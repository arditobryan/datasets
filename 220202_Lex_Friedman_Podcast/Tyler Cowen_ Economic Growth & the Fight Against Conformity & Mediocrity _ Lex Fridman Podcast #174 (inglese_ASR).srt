00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,040
tyler cohen an economist at george mason

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,439
university

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,240
and co-creator of an amazing economics

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,800
blog

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,519
called marginal revolution author of

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
many books

8
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,798
including the great stagnation average

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
is over

10
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:20,320
and his most recent big business a love

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,480
letter to an american anti-hero

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,160
he's truly a polymath in his work

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,800
including his love for food

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,399
which makes this amazing podcast called

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,519
conversations with tyler

16
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,640
really fun to listen to quick mention of

17
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,920

description to support this podcast

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,039
as a side note given tyler's culinary

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,559
explorations

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,320
let me say that one of the things that

24
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,159
makes me sad

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,840
about my love hate relationship with

26
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,319
food is that

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,360
while i've found a simple diet playing

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,238
meat veggies

29
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,079
it makes me happy in day to day life i

30
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,919
sometimes wish i had the mental ability

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,840
to moderate consumption of food

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
so that i could truly enjoy meals that

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,920
go way outside of that diet

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,599
i've seen my mom for example enjoy a

35
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,680
single piece of chocolate

36
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,679
and yet if i were to eat one piece of

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,840
chocolate the odds are high

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,118
that i would end up eating the whole box

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,159
this is definitely something i would

40
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,959
like to fix

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,840
because some of the amazing artistry in

42
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,679
this world

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,280
happens in the kitchen and some of the

44
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,240
richest human experiences

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,840
happen over a unique meal i recently was

46
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,399
eating cheeseburgers with

47
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,439
joe rogan and john donahue late at night

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
in austin

49
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,839
talking about jiu-jitsu and life and i

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,478
was distinctly aware

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,600
of the magic of that experience magic

52
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:43,039
made possible

53
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,879
by the incredibly delicious

54
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,680
cheeseburgers this

55
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,438
is the lex friedman podcast and here is

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,560
my conversation with tyler

57
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,199
cohen would you say economics is more

58
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
art

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,439
or science or philosophy or even magic

60
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,280
what is it economics is interesting

61
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,438
because it's all of the above

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,118
to start with magic the notion that you

63
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,478
can make some change and simply

64
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,639
everyone's better off

65
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,878
that is a kind of modern magic that has

66
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,878
replaced old-style magic

67
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,479
it's an art in the sense that the models

68
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:15,919
are not very exact

69
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,479
it's a science in the sense that

70
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,799
occasionally propositions are falsified

71
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,479
are a few basic things we know yeah and

72
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
however trivial they may sound if you

73
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,399
don't know them

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,480
you're out of luck so all of the above

75
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,920
but from my outsiders perspective

76
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,119
economics

77
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:36,159
is sometimes able to formulate very

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,120
simple almost like e equals c squared

79
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,919
general models of how our human society

80
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,439
will function

81
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:46,719
when you do a certain thing but

82
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,000
it seems impossible or almost way too

83
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,639
optimistic to think

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,120
that a single formula or just a set of

85
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,839
simple principles can describe

86
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,319
the behavior of billions of human beings

87
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
well

88
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,679
with all the complexity that we have

89
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,920
involved so do you have a sense there's

90
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,040
a hope for economics to

91
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,359
to uh to have those kinds of physics

92
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,039
level descriptions and models of the

93
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,800
world or is it just our desperate

94
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,000
attempts as humans to make sense of it

95
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,280
even though it's

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,280
more desperate than uh than uh

97
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,800
rigorous and serious and actually

98
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,120
predictable like a like a

99
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,000
physics type science i don't think

100
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,840
economics will ever be very predictive

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,039
it's most useful for helping you ask

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,200
better questions

103
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,039
you look at something like game theory

104
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,679
well game theory never predicted

105
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,878
usa and ussr would have a war would not

106
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,040
have a war

107
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,719
but trying to think through the logic of

108
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,359
strategic conflict if you know game

109
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,639
theory

110
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,519
it's just a much more interesting

111
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,919
discussion are you surprised

112
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
that we speaking of the soviet union and

113
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,878
the united states

114
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,239
and speaking of game theory are you

115
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,158
surprised that we haven't destroyed

116
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,560
ourselves with nuclear weapons yet like

117
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,959
that

118
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,158
simple formulation of mutually assured

119
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
destruction

120
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,519
that's a good example of an explanation

121
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,480
that perhaps

122
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,438
allows us to ask better questions but it

123
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,878
seems to have

124
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:08,878
actually described the reality of why we

125
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,399
haven't destroyed ourselves with these

126
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,759
ultra powerful weapons are you surprised

127
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
do you think the game of theoretic

128
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,879
explanation is is at all accurate there

129
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,840
i think we will destroy each other with

130
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,560
those weapons

131
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,159
eventually eventually look it's a very

132
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,160
low probability event

133
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,919
so i'm not surprised it hasn't happened

134
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,280
yet i'm a little surprised it came as

135
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,519
close as it did

136
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,959
you know your general thinking realizing

137
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,719
it might have just been a flock of birds

138
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,519
or it wasn't a first strike attack from

139
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,400
the usa

140
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,240
we got very lucky on that one but if you

141
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,079
just keep on running the clock on a low

142
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,120
probability event

143
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,959
it will happen and it may not be usa and

144
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,399
china usa and russia whatever

145
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,079
you know it could be the saudis and

146
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,120
turkey and it might not be nuclear

147
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,639
weapons it might be some other

148
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,600
destruction bio weapons

149
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,079
but it simply will happen is my view and

150
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,759
i've

151
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,079
argued at best we have seven or eight

152
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,360
hundred years and that's being generous

153
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,639
at worst how how long we got well maybe

154
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,800
it's asking for

155
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,759
arrival process right okay so tiny

156
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,560
probability

157
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
could come any time probably not in your

158
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,600
lifetime

159
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,399
but uh the chance presumably increases

160
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,199
the cheaper

161
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,319
weapons of mass destruction are so the

162
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,400
poisson process

163
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,319
description doesn't take in

164
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,799
consideration the game theoretic aspect

165
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,000
so another way to consider is uh

166
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,600
repeated games

167
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,079
iterative games so is there something

168
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,400
about

169
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,918
us our human nature that allows us to

170
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,439
fight against

171
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,799
probability reduce like the closer we

172
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,639
get to trouble

173
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,720
the more we're able to figure out how to

174
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,120
avoid trouble the same thing is

175
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,560
for when you take exams or you go you

176
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,800
know and take classes

177
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,000
the closer or paper deadlines the closer

178
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,680
you get to a deadline

179
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,879
the better you start to perform you get

180
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,079
your together and actually get

181
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,839
stuff done

182
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,318
i'm really not so negative on human

183
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,159
nature and as an economist i very much

184
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,080
see the gains from cooperation

185
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,759
yeah but if you just ask are there

186
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,318
outliers in history like was there a

187
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,720
hitler

188
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,840
for instance obviously and again you let

189
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,160
the clock tick

190
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,918
another hitler with nuclear weapons

191
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,800
doesn't per se care about

192
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,839
his own destruction it will happen so

193
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,240
your sense is fundamentally people are

194
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:23,359
good

195
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,759
but equilibrium is what we would call it

196
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,720
trembling hand equilibrium that the

197
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,360
basic logic

198
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080
is for cooperation which is mostly what

199
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,120
we've seen

200
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,000
even between enemies but every now and

201
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,519
then someone does

202
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,240
something crazy and you don't know how

203
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,519
to react to it and you can't always beat

204
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,038
hitler sometimes hitler drags you down

205
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,000
to push back is it possible that the

206
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,598
crazier

207
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,800
the person the less likely they are

208
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:55,279
and in a way where we're safe

209
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,240
meaning like this is the kind of

210
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,679
proposition

211
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,439
i've had i had the discussion with my

212
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,720
dad as a physicist about this

213
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:05,360
where he thinks that uh

214
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,080
like if you have a graph like evil

215
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,120
people

216
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,240
can't also be geniuses so his this is

217
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,000
his defense why

218
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,840
evil people will not get control of

219
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,399
nuclear weapons because to be truly evil

220
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,758
but evil meaning sort of you can argue

221
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,598
that

222
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,759
not even the evil of hitler were talking

223
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,120
about because hitler had a kind of view

224
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,919
of germany and all those kinds of

225
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
there's like

226
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,079
i he probably deluded himself and the

227
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,199
people around him to think that he's

228
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,918
actually doing good for the world

229
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,680
similar with stalin and so on by evil i

230
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:36,318
mean more like almost like terrorists

231
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,038
where they

232
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
want to destroy themselves and of the

233
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,918
world

234
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
like those people will never be able to

235
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,359
be

236
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,160
actually skilled enough to do to deliver

237
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,199
that kind of

238
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,560
mass scale destruction so the hope is

239
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,720
that it's very unlikely

240
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,240
that the kind of evil that would lead to

241
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,360
extinctions of humans or

242
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,519
mass destruction is so unlikely

243
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,520
that we're able to last way longer than

244
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,240
seven hundred and eight hundred years

245
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,000
is that three it's very unlikely in that

246
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,680
sense i accept the argument

247
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,680
but that's why you need to let the clock

248
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,038
dick it's also the best argument for

249
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,199
bureaucracy

250
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,800
to negotiate a bureaucracy it actually

251
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,879
selects against pure evil

252
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,639
because you need to build alliances so

253
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,759
bureaucracy in that regard is great

254
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,000
right it keeps out

255
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,800
the worst apples but look put it this

256
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,839
way could you imagine 35 years from now

257
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,399
the osama bin laden of the future has

258
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,639
nukes or very bad bio weapons

259
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,918
it seems to me you can yeah and osama

260
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,879
was pretty evil

261
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,000
and actually even he failed right but

262
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,360
nonetheless

263
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,599
that's what the seven or eight hundred

264
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
years is there for and there might be

265
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
destructive technologies that don't have

266
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,519
such a high

267
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,559
cost of production or such a high

268
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,959
learning curve

269
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,439
like cyber attacks or artificial

270
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,518
intelligence all those kinds of things

271
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,080
so yeah i mean let me ask you a question

272
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,159
let's say you could as an act of will

273
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,440
by spending a million dollars obliterate

274
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,679
any city on earth

275
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
and everyone in it dies and you'll get

276
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,559
caught

277
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,040
and you'll be sentenced to death but you

278
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,278
can make it happen just by willing it

279
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,679
how many months does it take before that

280
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,679
happens

281
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,278
so the obvious answer is like very soon

282
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,839
this is probably a good answer for that

283
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:21,278
because you can

284
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,640
consider how many millionaires there are

285
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,519
how many you could look at that right

286
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,480
right

287
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,959
i have a sense that there's just people

288
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,000
that

289
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:32,000
have a million dollars

290
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,600
i mean there's a certain amount but have

291
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,600
a million dollars

292
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,320
have other interests that will outweigh

293
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,920
the uh the interest of destroying the

294
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,240
entire city

295
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,039
like there's a particular you know like

296
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,959
the

297
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:51,199
i mean maybe that's a hope it's why we

298
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:53,199
should be nice to the wealthy too right

299
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,680
yeah all that trash talking is bill

300
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,000
gates we should stop that because uh

301
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,879
that doesn't inspire the other future

302
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,440
bill gates is to be nice to the world

303
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,200
that's true but your sense is the

304
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,760
cheaper it gets to destroy the world

305
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,440
the more likely it becomes now when i

306
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,200
say destroy the world there's a trick in

307
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,560
there i don't think literally every

308
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,200
human will die

309
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,958
but it would set back civilization by an

310
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,200
extraordinary degree it's then just

311
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,439
hard to predict what comes next yeah but

312
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
a catastrophe where everyone dies

313
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,920
that probably has to be something more

314
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,240
like an asteroid or a supernova

315
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,599
and those are purely exogenous for the

316
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,079
time being at least

317
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
so i immigrated to this country i'm i

318
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,958
was born in the

319
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:39,039
the soviet union in russia and uh

320
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,639
which one which is an important question

321
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,439
well which you were born in the soviet

322
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,360
union right

323
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,720
yes i was born in the soviet union the

324
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,000
rest is details but i

325
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,959
grew up in moscow russia yeah but i came

326
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to this

327
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,319
country and this country even back there

328
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,559
but

329
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,760
it's always symbolized to me a place of

330
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:59,359
opportunity

331
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:01,039
where ev everybody could build like uh

332
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,800
build the most incredible things

333
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,278
especially in the engineering side of

334
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,479
things

335
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,720
just invent and build and scale

336
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,920
and have a huge impact on the world and

337
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,399
that's been to me

338
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,719
the that's my version of the american

339
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,000
ideal the american dream

340
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,278
uh do you think the american dream

341
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,039
is still there uh do you think

342
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,559
what do you think of that notion in

343
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,799
itself like from an economics

344
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,799
perspective from a human perspective

345
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,838
is it still alive and how do you think

346
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,838
about it

347
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,440
the american dream the american dream is

348
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,360
mostly still there

349
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,200
if you look at which groups are the

350
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440
highest earners

351
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,200
it is individuals from india and

352
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,519
individuals from iran

353
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,399
which is a fairly new development great

354
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,039
for them

355
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,480
not necessarily easy both you could call

356
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,639
persons of color

357
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,320
may have faced discrimination also on

358
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,560
the grounds of religion

359
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,399
uh yet they've done it that's amazing it

360
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,479
says great things about america

361
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,480
now if you look at native born americans

362
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,039
the story's trickier

363
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,639
people think energizer intergenerational

364
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,120
mobility has declined a lot

365
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,480
recently but it has not for native born

366
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,480
americans

367
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,680
for about i think 40 years it's been

368
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,879
fairly constant

369
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,879
which is sort of good but compared to

370
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,600
much earlier times

371
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,278
it was much higher in the past i'm not

372
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,440
sure we can replicate that because look

373
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,559
go to the beginning of the 20th century

374
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,079
very few americans finish high school

375
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,439
or even have much wealth there's not

376
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:30,799
much credentialism there aren't that

377
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,279
many credentials

378
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,519
so there's more upward mobility across

379
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,360
the generations than today

380
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,039
and it's a good thing that we had it i'm

381
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,159
not sure we should blame the modern

382
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,199
world

383
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,838
for not being able to reproduce that

384
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,600
but look the general issue of who gets

385
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,560
into harvard or cornell

386
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,079
is there an injustice should we fix that

387
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,319
is there too little opportunity

388
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,359
for the bottom say half of americans

389
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
absolutely

390
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
it's a disgrace how this country has

391
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,560
evolved in that way

392
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,838
and in that sense the american dream is

393
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,000
clearly ailing

394
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,680
but it has had problems from the

395
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,958
beginning for blacks for women for many

396
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,278
other groups

397
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,799
i mean isn't that the whole challenge of

398
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,000
opportunity and freedom

399
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,799
is that it's hard and the difficulty of

400
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,958
how hard it is to move up in society

401
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,719
is unequal often and that's the

402
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,199
injustice of society but

403
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,959
the the whole point of that freedom is

404
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,519
that over time it becomes better and

405
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,559
better

406
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,919
you start to fix like uh fix

407
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,319
the the leaks the issues and it gives

408
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,039
that's he keeps progressing in that kind

409
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,639
of way

410
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,719
but ultimately there's always the

411
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,320
opportunity even if it's harder

412
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,639
there's the opportunity to create

413
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,079
something truly special to move up

414
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,600
to be to be president to be

415
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,039
a leader in whatever the industry that

416
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,560
you're passionate about to have it we

417
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,799
each have podcasts right

418
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,399
in english the value of joining that

419
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,958
american english

420
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,799
language network is much higher today

421
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,239
than it was 30 years ago mostly because

422
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,240
of the internet

423
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,759
so that makes immigration returns

424
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,120
themselves skewed

425
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:09,039
so going to the u.s canada or the uk

426
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,198
i think has become much more valuable in

427
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,958
relative terms than say going to france

428
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,479
which is still a pretty well-off very

429
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:18,159
nice country

430
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,079
if you had gone to france your chance of

431
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,399
having a globally known podcast

432
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,719
would be much smaller yeah this this is

433
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,519
the interesting thing uh

434
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
about how much intellectual influence

435
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,639
the united states has i don't know if

436
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,799
it's uh connected to what we're

437
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,879
discussing here the the freedom and

438
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,359
opportunity of the american dream

439
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,399
or like does it make any sense to you

440
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,519
that we have so

441
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,240
much impact on the rest of the world in

442
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,240
terms of

443
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,039
uh ideas you know is it just simply

444
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,959
because the

445
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,120
english is the primary language of the

446
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,399
world or is there something fundamental

447
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,600
to the united states that

448
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,559
drives the development of ideas it's

449
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,759
almost like

450
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:03,039
what's cool what's entertaining

451
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,159
what's uh you know like meme

452
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,078
culture the internet culture uh

453
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,600
the philosophers the intellectuals the

454
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,479
podcasts the

455
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,199
movies music all that stuff driving

456
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,560
culture

457
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,479
there's something above and beyond

458
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,239
language in the united states

459
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,079
it's a sense of entertainment really

460
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,879
mattering how to connect with your

461
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,599
audience

462
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,439
being direct and getting to the point uh

463
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,959
how humor is integrated

464
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,880
even with science yeah that is pretty

465
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,559
strongly represented here much more say

466
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,159
than on the european continent

467
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,000
britain has its own version of this

468
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,679
which it does very well

469
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,679
and not surprisingly they're hugely

470
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,919
influential in music comedy the

471
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,159
most of the other areas you mentioned

472
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,278
canada yes but their best talent tends

473
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,120
to come here but

474
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,879
you could say it's like a broader north

475
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,078
american thing and give them their fair

476
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,320
share of credit

477
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,000
what about science you you know there's

478
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,639
a sense

479
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
uh higher education is really strong

480
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,240
research is really strong in the united

481
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,839
states but it just feels like

482
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,519
culturally speaking when we zoom out

483
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,880
you know scientists aren't very cool

484
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,560
here

485
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,039
like uh most people wouldn't be able to

486
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,879
name basically a single scientist

487
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,799
maybe they would say like they would say

488
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,480
what like einstein and neil degrasse

489
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,240
tyson maybe

490
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
and neil degrasse tyson isn't exactly a

491
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,278
scientist he's a science communicator

492
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,440
so like there's not uh you know the same

493
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,799
kind of admiration

494
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,079
of uh science and innovators as there is

495
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,758
of like

496
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:35,838
athletes or actors actresses

497
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,278
musicians well you can become a

498
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,040
celebrity scientist

499
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,519
if you want to may or may not be best

500
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,039
for science and we have spock from star

501
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,000
trek who is still a

502
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,799
big deal but look at it this way which

503
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,519
country is most comfortable with

504
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,599
inegalitarian rewards

505
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,600
yeah for scientists whether it's fame or

506
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,360
money and i still think it's here some

507
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,680
of that's just the tax rate

508
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,639
some of it is a lot of america is set up

509
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,799
for rich people

510
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,879
to live really well and again that's

511
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,279
going to attract a lot of top talent

512
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,119
and you ask like the two best vaccines i

513
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,199
know the fights are vaccine is

514
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,279
sort of from germany sort of from turkey

515
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,798
but it's nonetheless

516
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,879
being distributed through the united

517
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,119
states marderana

518
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,880
an armenian ethnic armenian immigrant

519
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,279
through lebanon first to canada then

520
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,000
down here to boston cambridge area

521
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,279
those are incredible vaccines and u.s

522
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,519
nailed it

523
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,720
yeah well that's that's more almost like

524
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,000
the

525
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,000
i don't know what you would call it

526
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,640
engineering the sort of

527
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,400
scaling that's what us is really good as

528
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,000
not just inventing of ideas but

529
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,840
taking an idea and actually building the

530
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,359
thing and scaling it and

531
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,959
being able to distribute it at scale i

532
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,479
think some people would attributed that

533
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,519
to the

534
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,079
the the general award of capitalism

535
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,359
uh i don't know if you would uh what

536
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,279
what in your views

537
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:59,759
are the pros and cons of capitalism

538
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,200
as it's implemented in america i don't

539
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,960
know if you would say capitalism is

540
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,038
really exist in america

541
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,120
but to the extent that it does people

542
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,240
use the word capitalism in in so many

543
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,639
different ways

544
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,279
what is capitalism the literal meaning

545
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,320
is private ownership of capital goods

546
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,759
which i favor in most areas but no i

547
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,720
don't think the private sector should

548
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:23,440
own our f-16s or military assets

549
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,279
government-owned water utilities seem to

550
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,640
work as well as privately owned water

551
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,720
utilities

552
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,960
but with all those qualifications put to

553
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,079
the side

554
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,000
business for the most part innovates

555
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,918
better than government it is oriented

556
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,759
toward consumer services

557
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,120
the biggest businesses tend to pay the

558
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,519
highest wages

559
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,159
business is great at getting things done

560
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,319
usa

561
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,919
is fundamentally a nation of business

562
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,038
and that makes us a nation of

563
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,240
opportunity

564
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,919
so i am indeed mostly a fan subject to

565
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,880
numerous caveats

566
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,600
what's uh what's the con what's what are

567
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,200
some negative

568
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:03,279
downsides of capitalism in your view

569
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,038
or some things that we should be

570
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:08,720
concerned about maybe for long-term

571
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,879
impacts of capitalism again capitalism

572
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,798
takes a different form in each country i

573
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,799
would say in the united states

574
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,000
our weird blend of whatever you want to

575
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,639
call it

576
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
has had an enduring racial problem from

577
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,559
the beginning

578
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,558
has been a force of taking away land

579
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,279
from native americans and oppressing

580
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:30,000
them

581
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,000
pretty much from the beginning um

582
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,639
it has done very well by immigrants for

583
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,279
the most part

584
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,000
uh we revel in creationitarian creative

585
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,480
destruction

586
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,079
more so we don't just prop up national

587
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,480
champions forever

588
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,480
and there's a precariousness to life for

589
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,120
some people here that is less so

590
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,599
say in germany or the netherlands we

591
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,119
have weaker communities in some regards

592
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,678
than say northwestern europe

593
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,599
often would that has pluses and minuses

594
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,360
i think it makes us more creative

595
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,240
it's a better country in which to be a

596
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,558
weirdo than say germany or denmark

597
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,359
but there is truly whether from the

598
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,200
government

599
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,558
or from your private community there is

600
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,480
less social security

601
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,759
in some fundamental sense on the point

602
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,558
of weirdo uh

603
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,240
what that's kind of a beautiful little

604
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:19,918
statement

605
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,798
what uh what is that i mean that that

606
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,400
seems to be

607
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,918
uh you know you could think of a guy

608
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,600
like elon musk and

609
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,038
say that he's a weirdo is is that the

610
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,879
sense in which you're using the weirdo

611
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,960
like outside of the norm

612
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,480
like breaking conventions absolutely

613
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,440
yeah and here that is

614
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,480
either acceptable or even admired or to

615
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,279
be a loner

616
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,880
and since so many people are outsiders

617
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,558
and that we're all immigrants is

618
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,080
selecting for people who left something

619
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,279
behind we're willing to leave behind

620
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,839
their families

621
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,960
we're willing to undergo a certain

622
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,759
brutality of switch

623
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,880
in their lives makes us a nation of

624
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,038
weirdos

625
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,559
and weirdos are creative yeah and

626
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,158
denmark

627
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,960
is not a nation of weirdos it's a

628
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,640
wonderful place you know great for them

629
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,319
ideally you want part of the world to be

630
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,919
fully weirdos and innovating

631
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,359
and the other part of the world to be a

632
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,080
little kind of

633
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,839
chicken risk-averse and enjoy the

634
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,839
benefits of the innovation

635
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,199
and to give people these smooth lives

636
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,519
and six weeks off

637
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,519
and free ride and everyone's like oh

638
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,440
american way versus european way but

639
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,359
basically they're compliments

640
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,120
yeah that's fascinating i i used to have

641
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,639
this conversation with my uh like

642
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,399
parents when i was growing up and just

643
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,360
others from the immigrant

644
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,840
uh kind of flow and they use this term

645
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,839
especially in russian is uh

646
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,879
you know to criticize something i was

647
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:38,720
doing that would

648
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,960
suggest you know normal people don't do

649
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,519
this

650
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,400
and i used to be really offended by that

651
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,158
uh

652
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,919
but you know as i got older uh

653
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,280
i realized that that's a kind of

654
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,720
compliment

655
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:56,720
because in in the same kind of uh i

656
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,400
would say

657
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,759
way that you're you're saying that is

658
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,440
the american ideal

659
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,359
because if you want to do anything

660
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,320
special or interesting you don't want to

661
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,038
be doing

662
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,759
in one particular avenue what normal

663
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,960
people

664
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:13,359
do because uh because that won't be

665
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,640
interesting so the russians i think fit

666
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,558
in very well here

667
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,919
because the ones who come are weirdos

668
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:18,960
and there's a very different russian

669
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,000
weirdo tradition

670
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,679
like alyosha right in brothers carter or

671
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,880
perilman the mathematician they're

672
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,880
weirdos

673
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,120
and they have their own different kind

674
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,559
of status in soviet union russia

675
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,479
wherever

676
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,480
and when russians come to america they

677
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,839
stay pretty russian but it seems to me a

678
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,480
week later they've

679
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,918
somehow adjusted yeah and the ways in

680
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,720
which they might want to be like

681
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,400
grumpier

682
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,759
than americans not smile think that

683
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,919
people who smile are idiots

684
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,119
yeah like they can do that no one takes

685
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,080
that away from them yeah

686
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,479
yeah what are you uh on a tiny tangent

687
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,079
uh

688
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,558
i'd love to hear if you have thoughts

689
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,119
about grisha pearlman

690
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,038
uh turning down the fields medal is that

691
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,319
something you admire

692
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,200
does that make sense to you that

693
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,439
somebody you know with the structure of

694
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,600
nobel prizes of these huge awards of the

695
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,080
reputations the hierarchy of

696
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:12,000
everyone saying applauding how special

697
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,000
you are and here's a person

698
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,200
who was doing one of the greatest

699
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,720
accomplishments in the history of

700
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,080
mathematics it doesn't want

701
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,919
stupid prize and doesn't want

702
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,759
recognition doesn't want to do

703
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,720
interviews it doesn't want to be famous

704
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,798
what do you mean

705
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,798
what do you make of that it's great look

706
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,960
prizes are corrupting

707
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:31,038
after scientists win nobel prizes they

708
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,798
tend to become less productive

709
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,158
now statistically it's hard to sort out

710
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:35,200
the different effects there's aggression

711
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,799
toward the mean

712
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,480
does the prize make you too busy it's a

713
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,000
little tricky but there's not enough

714
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,798
nobel prizes either

715
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,200
to to get gathering of data right but

716
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,119
it's

717
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,880
i've known a lot of nobel prize winners

718
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,678
and it is my sense they become less

719
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,440
productive

720
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,000
they repeat more of their older messages

721
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,759
which may be highly socially valuable

722
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,400
but if someone wants to turn their back

723
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:59,038
on that and keep on working which i

724
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,200
assume is what he's doing that's awesome

725
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,879
yeah i mean we should respect that

726
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,319
it's like he wins a bigger prize right

727
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,360
our extreme respect

728
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,678
yeah uh well

729
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,639
uh grecia if you're listening i need to

730
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,919
talk to you soon

731
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,038
okay i've been uh i've been trying and

732
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,799
trying to get a hold of him

733
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,200
okay uh back to capitalism i got to ask

734
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:20,879
you

735
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,480
just competition in general in this

736
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,600
world of weirdos

737
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,839
is competition good for the world

738
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,278
you know this kind of uh seems to be one

739
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,519
of the fundamental

740
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,798
engines of capitalism right do you see

741
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,720
as ultimately constructive or

742
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,400
destructive for the world

743
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,798
what really matters is how good your

744
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,759
legal framework is so competition within

745
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:41,359
nature

746
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,278
you know for food leads to bloody

747
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,759
conflict all the time the animal world

748
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,640
is

749
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,119
quite unpleasant to say the least if you

750
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,080
have

751
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:52,158
something like the rule of law and

752
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,639
clearly defined property rights which

753
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,000
are

754
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,759
within reason justly allocated

755
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,759
competition probably is going to work

756
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,679
very well but it's not an

757
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,919
unalloyed good thing at all it can be

758
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,120
highly destructive military competition

759
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,600
right

760
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,278
which actually is itself sometimes good

761
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,038
but it's not good per se

762
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,558
what what what aspects of life do you

763
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,519
think we should protect from

764
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,960
competition so is there some you said

765
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,079
like the rule of law is there some

766
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,919
things we should uh

767
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,759
keep away from competition well the

768
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,240
fight for territory most of all

769
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,679
right so violence anything that involves

770
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,798
like actual physical violence

771
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,880
right and it's not that i think the

772
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,440
current borders are just i mean go talk

773
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,760
to

774
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,679
hungarians romanians they'll you know

775
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,400
serbians bosnians they'll talk your ear

776
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,640
off

777
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,320
and some of them are probably right but

778
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,720
at the end of the day we have

779
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:42,798
some kind of international order and i

780
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,159
would rather we more or less stick with

781
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,000
it

782
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,440
if catalonians want to leave they keep

783
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,480
up with it you know let them go

784
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,240
but what about space of like health care

785
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,000
this is where you get into a tension of

786
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,120
like between capitalism and

787
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,278
kind of uh morse i don't want to use

788
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,479
socialism but those kinds of policies

789
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,278
they're less

790
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,720
uh free market i think in this country

791
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:05,839
healthcare should be much more

792
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,600
competitive

793
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,000
so you go to hospitals doctors they

794
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,839
don't treat you like a customer uh they

795
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,558
treat you like an idiot or like a child

796
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,558
or

797
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,480
someone with third party payment and

798
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,720
it's a pretty humiliating experience

799
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,038
often

800
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,919
yeah do you think a free market in

801
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,038
general

802
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,440
is possible like a pure free market

803
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,079
and is that a good goal to to uh strive

804
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,000
for

805
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,759
i don't think the term pure free

806
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,798
market's well defined because you need a

807
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,960
legal order

808
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,038
the legal order has to make decisions

809
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,798
unlike what is intellectual property

810
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,359
more important than ever there's no

811
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:43,839
benchmark that like represents the

812
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,359
pure free market way of doing things

813
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,839
what will penalties be

814
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,839
how much do we put into law enforcement

815
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,639
no simple answers but just saying free

816
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,240
market

817
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,840
doesn't pin down what you're going to do

818
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,240
on those all important questions

819
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,199
so free market is a is an economics i

820
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,599
guess idea so

821
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
there's no it's it's not possible for

822
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,759
free marketers generate the rules

823
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,839
they're like

824
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,440
emergent like self-governing it

825
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,000
generates a lot of them right through

826
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,120
private norms through trade associations

827
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,919
international trade is mostly done uh

828
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,798
privately and by norms so it's certainly

829
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,400
possible

830
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,839
but at the end of the day i think you

831
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,159
need governments to draw very clear

832
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:25,119
lines to prevent it from turning into

833
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,240
mafia run systems you know i've been

834
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,959
hanging out

835
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,640
with the co with other group of weirdos

836
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,640
uh lately michael malus

837
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:38,640
who's uh who espouses to be an anarchist

838
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,840
anarchism which is like i i think

839
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,200
intellectually just a fascinating set of

840
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,158
ideas

841
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,679
uh where the you know taking free market

842
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,720
to the full extreme of

843
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,759
basically saying there should be no no

844
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,480
government what is it

845
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,119
uh oversight i guess and then everything

846
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,278
should be

847
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,239
fully like all the agreements all the

848
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:05,278
collectives you form should be uh

849
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,278
voluntary not based on the geographic

850
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:10,798
land you were born on and so on

851
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,640
do you think that's just the giant mess

852
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,079
like do you think it's possible for an

853
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,520
anarchist society to work

854
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:19,439
where it's um you know this in addition

855
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,119
in a fully distributed way people agree

856
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,679
with each other not just

857
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,479
on financial transactions but you know

858
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,919
on

859
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,960
um on their personal security

860
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,759
on sort of military type of stuff uh on

861
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,919
healthcare

862
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,519
on education all those kinds of things

863
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,120
and where does it break down

864
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,038
well i wouldn't press a button to say

865
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,398
get rid of our current constitution

866
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,640
which i view is pretty good

867
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:43,759
and quite wise but i think the deeper

868
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,759
point is that

869
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,798
all societies are in some regards

870
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,398
anarchistic

871
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,319
yes and we should take the anarchists

872
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,239
seriously so globally there's a kind of

873
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,798
anarchy

874
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,599
across borders even within federalistic

875
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:57,759
systems

876
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,439
they're typically complex there's not a

877
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,919
clear transitivity

878
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,798
necessarily of who has the final say

879
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,120
over what

880
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,839
uh just the state visa via its people

881
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,038
there's not

882
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:12,079
per se a final arbitrator in that regard

883
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,879
so you want a good anarchy rather than a

884
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,558
bad anarchy

885
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,640
you want to squish your anarchy into the

886
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:17,918
right corners and i don't think there's

887
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,080
a theoretical

888
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,759
answer how to do it but you start with a

889
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:24,480
country like is it working

890
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,519
well enough now this country you'd say

891
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,038
mostly

892
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,038
you'd certainly want to make a lot of

893
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,079
improvements and that's why i don't want

894
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:31,519
to press that get rid of the

895
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,278
constitution button

896
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,359
but to just dump on the anarchists is to

897
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,839
miss the point always try to learn

898
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,038
from any opinion you know and what in it

899
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,000
is true

900
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,759
i i'm just like uh marveling at the at

901
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,440
the poetry of

902
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,519
saying that we should squish our anarchy

903
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,640
into the right corners

904
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:54,398
love it okay uh i gotta ask i've been

905
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,278
uh talking with uh uh since we're doing

906
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:57,439
a whirlwind

907
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,960
introduction to all of economics uh i've

908
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,000
been talking to a few objectivists

909
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,519
recently

910
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,919
and just you know uh inran comes up as a

911
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,519
as a person as a philosopher throughout

912
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,038
many conversations a lot of people

913
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,278
really despise her

914
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:12,398
a lot of people really love her it's

915
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,798
always weird to me

916
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,558
when uh somebody arouses a philosophy or

917
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,398
a human being arouses that much emotion

918
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,038
in either direction

919
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,719
does she make do you understand first of

920
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:24,398
all that level of emotion

921
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,798
and what are your thoughts about ayn

922
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,678
rand and her philosophy objectivism is

923
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,240
it useful

924
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,159
at all to think about this kind of

925
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,440
formulation of

926
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,559
rational self interest if i could put in

927
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,399
those words

928
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:43,519
or i guess more negatively

929
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:46,319
the the the selfishness where she would

930
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,240
put i guess the virtue of selfishness

931
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,240
ein rand was a big influence on me

932
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,200
growing up the book that really mattered

933
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,880
for me was capitalism the unknown ideal

934
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,200
the notion that wealth creates

935
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,880
opportunity and good lives

936
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,120
and wealth is something we ought to

937
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,200
valorize and give very high status

938
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,239
it's one of our key ideas i think it's

939
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,080
completely correct

940
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,640
i think she has the most profound and

941
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,278
articulate statement of that idea

942
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,759
that said as a philosopher i disagree

943
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,000
with her

944
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,519
on most things and i did even like as a

945
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
boy when i was reading her

946
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,440
i read plato before i ran and in a

947
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,720
socratic dialogue there's all these

948
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,200
different points of view being thrown

949
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,360
around

950
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,000
yeah and who whomever it is you agree

951
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,359
with you understand the wisdom is in

952
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,440
the coming together of the different

953
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,158
points of view yeah and she doesn't have

954
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,880
that so

955
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,278
altruism can be wonderful in my view

956
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,159
humans are not actually that rational

957
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,359
self-interest is often poorly defined to

958
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,760
pound the table and say

959
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,719
existence exists i wouldn't say i

960
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,558
disagree

961
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,319
but i'm not sure that it's a very

962
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,319
meaningful statement

963
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,158
i think the secret to iran is that she

964
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,839
was russian i'd love to have her on my

965
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,080
podcast if she was still alive

966
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,119
i'd only ask her about russia which she

967
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,879
mostly

968
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,319
never talked about after writing we the

969
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,200
living and she

970
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,879
is much more russian than she seems at

971
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,558
first even like purging people

972
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,480
from the objectivist circles it's like

973
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,240
how russians especially

974
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,079
female russians so often purge their

975
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,880
friends it's weird

976
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,359
all the parallels so you're saying so

977
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,278
yes

978
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:19,199
so i um assuming she's still not around

979
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,480
uh but if she is and she comes into your

980
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,919
podcast see

981
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,558
can you dig into that a little bit do

982
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,679
you mean like the pers her personal

983
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:31,839
uh demons around the

984
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,679
social and economic russia of the time

985
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,359
when she escaped the promise she

986
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,038
suffered there yeah what she really

987
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,479
likes in the music and literature and

988
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,720
why she's looking literature

989
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,720
and getting deeply into that her view of

990
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,440
relations between the sexes and russia

991
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,079
how it differs from america why she

992
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,159
still

993
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,158
carries through the old russian vision

994
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,720
in her fiction this extreme

995
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,760
sexual dimorphism but with also very

996
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,000
strong women

997
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,038
to me as a uniquely at least eastern

998
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,240
european

999
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:02,319
uh vision mostly russian i would say

1000
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,679
and that's in her that's her actual real

1001
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,000
philosophy not this

1002
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,679
table bounding existence exists and

1003
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,480
that's not talked about enough

1004
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,320
he's a russian philosopher yeah like she

1005
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,960
or soviet whatever you want to call it

1006
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,359
and if she wasn't so certain she could

1007
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,679
have been

1008
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:20,558
a dostoevsky where it's not that that

1009
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,200
certainty is almost the thing that uh

1010
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,119
brings of the adoration of uh millions

1011
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,120
but also the hatred of millions

1012
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,959
you became a cult figure in a somewhat

1013
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:32,158
russian-like manner

1014
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,679
yeah yeah it is it is what it is uh but

1015
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,080
i love the idea that

1016
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,038
i again you're just dropping bombs that

1017
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,879
are poetic

1018
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:40,879
that the wisdom is in the coming

1019
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,278
together of ideas

1020
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,799
it's kind of interesting to think that

1021
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:48,079
no one human

1022
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:50,960
possesses wisdom no one idea

1023
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,079
is the wisdom that the coming together

1024
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,000
is the wisdom

1025
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,798
like in my view boswell's life of

1026
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,319
johnson 18th century british biography

1027
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,398
it's in essence a co-authored work

1028
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,480
boswell and johnson it's one of the

1029
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,158
greatest philosophy books ever

1030
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,319
though it is commonly regarded as a

1031
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,000
biography john stuart mill

1032
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,838
who in a sense was co-authoring with

1033
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,918
harriet taylor

1034
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:14,000
a better philosopher than his realized

1035
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,878
though he's rated very very highly

1036
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,918
plato socrates a lot of the greatest

1037
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,159
works

1038
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,960
are in a kind of dialogue form curtis

1039
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,760
faust

1040
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,800
would be another example it's very much

1041
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,560
a dialogue

1042
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,480
and yes it's drama but it's also

1043
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:31,838
philosophy shakespeare

1044
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,159
maybe the wisest thinker of them all

1045
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,279
in your book big business speaking of

1046
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,119
iran

1047
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,720
big business a love letter to an

1048
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,280
american anti-hero

1049
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,358
you make the case for uh the benefit

1050
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,159
that large businesses bring to society

1051
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:48,319
can you explain if you look at say the

1052
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,039
pandemic which has been a catastrophic

1053
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,919
event right for for many reasons

1054
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,079
but who is it that saved us so amazon

1055
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,480
has done remarkably well

1056
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,800
they upped their delivery game more or

1057
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,599
less overnight with very few hitches

1058
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,640
i've ordered hundreds of amazon packages

1059
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,280
direct delivery

1060
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,879
food whether it's doordash or ubereats

1061
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,000
or using you know whole foods through

1062
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,160
amazon shipping

1063
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,838
again it's gone remarkably well

1064
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,159
switching over our entire

1065
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,078
higher educational system basically

1066
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,159
within two weeks to zoom

1067
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,119
zoom did it i mean i've had a zoom

1068
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,279
outage

1069
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,640
but their performance rate has been

1070
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,320
remarkably high

1071
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,279
so if you just look at resources

1072
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,519
competence incentives

1073
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,599
who's been the star performers the nba

1074
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,400
even just canceling the season as early

1075
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,800
as they did

1076
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,440
sending a message like hey people this

1077
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,839
is real

1078
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,480
and then pulling off the bubble with not

1079
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,320
a single

1080
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,960
found case of covid and having all the

1081
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,760
testing set up in advance

1082
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,400
big business has done very well lately

1083
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,680
and

1084
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,838
throughout the broader course of

1085
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,919
american history in my view has mostly

1086
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,440
been a hero

1087
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,000
can we engage in a kind of therapy

1088
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,800
session uh in

1089
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,400
in i i'm often troubled by the

1090
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,920
negativity towards

1091
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,559
big business and uh i wonder if you

1092
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,000
could help

1093
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:12,000
figure out how we remove that or maybe

1094
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,280
first psychoanalyze it and then how we

1095
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,639
remove it it

1096
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,280
it it feels like you know once we've

1097
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,400
gotten

1098
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,760
wi-fi on flights

1099
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,119
on airplane flights uh

1100
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,800
people started complaining about how

1101
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,240
shitty the connection is right

1102
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,000
yeah they take it for granted

1103
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,759
immediately yeah and then start

1104
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,719
complaining about little details

1105
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,240
uh another example that's more that's

1106
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,039
closer to like

1107
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,719
especially as a as aspiring

1108
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,838
entrepreneurs closer to the things i'm

1109
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,118
thinking about

1110
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:48,159
is jack dorsey with twitter you know

1111
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,119
to me twitter has enabled an incredible

1112
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:53,279
platform of communication and yet the

1113
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,838
biggest thing that people talk about

1114
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:00,720
is not how incredible this platform is

1115
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,799
uh they essentially use the platform to

1116
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,719
complain about the censorship of a few

1117
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,480
individuals

1118
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,000
as opposed to how amazing it is now you

1119
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,240
should also you should talk about

1120
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,320
how shitty the wi-fi is and how

1121
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,159
censorship or the removal donald trump

1122
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,559
from the platform is a bad thing but

1123
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,480
it feels like we don't talk about the

1124
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,719
positive impacts at scale

1125
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,760
of these technologies is there can you

1126
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,759
explain why and is there a way to fix it

1127
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,000
i don't know if we can fix it i think we

1128
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,160
are beings of high neuroticism

1129
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,599
for the most part yeah as a personality

1130
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:34,319
trait not everyone

1131
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,640
but most people and as a compliment to

1132
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,559
that

1133
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,000
if someone says 10 nice things about you

1134
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:39,519
and one insult

1135
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,039
you're more bothered by the insult than

1136
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:42,639
you're pleased by the nice things

1137
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,119
especially if the insult is somewhat

1138
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,279
true yeah so you have these

1139
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,240
media these vehicles twitter is one you

1140
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,000
mentioned

1141
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,519
there's all kind of messages going back

1142
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,760
and forth and you're really bugged

1143
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,079
by the messages you don't like most

1144
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,079
people are neurotic to begin with

1145
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,440
it's not only taken out on big business

1146
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,160
to be clear so

1147
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,200
congress catches a lot of grief and yeah

1148
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:07,199
some of it they deserve yes

1149
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,679
religion is not attacked the same way

1150
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,639
but religiosity is declining

1151
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,199
if you poll people the military still

1152
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:15,358
pulls

1153
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,118
quite well but people are very

1154
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,480
disillusioned with many things and the

1155
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,079
martin guri thesis

1156
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,240
that because of the internet you just

1157
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,839
see more of things and the more you see

1158
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,719
of something whether it's good bad or in

1159
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:26,639
between

1160
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,480
the more you will find to complain about

1161
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:30,239
i suspect is the fundamental mechanism

1162
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,639
here

1163
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,319
i mean look at clubhouse right it's to

1164
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:35,598
me it's a great service may or may not

1165
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,519
be like my thing

1166
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,960
but gives people this opportunity no one

1167
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,800
makes you go on it

1168
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,639
and all these media articles like oh is

1169
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,480
clubhouse gonna wreck things you know

1170
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,078
are they gonna break things new york

1171
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,519
times is complaining of course it's

1172
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,440
their competitor as well

1173
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:50,639
yeah i'm like give these people a chance

1174
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,880
like talk it up

1175
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:54,400
you may or may not like it like let's

1176
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,640
praise the people who are

1177
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,599
getting something done very ein randy in

1178
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,319
point

1179
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,359
as an economic thinker as a writer as a

1180
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,838
podcaster

1181
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:06,159
what do you think about clubhouse as

1182
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:09,199
what do you think about

1183
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:09,920
okay let let me uh just throw my feeling

1184
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,759
about it i

1185
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,079
used to use discord which is another

1186
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,359
service where people use voice so the

1187
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,280
only thing you do is

1188
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,880
just hear each other there's no face you

1189
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,000
just see a little icon

1190
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,880
that's the essential element

1191
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,519
of uh clubhouse and there's an intimacy

1192
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,358
to voice only communication that's hard

1193
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,719
that didn't make sense to me but it was

1194
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,400
just what it is

1195
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,959
which feels like something that won't

1196
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,079
last for some reason maybe it's the

1197
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,720
cynical view but what's your sense uh

1198
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,079
what is it about this mat the intimacy

1199
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,279
of what's happening right now with

1200
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,519
clubhouse

1201
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,200
i've greatly enjoyed what i've done but

1202
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,639
i'm not sure it's for me in the long run

1203
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,960
for two reasons

1204
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,400
first if you compare it to doing a

1205
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,159
podcast

1206
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,320
podcasting has greater reach than

1207
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,159
clubhouse so i would rather put time

1208
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,599
into my podcast

1209
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:03,679
but then also my like core

1210
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,880
asset so to speak is i'm a very fast

1211
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,598
reader

1212
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,119
so audio per se is not necessarily to my

1213
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,280
advantage i don't speak or listen

1214
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,440
faster than other people in fact i'm a

1215
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,720
slower listener because i like 1.0

1216
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,720
not 1.5 x so i should spend less time on

1217
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,799
audio and more time reading and writing

1218
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,279
yeah it's interesting because you like

1219
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,720
you mention podcasts and audio books

1220
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,440
i you know the the

1221
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:29,838
podcasts are recorded and so i can skip

1222
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,720
things

1223
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:34,639
like i can skip commercials uh or i can

1224
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,159
skip parts where it's like ugh this part

1225
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:40,000
is boring

1226
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:41,679
with live conversations especially when

1227
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,119
there's a magic to the fact when you

1228
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,799
have a lot of people participating in

1229
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,960
that conversation

1230
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,839
but you know some people are like ugh

1231
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,280
this topic

1232
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:50,880
they're going into this thing and you

1233
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,839
can't skip it or you can't fast forward

1234
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,000
you can't go one

1235
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:57,599
1.5 x or 2x you can't speed it up

1236
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,480
nevertheless there's a tension between

1237
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,920
that so that's the productivity aspect

1238
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,440
with the actual magic of live

1239
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,559
communication where anything can happen

1240
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,960
where

1241
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,078
elon musk can ask the ceo of robin hood

1242
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,559
vlad

1243
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,920
about like hey somebody like holding a

1244
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:14,880
gun to your head there's something shady

1245
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,880
going on

1246
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,079
the magic of that that's also my

1247
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,440
criticism of like

1248
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,200
there's been a recent conversation with

1249
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:26,559
bill gates that uh he won a platform

1250
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,759
uh and had a basic a regular interview

1251
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,759
on the platform

1252
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,000
without allowing the possibility of the

1253
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,119
magic of the chaos like

1254
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,639
uh so i'm not i'm not exactly sure

1255
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,400
it's probably not the right platform for

1256
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,639
you and for many other people who are

1257
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,559
exceptionally productive in other places

1258
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,078
but there's still nevertheless a magic

1259
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,440
to the chaos that can be created with a

1260
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,400
live conversation

1261
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,920
that gives me pause maybe what it's

1262
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,680
perfect for is the tribute

1263
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,920
so they had an episode recently that i

1264
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,480
didn't hear but i heard it was wonderful

1265
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,159
it was anecdotes about steve jobs that

1266
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,280
you can't do one-to-one right and you

1267
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:00,879
don't want control

1268
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,280
you want different people appearing and

1269
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,720
stepping up and saying they're bit

1270
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,599
yeah and clubhouse is 110 perfect for

1271
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,318
that

1272
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,480
the tribute i love that that should be

1273
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,800
but there's also the possibility

1274
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,400
i think uh there was a time when

1275
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,720
somebody arranged a conversation with

1276
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,400
steve jobs and bill gates on stage right

1277
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:25,519
i remember that happened a long time ago

1278
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,519
and you know it was very formal

1279
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,039
you know it could have probably gone

1280
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,039
better but it was still magical

1281
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,559
to have these people that obviously like

1282
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,400
had a bunch of tension throughout their

1283
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:37,679
history

1284
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:41,200
there's it's so frictionless to have two

1285
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,440
major figures in world history just jump

1286
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:45,519
on

1287
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,519
a clubhouse stage putin and elon musk

1288
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,719
and then that's exactly it so there's a

1289
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,960
language barrier there

1290
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,719
there's also the problem that in

1291
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,119
particular

1292
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,559
it's like like biden would have a

1293
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,960
similar problem it's like they're just

1294
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,759
not

1295
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,440
into new technology so it's very hard to

1296
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,920
catch the kremlin up to

1297
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,440
first of all twitter right uh but to

1298
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,838
catch them up to clubhouse you have to

1299
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,318
have

1300
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,759
the elon musk has a sense of the

1301
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:10,639
internet the humor the memes and all

1302
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,040
that kind of stuff

1303
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,719
that you have to have in order to to

1304
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:16,960
like use a new app

1305
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,559
and figure out like the timing the beat

1306
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,240
what is this thing about

1307
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,239
you know so that that's the challenge

1308
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:26,159
there but that's exactly it that that

1309
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:29,598
magic of have two big personalities

1310
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:31,039
just show up and i i i wonder if it's

1311
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,440
just a temporary thing that we're going

1312
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:36,239
through with the pandemic where people

1313
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,639
are just lonely and they're seeking for

1314
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,479
that

1315
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,318
human connection that we usually guess

1316
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,400
get elsewhere through our work

1317
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,400
but they'll stay lonely in my opinion

1318
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,400
you think so i do

1319
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,920
so it is a pandemic thing but i think it

1320
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,760
will persist

1321
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,599
and the idea of wanting to be connected

1322
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,359
to more of the world clubhouse will

1323
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,119
still offer that

1324
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:58,480
and all the mental health issues out

1325
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,599
there a lot of people have broken ties

1326
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,159
and they will still be lonely

1327
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,240
post-vaccines

1328
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,159
yeah i um from an artificial

1329
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:09,279
intelligence perspective

1330
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:11,598
i have a sense that there is

1331
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,280
like a deep loneliness in the world that

1332
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,960
all of us are really lonely like we

1333
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,560
don't even acknowledge it even people in

1334
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,400
happy relationships

1335
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,159
it feels like there's like an iceberg of

1336
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,720
loneliness in all of us

1337
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,078
like seeking to be understood like

1338
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,799
deeply understood

1339
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,280
understanding us like having somebody

1340
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,160
with whom

1341
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,440
you can have a deep interaction enough

1342
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,000
to where you can

1343
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,639
they can help you to understand yourself

1344
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,199
and they

1345
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,118
also understand you like i have a sense

1346
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:42,318
that artificial intelligence systems can

1347
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,240
provide that as well but humans i think

1348
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:45,838
crave that from other humans

1349
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:47,598
in in ways that we perhaps don't

1350
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,039
acknowledge and i i have a hope that

1351
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,000
technology will enable that more and

1352
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:52,239
more like clubhouse

1353
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,679
is an example that allows that are

1354
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:54,719
touring bots going to out-compete

1355
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:56,719
clubhouse

1356
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,799
like why not pro sort of program your

1357
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,639
own session you'll just talk into your

1358
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,079
device and say here's the kind of

1359
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:03,598
conversation i want

1360
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,760
and it will create the characters for

1361
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,880
you and it may not be as good as elon

1362
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,640
and vladimir putin

1363
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,720
but it will be better than ordinary club

1364
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,000
has yeah and one of the things

1365
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,159
that's missing it's not just

1366
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,079
conversation it's

1367
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,960
it's memory so long-term memory is what

1368
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,280
current ai systems don't have

1369
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,000
is sharing an experience together forget

1370
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,480
the words

1371
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,199
it's like sharing the highs and the lows

1372
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,000
of life

1373
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,279
together and the systems around us

1374
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,440
remembering that

1375
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,040
remembering we've been through that like

1376
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,079
that's the thing that creates really

1377
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,480
close relationships

1378
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,519
is going through some like go

1379
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,440
struggle

1380
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,800
if you survive together there's

1381
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,720
something really difficult

1382
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,400
that bonds you with other humans and

1383
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,318
this is related to immigration in the

1384
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,318
american dream

1385
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,599
in what way people who have come to this

1386
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,000
country however

1387
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,680
weird and different they may be they are

1388
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,960
their ancestors at some point

1389
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:56,960
probably have shared this thing

1390
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,159
right us is not going to split up it may

1391
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,920
get more screwed up as a country

1392
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,000
but texas and california are not going

1393
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,358
to break off yeah i mean they're big

1394
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,800
enough where they could do it but it's

1395
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:10,239
just never going to happen

1396
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,480
we've been through too much together

1397
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,559
yeah

1398
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,079
ah that's a hopeful message do you think

1399
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,599
uh you know some people have talked to

1400
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,318
eric weinstein you've talked to eric

1401
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,838
weinstein

1402
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:25,199
uh he has a sense that growth

1403
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,719
uh you know like the the the entirety of

1404
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,919
the american system is based

1405
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:29,838
on the assumption that we're going to

1406
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,880
grow forever the economy is going to

1407
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,559
grow forever

1408
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,680
do you think uh uh economic growth will

1409
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,279
continue indefinitely

1410
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:41,838
or will we stagnate i've long been in

1411
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,319
agreement with eric peter thiel

1412
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,078
robert gordon and others that growth has

1413
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,679
slowed down

1414
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,400
i argued that in my book the great

1415
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:52,159
stagnation appropriately titled

1416
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,680
but the last two years i've become much

1417
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,719
more optimistic i've seen a lot of

1418
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,679
breakthroughs

1419
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,838
in green energy and battery technology

1420
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,639
mrna vaccines and medicine

1421
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,159
is a big deal already it will repair our

1422
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,879
gdp and save

1423
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:07,440
millions of lives around the world uh

1424
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,838
there's an

1425
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,000
anti-malaria vaccine that's now in stage

1426
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:15,199
3 trial it probably works

1427
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,159
crispr to defeat sickle cell anemia

1428
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,519
just space area after area after area

1429
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:20,480
there's suddenly the surge of

1430
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:22,239
breakthroughs

1431
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,679
i would say many of them rooted in

1432
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,239
superior computation

1433
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:28,239
and ultimately moore's law and access to

1434
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,318
those computational abilities

1435
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,239
so i'm much more optimistic than say the

1436
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:34,079
last time i spoke to eric

1437
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,838
i don't know he he moves all the time in

1438
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,920
his views i don't know where he's at now

1439
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:38,880
he's not he hasn't gained that's really

1440
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,480
interesting

1441
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,599
so your little drop of optimism comes

1442
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,079
from

1443
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,160
like there might be a fundamental shift

1444
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,880
in the kind of things that computation

1445
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:52,318
has unlocked for us in terms of like it

1446
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,800
could be a well spring of innovation

1447
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:55,039
that can

1448
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,519
that enables growth for a long time to

1449
00:47:55,039 --> 00:48:00,239
come like eric has not

1450
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,440
quite connected to the computation

1451
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:03,358
aspect yet

1452
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,280
to where it could be a wellspring of

1453
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:06,000
innovation but you're very close to it

1454
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,920
in your own work

1455
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,960
i don't have to tell you that the work

1456
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,000
you're doing would not have been

1457
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,000
possible

1458
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,760
not very long ago but the question is

1459
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,318
how much does that work enable

1460
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,599
continue growth for decades to come for

1461
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:19,599
all their problems

1462
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,760
some version of driverless vehicles will

1463
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,280
be a thing i'm not sure when you know

1464
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,520
much better than i do

1465
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,559
maybe only partially but that too will

1466
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,480
be a big deal

1467
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,200
well one of the open questions that sort

1468
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:34,400
of the peter thiel school

1469
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:36,078
area of ideas is how much can be

1470
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,800
converted to technology

1471
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,640
how much how many parts of our lives can

1472
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,680
technology integrate and then innovate

1473
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:46,239
like can it replace uh healthcare okay

1474
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,519
you know can a replace the legal system

1475
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:51,039
can replace government

1476
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:54,480
not replace but like you know uh

1477
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,759
make it digital and thereby enable

1478
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,000
computation to

1479
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,280
improve it right that's the open

1480
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,838
question because

1481
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,920
many aspects of our lives are still not

1482
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:07,039
really that

1483
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,599
digitized there was a new york times

1484
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,400
symposium in april which is not long ago

1485
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,240
and they asked

1486
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,519
the so-called experts when are we going

1487
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,000
to get vaccines

1488
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,639
and the most optimistic answer was in

1489
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,760
four years

1490
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:21,118
yeah and obviously we beat that by a

1491
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,960
long mile

1492
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,880
so i think people still haven't woken up

1493
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,000
you mentioned my tiny drop of optimism

1494
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,358
but it's a big drop

1495
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,239
of optimism is it a waterfall yet i mean

1496
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:33,519
is it just well here's my pessimism

1497
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,439
whenever there are major new

1498
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:37,599
technologies they also tend to be used

1499
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,000
for violence directly or indirectly

1500
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,599
radio hitler not that he hit people over

1501
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,559
the head with radios but

1502
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,559
it enabled the rise of various dictators

1503
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,400
so the new technologies now whatever

1504
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,000
exactly they may be

1505
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,000
they're going to cause a lot of trouble

1506
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,599
yeah and that's my pessimism not that i

1507
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,480
think they're all going to slow to a

1508
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,640
trickle

1509
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:01,119
when was the stagnation book 2011

1510
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,960
yes it was the first of these stagnation

1511
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,760
books in fact

1512
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,519
it's very interesting uh but even then i

1513
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,599
said this is temporary

1514
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:12,239
and i was predicting it would be gone in

1515
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,838
about 20 years time

1516
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,078
i'm not sure that's exactly the right

1517
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:17,279
prediction like 2030 but

1518
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,680
i think we're actually going to beat

1519
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,119
that so you think

1520
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:22,879
the united states might still be on top

1521
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:26,240
of the world for the rest of the century

1522
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,838
in terms of its economic economic growth

1523
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:29,838
impact on the world scientific

1524
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,519
innovation all those kinds of things

1525
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:34,960
that's too long to predict but i'm

1526
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:38,159
bullish on america in general

1527
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,800
got it um speaking of being bullish on

1528
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:42,078
america

1529
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,559
the opposite of that is uh

1530
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,440
you know we talked about capitalism talk

1531
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,359
about iran

1532
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:53,838
and her russian roots what do you think

1533
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:56,078
about communism why doesn't it

1534
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:56,078
what

1535
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,559
is it the implementation is there

1536
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,440
anything about its ideas that you find

1537
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,119
compelling

1538
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:07,920
or is it just a fundamentally flawed

1539
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,720
system well communism is like capitalism

1540
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,800
the words mean

1541
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,318
many things to different people yes you

1542
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,559
could argue my life as a tenured

1543
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,318
professor comes closer to communism

1544
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,319
anything that the human race has seen

1545
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,400
and i would argue it works pretty well

1546
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:21,599
yeah but look if you mean the soviet

1547
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,160
union

1548
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,519
it devolved pretty quickly to a kind of

1549
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:28,879
decentralized set of incentives that

1550
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,880
were destructive

1551
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,240
rather than value maximizing it wasn't

1552
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,880
even central planning

1553
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,399
much less communism so paul craig

1554
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,920
roberts and paulani

1555
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,519
were correct in their descriptions of

1556
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,599
the soviet system

1557
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,920
think of it as weird mixes of barter and

1558
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,680
malfunctioning incentives

1559
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,159
and being very good at a whole bunch of

1560
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:50,078
things but in terms of progress

1561
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,920
innovation and consumer goods

1562
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,920
it really being quite a failure

1563
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:58,318
and now i wouldn't call that communism

1564
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:01,759
but that's what i think of the system

1565
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:05,199
the soviets had and it required an

1566
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,599
ever increasing pile of lies that both

1567
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:08,879
alienated people but created an elite

1568
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,160
that by the end of the thing

1569
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,838
no longer believed in the system itself

1570
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,199
or even thought they were doing better

1571
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:16,880
by being crooks

1572
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:18,078
then by just say moving to switzerland

1573
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,440
and being an upper middle class

1574
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,440
individual like you would have a

1575
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,599
higher standard of living by gorbachev's

1576
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,119
time not gorbachev but if you're number

1577
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,559
30 in the hierarchy

1578
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,640
you're better off as a middle-class

1579
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,200
person in switzerland and that

1580
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,879
of course did not prove sustainable and

1581
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:34,159
so it's uh what is it a momentum a

1582
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,838
bureaucracy or something like that it

1583
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:36,159
just builds up or you lose control of

1584
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:38,400
the

1585
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,078
the original vision and that naturally

1586
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,838
happens it's just people

1587
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,599
and you can't use normal profit and loss

1588
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:44,239
and price incentives so you get all

1589
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,720
prices

1590
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,078
or most prices set too low right

1591
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,759
shortages everywhere

1592
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,000
people trade favors you have this

1593
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,200
culture of bartered bribes

1594
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,760
sexual favors or you know family friends

1595
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:57,439
and

1596
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,040
you get more and more of that and you

1597
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,679
over time lose more and more of the

1598
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,480
information

1599
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,000
and the prices and quantities and

1600
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,318
practices and norms you had

1601
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,119
and that sort of slowly decays and then

1602
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:10,880
by the end no one is believing in it

1603
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,240
that would be my take but again you're

1604
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,680
the expert here

1605
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:18,399
the the russian scholar

1606
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:18,960
well perhaps no more an expert than iron

1607
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,280
rand

1608
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,639
uh it's more personal than it is

1609
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,559
scholarly

1610
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:28,480
uh or historic so stalin held power for

1611
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,280
30 years

1612
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:35,358
uh vladimir putin has held power for

1613
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,240
21 years where you could argue he took a

1614
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:38,880
little break

1615
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:39,838
uh but not much he was still holding

1616
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,160
power i think

1617
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,679
and it's still possible now with the new

1618
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:45,679
uh

1619
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,358
uh constitution that he could hold power

1620
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:49,279
from longer than stalin 30

1621
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:51,279
longer than 30 years what do you think

1622
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,720
about the man

1623
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,760
the state of affairs in russia

1624
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:59,279
in general the system they have there

1625
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,359
is there something interesting to you as

1626
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,359
an economist as a human being

1627
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:04,558
about russia everything is interesting i

1628
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,199
mean he would be

1629
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,319
part of my take as you know the russian

1630
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,679
economy

1631
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:12,480
starting what 1999 2000 has really quite

1632
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:15,598
a few years

1633
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,159
of super excellent growth and putin is

1634
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,960
still

1635
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,920
riding on that it more or less coincides

1636
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,838
with his

1637
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,280
rise as the truly focal figure on the

1638
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:27,119
scene uh since then pretty recently

1639
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,680
they've had a bunch of years of negative

1640
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,160
four to five percent growth in a row

1641
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,039
which is

1642
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:34,960
terrible the economy is way too

1643
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,679
dependent on fossil fuels

1644
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,199
but the structural problem is this you

1645
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,679
need a concordance

1646
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:42,960
across economic power social power

1647
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:44,399
political power

1648
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,000
they don't have to be allocated

1649
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,440
identically but they have to be

1650
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,318
allocated

1651
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,159
consistently and the russian system

1652
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:55,199
under putin from almost the beginning

1653
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,159
has never been able to have that that

1654
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,239
ultimately

1655
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,920
his incentives are to steer the system

1656
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:01,879
where the economic power

1657
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,760
is in a small number of hands in a

1658
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,079
non-diversified way

1659
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,680
the system won't deliver sustainable

1660
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,960
gains and living standards

1661
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:12,960
anymore ever the way it's set up now

1662
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,838
that with fossil fuel prices go up

1663
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,798
they'll have some good years for sure

1664
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:20,159
and that is really quite structural what

1665
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:21,838
has gone wrong

1666
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,159
and then on top of that you can have an

1667
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:25,599
opinion of putin but you've got to start

1668
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,199
with those structural problems and

1669
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,280
that's why it's just

1670
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,639
not going to work but he had all those

1671
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,319
good years in the beginning

1672
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:34,400
so the number of russians say who live

1673
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:36,558
here or in russia

1674
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,838
who love putin and it's sincere they're

1675
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,119
not just afraid of being you know

1676
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:41,440
dragged away

1677
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,798
like that's a real phenomenon uh yeah

1678
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,679
i'm really torn on

1679
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,318
you know putin's approval rating real

1680
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,358
approval

1681
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:53,440
rating seems to be very high and i'm

1682
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:56,159
torn in whether that's has to do with uh

1683
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:58,000
the fact that there is uh control of the

1684
00:55:56,159 --> 00:56:00,879
press

1685
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
or if it's which is the people i talk to

1686
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,838
who are in russia family

1687
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
and so on a genuine love of putin

1688
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:09,759
appreciation of what putin has done and

1689
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,760
is going to do with russia

1690
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,119
and a lot of that would go away if the

1691
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,160
press were freer i think

1692
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,280
yes well singapore realizes this anyone

1693
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:18,798
discussed by the press

1694
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,559
no matter who they are people in

1695
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:23,280
singapore have done a great job

1696
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,559
yes uh but if you're discussed by the

1697
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,160
press you don't look good

1698
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:29,440
tech company executives are learning

1699
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:31,118
this right it's just like a rule

1700
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,880
so in that sense i think the rating is

1701
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,920
artificially high but i don't

1702
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,760
by any means think it's all insincere

1703
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,358
but that high popularity i view as

1704
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,960
bearish for russia

1705
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:43,039
i would feel better about the country if

1706
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,119
people were more pissed off at him

1707
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:46,480
yeah that's right it's nice to see free

1708
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,599
speech even if it's

1709
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,159
full of hate uh

1710
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,720
i am also troubled on the scientific

1711
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,639
side

1712
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:56,838
and entrepreneurial side it seems

1713
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,879
difficult to be an entrepreneur in

1714
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:03,039
russia

1715
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:05,039
like it's not even uh in terms of rules

1716
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,400
it's just culturally the people i speak

1717
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,838
to

1718
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:13,760
it's not easy to build a business

1719
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:15,838
to uh no it's not easy to even dream

1720
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,040
of building a business in russia that's

1721
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:19,039
just not part of the culture

1722
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,400
part of the conversation you know it's

1723
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,880
almost like

1724
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,720
the conversation is if you wanna if you

1725
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,960
wanna be the next bill gates or elon

1726
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,358
musk or steve jobs or whatever

1727
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,400
you come to america that's the sense

1728
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:34,000
they have yeah

1729
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,440
and i don't three matters is his

1730
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,199
is it history or just structural

1731
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,119
problems of today what do you i mean

1732
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:40,000
it's all the same thing so a history of

1733
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,280
hostility to

1734
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,719
commerce which of course the old ussr

1735
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,960
is gone but a lot of the attitudes

1736
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,558
remain a lot of the corruption remains

1737
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,159
you have this legacy distribution of

1738
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,040
wealth from the auctioning off of the

1739
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:54,960
assets

1740
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:57,599
which is not conducive to some kind of

1741
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,358
broadly egalitarian democracy

1742
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,359
and so you have these small number of

1743
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:02,960
power points to try to control

1744
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:05,279
information and wealth

1745
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,000
and not really so keen to encourage the

1746
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,680
others

1747
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,599
who ultimately would pull the balance of

1748
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,440
political power away from the very

1749
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,519
wealthy and from putin

1750
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,358
and they support that culture and the

1751
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,039
return of interest in like orthodox

1752
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,759
church and all that it's all part of the

1753
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,239
same

1754
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,880
piece i think because the old orthodox

1755
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:22,959
church is

1756
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,200
not that pro-commerce you'd have to say

1757
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,679
but it's traditionalist it's pro-family

1758
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,279
those are safer ideas and then there's

1759
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:31,440
such a great safety valve

1760
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,519
the most ambitious smartest people like

1761
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,679
they probably will learn english

1762
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:37,280
they sort of can look like they belong

1763
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,719
in all sorts of other countries they can

1764
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,480
show up and blend in

1765
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,159
super talented they've probably had an

1766
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,440
excellent education

1767
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:45,679
especially if they're from one of the

1768
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,559
two major cities but even if not so

1769
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:49,039
even from siberia and they go off they

1770
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,200
leave

1771
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,400
they're not a source of opposition and

1772
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:54,639
that keeps the whole thing up and

1773
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,440
running for another generation

1774
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:59,279
yeah uh what do you make of the other

1775
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,318
the other big uh

1776
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:07,760
player china uh they seem to have a

1777
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:11,279
very different messed up but also

1778
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,760
functioning system they seem to be much

1779
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,519
better at encouraging entrepreneurs

1780
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,200
they're choosing winners

1781
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:18,639
but like what do you make of the entire

1782
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,279
chinese system

1783
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:22,318
uh like why does it work as well as it

1784
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,880
does currently

1785
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,000
what are your concerns about it and uh

1786
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,280
what are

1787
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,838
its threats to the united states or

1788
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,720
uh possible you know it's a what is it

1789
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:34,400
you said like

1790
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:36,318
wisdom isn't when two ideas come

1791
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,798
together is there some possible

1792
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:40,318
benefits of uh these kinds of ideas

1793
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:43,039
coming together

1794
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,719
it's amazing what china has done but i

1795
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:47,119
would say to put it in perspective

1796
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:49,279
if you compare them to japan south korea

1797
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:52,318
taiwan hong kong and singapore

1798
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,880
they've still done much worse not even

1799
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:56,159
close

1800
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,880
yes and that's both living standards or

1801
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:00,558
i hesitate to cite democracy as an

1802
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,920
unalloyed good in and of itself but

1803
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,640
there's more freedom in all those other

1804
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,519
places

1805
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:06,879
by a lot so china has all these problems

1806
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,559
of history

1807
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,559
but they've managed as actually the

1808
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,079
soviets did in the middle of the 20th

1809
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,839
century

1810
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,599
one of the two great mass migrations

1811
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:18,318
from the countryside to cities

1812
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,798
which boosts productivity enormously and

1813
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:23,119
will sustain totalitarian systems

1814
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:24,639
but they move from a totalitarian system

1815
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,760
to an oligarchy

1816
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:30,000
where the ccp is actually

1817
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,960
at least for a while he has been really

1818
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,599
good at governing

1819
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,358
have made a lot of very good decisions

1820
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,119
you have to admit that

1821
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:39,598
i don't know how long that streak will

1822
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:44,000
continue with one person

1823
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:46,400
so much now holding authority

1824
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,480
in a more extreme manner the selection

1825
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,280
pressures for the next generation of

1826
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,480
high-level ccp members probably become

1827
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,000
much worse

1828
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,679
you have this general problem of the

1829
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,960
state-owned enterprise is losing

1830
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,960
relative productivity

1831
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,240
compared to the private sector well

1832
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,960
we're going to kind of

1833
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:06,000
hold jack ma on this island and he can

1834
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:09,280
only issue like weird hello statements

1835
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,358
it kind of smells bad to me i don't feel

1836
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,040
that it's about to crash

1837
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:14,639
uh below but i don't see them

1838
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,358
supplanting america

1839
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:19,118
as like the world's number one country i

1840
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:21,679
think they will muddle through

1841
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,039
and have very serious problems but

1842
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:25,440
there's enough talent there they will

1843
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:26,558
muddle through is there ideas from china

1844
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,358
from anywhere in general

1845
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,960
of large-scale role of government that

1846
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:33,598
you find might be useful like

1847
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,199
andrew yang recently ran on the platform

1848
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,798
of ubi

1849
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:43,519
right uh universal basic income is there

1850
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:46,559
some interesting ideas of large-scale

1851
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:51,759
government sort of welfare programs

1852
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:54,480
at scale that you find interesting

1853
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,640
keep in mind the current version of the

1854
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,039
chinese communist party post mao

1855
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:59,838
dismantled what was called the iron rice

1856
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,359
ball

1857
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:03,759
so took apart the health care

1858
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:06,000
protections a lot of the welfare system

1859
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,160
a lot of the guaranteed jobs so the

1860
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,119
economic rise of china coincided with

1861
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:12,239
the weakening

1862
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,880
of welfare i'm not saying that's causal

1863
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,318
per se

1864
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:17,599
but people think of china as having a

1865
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:19,279
government that takes care of everyone

1866
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,200
it's very far from the truth

1867
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,359
and buy a lot of metrics i don't mean

1868
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:24,960
control over people's lives

1869
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:26,960
i don't mean speech but by a lot of

1870
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,798
metrics economically we have a lot more

1871
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,559
government than they do

1872
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,559
so what one means here by like

1873
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,559
government private control

1874
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,640
i don't think you can just add up the

1875
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,880
numbers and get a simple answer

1876
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:40,719
they've been fantastic at building

1877
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,480
infrastructure in cities

1878
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:43,838
in ways that will attract people from

1879
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,920
the countryside

1880
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:48,798
and furthermore they more or less

1881
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:51,200
enforce a meritocracy in this sense

1882
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:53,119
like if you're a kid of a rich guy

1883
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,279
you'll get unfair privilege

1884
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:57,039
that's unfair but systems can afford

1885
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,559
that if you are smart and from the

1886
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,680
countryside and your parents have

1887
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,920
nothing

1888
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:03,598
you will be elevated and sent to a very

1889
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,039
good school graduate school because of

1890
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,039
the exam system

1891
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:08,319
and they do that and they mean that very

1892
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,839
consistently

1893
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:12,239
it's like the soviets had a version of

1894
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:14,880
that like for jazz and romantic piano

1895
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:15,679
not for everything but where they had it

1896
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,280
like

1897
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:19,038
yeah again they were tremendous right

1898
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,039
yeah exactly so yeah

1899
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,480
chinese have it in so many areas a

1900
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,559
genuine meritocracy

1901
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,599
in this one way that moves people from

1902
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:27,760
the world to this

1903
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,280
big city and that's that's all that's a

1904
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,319
big boost of productivity for some

1905
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,599
amount of time

1906
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:33,838
and when they get there they're taken

1907
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,599
seriously jack ma was riding a bicycle

1908
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:39,038
teaching english in his late 20s

1909
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:41,760
he was a poor guy so

1910
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,480
not a society of credentialism or in

1911
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,440
america is

1912
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,199
way too much a credentialist society as

1913
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,599
we're talking about even with the nobel

1914
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:49,919
prize

1915
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:51,680
yeah but what do you think about these

1916
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,798
large government programs like

1917
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:56,558
ubi the one version of ubi that makes

1918
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:57,119
the most sense to me is the mitt romney

1919
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,480
version

1920
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:02,240
ubi for kids like kids are vulnerable

1921
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,798
if their parents screw up you shouldn't

1922
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:07,358
blame the kid or make the kids suffer

1923
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:09,679
i believe in something like ubi for kids

1924
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:13,358
maybe just cash

1925
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:15,358
but if you don't have kids even with ai

1926
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:17,838
my sense is at least in the world we

1927
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:18,798
know you should be able to find a way to

1928
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,119
adjust

1929
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:23,599
you might have to move you know to north

1930
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:27,039
dakota to work

1931
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:30,400
uh you know next to fracking say

1932
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:32,960
uh but look before the pandemic

1933
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,798
the two most robot intensive societies

1934
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,079
japan and the u.s u.s at least for

1935
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,639
manufacturing

1936
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,000
uh were at full employment so maybe

1937
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:41,679
there's some far off day

1938
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,039
where there's literally no work john

1939
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:46,239
lennon imagine

1940
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:48,960
it's piped you know everywhere

1941
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:49,358
and then we might revisit the question

1942
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,039
yeah

1943
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:52,480
but for now we you know we had rising

1944
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,799
wages

1945
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,760
in the trump years and full employment

1946
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:57,440
so i don't

1947
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,280
you don't see automation as a threat

1948
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,240
that fundamentally like shakes our

1949
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,920
society

1950
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:04,078
it's a threat in the following sense the

1951
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,119
new technologies are harder to work with

1952
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:07,200
for many people

1953
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:09,200
yeah and that's the social problem but

1954
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:11,679
i'm not sure a universal

1955
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:13,279
basic income is the right answer to that

1956
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,919
very real problem

1957
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,640
well that's also i i like the upi for

1958
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,079
kids

1959
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:21,838
it's also your definition or the line

1960
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,039
the threshold for what is vulnerable and

1961
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,519
what is

1962
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,680
basic human nature going back to russia

1963
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:31,119
you know life is suffering

1964
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:34,239
that you know struggle is a part of life

1965
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:36,720
and perhaps sort of changing maybe the

1966
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:37,919
what defines the 21st century is having

1967
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:39,919
multiple careers

1968
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,039
and adjusting and learning and right

1969
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,159
evolving

1970
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:47,119
and uh some of the technology

1971
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,078
uh in terms of uh you know some of the

1972
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:52,640
technology we see

1973
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:55,680
like the internet allows us to uh

1974
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:58,879
make those pivots easier you know

1975
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:01,279
allows later life education possible

1976
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,960
it makes it possible i don't know and

1977
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,480
your earlier point about loneliness

1978
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,760
being this fundamental human problem

1979
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,880
which i would agree with

1980
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,000
strongly ubi if it's at a high level

1981
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,680
will make that worse

1982
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,760
i mean say ubi or higher enough you

1983
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:16,399
could just sit at home

1984
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,480
uh people are not going to be happy they

1985
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,440
don't actually want that yeah and we've

1986
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,318
relearned that in the pandemic

1987
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,159
yeah the flip side the hope with ubi is

1988
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:28,239
you have a little bit more freedom

1989
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:30,639
to find the thing that alleviates your

1990
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:33,279
loneliness that's the idea

1991
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:35,920
so it's it's kind of an open question if

1992
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:39,200
i give you a million dollars

1993
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:42,720
or a billion dollars will you

1994
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:44,798
pursue the thing you love will you be

1995
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,159
would you be more motivated to pursu to

1996
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:46,880
find the thing you love to do the thing

1997
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:50,078
you love or

1998
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:52,400
will you be lazy and lose yourself

1999
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,760
in the sort of daily activities that

2000
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,280
don't actually bring you

2001
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,480
joy but you know pacify you in some kind

2002
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,798
of way where

2003
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,559
you can you just let the day slip by

2004
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:04,318
that's that's the open question

2005
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,400
but a lot of the great creators did not

2006
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:07,440
have huge cushions whether it's mozart

2007
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,480
or james brown

2008
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,240
or the great painters in history they

2009
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,760
had to work pretty hard

2010
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:16,558
and if you look at heirs to great

2011
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,480
fortunes maybe i'm forgetting someone

2012
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,960
but it's hard to think of any

2013
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,798
who have creatively been important as

2014
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,318
novelists or

2015
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:25,838
they might have continued to run the

2016
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:28,480
family business yeah

2017
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:30,558
but you know van gaal was not heirs not

2018
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,519
heir to a great family fortune

2019
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,480
it said that cushions get in the way of

2020
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:37,358
progress

2021
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,798
which is uh yeah so there's the same

2022
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:41,038
point about prizes right

2023
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:43,119
yeah inheriting too much money is like

2024
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:45,760
winning a prize

2025
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,200
we mentioned eric uh eric weinstein i

2026
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,480
know you agree on a bunch of things is

2027
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:50,480
there some beautiful

2028
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,519
fascinating insightful disagreement that

2029
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,079
you have

2030
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:56,159
that has yet to be resolved with him is

2031
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:58,400
there some ideas that you guys battle

2032
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,399
better battle it out on is it the

2033
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,798
stagnation question that you mentioned

2034
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,960
that's one of them but here's at least

2035
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:07,280
two others

2036
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,960
but i would stress eric is always

2037
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,000
evolving so i'm just talking about a

2038
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,000
time slice eric

2039
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,079
right i don't know where he's at right

2040
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,760
now yeah like i heard him on clubhouse

2041
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,600
three nights ago but that was three

2042
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,920
nights ago yeah

2043
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,039
but i think he's far too pessimistic

2044
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,920
about the impact of

2045
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:26,479
immigration on u.s science he thinks it

2046
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,798
has displaced u.s scientists

2047
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:30,238
which i think that is partly true i just

2048
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:33,119
think we've gotten better talent

2049
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:34,798
i'm like bring it on double down and

2050
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:37,039
look at kuriko you know who

2051
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:39,198
basically came up with mrna vaccines she

2052
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,119
was from hungary

2053
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,639
and was ridiculed and mocked she

2054
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:45,759
couldn't get her papers published

2055
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,920
she stuck at it an american

2056
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,600
might not have been so stubborn because

2057
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,359
we have these cushions

2058
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,880
so eric is all worried like

2059
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,400
mathematicians coming in they're

2060
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,039
discouraging

2061
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,519
native u.s citizens from doing math i'm

2062
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:00,079
like

2063
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,120
bring in the best people if we all end

2064
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:03,759
up

2065
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:05,278
in other avocations absolutely fine by

2066
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,000
me does it trouble you that we

2067
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,640
kick them out after they get a degree

2068
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,560
often

2069
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,400
i would give anyone with a plausible

2070
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:15,679
graduate degree a green card

2071
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,960
universally yeah that's i i agree with

2072
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:18,798
that it makes no sense

2073
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,198
it makes so strange that the best people

2074
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:22,880
that come here suffer here

2075
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,318
create awesome stuff here then when we

2076
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,000
kick them out it doesn't make any sense

2077
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,960
here's another view i have i call it

2078
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,479
open borders for belarus

2079
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:33,039
now russia is a big country i would

2080
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,000
gladly like increase the russian quota

2081
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:37,359
yeah by 3x

2082
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,399
4x 5x like i not 20

2083
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:43,600
but a big boost but belarus

2084
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:44,238
small country like why can't and they're

2085
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,880
poor

2086
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:48,718
and they have decent education and a lot

2087
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,520
of talent there why can't we just open

2088
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,158
the door

2089
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,359
yeah and convert a belarus passport to a

2090
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,119
green card

2091
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,480
open borders for belarus it's my new

2092
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:59,039
campaign slogan

2093
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:02,158
are you running for president 2024 well

2094
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:03,600
write-ins are welcome but

2095
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:05,198
what's the second thing you disagree

2096
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:09,199
with eric

2097
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:10,079
uh trade again i'm not sure where he's

2098
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:13,119
at now

2099
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:14,640
but he is suspicious of trade in a way

2100
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:16,640
that i am not

2101
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,800
i do understand what's called the china

2102
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,679
shock has been a big problem for the u.s

2103
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,159
middle class

2104
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,920
i fully accept that i think most of that

2105
01:10:22,158 --> 01:10:26,719
is behind us

2106
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,840
national security issues aside i think

2107
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:31,039
free trade is

2108
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,719
very much a good thing eric

2109
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:34,079
i'm not sure he'll say it's not a good

2110
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:34,719
thing but he won't say it is a good

2111
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:37,279
thing

2112
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:39,198
and i know he's kind of that's like eric

2113
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:41,119
free trade

2114
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:42,799
but look on things like vaccines i don't

2115
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:44,880
believe in free trade

2116
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,800
you want vaccine production in your own

2117
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,319
country look at the eu

2118
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,079
they have enough money no one will send

2119
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:52,479
them vaccines

2120
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,600
what's different about vaccines is it

2121
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:56,238
there are some things you want to

2122
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,000
prioritize the citizenry on

2123
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:00,559
and they could argue it would be cheaper

2124
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,840
to produce all u.s manufactured vaccines

2125
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,640
in india

2126
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,760
they have the technologies uh obviously

2127
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,440
lower wages

2128
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,760
but look there's talk in india right now

2129
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:11,839
of cutting off the export of vaccines

2130
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,440
if you outsource your vaccine production

2131
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,760
you're not sure the other country will

2132
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:17,839
respect the norm of free trade

2133
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,920
so you need to keep some vaccine

2134
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,600
production in your country

2135
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,079
it's an exception to free trade not to

2136
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,079
the logic

2137
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,158
a bunch of things the navy uses you

2138
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:31,039
can't buy those components from china

2139
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:31,039
like that's insane

2140
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:35,359
but look it would be cheaper to do so

2141
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:37,359
right yeah

2142
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,799
let me uh completely shift topics on

2143
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,880
something that's fascinating it's all

2144
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:44,560
the same topic but great

2145
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,560
everything is interesting

2146
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,719
uh what do you think about what the hell

2147
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,719
is money

2148
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:54,399
and uh the recent

2149
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,800
the the recent excitement around

2150
01:11:54,399 --> 01:12:00,559
cryptocurrency

2151
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:03,600
that um brings to the forefront

2152
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,199
uh the philosophical discussion of the

2153
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,960
nature of money are you

2154
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:08,559
bullish on cryptocurrency are you

2155
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,439
excited about it what does it make you

2156
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,920
think about

2157
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:12,639
how the nature of money is changing no

2158
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,359
one knows

2159
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,199
what money is probably no one ever knew

2160
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,359
go back to medieval times bills of

2161
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:21,759
exchange were they money

2162
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:23,359
maybe it's just a semantic debate gold

2163
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,199
silver what about copper coins what

2164
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:26,799
about metals that were

2165
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:29,678
considered legal tender but not always

2166
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:32,640
circulating yeah what about credit

2167
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:34,399
so being confused about moneyness is the

2168
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,039
natural state of affairs for human

2169
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:36,479
beings

2170
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:38,719
and if there's more of that i'd say

2171
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:42,000
that's probably a good thing

2172
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:43,920
now crypto per se i think bitcoin

2173
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,439
has taken over a lot of the space held

2174
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,800
by gold

2175
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:52,158
that to me seems sustainable uh i'm not

2176
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,360
short bitcoin i don't have some view

2177
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:54,639
that the price

2178
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,519
has to be different than the current

2179
01:12:54,640 --> 01:13:00,079
price but i know it changes every moment

2180
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,040
uh i am deeply uncertain about the less

2181
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:03,679
of crypto

2182
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:04,399
which seems connected to ultimate

2183
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,520
visions

2184
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:09,198
of using it for transactions in ways

2185
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,880
where i'm not sure

2186
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:13,119
whether it be you know prediction

2187
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:15,520
markets or defy

2188
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:17,439
i'm not sure the retail demand really is

2189
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,080
there once it is regulated like

2190
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:21,919
everything else

2191
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:24,399
is i would say i'm 40 60

2192
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,920
optimistic on those forms of crypto that

2193
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:27,279
is i think it's somewhat more likely

2194
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,760
they failed and succeed

2195
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:31,359
but i take them very seriously so we're

2196
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,800
talking about it becoming one of the

2197
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:34,158
main currencies in the world

2198
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,640
that's what we're discussing that i

2199
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:39,039
don't think will happen so

2200
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,320
but but the reality is that bitcoin used

2201
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,560
to be

2202
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:44,559
in the single digits of a dollar and now

2203
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,199
has crossed fifty thousand dollars

2204
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,840
for a single bitcoin do you think it's

2205
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:49,359
possible

2206
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,279
it reaches something like a million

2207
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:52,719
dollars

2208
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:54,880
i don't think we have a good theory of

2209
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:56,319
the value of bitcoin if people decide

2210
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,600
it's worth a million dollars it's worth

2211
01:13:56,319 --> 01:13:59,439
a million dollars

2212
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,520
but isn't that money like you said isn't

2213
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:03,439
the ultimate state of money confusion or

2214
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,199
however beautifully you put it it's like

2215
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,879
valuing an andy warhol painting so when

2216
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:08,799
warhol started off

2217
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,440
probably those things had no value

2218
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,840
sketches early sketches of shoes

2219
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:14,559
now a good warhol could be worth over 50

2220
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,319
million

2221
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,560
yeah that's an incredible rate of price

2222
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:21,519
appreciation bitcoin is seeing

2223
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:23,600
a similar trajectory i don't pretend to

2224
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,280
know where it will stop

2225
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,880
but it's about trying to figure out what

2226
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:28,479
do people think of andy warhol he could

2227
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,560
be out of fashion

2228
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:34,639
in a century maybe yes maybe no

2229
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,400
but you don't think about war halls as

2230
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,560
money

2231
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:40,479
they perform some money like functions

2232
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:43,520
you can even use them as collateral

2233
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:45,919
for like deals between gangs

2234
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,719
but they're not basically money nor is

2235
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,800
bitcoin

2236
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,319
and the transactions velocity of bitcoin

2237
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,119
i would think is likely to fall if

2238
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,319
anything

2239
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,319
so you don't think there will be some

2240
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:56,399
kind of phase shift will become adopted

2241
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:58,559
and become mainstream for the trend

2242
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:00,079
for for the main for one of the main

2243
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,560
mechanisms of transactions

2244
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:04,640
bitcoin no now i you know ether has some

2245
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,719
chance at that i would bet against it

2246
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:10,000
but i wouldn't give you a definitive no

2247
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:12,399
and you'll would bitcoin is too costly

2248
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,800
it may be fine to hold it like gold but

2249
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:16,960
gold is also costly

2250
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,239
uh you have smart people trying to make

2251
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,640
say ether

2252
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:22,399
much more effective as a currency than

2253
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,400
bitcoin

2254
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:26,079
and there's certainly a decent chance

2255
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:28,319
they will succeed yeah there's a lot of

2256
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,559
innovation i mean with smart contracts

2257
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:31,679
with uh nfts as well there's there's a

2258
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,480
lot of interesting

2259
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,000
like innovations that are plugging into

2260
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:39,359
the human psyche somehow

2261
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,840
just like money does you know money

2262
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:42,639
seems to be this viral thing our ideas

2263
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,199
of money

2264
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:47,520
right and if the idea is strong enough

2265
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:49,119
it seems to be able to take hold

2266
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,719
like there's network effects that just

2267
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:53,840
take over

2268
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:55,920
and like i i particularly see that with

2269
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,199
i'd love to get your comment on uh

2270
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,199
deutsche coin

2271
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:01,279
which is basically by a single human

2272
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:03,359
being elon musk has been created

2273
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:04,639
you know it's like these celebrities can

2274
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,119
have a huge

2275
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,560
ripple effect on the impact of money is

2276
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:11,920
it possible

2277
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:14,000
that in the 21st century people like

2278
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,920
elon musk and celebrities i don't know

2279
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,198
donald trump the rock

2280
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:20,480
whoever else can have can actually

2281
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:22,158
define

2282
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:24,399
you know the currencies that we use

2283
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:27,198
maybe can can deutsch going behind the

2284
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:29,359
primary currency of the world

2285
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:31,119
i think of it as like baseball cards so

2286
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:32,639
right now every baseball player has a

2287
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,079
baseball card

2288
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,079
and the players who are stars their

2289
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:36,559
cards can end up worth a fair amount of

2290
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:38,479
money

2291
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,000
yeah and that's stable we've had it for

2292
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:42,639
many decades

2293
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,238
uh sort of the player defines the card

2294
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,000
they sign a contract with tops or

2295
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:47,759
whatever company

2296
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,079
now could you imagine celebrities

2297
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,840
baseball players lebron james

2298
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:53,920
having their own currencies instead of

2299
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,920
cards absolutely and

2300
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,359
you're somewhat seeing that right now as

2301
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,560
you mentioned artists with

2302
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:02,000
these unique works on the blockchain but

2303
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,760
i'm not sure those are macro

2304
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,520
economically important if it's just a

2305
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,640
new class of collectibles that people

2306
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,600
have fun with

2307
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,920
again i say bring it on but whether

2308
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,000
there are use cases beyond that

2309
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:15,119
that challenge fiat monies which

2310
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,399
actually work

2311
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:20,880
very well yesterday i sent money

2312
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:21,920
to a family in ethiopia that i helped

2313
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,840
support

2314
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,960
in less than 24 hours they got that

2315
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,319
money

2316
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,279
digitally yes no not digitally through

2317
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:31,759
my bank

2318
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:33,039
my primitive dinosaur bank bb t

2319
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,280
mid-atlantic bank

2320
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:37,119
headquartered in north carolina you know

2321
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,039
chartered by the fed regulated by the

2322
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:41,279
fdac in the occ

2323
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:42,960
now you could say well the exchange rate

2324
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:46,000
was not so great

2325
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,920
uh i don't see crypto

2326
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,600
as close to beating that once you take

2327
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,199
into account all of the last mile

2328
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,600
problems

2329
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:55,439
fiat currency works really well people

2330
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,039
are not sitting around bitching about it

2331
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:58,719
and when you talk to crypto people the

2332
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,479
number who have to postulate some out of

2333
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,920
the blue hyperinflation

2334
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,238
where there's no evidence for that

2335
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,840
whatsoever that's to me is a sign

2336
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:07,678
they're not thinking clearly

2337
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,159
about how hard they have to work to out

2338
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:11,039
compete fiat currency

2339
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:13,839
there's a bunch of different

2340
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:16,238
technologies that are really exciting

2341
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,039
that don't want to address how difficult

2342
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:18,559
it is to

2343
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:20,399
out-compete the current accepted

2344
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,600
alternative so for example autonomous

2345
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:24,000
vehicles

2346
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,920
a lot of people are really excited yeah

2347
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:30,880
but it's not trivial to out compete uber

2348
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,199
uh on the cost and the effectiveness and

2349
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,800
the

2350
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:34,879
user experience and all those concepts

2351
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,920
correct sorry uber driven by humans

2352
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:40,480
yes uh and it's not you know

2353
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,920
that's taken for granted i think that

2354
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:43,359
look wouldn't it be amazing

2355
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,440
how amazing would the world look when

2356
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:46,799
the cars are driving themselves fully

2357
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:48,559
you know it's going to drive the cost

2358
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,000
down you can remove the cost of drivers

2359
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,679
all those kinds of things

2360
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,359
but it's when you actually get down to

2361
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,000
it and have to build a business around

2362
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:55,920
it it's actually

2363
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,039
very difficult to do and i guess you're

2364
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,440
saying your sense is

2365
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:01,679
similar competition is facing

2366
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:05,439
cryptocurrency like you have to

2367
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:09,359
actually present a killer app

2368
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:12,399
uh reason to switch from fiat currency

2369
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:14,079
uh to uh to ethereum

2370
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:16,000
or the biden people are going to

2371
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:16,880
regulate crypto and they're going to do

2372
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,520
it soon

2373
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,159
so something like d5 i fully get why

2374
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,640
that is

2375
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:24,319
cheaper or for some can be cheaper than

2376
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,440
other ways of conducting financial

2377
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:28,399
intermediation

2378
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,559
but some of that is regulatory arbitrage

2379
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:33,198
it will not be allowed to go on forever

2380
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,960
for better or worse i would rather see

2381
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:37,359
it given greater tolerance and

2382
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,039
but the point is banking lobby is strong

2383
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:39,839
the government will only let it run so

2384
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:41,198
far

2385
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,199
there'll be capital requirements

2386
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:44,479
reporting requirements imposed

2387
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:46,399
and it will lose a lot of those

2388
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:48,639
advantages

2389
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:50,479
what do you make of wall street bets

2390
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:53,520
another thing that recently happened

2391
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:55,279
that shook the world and

2392
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,719
uh at least me from the outsider

2393
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:58,800
perspective

2394
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:00,880
make me question what i do and don't

2395
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,119
understand about our economic system

2396
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,000
uh which is a bunch of different uh a

2397
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:05,599
bun a large

2398
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,079
number of individuals getting together

2399
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:10,159
on the internet and having a large-scale

2400
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:11,760
impact on the markets

2401
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:13,198
if you tell a group of people and

2402
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,800
coordinate them through the internet

2403
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:16,559
we're going to play a fun game it might

2404
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,000
cost you money but you're going to make

2405
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:19,520
the headlines and there's a chance

2406
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,920
you'll screw over some billionaires and

2407
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,400
hedge funds enough people will play that

2408
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,399
game

2409
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:25,920
yes so that game might continue but i

2410
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,879
don't think it's of macro economic

2411
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,359
importance

2412
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,480
and the price of those stocks in the

2413
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:33,039
medium term

2414
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:33,599
will end up wherever it ought to be so

2415
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:36,079
these are

2416
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,960
little outliers from a macroeconomics

2417
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:40,158
perspective they're

2418
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:43,520
they're not going to the these are not

2419
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:45,359
signals of of shifting power

2420
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,800
like from from centralized power to

2421
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:48,079
distributed power these aren't some

2422
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,320
fundamental

2423
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:52,399
changes in the way our economy works i

2424
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:55,039
think of it as a new brand of esports

2425
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:57,198
maybe more fun than the old brand

2426
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:58,960
which is fine right it's like push the

2427
01:20:57,198 --> 01:20:59,519
anarchy into the corners where you want

2428
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,719
it

2429
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:04,239
it doesn't bother me

2430
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,639
but i think people are seeing it as more

2431
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:08,559
fundamental than it is it's a new esport

2432
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:10,800
more fun for many but more expensive

2433
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:13,520
than the old esports

2434
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,239
like chess is a new esport super cheap

2435
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,320
not as fun

2436
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:17,279
as like you know sending hedge funds to

2437
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:20,399
their doom but

2438
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:21,920
like what would you expect the poetry

2439
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:23,920
that i love it okay

2440
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,600
uh but macroeconomically it's not it's

2441
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,199
not fundamental okay

2442
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,679
i was gonna say i hope you're right

2443
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:33,198
because i'm uncomfortable with the chaos

2444
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:35,279
of the masses that's creates but uh i

2445
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:38,719
also think that chaos is somewhat real

2446
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:41,198
to be clear yes but it will matter

2447
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:42,239
through other channels not through

2448
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:46,000
manipulating

2449
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:47,678
you know gamestop or yeah amc

2450
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,679
so you're seeing the real macro

2451
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,560
phenomenon when people see a real macro

2452
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:52,560
phenomenon

2453
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,840
they tend to make every micro story fit

2454
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,600
the narrative

2455
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,960
and this micro story like it fits the

2456
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,840
narrative but it doesn't mean its

2457
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,079
importance

2458
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,920
fits the narrative that's how i would

2459
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:03,679
kind of dissect the mistake i think

2460
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,079
people are making

2461
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:07,039
oh do you do within the macro phenomena

2462
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:09,198
that are there

2463
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:10,319
do you mean everyone's weird now the

2464
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:12,319
internet

2465
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:13,840
either allows us to be weirder or makes

2466
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:16,319
us weirder i'm not sure what's the right

2467
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,920
way to put it maybe a mix of both

2468
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:20,079
you're probably right that it allows us

2469
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,679
to be weirder because

2470
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,600
well this is the other okay so this

2471
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:26,480
connects our previous conversation

2472
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,280
is does america allow us to be weirder

2473
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:30,000
or does it

2474
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:32,079
uh make us weirder like say we're weird

2475
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,920
and somewhat neurotic to begin with

2476
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:35,279
but the only messages we get are dwight

2477
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,840
d eisenhower and

2478
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:39,599
i love lucy and network tv like that's

2479
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,840
going to keep us within certain bounds

2480
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,679
yeah in good and bad ways that's

2481
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,920
obviously totally gone

2482
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,880
and the internet you can connect to not

2483
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,319
just q and on

2484
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:51,199
but all sorts of things many of them

2485
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:53,359
just fantastic right

2486
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:55,839
but in good and bad ways it makes us

2487
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:57,599
weirder so that maybe is troubling

2488
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,440
right like if someone's worried about

2489
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,760
that i would at least say they should

2490
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:03,359
give it deep serious thought and then it

2491
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,400
has a whole lot of

2492
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:07,359
ebbs and flows micro realizations of the

2493
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:10,079
weirdness

2494
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:12,000
that don't actually matter so like chess

2495
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:14,399
players today they play a lot more weird

2496
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,719
openings than they did 20 years ago

2497
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,399
like it reflects the same thing because

2498
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:21,119
you can research any weird opening on

2499
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:23,359
the internet but like does that matter

2500
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:24,880
probably not so a lot of the things we

2501
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:25,839
see are just like the weird chess

2502
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,199
openings

2503
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,639
and to figure out which are like the

2504
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:30,319
weird chess openings and which are

2505
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,359
fundamental to the new and growing

2506
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:33,119
weirdness

2507
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:34,880
like that's what a hedge fund investor

2508
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:37,198
type should be trying to do

2509
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,840
i just think no one knows yet it's like

2510
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:42,158
this itself this fun weird guessing game

2511
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,199
which we're partly engaging in right now

2512
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:46,319
exactly

2513
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:48,638
and i mean as eric talks about uh on the

2514
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:50,719
science side of things i mean i said

2515
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:52,319
uh like at mit especially in the machine

2516
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:54,158
learning field

2517
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:56,000
there's a natural institutional

2518
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:58,319
resistance to the weird

2519
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,158
it's very as they talk about it's it's

2520
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:00,799
difficult to hire weird faculty for

2521
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:03,439
example

2522
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,199
correct you want to hire you want to

2523
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:06,319
hire and give tenure to people that are

2524
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:08,319
safe

2525
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:10,639
and not weird and that's one of the

2526
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:11,840
concerns is like it seems like the weird

2527
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:13,920
people are the ones that push the

2528
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,760
science forward usually right

2529
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,679
and so like how do you how do you

2530
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,039
balance the two it's not obvious

2531
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:21,199
because there's another area where eric

2532
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:22,960
and i disagree as i

2533
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:24,399
interpret him he thinks academia is

2534
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,679
totally bankrupt yeah

2535
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:29,679
and i think it's only partially bankrupt

2536
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,920
how do we fix it because i i'm with you

2537
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:34,560
i'm i'm bullish on academia

2538
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,158
you need up-and-coming schools that end

2539
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,199
up better than where they started off

2540
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:39,679
and mit

2541
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:41,439
was once one of them yes now they're not

2542
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,480
in every area in some areas they have

2543
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:44,719
become the problem

2544
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:46,158
yeah you chicago you wouldn't call it up

2545
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,560
and coming but it's still different

2546
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:50,719
and that's great let's hope they managed

2547
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,360
to keep it that way

2548
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:55,119
uh the biggest problem to me is the rank

2549
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:57,439
absurd conformism

2550
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:59,039
at kind of second-tier schools maybe in

2551
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:01,039
the top 40 but not in the top

2552
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:02,479
dozen that are just trying to be like a

2553
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:04,880
junior mit

2554
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:06,718
but it's mediocre and copycat and

2555
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,159
they're the most dogmatic enforcers of

2556
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,840
weirdness that like

2557
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:11,359
harvard is more open than those

2558
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,880
second-tier schools

2559
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:14,799
and those second-tier schools are pretty

2560
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,279
good typically right yeah

2561
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,079
but the mediocrity is enforced there

2562
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,639
correct

2563
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:21,760
very strictly and the homogenization

2564
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,279
pressures clock try

2565
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,360
you know climb the rankings by another

2566
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:26,960
three places and be a little closer to

2567
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:28,799
mit though you'll never touch them

2568
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,239
yeah that to me is very harmful and

2569
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,880
you'd rather they be more like

2570
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:34,399
chicago more like caltech or the elder

2571
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,760
caltech all the more like

2572
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:38,719
pick some model be weird in it you might

2573
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,440
fail

2574
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:43,600
that's socially better yeah but so the

2575
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:47,279
problem with mit for example

2576
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:49,760
is the mediocrity is really

2577
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:51,599
enforced on the junior faculty yeah so

2578
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,400
like the people that are allowed to be

2579
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,920
weird

2580
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:55,599
or actually they just don't even ask for

2581
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,399
permissions anymore or more senior

2582
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,639
faculty

2583
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,638
and that's good of course but you want

2584
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:03,440
the weird young people

2585
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:05,199
uh you know i find to you know this

2586
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:07,439
podcast i like talking to

2587
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:08,638
tech people and i find the young faculty

2588
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:10,158
to be really boring

2589
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:11,760
they are they're the most boring of

2590
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:14,879
faculty their work

2591
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:18,000
is interesting technically technically

2592
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:20,719
but just the the the passion

2593
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,719
they are drudges

2594
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:24,960
and it's well some of them sneak by like

2595
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:27,599
you have like the max stag mark

2596
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,760
young version of max tegmark who knows

2597
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,639
how to play the role

2598
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:35,199
of boring and and fitting in and on the

2599
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:36,639
side he does the weird

2600
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:38,238
but they're not they're far and few in

2601
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,400
between which i

2602
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:42,799
i'd i'd love to figure out a way to

2603
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:44,799
shake up that system because

2604
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,320
as you look at mit's broad institute

2605
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,719
right and biomedical it's been a huge

2606
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:48,559
hit

2607
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:50,158
yeah i'm not privy to their internal

2608
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,280
doings but i suspect

2609
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:54,158
they support weird more than the formal

2610
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:56,000
departments do

2611
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:58,000
at the junior level yes that's probably

2612
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:02,238
true yeah i don't know what

2613
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:04,000
whatever they're doing is working but uh

2614
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:07,039
we need to figure it out because i think

2615
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:10,479
the best ideas still do come from the

2616
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:11,920
uh so forget uh my apologies but for the

2617
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:13,519
humanities side of things i don't i

2618
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,079
don't know anything about but the

2619
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,760
engineering and the science side i think

2620
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:18,000
there's so many amazing ideas that are

2621
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,239
still

2622
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,359
coming from universities it's not true

2623
01:27:20,238 --> 01:27:23,039
that you don't know anything about the

2624
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:24,238
humanities you're doing the humanities

2625
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:26,000
right now

2626
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:27,519
we're talking about people there are no

2627
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,840
numbers put on a blackboard

2628
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,880
right there's no hypothesis testing per

2629
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,679
se no yes

2630
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,480
you have however many subscribers to

2631
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,960
your podcast

2632
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:37,519
all listening to you on the humanities

2633
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,880
every

2634
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,800
whatever your frequency is there but i'm

2635
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,440
not in the department of the humanities

2636
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,360
that's why

2637
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:44,799
it's innovative they have very different

2638
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:48,000
conversations

2639
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:50,880
there's the number of emails i get about

2640
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,760
listen i i really deeply respect

2641
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:55,039
diversity

2642
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,800
and the and the the the full scope of

2643
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:58,319
what diversity means and also the more

2644
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,679
narrow scope of different races and

2645
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:00,000
genders and so on it's a really

2646
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:02,158
important

2647
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,920
topic but there's a disproportionate

2648
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:06,960
number of emails i'm getting

2649
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:08,480
about meetings and discussions and

2650
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,719
that just kind of is overwhelming i

2651
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:14,238
don't get enough emails from people

2652
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:15,840
like a meeting about uh why are all your

2653
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:17,919
ideas bad

2654
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,600
let's let's uh for example let me call

2655
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,960
out mit why don't we do

2656
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:25,360
more uh why don't we kick stanford's ass

2657
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:27,119
or google's ass more importantly in deep

2658
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:30,158
learning and machine learning and ai

2659
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:31,519
research what cell for example used to

2660
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:33,439
be a laboratory

2661
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,040
is a laboratory for artificial

2662
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:39,198
intelligence research

2663
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:42,319
and why is that not the the beacon

2664
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:44,000
of what of greatness

2665
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:45,599
in artificial intelligence let's have

2666
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,158
those meetings as well

2667
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,320
diversity talk has oddly become this new

2668
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:52,719
mechanism for enforcing conformity

2669
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:54,799
yes exactly and right so it's almost

2670
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:57,198
like this conformity mechanism finds

2671
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,520
the hot new topic to use to enforce

2672
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:02,158
further conformity exactly

2673
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,280
oh boy i still have hope i remain

2674
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:04,799
optimistic

2675
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:07,198
the humanities have innovated through

2676
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:10,320
podcasts including yours and mine

2677
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:12,399
yeah and they're alive and well all the

2678
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:13,679
bad talk you hear about the humanities

2679
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:15,119
in universities

2680
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:17,119
there's been this huge end run of

2681
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:18,319
innovation on the internet yeah and it's

2682
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:21,840
amazing you're right i

2683
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:23,840
never thought i mean this is humanities

2684
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,679
this this podcast i've been speaking

2685
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,880
pros all one's life and didn't know it

2686
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,840
right

2687
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,840
uh yeah i am actually part of the

2688
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,239
humanities department at mit now

2689
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,920
i didn't not realize this and i i will

2690
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:37,439
fully embrace it from this moment on

2691
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,960
look you have this thing the media lab

2692
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:40,638
i'm sure you know about it

2693
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,319
done some excellent things done a lot of

2694
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:43,760
very bogus things

2695
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:45,599
but you're out competing them you're

2696
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,440
blowing them out of the water yeah

2697
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,880
like you are them yeah i mean and i'm

2698
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:49,519
talking to those folks and they they're

2699
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:51,440
they're starting

2700
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,800
well they're trying to figure it out i

2701
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:53,919
mean they had their issues with jeffrey

2702
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,960
epstein and so on

2703
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:59,520
but outside of that

2704
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:01,198
there's a i've actually gone through a

2705
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,159
shift with this particular podcast for

2706
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:06,238
example

2707
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:08,238
where at first it was seen as a

2708
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:09,599
one at the very first it was seen as a

2709
01:30:08,238 --> 01:30:12,158
distraction

2710
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,600
second it was a source of like almost

2711
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:15,198
like a kind of jealousy

2712
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,679
like the same kind of jealousy you feel

2713
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:18,879
when junior faculty outshines the senior

2714
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:21,119
faculty

2715
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,079
and now it's more like oh okay this is a

2716
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:23,840
thing

2717
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:25,359
like we we should do more of that we

2718
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,800
should embrace this guy we should

2719
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:29,599
embrace this thing

2720
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,239
so there's a sense that podcasting and

2721
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,800
whatever this

2722
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:33,279
is and it doesn't have to be podcasting

2723
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,679
will

2724
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:37,439
drive some innovation within mit within

2725
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:39,119
different universities

2726
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:41,678
there's a sense that things are changing

2727
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:44,479
it's just that universities lag behind

2728
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,920
and my hope is that you know they catch

2729
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:48,799
up quickly

2730
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:50,480
they they they innovate in some way that

2731
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,679
goes along with the innovations of the

2732
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,599
internet

2733
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,600
um the internet will outrace them for a

2734
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,679
long time maybe forever

2735
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,199
well i mean but it's okay if they're as

2736
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:00,719
long as they keep in yeah and we're both

2737
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:02,559
in universities so we have

2738
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:04,480
multiple hats on here as we're speaking

2739
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,679
so yes we can complain about the

2740
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:07,039
universities

2741
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:10,960
that's like complaining about the

2742
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:14,238
podcast right yeah we view them

2743
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,239
but speaking on the weird you've uh uh

2744
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:17,439
in the best sense of the word weird

2745
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:19,359
you've written about

2746
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:20,479
and made the case that we should take

2747
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:22,960
ufo sightings

2748
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:23,599
more seriously so that's one of the

2749
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:27,439
things that

2750
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:31,440
uh i've been

2751
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:34,719
uh inundated with sort of

2752
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:37,678
the excitement and the passion that

2753
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:39,039
people have for the possibility of

2754
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,800
extraterrestrial life

2755
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:42,238
of life out there in the universe i've

2756
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,679
always felt this excitement

2757
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:45,919
of just looking up at the stars and

2758
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:47,760
wondering what the hell's out there

2759
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,600
but there's people that have more like

2760
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,239
uh more

2761
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:54,079
grounded excitement and passion of

2762
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:57,759
actually interacting with the

2763
01:31:54,079 --> 01:32:00,479
with aliens on this here our planet

2764
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,199
what's the case they from your

2765
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:04,238
perspective

2766
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:06,719
for taking these sightings more

2767
01:32:04,238 --> 01:32:06,718
seriously

2768
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,760
the data from the navy to me seemed

2769
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:13,279
quite serious

2770
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,639
i don't pretend that i have the

2771
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:19,279
technical abilities to judge it as data

2772
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:21,039
but there are numerous senators at the

2773
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:23,519
very highest of levels

2774
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:25,279
former heads of cia brennan i talked to

2775
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,679
him did an interview with him

2776
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:29,359
i asked him what's up with these what do

2777
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:31,600
you think it is he basically said that

2778
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:33,359
was the single most likely explanation

2779
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,280
was of alien origin now you don't have

2780
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:36,639
to agree with him

2781
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:39,039
but look if you know how government

2782
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:40,719
works these senators or hillary clinton

2783
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:42,479
for that matter or brennan

2784
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:44,560
they sat down they were briefed by their

2785
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:47,279
smartest people and they said

2786
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:48,960
hey what's going on here and everyone

2787
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:49,519
around the table i believe is telling

2788
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,639
them

2789
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,679
we don't know and that is sociological

2790
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:56,560
data

2791
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:57,679
i take very seriously i have not seen a

2792
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,760
debunking

2793
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:02,079
of the technical data yes which is

2794
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,679
eyewitness reports and images and radar

2795
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:06,479
again at a technical level

2796
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:08,560
i i feel quite uncertain on that turf

2797
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:09,839
but evaluating some of the testimony of

2798
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,400
witnesses

2799
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:14,960
it seems to me it's now at a threshold

2800
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:17,119
where one ought to take it seriously

2801
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,399
yeah there's a one of the problems with

2802
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:20,840
ufo sightings

2803
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:23,119
is that because of people with good

2804
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:25,039
equipment don't take it seriously it's

2805
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:27,519
such a taboo topic

2806
01:33:25,039 --> 01:33:29,760
that you have just like really shitty

2807
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:31,600
equipment collecting data

2808
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,360
and so you have the blurry bigfoot kind

2809
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,520
of situation where you have just bad

2810
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:38,479
video and all those kinds of things

2811
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,360
as opposed to uh i mean there's a bunch

2812
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:42,718
of

2813
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:45,759
people uh avi lowe from harvard

2814
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:46,239
uh talking about amo amua it's it's just

2815
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:49,520
like

2816
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:52,879
people with the equipment

2817
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:54,159
to do the data collection don't want to

2818
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:57,679
help out

2819
01:33:54,158 --> 01:34:00,079
and that creates a kind of divide

2820
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:01,840
where the scientists ignore that this is

2821
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:04,238
happening and there's the masses of

2822
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:05,920
people who are curious about it and then

2823
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:06,879
there's the government that's full of

2824
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,639
secrets

2825
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:12,159
that's leaking some confusion

2826
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:13,920
and it creates distrust in the

2827
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:15,119
government it creates distrust in

2828
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:17,039
science

2829
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:18,639
and it prevents the scientists from

2830
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:21,760
being able to explore some cool

2831
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:22,639
topics some exciting possibilities that

2832
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:25,199
they should be

2833
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:27,039
be curious kids like avi talks about

2834
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:29,839
even if it has nothing to do with

2835
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:31,039
aliens whatever the answer is it has to

2836
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,480
be something fascinating

2837
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:35,519
we already know everything's interesting

2838
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:35,519
but this is fascinating

2839
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,199
but look that all said i i suspect

2840
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,960
they're not of alien origin and let's

2841
01:34:39,198 --> 01:34:44,000
let me tell you my reason the people

2842
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,840
who are all gung-ho they do a kind of

2843
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,679
reasoning in reverse or argument from

2844
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,199
elimination

2845
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:51,039
they figure out a bunch of things that

2846
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:52,319
can't be like is it a russian advanced

2847
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:54,399
vehicle

2848
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:56,238
no probably pretty good arguments there

2849
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:59,198
is it a chinese advanced vehicle

2850
01:34:56,238 --> 01:35:00,079
no is it people like from the earth's

2851
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:02,638
future

2852
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:03,840
coming back in time no and they go

2853
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:05,118
through a few others they have some

2854
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,039
really good no arguments then they're

2855
01:35:05,118 --> 01:35:09,759
like well what we've got left is aliens

2856
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:10,399
yeah this argument from elimination i

2857
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,639
don't

2858
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:14,399
actually find that persuasive you can

2859
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:15,520
talk yourself into a lot of mistaken

2860
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:17,519
ideas that way

2861
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:18,880
yeah the positive evidence that it's

2862
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:21,040
aliens

2863
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,480
is still quite weak the positive

2864
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:25,439
evidence that it's a puzzle

2865
01:35:22,479 --> 01:35:27,118
is quite huge and then and uh whatever

2866
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:28,799
the solution to the puzzle is

2867
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:30,799
it might be fascinating and it's going

2868
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:32,560
to be so weird or fascinating or maybe

2869
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,520
even trivial but that's weird in its own

2870
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:37,119
way

2871
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:38,639
that we can't set up by elimination all

2872
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:40,238
the things that might be able to be

2873
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:42,079
yeah and just like you said the

2874
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:45,678
debunking that i've seen

2875
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:48,800
of these kinds of things are

2876
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:49,920
less explorations and solutions to the

2877
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,960
puzzle and more

2878
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:55,279
a kind of half-hearted dismissal and

2879
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:56,000
avi as you mentioned to him on your

2880
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:58,719
podcast with

2881
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:01,118
him he's been attacked an awful lot and

2882
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:04,239
when i hear the idea carrier attacked

2883
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:06,319
i get very suspicious of the critics

2884
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:08,799
uh if if he's wrong like just tell me

2885
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:11,279
why yeah like my ears are open

2886
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,320
i don't have a set view on omuamua you

2887
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:14,479
know

2888
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:16,158
i know i can't judge avi's arguments he

2889
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:17,198
can't convince me in that sense i'm too

2890
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:19,118
stupid

2891
01:36:17,198 --> 01:36:20,559
to understand how good his argument may

2892
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:23,679
or may not be

2893
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:26,800
and not like you said ultimately in the

2894
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:29,199
argument is uh in the in the meeting

2895
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,400
of that debate is when we've where we

2896
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:32,158
find the wisdom

2897
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:33,519
like dismissing it that's one thing that

2898
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:34,559
troubles me there's a bunch of people

2899
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,480
like nietzsche sometimes

2900
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,520
dismissed this way ayn rand is sometimes

2901
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:41,678
dismissed this way oh here we go like

2902
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,960
the there's a as opposed to arguing

2903
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:46,000
against her ideas

2904
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:48,480
dismissing it all right and that that

2905
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,319
that's not productive at all uh she may

2906
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:53,118
be wrong in a lot of things but

2907
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:55,039
like laying out some arguments even if

2908
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:57,359
they're basic human arguments

2909
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:59,118
uh that's that's where we arrive at the

2910
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:02,319
wisdom i love that

2911
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:04,238
uh is there something um

2912
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:06,639
deeper to be said about our trust and

2913
01:37:04,238 --> 01:37:09,359
institutions and governments and so on

2914
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:10,880
that has to do with ufos that there

2915
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:13,039
there's a kind of suspicion

2916
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,960
that the us government and governments

2917
01:37:13,039 --> 01:37:18,079
in general are hiding stuff from us

2918
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:19,520
uh when you talk about ufos

2919
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:21,279
this is my view on that if we

2920
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:22,800
declassified everything

2921
01:37:21,279 --> 01:37:24,399
i think we would find a lot more

2922
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,600
evidence all pointing toward the same

2923
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:27,519
puzzle

2924
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,360
there aren't some alien men being held

2925
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:32,560
underground yes there's not some secret

2926
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:34,799
file that lays out whatever is happening

2927
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:36,239
i think the real lesson about government

2928
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:39,199
is government cannot

2929
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:39,839
bring itself to any new belief on this

2930
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:41,919
matter

2931
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,840
of any kind and it's a kind of funny

2932
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,639
inertia like government is deeply

2933
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,239
puzzled

2934
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,480
they're more puzzled than they want to

2935
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:50,238
admit to us which like

2936
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:51,919
i'm okay with that actually they

2937
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:53,439
shouldn't just be out panicking people

2938
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,880
in the streets

2939
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:57,118
but at the end of the day it's a bit

2940
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,639
like approving the astrazeneca vaccine

2941
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:00,000
yeah like which does work and they

2942
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:01,600
haven't approved it like when are they

2943
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,880
going to do it like when is

2944
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,480
our government actually if only

2945
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:08,000
internally

2946
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:09,599
going to take this more than just

2947
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,719
seriously but like take it truly

2948
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,480
seriously yeah

2949
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:14,880
and i just don't know if we have that

2950
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:17,198
capability kind of mentally

2951
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,520
to sound like eric weinstein for another

2952
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:19,519
moment

2953
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:24,960
to stay on the same topic although on

2954
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:27,039
the surface shifting completely

2955
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:29,840
because it is all the same topic you

2956
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:32,960
have written and studied art

2957
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:33,760
why do you think we humans um long to

2958
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:36,239
create

2959
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:37,840
art human society in general and just

2960
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:39,839
the human mind

2961
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,039
well most of us don't really long to

2962
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,079
create art right

2963
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:44,880
i would start with that point you think

2964
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:46,319
so

2965
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,239
do you think that's the create i don't

2966
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:50,559
know that's the unique weirdness of

2967
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:52,319
some particular humans i think i don't

2968
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,719
know 10 percent of humans

2969
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:55,840
roughly which is a lot but it is

2970
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:58,880
somewhat weird

2971
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:00,000
yeah i don't aspire to create art you

2972
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,760
could say

2973
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,840
like writing non-fiction there's

2974
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:07,679
something art-like about it but

2975
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:07,679
it's a different urge i would say yeah

2976
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:14,399
so why do some people have it i think

2977
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:15,198
human brains are very different it's a

2978
01:39:14,399 --> 01:39:17,118
different

2979
01:39:15,198 --> 01:39:19,359
notion of working through a problem like

2980
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:21,839
you and i enjoy working through

2981
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:24,079
analytic problems for me economics for

2982
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,520
uai in other areas or your humanities

2983
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:28,559
podcast

2984
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,840
but that's fun yeah for that problem to

2985
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,920
be visual

2986
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:34,800
and linked to physical materials and

2987
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:37,760
putting those like on a canvas

2988
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,320
to me it's not a huge leap but i really

2989
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,800
don't

2990
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:42,479
want to do it like it would be pain if

2991
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,920
you paid me

2992
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:49,039
like 500 bucks to spend an hour painting

2993
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,920
i don't know uh is that worth it maybe

2994
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:53,439
but

2995
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:55,359
like i'm happy when that hour's over

2996
01:39:53,439 --> 01:39:57,519
and would not be proud or happy with the

2997
01:39:55,359 --> 01:40:00,079
results it would suck

2998
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:01,440
i don't think i would do it actually i i

2999
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:02,479
do you think you're suppressing some

3000
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:06,000
deep

3001
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:07,519
i mean absolutely not now when i was

3002
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,079
young i played the guitars you played

3003
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,840
the guitar

3004
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:11,359
and that i greatly enjoyed although i

3005
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:14,000
was never good

3006
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:14,639
but it helped me appreciate music much

3007
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,079
much more

3008
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:17,440
well this is the question okay so from

3009
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:18,800
the perspective of the observer and

3010
01:40:17,439 --> 01:40:21,839
appreciator of art

3011
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,079
you said good is is there such a concept

3012
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:25,279
as

3013
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:26,158
good in art there's clearly a concept of

3014
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:29,439
bad

3015
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:31,198
my guitar playing fit that concept

3016
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:33,439
okay but i wasn't trying to be good i

3017
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:35,678
wanted to learn like how the chords work

3018
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:37,599
okay and it was a jazz improvisation

3019
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:39,359
work how is blues different

3020
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,960
classical guitar sort of physically how

3021
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:43,439
do you make those sounds yes

3022
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:44,639
and i did learn those things and you can

3023
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:45,759
you can't learn everything about them

3024
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,960
but you can learn a lot about them

3025
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,800
without ever being good

3026
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,960
or even trying to be that good but i

3027
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:53,440
could play all the notes

3028
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,198
so from the observer perspective what do

3029
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:57,039
you

3030
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:58,719
apologize to the absurd question but

3031
01:40:57,039 --> 01:40:59,279
what do you use the most beautiful and

3032
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,079
maybe

3033
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:03,279
moving piece of art you've encountered

3034
01:41:02,079 --> 01:41:05,920
in your life

3035
01:41:03,279 --> 01:41:09,039
not an absurd question at all and i

3036
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:12,560
think about this quite a bit

3037
01:41:09,039 --> 01:41:14,960
i would say the two winners by a clear

3038
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:17,760
margin are both by michelangelo

3039
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:19,679
it's the pieta in the vatican and the

3040
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:22,400
david statue

3041
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:23,440
in florence why historical context or

3042
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:25,439
just purity

3043
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:26,799
the the the creation itself i don't

3044
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:28,879
think you can view it apart from

3045
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:30,159
historical context and being in florence

3046
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,319
or in the vatican

3047
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:33,679
is that you're already primed for a lot

3048
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:36,559
right you can't

3049
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:37,679
pull that out but just technically how

3050
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:40,960
they express you

3051
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:42,000
the emotion of human form i do honestly

3052
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,079
intellectually think

3053
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,039
they're the two greatest artworks for

3054
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:46,960
doing that

3055
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:48,479
that's not all that art does not all art

3056
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:51,439
is about the human form

3057
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:52,718
but they are phenomenal and i think

3058
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,039
critical opinion

3059
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:57,118
not that everyone agrees but my view is

3060
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:58,479
not considered a crazy one

3061
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:00,719
within the broader court of critical

3062
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:02,718
opinion now in painting

3063
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:04,800
i think the most i was ever blown away

3064
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:07,118
was to see vermeer's

3065
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,800
artwork it's called the art of painting

3066
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:11,359
and it's in vienna

3067
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:14,159
in the queen's distortious museum and i

3068
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:16,559
saw that i think i was 23.

3069
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:17,679
uh it just stunned me because i've seen

3070
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,440
reproductions

3071
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:20,800
but live in front of you in huge a

3072
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:24,479
completely different artwork

3073
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:26,159
and again vienna primed yes

3074
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:28,000
and i was living abroad for the first

3075
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:30,079
time in vienna itself the city

3076
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,198
and so on now unlike the michelangelo's

3077
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:33,840
that is not my current

3078
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:35,359
favorite painting but that would be like

3079
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,279
historically the one i would pick

3080
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:39,599
what do you make in the context of those

3081
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:43,039
choices what do you make of modern art

3082
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:43,840
and uh i apologize if not if i'm not

3083
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:47,198
using the correct

3084
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:50,800
terminology but art that maybe uh

3085
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:51,118
is goes another level of weird outside

3086
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,800
of

3087
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:54,559
uh the art that you've kind of mentioned

3088
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,520
it breaks all the conventions and rules

3089
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:58,719
and so on

3090
01:42:55,520 --> 01:43:01,840
and becomes uh something else

3091
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:04,079
entirely that doesn't make sense in

3092
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:06,000
in the same way that david might i think

3093
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:07,760
a lot of it is phenomenal and i would

3094
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
say the single biggest mistake that

3095
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:12,719
really smart people make

3096
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,600
is to think contemporary art or music

3097
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:16,000
for that matter

3098
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:17,600
it's just a load of junk or rubbish it's

3099
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,639
just like a kind of mathematics they

3100
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,039
haven't learned yet

3101
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:23,118
it's really hard to learn maybe some

3102
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:25,359
people can never learn it

3103
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:27,519
but there's a very large community of

3104
01:43:25,359 --> 01:43:29,118
super smart well-educated people

3105
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,960
who spend their lives with it who love

3106
01:43:29,118 --> 01:43:32,399
it those are genuine pleasures they

3107
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,079
understand it they talk about it with

3108
01:43:32,399 --> 01:43:35,439
the common language

3109
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:37,359
and to think that somehow they're all

3110
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:39,839
frauds it just isn't true

3111
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:41,359
like one doesn't have to like it oneself

3112
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,159
just like puff house may or may not be

3113
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:44,559
your thing

3114
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:45,679
but it is amazing and for me personally

3115
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,400
highly rewarding

3116
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:49,920
and if someone doesn't get it i do kind

3117
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:51,439
of have the conceited response of

3118
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:54,079
thinking like in that area

3119
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:54,559
i'm just smarter than you are you yeah

3120
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:56,880
so the

3121
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,560
the interesting thing is as with most we

3122
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:00,880
get back to eric weinstein again

3123
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:02,080
yes who is in general smarter than i am

3124
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:03,840
yes i get

3125
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:05,920
but when it comes to contemporary

3126
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:06,639
artistic creations i'm smarter than he

3127
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,800
is

3128
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:10,079
so he's not a fan of contemporary art i

3129
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:12,480
don't want to speak for him

3130
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:13,679
i've heard him say he's revolving always

3131
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:15,279
he's evolving always

3132
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:16,960
i've heard him say derogatory things

3133
01:44:15,279 --> 01:44:18,639
about some of it doesn't mean he doesn't

3134
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,639
love some other parts of it

3135
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:22,159
so i i wonder if if there's just a

3136
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:23,600
higher learning curve

3137
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:26,158
a steeper learning curve for

3138
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,239
contemporary art meaning like

3139
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:29,759
it takes more work to to appreciate the

3140
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:30,559
stories the context from which they're

3141
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:33,280
like

3142
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:35,119
thinking about this work it feels like

3143
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:36,719
in order to appreciate the art

3144
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:38,238
uh contemporary certain piece of

3145
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:39,679
contemporary art you have to know the

3146
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:42,158
story better

3147
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:43,920
behind the art i think that's true for

3148
01:44:42,158 --> 01:44:45,359
many people but i think it's a funny

3149
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,719
shaped distribution

3150
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:49,359
because there's a whole other set of

3151
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:51,279
people sometimes just small children

3152
01:44:49,359 --> 01:44:55,039
and they get abstract art more easily

3153
01:44:51,279 --> 01:44:57,599
yeah you show them vermeer or rembrandt

3154
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:58,560
they don't get it yeah but just like a a

3155
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:01,760
wall of color

3156
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:03,280
yeah they're in love with it so yeah i

3157
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,800
don't think i know the full story again

3158
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:06,639
some strange kind of distribution the

3159
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,679
entry barriers are super high or super

3160
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:11,039
low

3161
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:13,118
but not that often in between

3162
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:14,639
but you were challenged saying that

3163
01:45:13,118 --> 01:45:16,158
there's a lot to be explored in

3164
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:19,600
contemporary art is just

3165
01:45:16,158 --> 01:45:21,839
you need to uh you need to

3166
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:23,920
learn yeah it's one of the most profound

3167
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,719
bodies of human thought out there

3168
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:27,920
and it's part of the humanities and yes

3169
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:30,399
there are people who also don't like

3170
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:33,600
podcasts right

3171
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:36,158
and that's fine yeah you've also

3172
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:37,440
been a scholar of food we're just going

3173
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:38,319
through the entirety of the human

3174
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:42,399
experience today

3175
01:45:38,319 --> 01:45:44,559
on this humanities podcast uh

3176
01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:46,319
another sort absurd question say this

3177
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:47,600
conversation is the last thing you ever

3178
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:49,519
do in your life i

3179
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,639
wearing the suit would murder you at the

3180
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:52,800
end of the conversation

3181
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:54,400
so this is your last day on earth but i

3182
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:57,679
would offer you a last meal

3183
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:58,079
what would that meal contain we can also

3184
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:59,679
travel

3185
01:45:58,079 --> 01:46:01,359
to other parts of the world bro we have

3186
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:03,760
to travel because yeah

3187
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:05,679
my preferred last meal here i probably

3188
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:08,400
had like two nights ago

3189
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:09,920
which is what can you describe or not

3190
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:11,279
the best restaurant around here is

3191
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:14,158
called mama chang's

3192
01:46:11,279 --> 01:46:14,719
and it's in fairfax and it's food from

3193
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:17,759
muhan

3194
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:19,439
actually and they take pandemic safety

3195
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,440
seriously in addition to the food being

3196
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:23,678
very good

3197
01:46:21,439 --> 01:46:25,279
but this is what i would do i would fly

3198
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:28,000
to hermosillo

3199
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:30,399
in northern mexico which has some of the

3200
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,840
best food in mexico but i sadly only had

3201
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:34,960
two days there

3202
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:37,520
so somewhere like oaxaca puebla

3203
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:39,039
i think they have food just as good or

3204
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,000
some people would say better but i've

3205
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:42,960
spent a lot of time

3206
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,238
in those places so the scarce wait is it

3207
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,279
possible the scarcity of time

3208
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:46,959
contributed to the

3209
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:48,719
the richness of the experience of course

3210
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,600
but the point is that scarcity still

3211
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:51,920
holds

3212
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:53,280
yeah so i want one more dose yes the

3213
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:55,679
food from hammocio

3214
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:57,279
can we describe what the food is it's

3215
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:59,118
the one kind of mexican food that at

3216
01:46:57,279 --> 01:47:00,559
least nominally is just like the mexican

3217
01:46:59,118 --> 01:47:02,799
food you get in the u.s

3218
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:05,199
so there are burritos there's fajitas it

3219
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:07,279
doesn't taste at all like our stuff

3220
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:09,599
but again nominally it's the part of

3221
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:11,840
mexican food that made it into the u.s

3222
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:14,239
was then transformed yes but it's in a

3223
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:15,679
way the most familiar

3224
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:17,359
but for that reason it's the most

3225
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:18,880
radical because you have to rethink

3226
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:20,960
all these things you know and they're

3227
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,639
way better in harmony

3228
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,639
hardly any tourists go there like

3229
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:27,039
there's nothing to see in hermes

3230
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:29,118
nothing to do other than eat it's not

3231
01:47:27,039 --> 01:47:31,600
ruined by any outsiders

3232
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:32,880
it's this long-standing tradition uh

3233
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,560
dirt cheap

3234
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:36,159
and the thing to do there is just sweet

3235
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:38,719
talk a taxi driver

3236
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:40,158
into first taking you seriously and then

3237
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:42,239
trusting you enough

3238
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:44,719
to know that you trust him to bring you

3239
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:49,759
to the very best like food stands

3240
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:53,359
so where's the where's the magic of that

3241
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:55,440
similar uh entity of the burrito

3242
01:47:53,359 --> 01:47:57,279
where's the magic come from what is it

3243
01:47:55,439 --> 01:47:58,559
is it the taxi ride is it the whole

3244
01:47:57,279 --> 01:47:59,920
experience or is there something

3245
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,840
actually in the food

3246
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,000
well you can break the food down part by

3247
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:04,719
part so if you think of the beef the

3248
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,439
beef there

3249
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:08,960
will be dry aged just out in the air in

3250
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:11,439
a way the fda here

3251
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:14,319
would never permit like they dry age it

3252
01:48:11,439 --> 01:48:16,638
till it turns green but it is phenomenal

3253
01:48:14,319 --> 01:48:18,158
the quality of the chilies so here

3254
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,600
there's only a small number of kinds of

3255
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:22,000
jellies you can get

3256
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:24,000
in most parts of mexico there's quite a

3257
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,158
large number of chilies you can get

3258
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,760
they're different they're fresher but

3259
01:48:26,158 --> 01:48:31,599
it's just like a different thing

3260
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:34,000
the chilies the wheat

3261
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:36,960
used so this is wheat territory not corn

3262
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,039
territory which is itself interesting

3263
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,039
uh the wheat is more diverse and more

3264
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:42,158
complex here it's more homogenized

3265
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:45,760
obviously cheaper

3266
01:48:42,158 --> 01:48:48,638
more efficient but there it is better

3267
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,079
non-pasteurized cheeses are legal in all

3268
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:51,760
parts of mexico

3269
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:53,920
and they can be white and gooey and

3270
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,440
amazing in a way that here again it's

3271
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,880
just against the law

3272
01:48:55,439 --> 01:48:58,079
you could legalize them the demand

3273
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,239
wouldn't be that great there's a black

3274
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:01,439
market in these jesus that latino

3275
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:03,279
groceries around here

3276
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:04,879
but you just can't get that much of it

3277
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:08,000
so the cheese the meat

3278
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:09,118
the wheat uh all different in

3279
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,079
significant ways

3280
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:13,039
the chilis i don't think the onions

3281
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:14,800
really matter much

3282
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:16,560
garlic i don't know i wouldn't put much

3283
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,639
stock in that

3284
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,920
but that's a lot of the core food and

3285
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:22,560
then it's cooked much better

3286
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:25,118
and everything's super fresh the food

3287
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,880
chain is not relying on refrigeration

3288
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:28,559
and this is one thing russia and us have

3289
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,239
in common

3290
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,480
we were early pioneers in food

3291
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:34,079
refrigeration and that made a lot of our

3292
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:35,839
foods worse quite early

3293
01:49:34,079 --> 01:49:37,118
and it took us a long time to dig out of

3294
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:40,319
that

3295
01:49:37,118 --> 01:49:41,920
because big countries right is there

3296
01:49:40,319 --> 01:49:44,079
you've had an extensive rail system in

3297
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,920
russia ussr a long time

3298
01:49:44,079 --> 01:49:47,439
which makes it easier to freeze and then

3299
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:49,679
ship

3300
01:49:47,439 --> 01:49:50,479
what about the actual cooking the the

3301
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:53,599
chef

3302
01:49:50,479 --> 01:49:56,399
is there an artistry to the simple

3303
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:56,960
i hesitate to call the burrito simple

3304
01:49:56,399 --> 01:49:58,238
but

3305
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:01,039
and there's no brain drain out of

3306
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:02,638
cooking so if you're

3307
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:04,319
in the united states and you're very

3308
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:06,639
talented i'm not saying there aren't

3309
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:08,158
talented chefs of course there are

3310
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:10,480
but there's so many other things to pull

3311
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:12,559
people away yeah but in mexico there's

3312
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:13,919
so much talent going into food as there

3313
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:15,280
is in china

3314
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,279
which would be another candidate for

3315
01:50:15,279 --> 01:50:20,319
last meal christians

3316
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:22,719
or india or oh india don't let's not

3317
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:24,399
even get started unbelievable

3318
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:25,439
uh you've also i mean there's a million

3319
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:26,960
things we could talk about here but

3320
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:28,079
you've written about giro dreams of

3321
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,480
sushi

3322
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:31,679
um it's just a really clean good example

3323
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:35,678
that people are aware of

3324
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:39,279
of mastery in the

3325
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:40,399
in the art of the simple in food

3326
01:50:39,279 --> 01:50:43,118
what do you make of that kind of

3327
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:45,519
obsessive pursuit of perfection in

3328
01:50:43,118 --> 01:50:46,559
in in creating simple food sushi is

3329
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,000
about perfection

3330
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:49,760
but it's a bit like the beatles white

3331
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,760
album which people think is simple

3332
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:52,960
and not overproduced yeah it's in a

3333
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,880
funny way their most

3334
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:57,118
over produced album but it's produced

3335
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:59,118
just perfectly it sounds simple

3336
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:00,719
it's really hard to produce music to the

3337
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:01,359
point where it's going to sound so

3338
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:03,920
simple

3339
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:05,039
and not sound like sludge like let it be

3340
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:06,480
album

3341
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:08,800
has some great songs but a lot of it

3342
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:11,598
sounds like sledge one after 909

3343
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,800
that's sludge i dig a pony sludge like

3344
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:14,400
it's a bit interesting

3345
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:17,199
it's not that good it doesn't sound that

3346
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:18,000
good white album like the best half like

3347
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:20,479
dear prudence

3348
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,039
sounds perfect sounds simple cry baby

3349
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:23,839
cry

3350
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:25,039
it's not simple back in the ussr super

3351
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:28,000
complex

3352
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:29,519
so sushi's like that it's because it's

3353
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,479
so incredibly not simple

3354
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:34,239
starting with the rice you try to refine

3355
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:36,879
it to make it appear super simple

3356
01:51:34,238 --> 01:51:37,439
and that's the most complex thing of all

3357
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:40,800
so

3358
01:51:37,439 --> 01:51:41,678
do you admire i mean we're not talking

3359
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:44,480
about

3360
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:45,440
days weeks months we're talking about

3361
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:47,678
years

3362
01:51:45,439 --> 01:51:49,118
generations of doing the same thing over

3363
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:50,800
and over and over again

3364
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:52,559
do you admire that kind of sticking to

3365
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:54,560
the it does that

3366
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:55,840
you know we talked about our admiration

3367
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:58,560
of the weird

3368
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:59,440
that doesn't feel weird that seems like

3369
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:03,440
discipline

3370
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:05,279
and dedication to like like a stoic

3371
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:07,198
minimalism or something like that i'm

3372
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:07,759
happy they do it but i actually feel bad

3373
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:10,638
about it

3374
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:12,400
i feel they're sacrificial victims to me

3375
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:14,800
which i benefit from

3376
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:16,158
but don't you ever think like gee you're

3377
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:18,639
a great master

3378
01:52:16,158 --> 01:52:20,879
sushi chef wouldn't you be happier if

3379
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:24,000
you did something else

3380
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:26,159
uh doesn't seem to happen that might be

3381
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,039
something that a weird mind maybe it is

3382
01:52:26,158 --> 01:52:29,759
weird people

3383
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:31,359
and maybe they're really enjoying it but

3384
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:33,280
like to learn how to

3385
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:35,039
pack rice for 10 years before they let

3386
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:36,960
you do anything else

3387
01:52:35,039 --> 01:52:38,719
it's like these indian you know sarod

3388
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:40,239
players they just spent five years

3389
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:41,679
tapping out rhythms

3390
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:43,359
before they're allowed to touch their

3391
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:46,239
instruments

3392
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:48,319
well actually to to defend that it's

3393
01:52:46,238 --> 01:52:51,598
kind of like graduate school right

3394
01:52:48,319 --> 01:52:55,039
well i think graduate school perhaps

3395
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:57,679
i um graduate school is full of like

3396
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:58,800
every single day is full of surprises i

3397
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:01,760
would say

3398
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:03,199
uh i i did martial arts for a long time

3399
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:04,639
i do martial arts

3400
01:53:03,198 --> 01:53:06,799
and i've always loved kind of the

3401
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:09,359
russian way of drilling

3402
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,920
is doing the same technique i don't know

3403
01:53:09,359 --> 01:53:12,559
if this

3404
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,319
applies in into intellectual or academic

3405
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:16,880
disciplines where you can do the same

3406
01:53:14,319 --> 01:53:18,799
thing over and over and over again

3407
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:19,840
thousands and thousands and thousands of

3408
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:22,719
times

3409
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:23,520
what i've discovered through that

3410
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:25,920
process

3411
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:28,080
is you get to start to appreciate the

3412
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:29,039
tiniest of details and find the beauty

3413
01:53:28,079 --> 01:53:31,359
in them

3414
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:33,198
uh people who go to like monasteries to

3415
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:35,598
meditate talk about this

3416
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:37,279
is when you just sit in silence and

3417
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:40,079
don't do anything

3418
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:42,000
you start to appreciate how much

3419
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:43,679
complexity and beauty there isn't just a

3420
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,960
movement of a finger like you can spend

3421
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:48,079
the whole day

3422
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:49,439
joyously thinking about how fun it is to

3423
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:52,238
move a finger

3424
01:53:49,439 --> 01:53:53,118
yeah and so and then you can almost

3425
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:55,598
become

3426
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:56,719
your full weird self about the tiniest

3427
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:57,840
details of life

3428
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:59,760
that's the thing you've got to wonder

3429
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:01,760
like is there a free lunch in there are

3430
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:04,880
the rest of us moving around too much

3431
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:06,639
yeah exactly that's they sure

3432
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,039
feel like they found a free lunch the

3433
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:11,760
people meditate they're on to something

3434
01:54:09,039 --> 01:54:13,439
i tend to think it's like artists that

3435
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:14,560
some percent of people are like that but

3436
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:16,638
most are not

3437
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:18,320
and for most of us there's no free lunch

3438
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:18,960
like my free lunch is to move around a

3439
01:54:18,319 --> 01:54:22,719
lot

3440
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:24,399
in search of lunch well you with all the

3441
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:27,520
food talk you made me hungry uh

3442
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:30,399
what uh what books

3443
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:31,920
three or so books if you can come if any

3444
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:33,359
come to mind technical fiction

3445
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:36,399
philosophical

3446
01:54:33,359 --> 01:54:37,198
would you recommend had a big impact on

3447
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:38,960
you

3448
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:40,238
or you just drew some insights from

3449
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:42,239
throughout your life

3450
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:44,559
well two of them we've already discussed

3451
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:46,158
one is plato's dialogues

3452
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:49,360
which i started reading when i was like

3453
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:50,879
13. another is iran capitalism the

3454
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:53,279
unknown ideal

3455
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:56,079
but i would say the friedrich hayek

3456
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:57,759
essay the use of knowledge in society

3457
01:54:56,079 --> 01:54:59,679
which is about how decentralized

3458
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:00,880
mechanisms can work also why they might

3459
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:03,199
go wrong

3460
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:05,039
and that's where you start to understand

3461
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:06,158
price system capitalism

3462
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:08,238
and that was in a book called

3463
01:55:06,158 --> 01:55:10,399
individualism and economic order but

3464
01:55:08,238 --> 01:55:12,559
it was just a few essays in that book

3465
01:55:10,399 --> 01:55:14,479
those are maybe the three i would cite

3466
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,239
can you elaborate a little bit on the

3467
01:55:14,479 --> 01:55:17,279
say the price of copper goes up right

3468
01:55:16,238 --> 01:55:19,279
because there's a

3469
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:20,479
problem with the copper mine in chile or

3470
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:22,000
bolivia

3471
01:55:20,479 --> 01:55:23,439
so the price of copper goes up all

3472
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,719
around the world people are led to

3473
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:26,799
economize copper

3474
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:28,719
to look for substitutes for copper to

3475
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,480
change their production processes

3476
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:32,079
to change the goods and services they

3477
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:36,238
buy to build homes a different

3478
01:55:32,079 --> 01:55:38,479
way and this one event creates this one

3479
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:39,678
tiny change in information this gets

3480
01:55:38,479 --> 01:55:42,479
into your ai work

3481
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:43,599
very directly and how much complexity

3482
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:47,118
that one change

3483
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:49,039
engenders in a meaningful coherent way

3484
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:50,719
how the different pieces of the price

3485
01:55:49,039 --> 01:55:53,840
system fit together

3486
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:56,639
hayek really laid out very clearly

3487
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:57,039
and it's it's like an ai problem and how

3488
01:55:56,639 --> 01:55:58,719
well

3489
01:55:57,039 --> 01:56:00,800
not for everything but for many things

3490
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:03,359
we solve that ai problem

3491
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,719
i learned i was i think 13 maybe 14 when

3492
01:56:03,359 --> 01:56:06,399
i read hayek

3493
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:08,560
you're the distributed nature of things

3494
01:56:06,399 --> 01:56:10,479
there and it's like your work on human

3495
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:13,679
attention like how much can we take in

3496
01:56:10,479 --> 01:56:15,598
yes very often not that much

3497
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:17,920
and how many of the advances of modern

3498
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:19,360
civilization you need to understand as a

3499
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:21,440
response to that constraint

3500
01:56:19,359 --> 01:56:23,598
i got that also from hayek and what's

3501
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:25,519
the title of the book again

3502
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:27,119
uh it's reprinted in a lot of books at

3503
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,520
this point but back then the book was

3504
01:56:27,118 --> 01:56:30,719
called

3505
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,679
individualism and economic order but the

3506
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:34,560
essays online

3507
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:36,399
hayek use of knowledge in society there

3508
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:37,199
are open access versions of it through

3509
01:56:36,399 --> 01:56:39,118
google

3510
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:42,079
and you don't need the whole book so

3511
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:45,198
it's a very good book

3512
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:46,000
again one of those profound looking over

3513
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:48,238
the ocean

3514
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,158
maybe sitting on a porch maybe with a

3515
01:56:48,238 --> 01:56:54,000
drink of some kind

3516
01:56:50,158 --> 01:56:56,559
um and a young kid comes by and asks you

3517
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,399
for advice what advice would you give to

3518
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:01,520
drink that's my advice

3519
01:56:58,399 --> 01:57:04,638
i'm serious so

3520
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:08,320
okay after that

3521
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:10,800
uh what uh advice would you give to a

3522
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:14,799
young person today as they take on life

3523
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:15,279
whether career in academia in general or

3524
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,599
just

3525
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:19,279
a life which is probably more important

3526
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:22,000
than career

3527
01:57:19,279 --> 01:57:24,399
most good advice is context specific but

3528
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:27,439
here are my two generic pieces of advice

3529
01:57:24,399 --> 01:57:28,960
good first get a mentor both

3530
01:57:27,439 --> 01:57:30,000
career but anything you want to learn

3531
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,439
like say you want to learn about

3532
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,679
contemporary art

3533
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:35,198
people write me this uh what book should

3534
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:36,399
i read it's

3535
01:57:35,198 --> 01:57:37,839
probably not going to work that way you

3536
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:38,960
need a mentor yes you should read some

3537
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:40,480
books on it

3538
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:42,319
but you want to mentor to help you frame

3539
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:44,399
them take you around to some art

3540
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:45,920
talk about it with you so get as many

3541
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:47,519
mentors as you can in the things you

3542
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:50,079
want to learn

3543
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:52,400
and then can ask you a quick yeah a

3544
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:55,198
tangent on that uh

3545
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:55,519
presumably a good mentor of course is

3546
01:57:55,198 --> 01:57:57,759
there

3547
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:59,040
begging the question in there it's

3548
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,800
complicated right

3549
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:03,198
well it is complicated is there a lot of

3550
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:04,560
damage to be done from a bad mentor

3551
01:58:03,198 --> 01:58:06,319
i don't think that much because it's

3552
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:07,760
very easy to drop mentors and in fact

3553
01:58:06,319 --> 01:58:09,759
it's quite hard to maintain them

3554
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:11,360
good mentors tend to be busy head

3555
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:14,159
mentors tend to be busy

3556
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:15,679
yeah and you can try on mentors and

3557
01:58:14,158 --> 01:58:16,079
maybe they're not good for you but you

3558
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:17,279
still

3559
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:19,279
there's a good chance you'll learn

3560
01:58:17,279 --> 01:58:20,960
something

3561
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:22,479
like i had a mentor i was an undergrad

3562
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,079
he was a stalinist

3563
01:58:22,479 --> 01:58:25,519
he edited the book called the essential

3564
01:58:24,079 --> 01:58:28,079
stalin brilliant guy

3565
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:30,159
i learned a tremendous amount from him

3566
01:58:28,079 --> 01:58:30,559
was he like as a stalinist a good mentor

3567
01:58:30,158 --> 01:58:33,118
for me

3568
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:35,840
fan of fayak well no but for a year it

3569
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:35,839
was tremendous

3570
01:58:36,158 --> 01:58:41,118
hmm yeah he introduced me like to you

3571
01:58:39,439 --> 01:58:41,598
know soviet in eastern european science

3572
01:58:41,118 --> 01:58:43,759
fiction

3573
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:45,279
because he was a marxist like that's

3574
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:47,520
what i took from him among other things

3575
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:51,039
any advice on finding a good mentor

3576
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:52,719
daniel kahneman has

3577
01:58:51,039 --> 01:58:54,238
somebody just popped this to mind as

3578
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:55,599
somebody who was able to find

3579
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:58,319
exceptionally good collaborators

3580
01:58:55,599 --> 01:59:00,239
throughout his life there's not many

3581
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:02,319
bright minds that find collaborators

3582
01:59:00,238 --> 01:59:05,678
they often

3583
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:06,319
um which i ultimately see what a mentor

3584
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:10,000
is

3585
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:11,840
yeah be direct and try

3586
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,520
it's not like a perfect formula but it's

3587
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,239
amazing how many people don't even do

3588
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:17,360
those things

3589
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:19,039
be interesting be direct and try

3590
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:21,359
like what you want from a better known

3591
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:22,158
person i would just say be very direct

3592
01:59:21,359 --> 01:59:25,118
with them

3593
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:26,479
yeah beautiful what's the second piece

3594
01:59:25,118 --> 01:59:29,519
of advice

3595
01:59:26,479 --> 01:59:31,359
build small groups of peers they don't

3596
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:32,239
have to be your age but very often

3597
01:59:31,359 --> 01:59:33,920
they'll be your age

3598
01:59:32,238 --> 01:59:35,678
especially if you're younger with

3599
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:37,118
broadly similar interests but there can

3600
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:39,199
be different points of view

3601
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:41,598
people you hang out with which can

3602
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:43,759
include in a whatsapp group online

3603
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:45,679
and like every day or almost every day

3604
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:46,079
they're talking about the thing you care

3605
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:48,639
about

3606
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:50,079
trying to solve problems in that thing

3607
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:51,760
and that's your small group and you

3608
01:59:50,079 --> 01:59:53,760
really like them and they like you and

3609
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:56,079
you care what you think about each other

3610
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:57,679
and you have this common interest that's

3611
01:59:56,079 --> 01:59:58,719
for human connection or that's for

3612
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:01,279
development of ideas

3613
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:03,279
it's both they're not that different

3614
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:06,399
like beatles classic small group

3615
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:08,079
right uh but there's so much drama

3616
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:09,920
the florentine artists of course there's

3617
02:00:08,079 --> 02:00:11,279
drama and small groups tend to split up

3618
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:14,239
which is fine just like

3619
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:15,679
mentoring relationships often end but

3620
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:17,198
it's remarkable

3621
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:19,840
how little has been done that was not

3622
02:00:17,198 --> 02:00:23,519
done in small groups in some way

3623
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:26,480
so speaking of uh loss

3624
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:28,400
of a beautiful relationships what do you

3625
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:31,598
make of this whole love thing

3626
02:00:28,399 --> 02:00:34,559
uh why do humans fall in love

3627
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:37,360
what's the role of love friendship

3628
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:39,199
family in life

3629
02:00:37,359 --> 02:00:41,439
in a successful life or just life in

3630
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:42,000
general why the hell are we so into this

3631
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:43,439
thing

3632
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,279
there are multiple layers of

3633
02:00:43,439 --> 02:00:48,319
understanding that question so kind of

3634
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:50,800
the lowest layer is the darwinian answer

3635
02:00:48,319 --> 02:00:52,559
right if we weren't this way we wouldn't

3636
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:54,320
have been successful in reproducing and

3637
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:56,639
building alliances

3638
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:57,519
it's important to realize that's far

3639
02:00:56,639 --> 02:00:59,199
from complete

3640
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:01,040
sort of the highest understanding would

3641
02:00:59,198 --> 02:01:03,359
be poetic like read john keats

3642
02:01:01,039 --> 02:01:05,599
or you know many other love powers is

3643
02:01:03,359 --> 02:01:07,679
that so who do i go to to find out to

3644
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:10,400
learn about love in terms of poets

3645
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:11,359
or i would say start with john keats but

3646
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:14,399
given that you're

3647
02:01:11,359 --> 02:01:16,158
fluent in russian um yeah let's go let's

3648
02:01:14,399 --> 02:01:16,719
go russian literature for a second like

3649
02:01:16,158 --> 02:01:19,279
what what

3650
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:21,279
what you you keep mentioning russia what

3651
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:24,960
uh what's your connection

3652
02:01:21,279 --> 02:01:26,719
what's your love uh in russia

3653
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:29,198
well first it's all interesting but more

3654
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:33,198
concretely my wife was born in moscow

3655
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:34,079
sokolniki wow yeah wow and she grew up

3656
02:01:33,198 --> 02:01:37,678
there

3657
02:01:34,079 --> 02:01:39,279
i married her here uh my daughter i

3658
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:41,199
adopted her i'm not her biological

3659
02:01:39,279 --> 02:01:42,960
father but i genuinely raised her

3660
02:01:41,198 --> 02:01:44,319
she was born in russia though she came

3661
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:46,639
here when she was one

3662
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:50,158
wow uh my father you're basically

3663
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:51,840
russian no no no i'm a new jersey boy uh

3664
02:01:50,158 --> 02:01:53,519
that's the same thing i'm very sorry to

3665
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:54,719
report my father-in-law passed away a

3666
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:57,760
week ago

3667
02:01:54,719 --> 02:02:01,520
he lived with us for six years he

3668
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:04,320
lived in russia until he was oh seventy

3669
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:05,760
saw you know the stalinist era his

3670
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:08,399
father was brought to a camp

3671
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:09,039
lived through world war ii much much

3672
02:02:08,399 --> 02:02:12,399
more

3673
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:14,399
uh had an incredible life never really

3674
02:02:12,399 --> 02:02:16,960
learned how to speak english

3675
02:02:14,399 --> 02:02:20,158
so i absorbed something russian from him

3676
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:22,079
as well he was part armenian

3677
02:02:20,158 --> 02:02:24,479
so that's my connection to russia a bit

3678
02:02:22,079 --> 02:02:25,920
of the russian soul too

3679
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:28,319
i don't think i have it i think i

3680
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,960
appreciate it but there's division of

3681
02:02:28,319 --> 02:02:32,000
labor right

3682
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:34,880
others in the family take care of that

3683
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,118
i'm i'm more superficial you mentioned

3684
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:39,679
keats and uh that higher version that

3685
02:02:37,118 --> 02:02:41,439
non darwinian love what's that about

3686
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:44,079
that it's the highest form of human

3687
02:02:41,439 --> 02:02:46,960
connection and it's intoxicating

3688
02:02:44,079 --> 02:02:47,920
and it's part of building a life and

3689
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:50,399
most of us

3690
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:52,560
are very very strongly drawn to it and

3691
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:54,559
it's part of the highest realization of

3692
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,920
you being what you can be

3693
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:59,760
yeah you mentioned you lost but ask a

3694
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:02,399
russian i mean this is a

3695
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:05,599
superficial new jersey boy who grew up

3696
02:03:02,399 --> 02:03:05,598
listening to bruce springsteen

3697
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:09,519
uh what's your favorite bruce

3698
02:03:08,319 --> 02:03:12,399
springsteen song

3699
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:14,320
i think the album born to run has

3700
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:15,439
actually held up the best though it's

3701
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:17,359
very fashionable

3702
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:18,799
to think the earlier or later works are

3703
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:20,960
actually better and that's the

3704
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:22,719
overproduced super pop album

3705
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:24,000
but the quality of the songs to be born

3706
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:26,000
to run is just

3707
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,118
far and away the best then darkness on

3708
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:30,319
the edge of town

3709
02:03:27,118 --> 02:03:33,920
yeah and those are still my favorites

3710
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:36,399
is an incredible song yeah and perfectly

3711
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:39,279
produced in a phil spector kind of way

3712
02:03:36,399 --> 02:03:40,000
every detail is right every lyric what

3713
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:42,559
else is on the

3714
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,319
album thunder road jungle land 10th

3715
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:47,520
avenue freeze out she's the one

3716
02:03:44,319 --> 02:03:48,799
unbelievable yeah yeah bruce leading

3717
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:53,119
across the river

3718
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:55,760
i really like um i mean i like when he

3719
02:03:53,118 --> 02:03:56,238
goes into love personally uh you know

3720
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:58,639
like

3721
02:03:56,238 --> 02:04:00,238
i'm on fire that's a very good song

3722
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:01,760
dancing in the dark and

3723
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:03,919
a lot of the later work i find the

3724
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:06,880
percussion becomes too simple

3725
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:08,000
and kind of too white somehow and a

3726
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:10,000
little clunky

3727
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,599
and it's still good work he's super

3728
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,719
talented but it doesn't

3729
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:15,840
speak to me but when it all bursts open

3730
02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:19,599
into the open road

3731
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:21,840
like it does on born to run that's magic

3732
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:23,360
yeah rosalita have you ever seen him

3733
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:27,039
live

3734
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:28,479
is it yes twice i wonder what he's like

3735
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:30,639
live when he was young right

3736
02:04:28,479 --> 02:04:32,479
those years i saw him live when he was

3737
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:34,880
young i was young

3738
02:04:32,479 --> 02:04:36,399
uh new jersey i was a little

3739
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:39,279
disappointed actually

3740
02:04:36,399 --> 02:04:41,039
yeah i think what i like best from him

3741
02:04:39,279 --> 02:04:42,800
is quite studio

3742
02:04:41,039 --> 02:04:44,880
he certainly played well i don't fault

3743
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:47,440
his performance but it's like when i saw

3744
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:48,800
plant and page you know fled zeppelin

3745
02:04:47,439 --> 02:04:50,238
tremendous creators

3746
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:52,000
and they showed up they were not drunk

3747
02:04:50,238 --> 02:04:54,399
like they were paying attention

3748
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,560
but i was underwhelmed because led

3749
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:58,399
zeppelin like the beatles white album

3750
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:59,599
is much more of a studio band than you

3751
02:04:58,399 --> 02:05:01,198
think it means

3752
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:03,279
and in the case of bruce springsteen i

3753
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:05,439
don't know about you but for me

3754
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:07,599
he's somebody that i connect with the

3755
02:05:05,439 --> 02:05:09,919
most when i got that when i'm alone

3756
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:10,960
and there's like a melancholy feeling

3757
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,760
and actually driving my

3758
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:14,719
my folks live in philly i went to school

3759
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:18,400
in philly

3760
02:05:14,719 --> 02:05:20,239
and so you know i've uh i i

3761
02:05:18,399 --> 02:05:22,000
almost worthy of new jersey then yeah

3762
02:05:20,238 --> 02:05:25,439
well you're

3763
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:27,760
you're almost worthy of russia so we're

3764
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:30,719
we can connect uh and then ask but i

3765
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:34,000
mean i love yours it's something

3766
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:36,000
i feel like um i feel like

3767
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,520
i don't know it's it's always there's

3768
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,639
this beautiful like there's a dying old

3769
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:43,040
goes diner they closed down i used to uh

3770
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:44,078
uh go there there's there's a melancholy

3771
02:05:43,039 --> 02:05:46,078
feeling to me i mean

3772
02:05:44,078 --> 02:05:47,599
of course a thickness to culture in that

3773
02:05:46,078 --> 02:05:49,759
part of the world yeah

3774
02:05:47,599 --> 02:05:51,360
which is oddly similar to some elements

3775
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:52,880
of the thickness of russian culture

3776
02:05:51,359 --> 02:05:55,439
yeah and when you see like russian

3777
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:56,960
characters on the sopranos yeah

3778
02:05:55,439 --> 02:05:59,359
it totally makes sense even though

3779
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:02,960
they're these complete outlines

3780
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:04,078
exactly it totally makes sense you've uh

3781
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:06,960
you mentioned you lost your

3782
02:06:04,078 --> 02:06:09,759
father-in-law last week

3783
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:10,800
uh do you think about mortality do you

3784
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:13,760
think about

3785
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:14,719
your own mortality are you afraid of

3786
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,719
death

3787
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:17,920
i don't think about my own mortality

3788
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:20,800
that much which is

3789
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:21,199
probably a good thing i think death will

3790
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:24,000
be

3791
02:06:21,198 --> 02:06:25,759
bad i wouldn't say i'm afraid of it for

3792
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,238
me the worst thing about death is not

3793
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:29,039
knowing

3794
02:06:26,238 --> 02:06:31,118
how the human story turns out the full

3795
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:32,719
human story the full human story so if i

3796
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:34,799
could right before i die

3797
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:36,319
read like a wikipedia page called the

3798
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:37,840
rest of human history

3799
02:06:36,319 --> 02:06:40,078
and have enough time just like a few

3800
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:43,119
days to absorb it think about it

3801
02:06:40,078 --> 02:06:44,719
and know like oh well 643 years from now

3802
02:06:43,118 --> 02:06:45,359
that's when all the atomic weapons went

3803
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:46,800
off and

3804
02:06:45,359 --> 02:06:51,359
here's what happened between now and

3805
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,360
then i would feel much better dying

3806
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,599
because that's not how it's going to be

3807
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:55,920
right that's unlikely it's almost like

3808
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:58,159
the

3809
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:59,679
hitchhiker's guide they kind of have

3810
02:06:58,158 --> 02:07:01,279
what is it they have a

3811
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:03,520
one or two sentence description of the

3812
02:07:01,279 --> 02:07:05,039
human of what goes on on earth

3813
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:06,239
it's kind of interesting to think if

3814
02:07:05,039 --> 02:07:07,920
there's a lot of intelligent

3815
02:07:06,238 --> 02:07:09,919
civilizations out there

3816
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:11,679
that in the big encyclopedia that

3817
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:12,560
describes the universe humans will only

3818
02:07:11,679 --> 02:07:15,359
have one

3819
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:17,199
sentence probably too true yeah that's

3820
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:20,000
the only one i can read and understand

3821
02:07:17,198 --> 02:07:21,678
right and it may be hard to understand

3822
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:26,319
the human one past

3823
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:27,679
a number of centuries yeah yes

3824
02:07:26,319 --> 02:07:29,840
like how many years from now will

3825
02:07:27,679 --> 02:07:30,880
reading wikipedia be like trying to read

3826
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:32,880
chaucer

3827
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:34,800
which i almost can do but i actually

3828
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:37,599
can't i need a translation

3829
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:39,360
probably you can't do it at all yeah i

3830
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:41,520
mean maybe reading will be outdated it

3831
02:07:39,359 --> 02:07:44,078
might be a very silly notion

3832
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:46,079
maybe we're fundamentally like we think

3833
02:07:44,078 --> 02:07:47,519
language is fundamental to cognition but

3834
02:07:46,078 --> 02:07:49,039
it could be something visual or

3835
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:51,199
something totally different exactly

3836
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:55,039
we'll plug in neural ink or

3837
02:07:51,198 --> 02:07:55,759
yeah uh but in that story that wikipedia

3838
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:58,639
article

3839
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:59,280
do you think there'll be a section on uh

3840
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:03,039
the

3841
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:04,639
meaning of it i hope not

3842
02:08:03,039 --> 02:08:06,399
because that section we could write now

3843
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:08,480
and it's just not going to be very good

3844
02:08:06,399 --> 02:08:10,399
right what would you put in the section

3845
02:08:08,479 --> 02:08:12,399
on the meaning of uh

3846
02:08:10,399 --> 02:08:15,359
human existence i don't know links to a

3847
02:08:12,399 --> 02:08:15,359
lot of other sections

3848
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:18,319
i don't think there are general

3849
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:19,760
statements about the meaning of life

3850
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:21,920
that have that much meaning

3851
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:23,840
i think if you study different cultures

3852
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:25,039
the arts travel mathematics like

3853
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:26,480
whatever your thing is

3854
02:08:25,039 --> 02:08:28,880
yeah you'll get a lot about the meaning

3855
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:30,479
of life so like it's there in wikipedia

3856
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:31,760
in some bigger sense

3857
02:08:30,479 --> 02:08:33,359
but i don't want to read the page on the

3858
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:34,159
meaning i bet they have such a page in

3859
02:08:33,359 --> 02:08:36,078
fact

3860
02:08:34,158 --> 02:08:37,920
the fact that i've never visited it none

3861
02:08:36,078 --> 02:08:39,198
of my friends oh here tyler here's the

3862
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:40,480
page on the meaning of life i know

3863
02:08:39,198 --> 02:08:41,439
you've been wondering about this you got

3864
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:43,279
to read this one

3865
02:08:41,439 --> 02:08:45,359
no one's ever done that to you have they

3866
02:08:43,279 --> 02:08:46,000
it probably has well actually gone to

3867
02:08:45,359 --> 02:08:48,839
that page

3868
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,880
it does in fact have a lot of links to

3869
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:53,520
others uh

3870
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:54,639
so that that's it uh the meaning of life

3871
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:58,560
is just

3872
02:08:54,639 --> 02:09:02,159
a bunch of self-referential or uh

3873
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:03,760
citation needed type of statements

3874
02:09:02,158 --> 02:09:06,319
i think there's no better way to end it

3875
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:09,039
tyler's a huge honor i'm a huge fan

3876
02:09:06,319 --> 02:09:10,479
um thank you so much for wasting all of

3877
02:09:09,039 --> 02:09:11,840
this time with me it was one of the

3878
02:09:10,479 --> 02:09:12,638
greatest conversations i've ever had

3879
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:14,480
thank you so much

3880
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:17,599
my pleasure and delighted to finally

3881
02:09:14,479 --> 02:09:18,638
