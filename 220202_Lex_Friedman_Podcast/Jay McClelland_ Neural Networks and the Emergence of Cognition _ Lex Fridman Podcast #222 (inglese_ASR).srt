00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,040
mcclelland a cognitive scientist at

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,559
stanford and one of the seminal figures

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,359
in the history of artificial

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:14,239
intelligence and specifically neural

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,480
networks having written the parallel

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,640
distributed processing book with david

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,519
rommelhart who co-authored the

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,839
backpropagation paper with jeff hinton

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,679
in their collaborations they've paved

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,439
the way for many of the ideas at the

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,160
center of the neural network-based

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,839
machine learning revolution of the past

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,000
15 years

this is the lex friedman podcast and

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,359
here is my conversation with jay

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,439
mcclelland

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,280
you are one of the seminal figures in

21
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,199
the history of neural networks

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
at the intersection of uh cognitive

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,520
psychology and computer science

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,760
what do you have over the decades

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,359
emerged as the most beautiful aspect

26
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,718
about neural networks

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,960
both artificial and biological

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,280
the fundamental thing i think about with

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,519
neural networks is how they allow us to

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,519
link

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,000
biology

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,320
with

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,079
the mysteries of thought and

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,279
um

35
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,200
you know in the

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,879
when i was first entering the field

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,640
myself in

38
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,640
the late 60s early 70s

39
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,359
cognitive psychology had just become a

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,920
field there was a book published in 67

41
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,000
called cognitive psychology

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,560
um

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,359
and the author said

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
that

45
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,478
you know the study of the nervous system

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,240
was only of peripheral interest it

47
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,239
wasn't going to tell us anything about

48
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,000
the mind

49
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,959
and i

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
didn't

51
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,239
agree with that i i always felt oh look

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,718
i'm i'm a physical

53
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,000
being i

54
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,959
from dust

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,599
to dust you know ashes to ashes and

56
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,640
somehow i emerged from that

57
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,159
um

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,639
so that's really interesting so there

59
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,759
was a sense with cognitive

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,000
psychology that

61
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,840
in understanding the sort of neuronal

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,919
structure of things you're not going to

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,319
be able to understand the mind

64
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,799
and then your senses if we study these

65
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,560
neural networks we might be able to get

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,120
at least very close to understanding the

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,598
fundamentals of the human mind yeah

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,840
i used to think um where i used to talk

69
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,479
about the idea of awakening from the

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,280
cartesian dream

71
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,280
so descartes

72
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,759
you know thought about these things

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,879
right

74
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,719
he

75
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,120
he was walking in the gardens of

76
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,719
versailles one day and he stepped on a

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,000
stone

78
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,680
and a statue moved

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,439
and he walked a little further stepped

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,920
on another stone and another statue

81
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,680
moved and he like

82
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,439
why did the statue move when i stepped

83
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,159
on the stone and he went and talked to

84
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,719
the gardeners and he found out that they

85
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,639
had a hydraulic system

86
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,639
that allowed

87
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,079
the physical contact with the stone to

88
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,919
cause water to flow in various

89
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,879
directions which caused water to flow

90
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,039
under the statue and move the statue

91
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,878
and he

92
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,840
used this as

93
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,679
the beginnings of a theory about how

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,000
animals

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
act

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
and

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
he had this notion that

98
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,599
these little fibers that people had

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
identified that weren't carrying the

100
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,119
blood

101
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,199
you know were these little hydraulic

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,640
tubes that if you touch something there

103
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,798
would be pressure and it would send a

104
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,639
signal of pressure to the

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,120
other parts of the system and that would

106
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,079
cause action

107
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,158
so he had a mechanistic theory of

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,640
animal behavior

109
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,840
and he thought that the human

110
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,839
had this animal

111
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,560
body but that some

112
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,799
divine something else had to have come

113
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,080
down and been placed in him

114
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,239
to give him the ability to think

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,120
right so

116
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,959
the physical world includes the body in

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,600
action but it doesn't include thought

118
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,319
according to descartes right

119
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,960
and so the study of physiology at that

120
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,199
time was the study of sensory systems

121
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,719
and motor systems and

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,040
things that you could

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,520
directly measure when you stimulated

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,280
neurons and stuff like that

125
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,879
and um

126
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,679
the study of cognition was something

127
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,680
that

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,120
you know was tied in with abstract

129
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,040
computer algorithms and things like that

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
but when i was an undergraduate i

131
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,840
learned about the physiological

132
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,160
mechanisms uh and so when i'm studying

133
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,679
cognitive psychology as a first year phd

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,199
student i'm saying

135
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,759
wait a minute the whole thing is

136
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,600
biological

137
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,800
you had that intuition right away that

138
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,879
was seemed obvious to you yeah yeah

139
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,759
it isn't that magical though that from

140
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,319
just

141
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,720
the little bit of biology can emerge the

142
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,680
full beauty of the human experience is

143
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
that

144
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,038
why is that so obvious to you well i

145
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,159
it's obvious

146
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,319
and not obvious at the same time um and

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,439
i think about darwin in this context too

148
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,439
because

149
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,680
darwin

150
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,120
knew very early on that none of the

151
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,759
ideas that anybody had ever offered

152
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
gave him a sense of understanding how

153
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,240
evolution

154
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
could have worked

155
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,399
but he wanted to figure out how it could

156
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,240
have worked that was his goal

157
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,120
and

158
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,960
he

159
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,160
spent a lot of time

160
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,159
working on this idea and coming you know

161
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
reading about things that gave him hints

162
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,360
and thinking they were interesting but

163
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,719
not knowing why and

164
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,160
drawing more and more pictures of

165
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,319
different birds that differ slightly

166
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,199
from each other and so on you know and

167
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,800
and then then he figured it out

168
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,800
but after he figured it out he had

169
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,800
nightmares about it

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
he would dream about the complexity of

171
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,560
the eye

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and the arguments that people had given

173
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,959
about how ridiculous it was to imagine

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
that

175
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,120
that could have ever emerged from some

176
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,280
sort of you know

177
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,319
unguided process right that it hadn't

178
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,359
been the product of design

179
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,600
and and uh so he he didn't publish for a

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,919
long time in part because he was

181
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,240
scared of his own ideas he didn't think

182
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,198
they could probably possibly be true

183
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,879
yeah

184
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,478
um

185
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:48,319
but then you know by the time

186
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,360
the 20th century rolls around we all

187
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,639
uh

188
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,439
you know we understand that evolut or

189
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,000
many people understand or believe

190
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,519
that evolution uh produced you know the

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,959
entire uh range of uh animals that there

192
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,839
are

193
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,918
uh and uh you know descartes idea starts

194
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,918
to seem a little wonky after a while

195
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,120
right like well wait a minute

196
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:12,079
um

197
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,399
there's

198
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,879
the apes and the chimpanzees and the

199
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,399
bonobos and you know like they're pretty

200
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,478
smart in some ways you know so what

201
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,000
oh you know somebody comes oh there's a

202
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,758
certain part of the brain that's still

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,918
different they don't you know there's no

204
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,520
hippocampus in the

205
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,639
monkey brain it's only in the human

206
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,038
brain

207
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,960
uh huxley had to do a surgery in front

208
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,719
of many many people in the late 19th

209
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,399
century to show to them there's actually

210
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,919
a hippocampus

211
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:45,918
in the chimpanzees brain you know

212
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,038
so so their continuity of the species is

213
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:51,120
another

214
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:52,800
element uh that you know contributes

215
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,598
to um

216
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,680
this sort of you know

217
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:01,199
idea that we are

218
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,439
ourselves uh a total product of nature

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,439
um and uh

220
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,879
that to me is the is the magic in the

221
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:11,120
mystery how

222
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,120
how nature could actually um

223
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,439
you know give rise to

224
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,639
uh

225
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,918
organisms that have the capabilities

226
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,918
that we have

227
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:25,038
so it's interesting because even the

228
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,680
idea of evolution is hard for me to keep

229
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,000
all together in my mind so because we

230
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,719
think of a human time scale

231
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,320
it's hard to imagine that like like the

232
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,000
the development of the human eye would

233
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,839
give me nightmares too

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,759
because you have to think across many

235
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,680
many many generations

236
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,559
and it's very tempting to think about

237
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,639
kind of

238
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,879
a growth of a complicated object and

239
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,399
it's like how is it possible for that

240
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,958
such

241
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,559
such a thing to be built because also

242
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,159
me from a robotics engineering

243
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,239
perspective it's very hard to build

244
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,879
these systems how can

245
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,159
through an undirected process can a

246
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,278
complex thing be designed it seems not

247
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:07,120
it seems wrong yeah so that's absolutely

248
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,720
right and i you know

249
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,240
a slightly different career path that

250
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,360
would have been equally interesting to

251
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,200
me would have

252
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,600
would have been um to actually study the

253
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,080
process of

254
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:24,080
embryological development

255
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,240
flowing on into brain development and

256
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
the

257
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,759
um

258
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,760
exquisite sort of laying down of

259
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,080
pathways and so on that occurs in the

260
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,720
brain and uh i know the slightest bit

261
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,839
about that it's not my field but

262
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,320
um

263
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,320
there are

264
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:46,319
you know fascinating

265
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:49,278
aspects to this process that

266
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,640
eventually result in the

267
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,159
you know the complexity of of uh

268
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,319
various brains

269
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:59,679
at least you know one thing um we're

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,519
um

271
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,958
in in the field i think people have felt

272
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,600
for a long time

273
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,838
it

274
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,879
in the study of vision the continuity

275
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,760
between

276
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,399
humans and non-human animals has been

277
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,799
has been second nature for a lot longer

278
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,799
i was having i had this conversation

279
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,399
um with somebody who's a vision

280
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,838
scientist and you're saying oh we we

281
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,519
don't have any problem with this you

282
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,640
know the monkey's visual system and the

283
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,159
human visual system extremely similar

284
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,240
um

285
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,919
up to certain levels of course they they

286
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,879
diverge after a while but um the first

287
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,519
the the visual pathway from the eye to

288
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,120
the brain and the first few

289
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,399
um

290
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,839
layers of

291
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,958
cortex um or cortical areas i guess one

292
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,800
would say

293
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,799
uh are are extremely similar

294
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,078
yeah so on the cognition side is where

295
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,559
the leap seems to happen with humans

296
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,319
that it does seem we're kind of special

297
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,958
and that's a really interesting question

298
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,320
when thinking about alien life or if

299
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,719
there's other intelligent alien

300
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,200
civilizations out there is how special

301
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,600
is this leap so one special thing seems

302
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,839
to be the origin of life itself however

303
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,079
you define that there's a gray area and

304
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,880
the other leap this is very biased

305
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,679
perspective of a human is the

306
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,600
the

307
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,000
origin of intelligence

308
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,879
and again from an engineer perspective

309
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,879
it's a

310
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,159
difficult question to ask an important

311
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,078
one

312
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,000
is how difficult does that leap how

313
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,399
special were humans

314
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,480
did uh did uh a monolith come down did

315
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,440
aliens bring down a monolith and some

316
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,839
apes had to touch a monolith but

317
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,640
to get it it's a lot like dark descartes

318
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,240
uh you know idea right exactly i it's

319
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,639
but it just seems

320
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,720
that it seems one heck of a leap yeah to

321
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,919
get to this level of intelligence yeah

322
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,959
and you know so chomsky um

323
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:57,120
uh argued um

324
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,958
that you know some

325
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,959
uh

326
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,039
genetic fluke occurred a hundred

327
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,239
thousand years ago and

328
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,000
you know just happened that some

329
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,560
human some

330
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,039
homonym

331
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,879
of current humans

332
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,559
had this

333
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,879
one genetic

334
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,518
tweak that resulted in

335
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,720
language yeah and

336
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,679
language

337
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,120
then provided

338
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,000
this

339
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,560
special thing that separates us from all

340
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,399
other animals

341
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,159
um

342
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
i'm

343
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,919
i think there's a lot of truth to the

344
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,480
value and importance of language

345
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:47,120
but i think it comes along with

346
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,720
um the evolution of a lot of other

347
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,078
related things related to sociality

348
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,560
and mutual engagement with others

349
00:12:54,078 --> 00:13:00,000
and um

350
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,000
establishment of

351
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,440
i don't know rich

352
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:09,759
mechanisms for

353
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
organizing an understanding of the world

354
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,480
which language then plugs into right so

355
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,240
it's uh

356
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,759
language is a tool

357
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,519
that allows you to do this kind of

358
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,958
collective intelligence and whatever is

359
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,560
at the core of

360
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,319
the thing that allows for this

361
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,119
collective intelligence is the main

362
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,040
thing

363
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,120
and it's interesting to think about that

364
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,078
one fluke

365
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,078
one mutation could lead to the like the

366
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:38,399
the first crack open opening of the door

367
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,479
to human intelligence like all it takes

368
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,278
is one like evolution just kind of opens

369
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,759
the door a little bit and then it time

370
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,600
and selection takes care of the rest

371
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,799
you know there's so many fascinating

372
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,680
aspects to these kinds of things so

373
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:57,039
we think of evolution as continuous

374
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:59,278
right we think oh yes okay over

375
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,639
500 million years there could have been

376
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,519
this

377
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,000
you know relatively continuous

378
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,078
uh changes and

379
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,720
um

380
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,399
but that's not what

381
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,720
anthropologists

382
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,360
evolutionary biologists found from the

383
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,959
fossil record they found

384
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,720
you know

385
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,399
hundreds of years of

386
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,639
hundreds of millions of years of stasis

387
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,519
and then you know suddenly a change

388
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,600
occurs well suddenly on that scale is a

389
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,120
million years or something

390
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,560
but but or even 10 million years but

391
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,799
but um

392
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,119
the concept of punctuated equilibrium

393
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,359
was a very important concept in

394
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,440
evolutionary biology

395
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,680
uh and

396
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,680
that

397
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,000
also feels

398
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,039
somehow right about

399
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,919
you know

400
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,679
the stages of our mental abilities we

401
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,159
we seem to have a certain kind of

402
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,838
mindset at a certain age and then

403
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,600
at another

404
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
another age we like look at that

405
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,120
four-year-old and say oh my god how

406
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,120
could they have thought that way

407
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,519
so piaget was known for this kind of

408
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,000
stage theory of child development right

409
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,159
and you look at it closely and suddenly

410
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,078
those stages are so discreet and the

411
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,759
transitions but the difference between

412
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,078
the four-year-old and the seven-year-old

413
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,519
is profound and

414
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,319
that's another thing that's always

415
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,560
interested me is how we

416
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,560
something happens over the course of

417
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,439
several years of experience where at

418
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,039
some point we reach the point where

419
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,600
something like an insight or a

420
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:40,799
transition or a new stage of development

421
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,240
occurs and uh

422
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,599
you know these kinds of things can be

423
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,198
understood

424
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,759
um

425
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:52,078
in complex systems uh research and so um

426
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,079
evolutionary biology developmental

427
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,078
biology

428
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,198
cognitive development are all things

429
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,039
that have been approached in this kind

430
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,559
of way yeah

431
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,919
just like you said i find both

432
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,039
fascinating

433
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,879
those early years of human life but also

434
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,919
the early like

435
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,039
minutes days of from the embryonic

436
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,799
development

437
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:19,278
to like how from embryos you get like

438
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,799
the brain that development

439
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,480
again from the engineering perspective

440
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:26,719
is fascinating so it's not so the early

441
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,800
when you deploy the brain to the human

442
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,800
world and it gets to explore that world

443
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,439
and learn that's fascinating but just

444
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,838
like the assembly of the mechanism that

445
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,519
is capable of learning that's like

446
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,519
amazing the stuff they're doing with

447
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,879
like brain organoids

448
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,519
where you can

449
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,559
build many brains and study that

450
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,720
um

451
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,078
self-assembly of a mechanism from like

452
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,600
the dna material that that's like what

453
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,919
the heck

454
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,199
you have literally like biological

455
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,000
programs

456
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,078
that just generate a system

457
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,440
this mushy thing

458
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,519
that's able to be robust and learn in a

459
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,400
very unpredictable world

460
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,679
and learn seemingly arbitrary things or

461
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,559
like

462
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,038
a very large number of things that

463
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,838
enable survival yeah

464
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,078
ultimately

465
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:22,240
um that is a very important part of the

466
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,078
whole process of you know understanding

467
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,959
this sort of

468
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,480
emergence of mind from brain kind of

469
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,120
kind of thing and the whole thing seems

470
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,279
to be pretty continuous so let me uh let

471
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,639
me step back to neural networks for for

472
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,879
another brief

473
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,799
minute you wrote parallel distributed

474
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,160
processing books that explored ideas of

475
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,000
neural networks

476
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
in the 1980s

477
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,839
together with a few folks but the books

478
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,080
you wrote with

479
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,720
david uh ronald hart who is the first

480
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,319
author on the back propagation paper

481
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
with jeff hinton

482
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,599
so these are just some figures at the

483
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,960
time that were thinking about these big

484
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,038
ideas

485
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,679
what are some memorable moments of

486
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:04,240
discovery and beautiful ideas from those

487
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,240
early days

488
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,440
i'm going to start

489
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,678
sort of with my own

490
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,038
process in the

491
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,919
mid 70s

492
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,519
and then into the late 70s

493
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,520
when

494
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,599
i met jeff hinson and

495
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,639
he came to san diego

496
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,639
and we were all together

497
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,038
in

498
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,038
my time in graduate school as i've

499
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,640
already described to you i had this sort

500
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,798
of feeling of

501
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,960
okay i'm really interested in human

502
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,519
cognition but

503
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,480
this disembodied sort of way of thinking

504
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,440
about it that i'm getting from the

505
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,038
current

506
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,120
mode of thought about it is isn't

507
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:47,919
working fully for me

508
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,319
and

509
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,320
when i

510
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:55,440
got my assistant professorship i went to

511
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,480
ucsd and um

512
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,120
that was in 1974.

513
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,440
something amazing had just happened dave

514
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,079
rummelhart had written a book together

515
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,840
with another man named don norman

516
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:11,918
and the book was called explorations in

517
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:14,798
cognition and it was

518
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,679
a series of chapters exploring

519
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:20,240
interesting questions about cognition

520
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,960
but in a completely sort of

521
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,359
abstract you know non-biological kind of

522
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,600
way and i'm saying gee this is amazing

523
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,599
i'm coming to this community where

524
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:33,678
people can get together and feel like

525
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:36,719
they've collectively exploring

526
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,960
you know ideas and um

527
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,600
it was a book that had a lot of

528
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,558
i don't know lightness to it and you

529
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,759
know

530
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,519
the the don norman who was

531
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,079
the the more senior figure the roman

532
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,319
heart at that time who led that project

533
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,839
um you know cr always created this

534
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:58,319
spirit of playful exploration of ideas

535
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,558
and so i'm like wow this is great

536
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,558
but

537
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,480
i was also

538
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,880
you know still trying to get from

539
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,400
the neurons to the

540
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,760
to the cognition

541
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,038
and

542
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,798
i realized at one point i i got this

543
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,279
opportunity to go to a conference where

544
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,558
i heard a talk by a man named james

545
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,359
anderson who is an engineer

546
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,200
but

547
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,558
by then a professor in a psychology

548
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,319
department who had used

549
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:36,319
linear algebra to create neural network

550
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:38,558
models of perception and categorization

551
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,519
and memory and i

552
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,119
just

553
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:45,918
blew me out of the water that one could

554
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:49,119
you know create a model

555
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,080
that was simulating neurons not

556
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,239
just

557
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,119
kind of

558
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,599
engaged in a stepwise

559
00:20:55,119 --> 00:21:00,798
algorithmic process that was construed

560
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:04,158
abstractly but it was

561
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,119
simulating remembering and recalling and

562
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,280
um

563
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,038
recognizing the prior occurrence of a

564
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,798
stimulus or something like that so for

565
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,359
me this was

566
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:17,119
a bridge between the mind and the brain

567
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:19,319
and i just like stuck and i i remember i

568
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,918
was walking across campus one day in

569
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:24,079
1977 and i

570
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,880
almost felt like saint paul on the road

571
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:30,000
to damascus i said to myself you know if

572
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,080
i think about the mind

573
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,519
in terms of a neural network it will

574
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,000
help me answer the questions about the

575
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,720
mind that i'm trying to answer

576
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,960
and that really excited me

577
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,960
so

578
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,599
i think that a lot of people were

579
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,759
becoming excited about that and one of

580
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,918
those people

581
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,240
was jim anderson who i had mentioned

582
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,759
another one was steve grossberg who had

583
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,519
been

584
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,519
writing about neural networks since the

585
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,519
60s

586
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:06,320
and jeff hinton was yet another and

587
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,720
his phd dissertation showed up uh in an

588
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,678
applicant pool

589
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,120
to a postdoctoral training program

590
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,480
that dave

591
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,319
and don

592
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,240
the two men i mentioned before remember

593
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,480
heart and norman

594
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,120
were administering and rommelhardt got

595
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,120
really excited about hinton's phd

596
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,519
dissertation

597
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:30,479
um and so

598
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,158
uh hinton was one of the first um people

599
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,240
who came and joined this group of

600
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,039
postdoctoral scholars

601
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,359
uh that was funded by this this

602
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,919
wonderful grant that they got

603
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,599
another one who is also well known in

604
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,240
neural network circus

605
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,918
circles is pulse milenski he was another

606
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,519
one of that group

607
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,759
anyway

608
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,759
um

609
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,440
jeff and jim anderson organized a

610
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:02,079
conference at ucsd

611
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,480
uh where we we were and uh it was called

612
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,240
parallel models of associative memory

613
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,679
and it brought all the people together

614
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,038
who had been thinking about these kinds

615
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,720
of ideas

616
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,679
in 1979 or 1980 and

617
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,200
this

618
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,840
this began

619
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,919
to kind of

620
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,240
really resonate with some of rommel

621
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,520
hart's um

622
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,759
own thinking some of his reasons for

623
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,158
wanting something other than the kinds

624
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,599
of computation he'd been doing so far so

625
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,440
let me talk about ronald hart now for a

626
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,798
minute okay with that context well let

627
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,720
me also just pause because he said so

628
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,038
many interesting things before we go to

629
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,558
roma heart so first of all for people

630
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,240
who are not familiar

631
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,519
uh neural networks are at the core of

632
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,919
the machine learning deep learning

633
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,599
revolution of today uh jeffrey hidden

634
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,759
that we mentioned is one

635
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,278
of the figures that were important in

636
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,038
the history like yourself in the

637
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,798
development of these neural networks

638
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:55,919
artificial neural networks that are then

639
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:57,759
used for the machine learning

640
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,919
application like i mentioned the back

641
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,200
propagation paper is one of the

642
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,799
optimization

643
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,840
mechanisms by which these uh networks uh

644
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:07,119
can learn

645
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,439
and uh

646
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,158
the word parallel is really interesting

647
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,400
so it's it's almost like synonymous from

648
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,080
a computational perspective what how you

649
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,000
thought at the time about

650
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,278
neural networks that is parallel

651
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,038
computation

652
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,839
is that would that be fair to say well

653
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,200
yeah the the parallel the word parallel

654
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,519
in this

655
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,080
you know comes from the idea that each

656
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,440
neuron is

657
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:37,678
an independent computational unit right

658
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,519
it it gathers data from other neurons it

659
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,559
integrates it in a certain way and then

660
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:45,519
it produces a result and it's a very

661
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:49,359
simple little computational unit but it

662
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:51,359
it's autonomous in the sense that

663
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,519
you know it does its thing right it's

664
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,639
it's in a biological medium where it's

665
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,839
getting nutrients and various uh

666
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,240
chemicals from that medium

667
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:04,798
um but it's uh you know you can think of

668
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,839
it as almost like a little

669
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:10,240
little computer in and of itself

670
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:13,599
so the idea is that each you know our

671
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,640
brains have oh look you know a hundred

672
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,918
or

673
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,159
hundreds

674
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,480
almost a billion of these

675
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,520
little neurons right

676
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,000
um

677
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,720
and they're all capable of doing their

678
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,119
work at the same time so it's like

679
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,759
instead of just a single central

680
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:36,000
processor that's engaged in you know

681
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,000
chug chug one step after another

682
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,559
we have

683
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,879
a billion of these little computational

684
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,879
units working at the same time so at the

685
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,278
time that's i don't know maybe you can

686
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,440
comment it seems to me

687
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,200
even still to me uh quite a

688
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,880
revolutionary way to think about

689
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,319
computation

690
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,080
relative to

691
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,240
the development of theoretical computer

692
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:00,240
science alongside of that where it's

693
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,159
very much like sequential computer

694
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,000
you're analyzing algorithms that are

695
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,440
running on a single computer that's

696
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,679
right you're saying

697
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,080
wait a minute what what

698
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,320
why don't we take a really dumb very

699
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,558
simple computer and just have a lot of

700
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,399
them interconnected together and they're

701
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:17,759
all operating in their own little world

702
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,159
and they're communicating with each

703
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,319
other and thinking of computation in

704
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,080
that way and from that kind of

705
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:27,439
computation

706
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,960
on trying to understand how things like

707
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,640
certain characteristics of the human

708
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,600
mind can emerge

709
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,919
right that's quite a revolutionary way

710
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:39,918
of thinking i would say

711
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:44,000
well yes i agree with you and um

712
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,320
there's still this sort of sense

713
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,319
of

714
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:54,319
not sort of knowing how we

715
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,278
kind of get all the way there um i think

716
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,798
and this very much remains

717
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,319
at the core of the questions that

718
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,000
everybody's asking about the

719
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,678
capabilities of deep learning and all

720
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,119
these kinds of things but if i could

721
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,120
just play this out a little bit

722
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,240
a a convolutional neural network or a

723
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,359
cnn which

724
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,519
you know many people may have heard of

725
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,519
is

726
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:23,200
a set of

727
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,879
you could think of it biologically as

728
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,919
a set of

729
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,320
collections of neurons each one had

730
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,440
each collection has

731
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,639
maybe

732
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,120
10 000 neurons in it but there's many

733
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,919
layers right some of these things are

734
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,959
hundreds or even a thousand layers deep

735
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,200
but

736
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,120
others are closer to the biological

737
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,880
brain and maybe they're like 20 layers

738
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,398
deep or something like that

739
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,600
so we have

740
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,439
within each layer we have

741
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,359
thousands of neurons or tens of

742
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,519
thousands maybe well in the brain we

743
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,918
probably have

744
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,240
millions in each layer so but we're

745
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,600
getting sort of similar in a certain way

746
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,839
right

747
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,839
um

748
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,120
and then we think okay at the bottom

749
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,960
level

750
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,199
there's an array of things that are like

751
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,600
the photoreceptors in there in the eye

752
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,840
they respond to the amount of light of a

753
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,199
certain wavelength at a certain location

754
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,038
on the

755
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,480
on the pixel array

756
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,558
so that's like the biological eye

757
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,798
and then there's several further stages

758
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,398
going up layers of these neuron-like

759
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:31,359
units

760
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,798
and

761
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:37,759
you go from that raw

762
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,000
input array of pixels to

763
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,000
a classification

764
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,480
you've actually built a system that

765
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,079
could do the same kind of thing that you

766
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,839
and i do when we open our eyes and we

767
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,519
look around and we see there's a cup

768
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,079
there's a cell phone

769
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,000
there's a water bottle

770
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:54,879
and these systems are doing that now

771
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
right

772
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,600
so

773
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,558
they are

774
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,158
in in terms of the parallel idea that we

775
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,720
were talking about before

776
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,520
they are doing this massively parallel

777
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,200
computation in the sense that

778
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,798
each of the neurons in each of those

779
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,600
layers is

780
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,519
thought of as computing its little bit

781
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,678
of

782
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,599
something about the input uh

783
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,840
simultaneously with all the other ones

784
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,678
in the same layer

785
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,319
we get to the point of abstracting that

786
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,038
away and thinking oh it's just one whole

787
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:31,200
vector that's being computed one one

788
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,798
activation pattern is computed in a

789
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,319
single step and that

790
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:39,119
that that abstraction is useful

791
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,519
but it's still that parallel

792
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,199
and distributed processing right each

793
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,359
one of these guys is just contributing a

794
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,120
tiny bit to that whole thing and that's

795
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,719
the excitement that you felt that from

796
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,519
these simple

797
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,240
things you can emerge when you add these

798
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,839
level of abstractions on it yeah you can

799
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,079
start getting all the beautiful things

800
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:01,038
that we think about as cognition right

801
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,480
and so okay so you have this conference

802
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,000
i forgot the name already but it's

803
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,839
parallel and something associative

804
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,839
memory and so on

805
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,959
very exciting technical and exciting

806
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:13,678
title and you started talking about dave

807
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,960
romohart so who is this person

808
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,120
that was so

809
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,159
you've spoken very highly of him yeah

810
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,599
can you tell me about him his ideas his

811
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,520
mind

812
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:24,959
who he was as a human being as a

813
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:25,679
scientist

814
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,038
so

815
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,679
dave came from a little tiny town in

816
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,038
western south dakota

817
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,240
and

818
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,480
his

819
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,519
mother was the librarian and his father

820
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,120
was the editor of the newspaper

821
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:43,359
um

822
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:46,000
and uh i know one of his brothers pretty

823
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,439
well um

824
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,880
they grew up

825
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,240
there were four brothers uh and uh

826
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,278
they grew up

827
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,519
together

828
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:58,319
uh and their father encouraged them to

829
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,558
compete with each other a lot

830
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:04,480
they competed in sports and they

831
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:06,398
competed in mind games you know um

832
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
i don't know things like sudoku and

833
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,719
chess and various things like that

834
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,558
and uh

835
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,839
dave um

836
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:18,079
was

837
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:20,398
a standout undergraduate he went

838
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,599
as at a younger age than most people do

839
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,199
to college

840
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,480
at the university of south dakota and

841
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:29,120
majored in mathematics and i don't know

842
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,839
how he got interested in

843
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:33,918
psychology but he

844
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:36,079
applied to the mathematical psychology

845
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,038
program at stanford and was accepted as

846
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:41,119
a phd student to study mathematical

847
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,440
psychology at stanford so mathematical

848
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:45,038
psychology

849
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,960
is the

850
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:51,759
use of mathematics to model

851
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,960
mental processes right so something that

852
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,839
i think these days might be called

853
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,440
cognitive modeling that whole space yeah

854
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,639
it's mathematical in the sense that

855
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,320
um

856
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,840
you say

857
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,918
if

858
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,240
this is true and that is true then i can

859
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,159
derive that this should follow okay and

860
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,319
so you say these are my stipulations

861
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,200
about the fundamental principles and

862
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:17,038
this is my prediction about behavior and

863
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,519
it's all done with equations it's not

864
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,240
done with a computer simulation

865
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,038
right so the you you solve the equation

866
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,880
and that tells you what the

867
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,558
probability that the subject will be

868
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,159
correct on the seventh trial of the

869
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,720
experiment is or something like that

870
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,840
right so it's a it's a it's a

871
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,839
it's a

872
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:39,918
use of mathematics to descriptively

873
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:42,879
characterize uh aspects of of behavior

874
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,399
and uh stanford at that time was the

875
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,840
place where

876
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:50,319
uh there were several really really

877
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,079
strong mathematical thinkers who were

878
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,519
also connected with three or four others

879
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,240
around the country

880
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,120
who um you know brought a lot of really

881
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,720
exciting ideas uh onto the table

882
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,879
and it was a very very prestigious part

883
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,519
of the field of psychology at that time

884
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,320
so remember heart comes into this

885
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,558
um

886
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,798
he was a very strong student within that

887
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,240
program

888
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:15,278
uh and

889
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
uh

890
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:17,200
he got

891
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,278
this

892
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,679
job at this brand new university in san

893
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,798
diego in 1967

894
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,240
he's one of the first assistant

895
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:27,679
professors in the department of

896
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,159
psychology

897
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,759
at ucsd

898
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,278
so

899
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:37,278
i got there

900
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:38,960
in 74 seven years later

901
00:33:37,278 --> 00:33:41,599
and

902
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,200
reunhard at that time

903
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:47,199
was

904
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,720
still doing mathematical modeling

905
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,840
um

906
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:56,159
but he had gotten interested

907
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:58,798
in cognition he'd gotten interested in

908
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,278
understanding

909
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,759
and you know understanding i think

910
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,759
remains

911
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,839
you know what does it mean to understand

912
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,838
anyway you know

913
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,000
uh it's it's an interesting sort of

914
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:15,358
curious you know like how would we know

915
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,800
if we really understood something but

916
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,878
but he was

917
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,879
interested in building machines that

918
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,719
would you know hear a couple of

919
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,279
sentences and have an insight about what

920
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:28,799
was going on so for example one of his

921
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,800
favorite things at that time was

922
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,440
marky was sitting on the front step when

923
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:38,239
she heard the familiar jingle

924
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,079
of the good humor man

925
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,000
she remembered her birthday money and

926
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,720
ran into the house

927
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,960
what is margie doing

928
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,959
why

929
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,878
well there's a couple of ideas you could

930
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,200
have but

931
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,440
the most natural one is that

932
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,358
the good humor man brings ice cream she

933
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,760
likes ice cream she's

934
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:01,358
she knows she needs money to buy ice

935
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,880
cream so she's gonna run into the house

936
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:04,719
and get her money so she can buy herself

937
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,400
an ice cream it's a huge amount of

938
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,439
inference that has to happen to get

939
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,440
those things to link up with each other

940
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,039
and and he was interested in how the

941
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,559
hell that could happen

942
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:20,719
and he was trying to build um

943
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:22,960
you know good old-fashioned ai style

944
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:26,319
models of

945
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,358
representation of language and

946
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,960
and content of

947
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:32,239
you know things like

948
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,240
has money

949
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,078
so like a lot or like formal logic and

950
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,000
like knowledge bases like that kind of

951
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,480
stuff yeah so he was integrating that

952
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,880
with his thinking about cognition yes

953
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,280
the mechanisms cognition

954
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,519
how can they like mechanistically be

955
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,320
applied to build these knowledge like to

956
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:54,079
actually build something that looks like

957
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,519
a web of knowledge and thereby from

958
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,680
from there emerges something like

959
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,480
understanding whatever the heck that is

960
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,078
yeah

961
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,679
he was grappling

962
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,599
this was something that they grappled

963
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,319
with at the end of that book that i was

964
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,200
describing explorations and cognition

965
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,320
but he was realizing that the paradigm

966
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,559
of

967
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,480
good old-fashioned ai wasn't giving him

968
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,679
the answers to these questions

969
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,358
yeah

970
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,559
and by the way that's called good

971
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:22,559
old-fashioned ai now it was called that

972
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,880
well it was it was beginning to be

973
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:28,400
called that because it was from the 60s

974
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,838
yeah by by the late 70s it was kind of

975
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,599
old-fashioned and it hadn't really

976
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,440
panned out you know and

977
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,320
people were beginning to recognize that

978
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,240
but

979
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,920
and and remember heart was you know like

980
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,519
yeah it was part of the recognition that

981
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,559
this wasn't all working

982
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:45,679
anyway so he

983
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,920
started thinking in terms of

984
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,639
uh

985
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,838
the idea that we needed systems that

986
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,199
allowed us to integrate multiple

987
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:57,358
simultaneous constraints

988
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:00,000
in a way that would be mutually

989
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,239
influencing each other

990
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,239
so

991
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,679
he wrote a paper that

992
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
just

993
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,039
really

994
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,480
first time i read it i said oh well you

995
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,119
know yeah

996
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,119
but is this important but after a while

997
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,680
it just got under my skin

998
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,800
and it was called an interactive model

999
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:22,799
of reading and in this paper he laid out

1000
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,280
the idea that

1001
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,519
every aspect

1002
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,519
of

1003
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,960
our

1004
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,960
interpretation of

1005
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,079
what what's coming off the page when we

1006
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,720
read

1007
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,680
at every level of analysis you can think

1008
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,078
of

1009
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,838
actually depends on all the other levels

1010
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,079
of analysis

1011
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,320
so

1012
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,320
what are the actual

1013
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,440
pixels

1014
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,880
making up each letter and

1015
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,960
what do those pixels signify about which

1016
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,358
letters they are and what do those

1017
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,440
letters tell us about

1018
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,719
what words are there

1019
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,599
and what do those words tell us about

1020
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:14,719
what ideas the author is trying to

1021
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,720
convey and

1022
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:20,239
so he had this model where you know we

1023
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,559
have these

1024
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,319
little tiny

1025
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,519
uh

1026
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,760
elements that represent each of the

1027
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,199
pixels of each of the letters and then

1028
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,720
other ones that represent the line

1029
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,319
segments in them and other ones that

1030
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:36,319
represent the letters and other ones

1031
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,760
that represent the words

1032
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,160
and

1033
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,960
um at that time his idea was there's

1034
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:46,639
this set of experts

1035
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,400
there's an expert about how to

1036
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,559
construct a line out of pixels and

1037
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,320
another expert about how

1038
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:54,000
which sets of lines go together to make

1039
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,838
which letters and another one about

1040
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
which letters go together to make mitch

1041
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,920
words and another one about what the

1042
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,039
meanings of the words are and another

1043
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,119
one about

1044
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,559
how the meanings fit together and you

1045
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,240
know things like that and all these

1046
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,960
experts are looking at this data and

1047
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,639
they're

1048
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,838
they're um

1049
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,679
updating

1050
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,838
hypotheses at

1051
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,159
at other levels so the word expert can

1052
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:18,480
tell the letter expert oh i think there

1053
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,039
should be a t there because i think

1054
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,119
there should be a word the here and the

1055
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,559
bottom up sort of feature to letter

1056
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,200
expert could say i think there should be

1057
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,440
a t there too and if they agree

1058
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,399
then you see a t right and so there's a

1059
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,838
top-down bottom-up interactive process

1060
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,838
but it's going on at all layers

1061
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,519
simultaneously so everything can filter

1062
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,440
all the way down from the top as well as

1063
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:42,719
all the way up from the bottom and it's

1064
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,679
a completely interactive bi-directional

1065
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,919
parallel distributed process that is

1066
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:50,319
somehow because of the abstractions is

1067
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,639
hierarchical so like yeah so there's

1068
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,559
different layers of responsibilities

1069
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:55,920
different levels of responsibilities

1070
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,320
first of all it's fascinating to think

1071
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,800
about it in this kind of mechanistic way

1072
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,119
so not thinking purely

1073
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,960
from the structure of a neural network

1074
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,640
or something like a neural network but

1075
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,639
thinking about these little little guys

1076
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,400
that work on letters and then

1077
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,519
the letters come words and words become

1078
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,838
sentences

1079
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,559
and uh that's a very interesting

1080
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,480
hypothesis that from that

1081
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,838
kind of hierarchical structure can

1082
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,800
emerge

1083
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:25,039
uh understanding yeah so but the thing

1084
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,400
is though i want to just sort of

1085
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,519
relate this to the earlier part of the

1086
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,880
conversation

1087
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:30,880
um

1088
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,559
when rommelhart was first thinking about

1089
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,240
it there were these experts on the side

1090
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,078
one for the features and one for the

1091
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,759
letters and one for how the letters make

1092
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,280
the words and so on

1093
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,920
and and they would each be working sort

1094
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,480
of

1095
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,559
evaluating various propositions about

1096
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,480
you know is this combination of features

1097
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,480
here going to be one that looks like the

1098
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,838
letter t and so on

1099
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,599
and

1100
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:58,318
and what he

1101
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,160
realized kind of after reading hinton's

1102
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:03,599
dissertation and

1103
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:05,519
hearing about jim anderson's

1104
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,039
linear algebra-based neural network

1105
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,159
models that i was telling you about

1106
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:12,239
before was that he could replace those

1107
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,759
experts with neuron-like processing

1108
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,358
units which just would have their

1109
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,480
connection weights that would do this

1110
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:18,639
job

1111
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,800
so there so

1112
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,118
what ended up happening was that remote

1113
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,039
heart and i got together and we created

1114
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,960
a model called the interactive

1115
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:30,318
activation model of letter perception

1116
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,760
which is

1117
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:35,920
takes these

1118
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,119
little pixel level uh inputs

1119
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,079
constructs

1120
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,240
uh

1121
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,960
line segment features

1122
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,519
letters and words but now we built it

1123
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,358
out of a set of neuron like processing

1124
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,318
units that are just connected to each

1125
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:52,960
other with connection weights so the

1126
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:55,199
unit for the word time has a connection

1127
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,119
to the unit for the letter t in the

1128
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,759
first position and the letter i in the

1129
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,200
second position so on

1130
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,400
and

1131
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:05,279
because these connections are

1132
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,280
bi-directional

1133
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,440
if you have prior knowledge that it

1134
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,358
might be the word time that starts to

1135
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,679
prime the feature to the letters and the

1136
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,598
features and if you don't then it's it

1137
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,838
has to start bottom up but the

1138
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,000
directionality just depends on where the

1139
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:22,239
information comes in first and

1140
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,559
and if you have context together with

1141
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:27,039
features at the same time they can

1142
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,799
convergently result in an emergent

1143
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,358
perception and that

1144
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,280
um that was the

1145
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:35,759
um

1146
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,680
the piece of work that we did together

1147
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,119
that uh

1148
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:43,598
sort of got us both completely convinced

1149
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,400
that you know this neural network way of

1150
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,640
thinking

1151
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,639
was going to be able to

1152
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:50,799
actually address the questions that we

1153
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,719
were interested in as cognitive cycle so

1154
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,560
the algorithmic side the optimization

1155
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:55,838
side those are all details like when you

1156
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,838
first start

1157
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,159
the idea that you can get far with this

1158
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:02,480
kind of way of thinking that in itself

1159
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:04,879
is a profound idea so do you like the

1160
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,599
term uh connectionism

1161
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,000
to describe this kind of set of ideas

1162
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,680
i think it's useful

1163
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,719
it highlights

1164
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,279
the

1165
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:18,559
notion that the knowledge

1166
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,040
that the system exploits is

1167
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,599
in the connections between the units

1168
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:25,679
right there isn't a separate

1169
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,920
dictionary

1170
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:28,719
the connections between the units

1171
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,880
so

1172
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,159
i already sort of

1173
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,200
laid that on the table with the

1174
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:37,199
connections from the letter units to the

1175
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:39,199
unit for the word time right the unit

1176
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,078
for the word time isn't a unit for the

1177
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:44,078
word time for any other reason then it's

1178
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,920
got the connections to the letters that

1179
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,599
make up the word time

1180
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,318
those are the units on the input that

1181
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,680
excite it when it's excited that

1182
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:55,679
it in a sense represents in the system

1183
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,759
that

1184
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:00,399
there's support for the hypothesis that

1185
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,839
the word time is present in the input

1186
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,639
um

1187
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:04,639
but it's not

1188
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,400
there there's the word time isn't

1189
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,480
written anywhere inside the bottle it's

1190
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,639
only written there in the picture we

1191
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,760
drew of the model to say that's the unit

1192
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:18,719
for the word time right yeah and um if

1193
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,960
if if somebody wants to tell me well

1194
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,118
what are the how do you spell that word

1195
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,119
you have to use the connections from

1196
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,680
that out to

1197
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,358
to then get those letters for example

1198
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,598
that's such a

1199
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:34,318
that's a counter-intuitive idea

1200
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,079
we humans want to think in this logic

1201
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,759
way

1202
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,079
this this idea of connectionism

1203
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,400
it doesn't it's weird it's weird that

1204
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,119
this is how it all works yeah but let's

1205
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,559
go back to that cnn right that cnn with

1206
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,920
all those layers of neuron like

1207
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,358
processing units that we were talking

1208
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,880
about before

1209
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,199
it's going to come out and say this is a

1210
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,760
cat that's a dog

1211
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,679
but it has no idea why it said that it's

1212
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,880
just got all these connections between

1213
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:03,358
all these

1214
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,079
layers of neurons like from the

1215
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:08,000
very first layer to the you know the

1216
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,318
like whatever these layers are they just

1217
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,760
get numbered after a while because they

1218
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:15,358
you know they they

1219
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,200
somehow further in you go the more

1220
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:19,679
the more abstract the features are but

1221
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:22,318
it's a graded and continuous sort of

1222
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:25,039
process of abstraction anyway and

1223
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:27,599
you know it goes from very local very

1224
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,719
very specific to much more sort of

1225
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,160
global

1226
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,000
but it's still

1227
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:33,838
you know another sort of pattern of

1228
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,318
activation over an array of units and

1229
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:39,199
then at the output side it says it's cat

1230
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:42,318
or it's a dot and when when we when i

1231
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,279
open my eyes and say oh that's lex

1232
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:44,480
or

1233
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,359
um

1234
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,760
oh

1235
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,318
you know there's my own dog and i

1236
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,160
recognize my dog

1237
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:53,920
which is a member of the same species as

1238
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,159
many other dogs but

1239
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,920
i know this one because of some slightly

1240
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,399
unique characteristics i don't know how

1241
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,480
to describe you know what it is that

1242
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,880
makes me know that i'm looking at lex or

1243
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,559
at my particular dog right yeah or even

1244
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,800
that i'm looking at a particular brand

1245
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,599
of car like i could say a few words

1246
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,519
about it but if i wrote you a paragraph

1247
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,440
about the car you you would have trouble

1248
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,838
figuring out which car is he talking

1249
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,559
about right so the idea that we have

1250
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:23,440
propositional knowledge of what

1251
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,679
it is that allows us to recognize that

1252
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:30,318
this is an actual instance of this

1253
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:32,879
particular natural kind is um has always

1254
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:35,119
been you know something that

1255
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,200
uh

1256
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,280
it never worked right you couldn't ever

1257
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:41,519
write down a set of propositions for you

1258
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,280
know visual recognition

1259
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,440
and and and so

1260
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,000
in that space it sort of always seemed

1261
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,318
very natural that something more

1262
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,838
implicit um

1263
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:53,440
you know

1264
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:55,440
you don't have access to what the

1265
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,318
details of the computation were in

1266
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,079
between you just get the result so

1267
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,358
that's the other part of connectionism

1268
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,200
you cannot

1269
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:05,598
you don't read the contents of the

1270
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:06,960
connections the connections only

1271
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,519
cause

1272
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,800
outputs to occur based on inputs

1273
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:14,400
yeah it's it's and for us that like

1274
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,400
final layer or

1275
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,440
some particular layer is very important

1276
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,960
the one that tells us that it's our dog

1277
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,800
or like it's a cat or a dog but

1278
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,240
you know each layer is probably equally

1279
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,200
as important in the grand scheme of

1280
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:28,239
things

1281
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:30,078
like

1282
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,318
there's no reason why the cat versus dog

1283
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,079
is more important than the lower level

1284
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,239
activations it doesn't really matter i

1285
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,920
mean all of it is just this beautiful

1286
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:39,919
stacking on top of each other and we

1287
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,480
humans live in this particular layers

1288
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,720
for us for us it's useful to

1289
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,838
to survive to to use those

1290
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:49,838
cat versus dog predator versus prey all

1291
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,078
those kinds of things it's fascinating

1292
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:53,279
that it's all continuous but then you

1293
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,640
then ask

1294
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,480
you know the history of artificial

1295
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,318
intelligence you ask are we able to

1296
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,159
introspect and convert

1297
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,318
the very things that allow us to tell

1298
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:03,279
the difference to cat and dog

1299
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:05,759
into

1300
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,400
logic into formal logic that's been the

1301
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,319
dream

1302
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,920
i would say that's still part of the the

1303
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:14,480
dream of symbolic ai and

1304
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,480
i've recently

1305
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,280
talked to uh doug

1306
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,519
leonard who created psych

1307
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,119
and that's that's a project that lasted

1308
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:26,239
for many decades

1309
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,960
and still carries a sort of dream in it

1310
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:28,719
right

1311
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,559
um

1312
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:33,199
but we still don't know the answer right

1313
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,720
it seems like connectionism is really

1314
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,719
powerful

1315
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,639
but it also seems like there's this

1316
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,078
building of knowledge

1317
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,078
and so how do we

1318
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,318
how do you square those two like do you

1319
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,800
think the connections can contain the

1320
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:49,440
depth of human knowledge and the depth

1321
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,880
of what uh dave romohart was thinking

1322
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:56,159
about of understanding

1323
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,920
well uh that remains the 64 question and

1324
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:01,679
um

1325
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,760
with inflation that number yeah

1326
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,879
maybe it's the 64 billion dollar

1327
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,480
question now

1328
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,720
uh

1329
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,240
uh

1330
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,558
you know i think that

1331
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,558
um

1332
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,519
from

1333
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:20,480
the emergence side which you know

1334
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,599
uh

1335
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,000
i placed myself on um

1336
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:29,519
so i i used to sometimes tell people i

1337
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,800
was a radical eliminative connectionist

1338
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:32,960
because

1339
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,240
i didn't want them to

1340
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,880
think

1341
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:39,439
that i wanted to build like anything

1342
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,039
into the machine

1343
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,400
but um i

1344
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:48,880
don't like the word eliminative

1345
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,880
uh anymore because it makes it seem like

1346
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,480
it's wrong to think that there is this

1347
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,838
emergent level of

1348
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,719
understanding and

1349
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:01,199
um

1350
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,279
i disagree with that so i think you know

1351
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,439
i would call myself in a radical

1352
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,400
emergentist

1353
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:11,440
uh connectionist rather than eliminative

1354
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,400
connectionist right because i want to

1355
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,000
acknowledge

1356
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,800
that

1357
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,239
that these higher level kinds of

1358
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,160
aspects of our cognition are

1359
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:25,799
are real but they're not

1360
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:25,799
they're they don't

1361
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,599
they don't exist as

1362
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:34,239
such and so there was an example that uh

1363
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,559
doug hofstetter used to use that i

1364
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:39,199
thought was helpful in this respect

1365
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,880
just the idea that

1366
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:45,838
we could think about sand dunes

1367
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,838
as entities

1368
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,480
and talk about like how many there are

1369
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,280
even

1370
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,639
um

1371
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,599
but we also

1372
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:58,318
know that a sand dune is a very fluid

1373
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,800
thing it's it's it's a it's a

1374
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:03,599
it's a pile of sand that is capable of

1375
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,519
moving around under the wind and the and

1376
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,599
and um

1377
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,599
you know

1378
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,359
reforming itself in somewhat different

1379
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,359
ways and and if we think about our

1380
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:14,400
thoughts it's like sand dunes as being

1381
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:16,960
things that

1382
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,000
you know emerge from

1383
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,639
uh

1384
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,519
just the the way all the lower level

1385
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:26,879
elements sort of work together and and

1386
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:29,119
are constrained by external forces

1387
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,920
then we can we can say yes they exist as

1388
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,680
such but they they also

1389
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,358
you know

1390
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:36,960
we shouldn't treat them as completely

1391
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,880
monolithic

1392
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,559
entities that we

1393
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,559
we can understand without understanding

1394
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,720
sort of all of the stuff that

1395
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,400
allows them to change in the ways that

1396
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,879
they do and that's where i think the

1397
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,440
connectionist feeds into the

1398
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,400
into the cognitive it's like okay so if

1399
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,200
the under if the substrate is parallel

1400
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,160
distributed connectionist

1401
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:05,039
um then it doesn't mean that the

1402
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:08,318
contents of thought isn't you know like

1403
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:11,838
abstract and symbolic and um

1404
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:13,920
but it's more fluid maybe then uh

1405
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:16,239
is easier to capture with a set of

1406
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,480
logical expressions yeah that's a heck

1407
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:19,679
of a sort of thing to put

1408
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,838
at the top of

1409
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,358
a resume radical emergingist

1410
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,119
connectionist

1411
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:26,799
so i there is

1412
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,960
just like you said a beautiful dance

1413
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,318
between that between the machinery of

1414
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,480
intelligence

1415
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:34,159
like the neural network side of it and

1416
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,079
the stuff that emerges

1417
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:40,799
i mean the stuff that emerges

1418
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,079
seems to be um

1419
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,839
i don't know

1420
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,880
i don't know what that is

1421
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:50,558
that it seems like maybe all

1422
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,720
of reality is emergent

1423
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,680
what i what i think about

1424
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:58,639
this is made most distinctly

1425
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,199
rich to me when i look at cellular

1426
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:03,598
automata look at game of life

1427
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:06,879
they're from very very simple things

1428
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,720
very rich complex things emerge that

1429
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,160
start looking very quickly like

1430
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,558
organisms

1431
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:14,159
that you forget that the forget how the

1432
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,599
actual thing operates they start looking

1433
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:16,879
like they're moving around they're

1434
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,318
eating each other some of them are

1435
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,680
generating

1436
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:22,400
offspring

1437
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,078
it you forget very quickly and it seems

1438
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,480
like maybe it's something about the

1439
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,480
human mind that wants to operate in some

1440
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,559
layer of the emergent

1441
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,119
and forget about the the mechanism of

1442
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,440
how that emerges happens so i it just

1443
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,960
like you are in your radicalness

1444
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,838
i'm uh

1445
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,960
also it seems like unfair to

1446
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:45,599
eliminate the magic of that emergent

1447
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,240
like eliminate the

1448
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,720
the fact that that the emergence is real

1449
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,799
yeah no i agree i'm not

1450
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,279
that's why i got rid of eliminative

1451
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,000
right yeah yeah because it seemed like

1452
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,760
that was trying to say that you know

1453
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,679
it's all

1454
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,240
completely like

1455
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:06,000
an illusion of some kindness well it it

1456
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:07,118
you know who knows whether there isn't

1457
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,880
there aren't some illusory

1458
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,800
characteristics there

1459
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,240
um and and

1460
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,318
i i think that uh philosophically um

1461
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,558
many people have have confronted that

1462
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:19,838
possibility over time but

1463
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,440
but uh

1464
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:22,960
it it's still

1465
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,519
important to

1466
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,519
um you know accept it as magic right so

1467
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,440
you know i think of fellini in this

1468
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,920
context i think of

1469
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:38,079
um others who have

1470
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:40,400
appreciated uh the role of magic uh of

1471
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,359
actual trickery in creating illusions

1472
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,119
that

1473
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,199
that move

1474
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,280
that move us

1475
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:50,480
you know had plato was odd to this too

1476
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,480
it's like somehow or other these shadows

1477
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,559
you know

1478
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,880
give rise to something

1479
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,400
much deeper than that and and that's

1480
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,400
that's

1481
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,559
so you know we won't try to figure out

1482
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,318
what it is we'll just accept it as given

1483
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,599
that that that occurs and um

1484
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:10,960
you know but he was still on to the

1485
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,960
magic of it yeah yeah we won't try to

1486
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,280
really really really deeply understand

1487
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,559
how it works we just enjoy the fact that

1488
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,920
it's kind of fun

1489
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,839
okay but you uh worked closely with dave

1490
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,358
around my heart

1491
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:25,519
he passed away

1492
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:26,798
as a human being what do you remember

1493
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,358
about him

1494
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:32,000
do you miss the guy

1495
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:32,000
absolutely

1496
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:38,639
you know he passed away um

1497
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,358
15 ish years ago now

1498
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:41,358
and um

1499
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:48,559
his

1500
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:51,440
his demise was actually one of the most

1501
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,640
poignant and

1502
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,760
um

1503
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:58,078
you know like relevant

1504
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:02,680
uh tragedies um

1505
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,680
relevant to our conversation he

1506
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,759
started to

1507
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:10,960
undergo a progressive

1508
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,960
neurological condition

1509
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,599
that

1510
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,599
isn't fully understood that is to say

1511
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:22,079
his particular

1512
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:22,079
course isn't fully understood um

1513
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,000
because

1514
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:28,079
certain you know brain scans weren't

1515
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,719
done in certain stages

1516
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,599
and no autopsy was done or anything like

1517
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,239
that

1518
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,400
the wishes of the family um

1519
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:39,519
so we don't know as much about the

1520
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,838
underlying pathology as we might but

1521
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:41,838
um

1522
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:49,358
i had begun to get interested in this

1523
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:51,280
neurological condition that might have

1524
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,400
been the very one that he was succumbing

1525
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,519
to

1526
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,440
as my own efforts to uh understand

1527
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:59,920
another aspect of this mystery that

1528
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,838
we've been discussing

1529
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,318
while he was beginning to get

1530
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:05,279
progressively more and more affected

1531
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:07,039
so

1532
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,480
i'm going to talk about the disorder and

1533
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:11,039
not about remember heart for a second

1534
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,960
okay sure the disorder is something my

1535
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,798
colleagues and collaborators have chosen

1536
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,119
to call

1537
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,318
semantic dementia

1538
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,599
so

1539
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:23,279
it's a specific form of

1540
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,359
loss of mind

1541
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,519
related to meaning

1542
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:30,239
semantic dementia

1543
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:33,679
and it's progressive

1544
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,679
in the sense that the patient

1545
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,280
loses the ability

1546
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,400
to

1547
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:45,680
appreciate the meaning of the

1548
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:49,440
experiences that they have either from

1549
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:50,879
touch from sight from sound

1550
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,519
from language

1551
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,440
they i hear sounds but i don't know what

1552
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,798
they mean kind of thing

1553
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,318
um

1554
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:01,599
the

1555
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:04,000
so as as this illness progresses it

1556
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:07,039
starts with

1557
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,559
the patient being unable to

1558
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:12,400
um

1559
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,760
differentiate like similar breeds of dog

1560
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,880
or

1561
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,440
remember

1562
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,680
you know the the lower frequency

1563
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,760
unfamiliar categories that they used to

1564
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:24,000
be able to remember

1565
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,799
but as it progresses

1566
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,599
it

1567
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,318
it it becomes more and more striking and

1568
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,318
and

1569
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:33,440
you know the the patient loses the

1570
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:35,039
ability to recognize

1571
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,358
um

1572
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:40,558
you know things like

1573
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:43,598
pigs and goats and sheep and calls all

1574
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,440
middle-sized animals dogs and all can't

1575
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,400
recognize rabbits and

1576
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,240
and rodents anymore they call all the

1577
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,318
little ones cats and they can't

1578
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,159
recognize

1579
00:58:51,318 --> 00:58:56,719
hippopotamuses and and cows anymore they

1580
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:59,199
call them all horses you know so

1581
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:01,358
there was this one patient who

1582
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,960
went through this progression where uh

1583
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:04,798
at a certain point

1584
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,000
any four-legged animal he would call it

1585
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:09,920
either a horse or a dog or a cat

1586
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,679
and if it was big he would tend to call

1587
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,838
it a horse if it was small he'd tend to

1588
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:16,239
call it a cat middle-sized onesie called

1589
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:16,239
dogs

1590
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,680
this is just a part of the syndrome

1591
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,920
though it

1592
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,279
the the patient loses the ability to

1593
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,639
relate

1594
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,240
uh concepts to each other so my my

1595
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:29,920
collaborator in this work carolyn

1596
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,159
patterson developed

1597
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,798
a test called the pyramids and palm

1598
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,159
trees test

1599
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,639
so

1600
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,719
you give the patient a picture of

1601
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:42,879
pyramids and they have a choice which

1602
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:46,480
goes with the pyramids

1603
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,440
palm trees or pine trees

1604
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,199
and

1605
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,159
you know she showed that this wasn't

1606
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,759
just a matter of language because

1607
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:56,000
the patient's

1608
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,400
loss of this ability shows up whether

1609
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,079
you present the material with words or

1610
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,680
with pictures the pictures

1611
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,280
they can't put the pictures together

1612
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:07,199
with each other properly anymore they

1613
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,798
can't relate the pictures to the words

1614
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:11,439
either they can't do word picture

1615
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:13,440
matching but they've lost the conceptual

1616
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,639
grounding

1617
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,720
from either modality of input and

1618
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:21,598
um so it's that's why it's called

1619
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:23,039
semantic dementia the very semantics is

1620
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,079
disintegrating

1621
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,838
and and we we understand this in terms

1622
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,480
of our

1623
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:32,318
idea that distributed representation a

1624
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,798
pattern of activation represents the

1625
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,880
concepts really similar ones as you

1626
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:39,119
degrade them they start being

1627
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,280
you lose the differences and

1628
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,880
and then um so the difference between

1629
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,119
the dog and the goat sort of is no

1630
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,079
longer part of the pattern anymore and

1631
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,480
since dog is really familiar that's the

1632
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:52,079
thing that remains and and we understand

1633
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,280
that in the way the models work and

1634
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,240
learn but

1635
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,798
but remember heart underwent this this

1636
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:00,639
condition so on the one hand it's a

1637
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:02,798
fascinating aspect of parallel

1638
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:06,480
distributed processing to me

1639
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:09,119
uh and it reveals this uh this sort of

1640
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,519
texture of distributed representation

1641
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:13,119
in a very nice way i've always felt but

1642
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,199
at the same time it was extremely

1643
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,039
poignant because

1644
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:19,118
this is exactly the condition that romal

1645
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:22,239
heart was undergoing and there was a

1646
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:24,400
period of time when he was

1647
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:26,558
this man who had been the most

1648
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,480
focused

1649
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,798
um

1650
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,440
goal-directed

1651
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:35,759
competitive

1652
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,760
um

1653
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,920
thoughtful

1654
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:46,000
person who was willing to work for years

1655
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:46,000
to solve a hard problem you know he

1656
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,880
he he starts to disappear

1657
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,879
and

1658
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:55,760
there was a period of time when it was

1659
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:55,759
like

1660
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,519
hard for any of us to really appreciate

1661
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,799
that he was sort of in some sense

1662
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:04,880
not

1663
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:07,599
fully there anymore do you know if he

1664
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,599
was able to introspect

1665
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:12,798
this um

1666
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,798
the solution of this you know the the

1667
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:17,358
understanding mind

1668
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:20,000
was he i mean this is one of the big

1669
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,759
scientists that thinks about this yeah

1670
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,559
was he able to look at himself and

1671
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,520
understand the fading mind

1672
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:29,200
you know

1673
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:31,599
um we can we can contrast um

1674
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:34,078
hawking and normal heart in this way and

1675
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,760
i i like to do that to honor rummelhart

1676
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,440
because i think rummelhart is sort of

1677
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,200
like the hawking of

1678
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,039
you know cognitive science to me in some

1679
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:42,558
ways um

1680
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:45,039
but both of them

1681
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,079
suffered from a degenerative

1682
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,160
condition

1683
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,000
and in hawking's case it affected the

1684
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:52,399
motor system

1685
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,719
in in romelhart's case it's it's

1686
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,160
affecting the semantics

1687
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,679
uh and

1688
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:58,798
um

1689
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:02,159
not

1690
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:05,440
not just the pure uh object semantics

1691
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:08,000
but maybe the self semantics as well and

1692
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:11,200
we don't understand that

1693
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,480
broadly but but but it's

1694
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:16,879
so i would say uh he didn't and this was

1695
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,639
part of what from the outside was a

1696
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,519
profound tragedy

1697
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:21,920
but

1698
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:24,798
but on the other hand at some level he

1699
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,200
sort of did because

1700
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:29,679
you know there was a period of time when

1701
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:31,838
it finally was realized that he had

1702
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:33,919
really become

1703
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:36,078
profoundly impaired this was clearly a

1704
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,119
biological condition and he wasn't you

1705
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,880
know it wasn't just like he was

1706
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,079
distracted that day or something like

1707
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,240
that

1708
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:44,240
so he retired

1709
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:47,038
uh you know from his professorship at

1710
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:49,919
stanford and he became

1711
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,359
um he he

1712
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,000
uh lived with his brother for a couple

1713
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:57,358
years and then he moved into a

1714
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,519
a facility for people with um

1715
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:00,960
cognitive impairments

1716
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:01,679
um

1717
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,039
a

1718
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,038
one that

1719
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:08,880
you know many elderly people end up in

1720
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,880
when they have cognitive impairments and

1721
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,480
i

1722
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:15,038
would spend time with him during that

1723
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,039
period this was like in the late 90s

1724
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,160
around 2000 even

1725
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,119
and

1726
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:22,239
you know i would we would go

1727
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,280
bowling

1728
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:28,000
and he could still bowl

1729
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:30,880
uh and um

1730
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,639
i after bowling i took him to lunch and

1731
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,559
i i said

1732
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:37,118
where would you like to go you want to

1733
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,400
go to wendy's and he said nah

1734
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,039
and i said okay well where you want to

1735
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,318
go and he he just pointed he's turn here

1736
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,240
you know so

1737
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:46,000
he still had a certain amount of spatial

1738
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:47,679
cognition and he could get me to the

1739
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,318
restaurant

1740
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:53,598
and then when we got to the restaurant

1741
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:54,639
i i said what do you want to order and

1742
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,760
um

1743
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:56,960
he couldn't

1744
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,799
come up with any of the words but he

1745
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,559
knew where on the menu the thing was

1746
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:03,920
that he wanted so

1747
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:05,680
so fascinating it's it you know and

1748
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,400
he couldn't say what it was but he knew

1749
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:10,798
that that's what he wanted to eat and

1750
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:14,079
and so there was you know that

1751
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:17,119
it's it's it's like it isn't monolithic

1752
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:19,039
at all this the our cognition is

1753
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,960
is

1754
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,960
you know first of all graded in certain

1755
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,519
kinds of ways but also

1756
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,039
multipartite there's many elements to it

1757
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:28,000
and things

1758
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,160
uh

1759
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,239
certain sort of

1760
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:33,519
partial competencies still exist in the

1761
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:37,038
absence of

1762
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:39,280
of other aspects of these competencies

1763
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,400
so this is what always fascinated me

1764
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,599
about

1765
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,798
what

1766
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:44,838
uh

1767
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:46,719
used to be called cognitive

1768
01:05:44,838 --> 01:05:48,838
neuropsychology

1769
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:52,159
you know the effects of brain damage on

1770
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:54,719
cognition but in particular this gradual

1771
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:57,838
disintegration part you know i'm a big

1772
01:05:54,719 --> 01:06:00,239
believer that the loss of a

1773
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:02,000
human being that you value is as

1774
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:04,399
powerful as you know first falling in

1775
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,239
love with that human being i think

1776
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,960
it's all a celebration of the human

1777
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,719
being so the disintegration itself too

1778
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,280
is a celebration yeah

1779
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:16,318
yeah yeah and

1780
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,559
but just to say something more about

1781
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:22,480
the scientists and and the back

1782
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,839
propagation idea that you mentioned um

1783
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:27,639
so

1784
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:27,639
in in 1982

1785
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,280
hinton had been there as a postdoc and

1786
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,720
organized that conference he'd actually

1787
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,119
gone away and gotten an assistant

1788
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:41,038
professorship and then

1789
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:44,400
um there was this opportunity to bring

1790
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:48,319
him back so jeff hinton was back

1791
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:50,880
on a sabbatical san diego in san diego

1792
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:52,719
and uh remember heart and i had decided

1793
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,160
we wanted to do this

1794
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:56,159
you know we thought it was really

1795
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:58,480
exciting and

1796
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,239
um our the papers on the interactive

1797
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,240
activation model that i was telling you

1798
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:04,558
about had just been published and we

1799
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:05,838
both sort of saw a huge potential for

1800
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,079
this work and

1801
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:09,279
and and jeff was there and so the three

1802
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:10,880
of us

1803
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,880
uh

1804
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,960
started a research group which we called

1805
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,920
the pdp research group

1806
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,838
and

1807
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,318
several other people

1808
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:22,159
came um francis crick

1809
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:24,159
who was at the salk institute heard

1810
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:27,038
about it from jeff

1811
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:29,038
um and because jeff was known among

1812
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,640
brits to be brilliant and francis was

1813
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,920
well connected with his british con

1814
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,480
friends so

1815
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:38,000
francis crick came and a heck of a group

1816
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:40,480
of people wow and uh uh several as paul

1817
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,960
spalensky um was one of the other

1818
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,798
postdocs he was still there as a postdoc

1819
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:48,798
and

1820
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:48,798
a few other people but anyway

1821
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,798
jeff

1822
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:56,719
talk to us about

1823
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:57,519
learning

1824
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:01,038
and

1825
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:01,038
how we should think about

1826
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:08,318
how you know learning occurs in

1827
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,960
a neural network and he said

1828
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:12,318
the problem

1829
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,079
with the way you guys have been

1830
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:17,679
approaching this is that you've been

1831
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:19,920
looking for inspiration from biology

1832
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:21,679
to tell you how

1833
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,520
what the rules should be for how the

1834
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,440
synapses should change the strengths of

1835
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,000
their connections how the connections

1836
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,000
should form

1837
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:34,079
he said that's the wrong way to go about

1838
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:36,960
it what you should do is you should

1839
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:36,960
think in terms of

1840
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,000
how you can

1841
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,279
adjust connection weights

1842
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,039
to solve

1843
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:48,000
a problem

1844
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:50,079
so you define your problem

1845
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,759
and then you figure out

1846
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:55,198
how the adjustment of the connection

1847
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:56,238
weights will solve the problem

1848
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,798
and

1849
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:59,759
removal heart heard that

1850
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:02,798
and

1851
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:04,640
said to himself okay so i'm going to

1852
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:07,679
start thinking about it that way i'm

1853
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,119
going to

1854
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,039
essentially

1855
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:12,079
imagine that i have some objective

1856
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,119
function

1857
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:17,679
some goal of the computation i want my

1858
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:20,079
machine to correctly classify all of

1859
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:22,319
these images

1860
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:24,640
and i can score that i can measure how

1861
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:27,520
well they're doing on each image and i

1862
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:29,279
get some measure of law error or loss

1863
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,719
it's typically called in in deep

1864
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,560
learning

1865
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:35,039
and um

1866
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,679
i'm going to figure out how to adjust

1867
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:41,278
the connection weights so as to minimize

1868
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:43,520
my loss or reduce the error

1869
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,719
uh and

1870
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,359
that's called

1871
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:48,399
you know gradient descent

1872
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,400
and

1873
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:52,238
engineers were already

1874
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:53,679
familiar with the concept of gradient

1875
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,599
descent

1876
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:57,440
and in fact

1877
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,199
there was an algorithm

1878
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:01,519
called the delta rule

1879
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:03,759
that had been invented

1880
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,320
by

1881
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,600
a professor in the engineering

1882
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:08,719
electrical engineering department at

1883
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,560
stanford

1884
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,239
uh woodrow bernie woodrow and a

1885
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,960
collaborator named hoff i don't never

1886
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:18,879
met him anyway so

1887
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,640
so gradient descent in continuous

1888
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,960
neural networks with multiple

1889
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,560
neuron-like processing units was already

1890
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,880
understood

1891
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,880
um

1892
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,840
for a single layer of connection weights

1893
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,480
we have some inputs over a set of

1894
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,000
neurons we want the output to produce a

1895
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:38,158
certain pattern

1896
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,960
we can define the difference between our

1897
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:42,559
target and what the narrow network is

1898
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,079
producing and we can figure out how to

1899
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,120
change the connection weights to reduce

1900
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:48,238
that error

1901
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:49,760
so what rommelhard did was to generalize

1902
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:51,359
that

1903
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,920
so as to be able to change the

1904
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:55,519
connections from earlier layers of units

1905
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,600
to the ones

1906
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,960
at a hidden layer between the input and

1907
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,920
the output

1908
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,560
and

1909
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,560
so he first called the algorithm the

1910
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,360
generalized delta rule because it's just

1911
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,400
an extension of the gradient descent

1912
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:10,960
idea

1913
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:13,198
and interestingly enough

1914
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,359
hinton was thinking that this wasn't

1915
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:18,719
going to work very well

1916
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:21,119
so hinton had his own alternative

1917
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,239
algorithm at the time

1918
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:24,319
based on

1919
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:26,238
the concept of the balsa machine that he

1920
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:28,399
was pursuing so the paper on the balsa

1921
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:31,839
machine came out in learning in bolster

1922
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:33,839
machines came out in 1985

1923
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,960
but it turned out that

1924
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,800
backprop

1925
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:39,520
worked better than the bolster machine

1926
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,239
learning algorithm so this generalized

1927
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,880
delta algorithm ended up being called

1928
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:46,079
back propagation as you say back prop

1929
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,440
yeah

1930
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:48,399
and

1931
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:50,879
the

1932
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:54,559
you know probably that name is opaque to

1933
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:56,880
maybe what what does that mean

1934
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,199
what it what it meant was that in order

1935
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,039
to figure out what the changes you

1936
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:03,039
needed to make to the

1937
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:04,158
connections from the input to the hidden

1938
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:05,840
layer

1939
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:09,439
you had to

1940
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:11,520
back propagate the error signals

1941
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:12,799
from the output layer through the

1942
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:16,080
connections

1943
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,920
from the hidden layer to the output

1944
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:19,679
to get the signals

1945
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,039
that would be the error signals for the

1946
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,119
hidden layer

1947
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:24,719
and that's how rimmel hard formulated it

1948
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:26,399
was like well we know what the air

1949
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,640
signals are at the output layer let's

1950
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:30,559
see if we can get a signal at the hidden

1951
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,360
layer that tells each hidden unit what

1952
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:38,000
its error signal is essentially so it's

1953
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:40,000
back propagating through the connections

1954
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,920
from the hidden to the output to get the

1955
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,920
signals to tell the hidden units how to

1956
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:47,279
change their weights from the input and

1957
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,279
that's why it's called back problems

1958
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,480
yeah but

1959
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:55,039
so it came from hinton having

1960
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:57,439
introduced the concept of you know

1961
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:58,640
define your objective function figure

1962
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:01,359
out how to

1963
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:03,440
take the derivative so that you can um

1964
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:05,279
adjust the connections so that they make

1965
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,599
progress towards your goal so stop

1966
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,599
thinking about biology for a second and

1967
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:12,880
let's start to think about optimization

1968
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,600
and computation yeah a little bit more

1969
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,640
so

1970
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,000
what about

1971
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,520
jeff hinton

1972
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,119
what

1973
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,520
you've gotten a chance to work with him

1974
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:24,158
in that little

1975
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,000
the set of people involved there is

1976
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:26,960
quite incredible the small set of people

1977
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,039
under the

1978
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,359
pdp flag

1979
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:33,198
it's just given the amount of impact

1980
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:35,599
those ideas have had over the years it's

1981
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:36,479
kind of incredible to think about but

1982
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,039
you know

1983
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:41,519
just like you said uh like yourself

1984
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:43,920
jeffrey hinton is seen as one of the

1985
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,719
not just like a seminal figure in ai but

1986
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:49,039
just a brilliant person just a like the

1987
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:51,439
horsepower of the mind is pretty high up

1988
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:53,600
there for him because he's

1989
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:56,639
just a great thinker so what kind of

1990
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,640
ideas have you

1991
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,279
learned from him have you influenced

1992
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:02,960
each other on have you debated over what

1993
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:06,238
stands out to you

1994
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:08,000
in in in the full space of ideas here at

1995
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:10,079
the intersection of computation and

1996
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,039
cognition

1997
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,559
well

1998
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:14,960
so um

1999
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:18,320
jeff has said many things to me that had

2000
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:20,719
a profound impact on my thinking

2001
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:23,119
um and he's written several articles

2002
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:25,840
which um

2003
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:27,679
uh were way ahead of their time

2004
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,480
um

2005
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,480
he uh

2006
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:37,920
he had two papers in 1981 just to give

2007
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:37,920
one example

2008
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,439
uh one of which was essentially the idea

2009
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:46,158
of transformers

2010
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:47,919
and another of which

2011
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:52,000
was a

2012
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:54,719
early paper on semantic cognition which

2013
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,719
inspired

2014
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:59,760
uh him and rummelhart and me

2015
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,039
uh

2016
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,920
throughout

2017
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:05,840
the 80s and uh

2018
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:09,600
um

2019
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:12,719
you know still uh i think sort of

2020
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:17,760
grounds my own thinking about

2021
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:20,719
um the semantic aspects of of cognition

2022
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,719
he also

2023
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:25,920
in a in a small paper that was never

2024
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:27,920
published that he wrote in 1977 you know

2025
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,520
before he actually arrived at ucsd or

2026
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,560
maybe a couple of years even before that

2027
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,159
i don't know

2028
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:38,239
uh when he was a phd student he he um

2029
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:40,879
described how a neural network could do

2030
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:43,599
recursive computation

2031
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,600
and um

2032
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:49,759
it was a very clever idea that he's

2033
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:54,319
continued to explore over time which was

2034
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,320
sort of the idea that um

2035
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:00,480
when you when you call a subroutine you

2036
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:02,319
need to save the state that you had

2037
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:03,678
when you called it so you can get back

2038
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:07,119
to where you were when you're finished

2039
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:09,760
with the subroutine and and the idea was

2040
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:12,238
that you would save the state

2041
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,719
of the calling routine by making fast

2042
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:15,839
changes to connection weights

2043
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,399
and then

2044
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,400
when you

2045
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:22,238
finished with the subroutine call those

2046
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,000
fast changes and the connection weights

2047
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:25,359
would allow you to go back to where you

2048
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,679
had been before

2049
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:30,158
and reinstate the previous context so

2050
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:31,279
that you could continue on with the

2051
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:34,000
the

2052
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:36,479
top level of the computation

2053
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,399
anyway that was part of the idea and um

2054
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,079
i always thought okay that's really you

2055
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:42,639
know he just

2056
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:45,198
he had extremely creative ideas that

2057
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,000
were uh quite a lot ahead of his time

2058
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:48,879
and

2059
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,000
many of them in the 1970s and early

2060
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,000
early 1980s

2061
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:57,840
so

2062
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,520
another thing about jeff hinton's way of

2063
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:03,840
thinking which

2064
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,840
has profoundly influenced my

2065
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,920
effort to understand human mathematical

2066
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,079
cognition

2067
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,079
is

2068
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,560
that he doesn't write too many equations

2069
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,319
and people tell stories like oh in

2070
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,080
in the hints and lab meetings you don't

2071
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:22,000
get up at the board and write equations

2072
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:23,279
like you do in everybody else's machine

2073
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,719
learning lab

2074
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:26,719
what you do is you draw a picture

2075
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:34,399
and and you know he he explains

2076
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,279
aspects of the way deep learning works

2077
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:37,198
by

2078
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,519
putting his hands together and showing

2079
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:41,678
you the shape of a ravine

2080
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:44,719
and um

2081
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,520
using that as a geometrical metaphor for

2082
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:47,359
the

2083
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:49,360
what's happening as this gradient

2084
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:51,279
descent process you're coming down the

2085
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:52,719
wall of a ravine if you take too big a

2086
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:53,920
jump you're going to jump to the other

2087
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:56,319
side

2088
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:59,679
and um so that's why we have to turn

2089
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:01,119
down the learning rate for example um

2090
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,560
and

2091
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:05,640
it it

2092
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:09,679
speaks to me of the

2093
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:13,039
fundamentally intuitive character of

2094
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:15,679
uh deep insight

2095
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:19,279
together with

2096
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:21,600
a commitment to really understanding

2097
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:21,599
um

2098
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:28,158
in a way that's

2099
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:29,599
absolutely ultimately explicit and clear

2100
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:31,679
uh

2101
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,360
but also intuitive

2102
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,119
yeah the there's certain people like

2103
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:38,399
that here's an example

2104
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:40,158
some kind of weird mix of uh visual

2105
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:41,920
and intuitive and all those kinds of

2106
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:44,479
things feynman is another example

2107
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,000
different style thinking but very unique

2108
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,158
and when you when you're around those

2109
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,479
people for me in the engineering realm

2110
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:54,000
uh there's a guy named jim keller

2111
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:56,479
who's a chip designer engineer

2112
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,840
every time i talk to him

2113
01:18:56,479 --> 01:18:59,039
it doesn't matter what we're talking

2114
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,440
about just

2115
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:03,760
having experience that unique way of

2116
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:05,279
thinking transforms you and makes your

2117
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,360
work much better

2118
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:09,679
and that's that's the magic you look at

2119
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:11,679
daniel kahneman you look at the great

2120
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:13,760
collaborations throughout the history of

2121
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:15,840
science that's the magic of that it's

2122
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:18,640
not always the exact ideas that you talk

2123
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:21,279
about but it's the process of generating

2124
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,199
those ideas being around that spending

2125
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:25,439
time with that human being you can come

2126
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:27,599
up with some brilliant work especially

2127
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:30,559
when it's cross-disciplinary as it was a

2128
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,400
little bit in your case yeah with jeff

2129
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,120
yeah um

2130
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:38,639
jeff is uh a descendant of the logician

2131
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:41,599
bool

2132
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:44,000
he comes from a long line of

2133
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,800
english academics

2134
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,679
and

2135
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,039
together with the

2136
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:51,039
um

2137
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:53,679
deeply intuitive thinking ability that

2138
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:55,039
he has he also

2139
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:56,480
um

2140
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:58,640
has uh

2141
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:00,799
you know it's been clear he's he's

2142
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:04,000
described this to me um and i think he's

2143
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,520
mentioned it from time to time in other

2144
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,679
interviews with that he's had with

2145
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,639
people um you know he's

2146
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:14,399
he's wanted to be able to sort of think

2147
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:15,359
of himself as contributing to the

2148
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:19,238
to the

2149
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:19,238
understanding of

2150
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:25,359
reasoning itself not just human

2151
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:26,559
reasoning like bull like is about logic

2152
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:29,279
right it's about

2153
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:32,800
what can we conclude from what else and

2154
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:36,319
how do we formalize that and

2155
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,840
um as a computer scientist uh

2156
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:40,479
logician

2157
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,960
philosopher you know um

2158
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:45,599
the goal is to

2159
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,560
understand how we derive truths from

2160
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,920
other

2161
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:53,280
from givens and things like this and and

2162
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,158
the work that jeff was doing in the

2163
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:57,759
um

2164
01:20:54,158 --> 01:20:59,279
early to mid 80s

2165
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,800
on something called the boltzmann

2166
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:02,238
machine was

2167
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,159
his way of

2168
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:05,839
connecting with that boolean tradition

2169
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:08,960
and bringing it

2170
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:11,920
into the more continuous probabilistic

2171
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:16,158
graded constraint satisfaction realm

2172
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:18,158
um and it was it was um

2173
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:20,479
beautiful uh

2174
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:23,439
a set of ideas linked with theoretical

2175
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:25,359
physics um and

2176
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:28,960
um

2177
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:31,439
as well as with logic and um

2178
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:33,359
it it's always been i mean i've always

2179
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:35,359
been inspired by the balsa machine too

2180
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:38,238
it's it's like well if the neurons are

2181
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:41,359
probabilistic rather than you know

2182
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:44,158
deterministic in their computations then

2183
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:46,238
you know that that maybe this somehow is

2184
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:48,479
part of the

2185
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:50,759
um

2186
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:52,718
serendipity or you know

2187
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,400
advantageousness of the moment of

2188
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:56,319
insight right

2189
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:58,238
it might not have occurred at that

2190
01:21:56,319 --> 01:22:00,158
particular instant it might be sort of

2191
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:01,439
partially the result of a stochastic

2192
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:02,638
process

2193
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:04,559
and uh

2194
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,880
and and that too is part of the magic of

2195
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,560
the emergence of uh

2196
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,319
some of these things well you're right

2197
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,639
with the bullying lineage and the the

2198
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:14,799
dream of computer science

2199
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:16,639
is uh somehow

2200
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,119
i mean i certainly think of humans this

2201
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:21,279
way that humans are one particular

2202
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:23,279
manifestation of intelligence

2203
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:24,960
that there's something bigger going on

2204
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:26,238
and you're trying to you're hoping to

2205
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,920
figure that out

2206
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:29,839
the mechanisms of intelligence the

2207
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:32,239
mechanisms of cognition are much bigger

2208
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:35,360
than just humans yeah

2209
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:37,839
so i think of um i've i started using

2210
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:40,799
the phrase computational intelligence at

2211
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:43,199
some point as to characterize the

2212
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,119
the field that i thought you know people

2213
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:47,119
like jeff hinton

2214
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:51,679
um and many of the

2215
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:51,679
of the people i know at deepmind um

2216
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,560
are are working in and where i i feel

2217
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:58,800
like i'm

2218
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,800
um

2219
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:04,559
you know i'm a i'm a kind of a

2220
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,960
human-oriented

2221
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:09,199
computational intelligence researcher in

2222
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,960
that i'm actually kind of interested in

2223
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:12,799
the human solution

2224
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,399
but at the same time i

2225
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,159
i

2226
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:19,198
i feel like

2227
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:20,638
that's that's where um a huge amount of

2228
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:23,519
the

2229
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:27,279
the excitement of deep learning actually

2230
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:30,320
lies is in the idea that

2231
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:33,519
you know we may be able to even go

2232
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:35,519
beyond what we can achieve with our own

2233
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,440
nervous systems when we

2234
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,960
build

2235
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:43,119
computational intelligences that are

2236
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:45,039
um

2237
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:47,679
you know not limited in the ways that we

2238
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:51,198
are by our own biology perhaps allowing

2239
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:53,600
us to scale the very mechanisms of human

2240
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:55,519
intelligence just increase its power

2241
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,800
through scale

2242
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,960
yes

2243
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:02,760
and and i think that that you know

2244
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,760
obviously that's the

2245
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:09,198
that's being played out massively at

2246
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:11,839
google brain at open ai and to some

2247
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:13,839
extended deep mind as well um

2248
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:18,639
i guess i shouldn't say to some extent

2249
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:21,119
yeah uh the the massive scale of the um

2250
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,400
computations that uh

2251
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:25,039
are used to

2252
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:26,559
succeed at games like go or to solve the

2253
01:24:25,039 --> 01:24:29,679
protein folding problems that they've

2254
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:32,080
been solving and so on still not as many

2255
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:34,239
uh synapses and neurons as the human

2256
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:36,479
brain so we still got

2257
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:39,198
we're still still beating them on that

2258
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:42,238
we humans are beating the ais but uh

2259
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:44,879
they're catching up qui pretty quickly

2260
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:46,959
you write about modeling of uh

2261
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:49,520
mathematical cognition so let me first

2262
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,399
ask about mathematics in general

2263
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,880
um

2264
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:54,238
there's a paper uh titled parallel

2265
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,639
distributed processing approach to

2266
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:58,718
mathematical cognition where in the

2267
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:00,719
introduction there's some beautiful

2268
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,520
discussion of mathematics

2269
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:06,399
and uh you reference there uh tristan

2270
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:08,239
needham who criticizes a narrow formal

2271
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:09,279
view of mathematics by

2272
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:12,158
liking

2273
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:15,198
the studying of mathematics as symbol

2274
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:17,119
manipulation to studying music without

2275
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:19,198
ever hearing a note

2276
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:21,039
so from that perspective

2277
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:23,919
what do you think is mathematics what is

2278
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:27,039
this world of mathematics like well i

2279
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:30,560
think of mathematics as

2280
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:32,960
a set of tools for

2281
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,560
exploring

2282
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,039
idealized

2283
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,039
worlds

2284
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,760
that

2285
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:44,079
often turn out to be

2286
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:47,280
extremely relevant to the real world but

2287
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:47,279
need not um

2288
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,440
but there are worlds in which

2289
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:59,599
objects exist with

2290
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:59,600
idealized properties

2291
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,480
and

2292
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:07,280
in which

2293
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:10,319
the relationships among them can be

2294
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:12,719
characterized with precision

2295
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:16,238
so as to allow

2296
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,239
the implications of

2297
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:23,039
certain facts to then allow you to

2298
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:24,880
derive other facts with certainty

2299
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:26,719
so

2300
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,159
you know

2301
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,679
if uh

2302
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:31,519
you have two

2303
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:35,600
triangles

2304
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:36,639
and you know that there is um

2305
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,840
uh

2306
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,319
an angle

2307
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:42,880
in the first one that has the same

2308
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:44,799
measure as an angle in the second one

2309
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,400
and you know that the lengths of the

2310
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,639
sides

2311
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:51,839
adjacent to that angle in each of the

2312
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:51,840
two triangles

2313
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,520
the corresponding sides adjacent to that

2314
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:58,079
angle are

2315
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:00,800
also have the same measure then you can

2316
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:02,319
then conclude that the triangles

2317
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,719
are

2318
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:06,799
congruent that is to say they have all

2319
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:09,039
of their properties in common

2320
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:11,360
and and that

2321
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:13,679
is something about

2322
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:14,719
triangles it's not

2323
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:17,600
a

2324
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:19,600
matter of formulas these are idealized

2325
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,360
objects

2326
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,360
in fact

2327
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:27,439
you know we built bridges out of

2328
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:29,198
triangles and uh we understand

2329
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:30,839
how to measure the height of something

2330
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:34,238
we can't climb

2331
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:37,039
by um extending these ideas about

2332
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:38,959
triangles a little further

2333
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:41,198
and um

2334
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,198
uh

2335
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:46,079
you know

2336
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,840
all of the ability to um

2337
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:51,679
get a tiny

2338
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:54,400
speck of matter launched from

2339
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:58,480
uh the planet earth to intersect with

2340
01:27:54,399 --> 01:28:01,039
some tiny tiny little body way out in

2341
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:04,158
way beyond pluto somewhere

2342
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:07,439
at exactly a predicted time and date is

2343
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:08,879
is something that depends on these ideas

2344
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:12,879
right so

2345
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:15,679
but and it's actually uh

2346
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,520
happening in the real physical world

2347
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:18,560
that these

2348
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:21,120
ideas

2349
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,719
make contact with it uh in those kinds

2350
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:24,158
of instances

2351
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:26,239
um

2352
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:27,679
and um

2353
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:30,399
so

2354
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:32,399
but you know there are these idealized

2355
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:34,479
objects these triangles or these

2356
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:35,679
distances or these points whatever they

2357
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:37,359
are

2358
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:41,119
that um

2359
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:44,158
uh allow for this um set of tools to be

2360
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:44,158
created that then

2361
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:49,039
gives human beings the uh it's this

2362
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:51,760
incredible leverage that they didn't

2363
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:55,279
have without these concepts

2364
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:57,199
and uh i think this is actually already

2365
01:28:55,279 --> 01:29:00,158
true

2366
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:00,158
when we think about

2367
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:02,559
just

2368
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,520
you know

2369
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,239
the

2370
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:08,719
natural numbers

2371
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:09,919
um i always like to include zero so i'm

2372
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:13,439
going to say

2373
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:15,279
the non-negative integers but

2374
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:17,839
that's that's the place where some

2375
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:20,158
people prefer not to include zero but uh

2376
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:22,239
yeah we like zero here natural numbers

2377
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:25,519
zero one two three four five six seven

2378
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:28,718
and so on yeah and and you know because

2379
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,920
they give you the ability to

2380
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,039
um

2381
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,239
be

2382
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:33,600
exact

2383
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:35,919
about

2384
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,920
um

2385
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:40,079
like how many sheep you have like you

2386
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,719
know i sent you out this morning there

2387
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:45,039
were 23 sheep you came back with only

2388
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,719
22. what happened yeah right

2389
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,039
the fundamental problem of physics how

2390
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:51,279
many sheep you have yeah

2391
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:53,840
it's a fundamental problem of life of

2392
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:55,279
human uh society that you damn well

2393
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,279
better bring back the same number of

2394
01:29:55,279 --> 01:30:00,399
sheep as you started with

2395
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:01,840
uh and you know it allows commerce it

2396
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:05,359
allows um

2397
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:08,400
contracts it allows the establishment of

2398
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:10,799
uh records and so on to have systems

2399
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:13,439
that allow these things to be notated

2400
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,000
but they they have um

2401
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:17,519
an inherent aboutness to them that's at

2402
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,399
this one

2403
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:23,280
at the one in the same time sort of

2404
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:26,719
abstract and idealized and generalizable

2405
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:29,119
while at the other on the other hand um

2406
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,800
potentially very very grounded and

2407
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:32,238
concrete

2408
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,360
and

2409
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:37,198
one of the things that

2410
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:38,479
makes

2411
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:39,678
for the

2412
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:43,678
incredible

2413
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:45,920
achievements of the human mind is

2414
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:48,880
the fact that humans invented these

2415
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:50,480
idealized systems that

2416
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,359
leverage

2417
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:55,599
the power of human thought

2418
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:57,759
in such a way as to allow all this kind

2419
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:00,079
of thing to happen

2420
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:02,400
and and so that's

2421
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:04,800
what mathematics to me is the

2422
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:06,638
development of systems for thinking

2423
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:10,000
about

2424
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:11,679
uh the properties and relations among uh

2425
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,840
sets of

2426
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:18,480
idealized objects and

2427
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:18,480
um uh

2428
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,719
you know the the mathematical notation

2429
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:24,000
system that

2430
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:27,279
we

2431
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,039
unfortunately focus way too much on

2432
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:31,800
is um

2433
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:33,359
just our way of

2434
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:36,960
expressing

2435
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:38,639
uh propositions about these properties

2436
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,399
right it's just just like we're talking

2437
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:42,159
with chomsky and language

2438
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:44,638
it's the thing we've invented for the

2439
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:46,000
communication of those ideas they're not

2440
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:48,560
necessarily

2441
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,800
the deep representation of those ideas

2442
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:53,360
yeah so what um

2443
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:56,639
what's uh what's a good way to model

2444
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:58,559
such powerful mathematical

2445
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:01,039
reasoning would you say what what are

2446
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,320
some ideas you have for capturing this

2447
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:04,800
in a model

2448
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:06,799
the insights that human mathematicians

2449
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:11,360
have had is

2450
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:11,360
a combination of the kind of the

2451
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:15,280
intuitive

2452
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,079
kind of

2453
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:20,000
connectionist like knowledge that makes

2454
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:22,479
it so that

2455
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,479
something

2456
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,840
is just

2457
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:27,839
like obviously true

2458
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,319
so that you don't have to think about

2459
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:35,119
why it's true

2460
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:36,399
that then makes it possible

2461
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:38,880
to then

2462
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:41,439
take the next step

2463
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:43,679
and ponder and reason and figure out

2464
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:46,399
something that you previously didn't

2465
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:49,039
have that intuition about

2466
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:51,839
it then ultimately becomes

2467
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:55,600
a part of the intuition that

2468
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,840
the next generation of

2469
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:00,079
mathematical thinkers have to ground

2470
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,960
their own thinking on so that they can

2471
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:06,719
extend the ideas even further

2472
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,719
i came across this quotation

2473
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:12,399
from i'll replace while i was

2474
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:14,319
um walking

2475
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:16,799
in the

2476
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:19,519
in the woods with my wife in a state

2477
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,360
park in northern california uh late last

2478
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:25,920
summer

2479
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:25,920
and what it said on the bench was

2480
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:29,119
it is by

2481
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:34,799
logic that we prove but by intuition

2482
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:39,279
that we discover and so what what for me

2483
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:41,360
the the essence of the of the project

2484
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:44,079
is to understand how to bring the

2485
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:46,799
intuitive connectionist

2486
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:48,079
resources to bear on

2487
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,960
letting

2488
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:52,319
the

2489
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:53,679
intuitive discovery arise

2490
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:56,000
uh

2491
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:58,960
you know from

2492
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,560
engagement in thinking with this formal

2493
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,520
system

2494
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,280
so

2495
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,040
i i think of

2496
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:06,559
you know

2497
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:09,439
the

2498
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:13,199
ability of somebody like hinton or

2499
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:15,198
newton or einstein or

2500
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:16,839
romal heart or

2501
01:34:15,198 --> 01:34:19,759
poincare

2502
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:22,719
to um

2503
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:25,679
archimedes is another example right so

2504
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:27,760
suddenly a flash of insight occurs

2505
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:29,760
it's it's like

2506
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:32,159
the

2507
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,560
constellation of all of these

2508
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:38,000
simultaneous constraints that somehow or

2509
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:41,199
other causes the mind to settle into a

2510
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,920
novel state that it never did before and

2511
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:47,799
and give rise to a new idea

2512
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,800
um that

2513
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:52,079
you know then

2514
01:34:50,079 --> 01:34:54,800
you can say okay well now how can i

2515
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:57,118
prove this you know how do i write down

2516
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:59,440
the steps of that theorem

2517
01:34:57,118 --> 01:35:02,319
that that'll allow me to make it

2518
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:03,919
rigorous and certain

2519
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:06,960
and so

2520
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,960
i feel like the

2521
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:10,638
the kinds of things that we're beginning

2522
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:12,079
to see

2523
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:15,199
um

2524
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:17,679
deep learning systems do of their own

2525
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:17,678
accord

2526
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,239
kind of gives me

2527
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:24,880
this feeling of

2528
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:24,879
of um

2529
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:29,679
i don't know hope or

2530
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,440
encouragement that

2531
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:33,840
ultimately

2532
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:35,519
it'll all

2533
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:39,520
happen

2534
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,520
so in particular as

2535
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:45,039
many people now have have

2536
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:46,238
become really interested in thinking

2537
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:48,158
about

2538
01:35:46,238 --> 01:35:51,678
you know neural networks that have been

2539
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:53,759
trained with massive amounts of

2540
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:56,399
text

2541
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,960
can be given a prompt and they can then

2542
01:35:56,399 --> 01:36:01,359
sort of generate some

2543
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:04,800
really interesting fanciful creative

2544
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:04,799
story from that prompt

2545
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:08,319
um and

2546
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:13,359
there's there's kind of like a sense

2547
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:14,559
that they've somehow synthesized

2548
01:36:13,359 --> 01:36:17,118
something

2549
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:20,320
like novel out of the

2550
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:22,158
you know all of the particulars of all

2551
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:24,158
of the billions and billions of

2552
01:36:22,158 --> 01:36:25,359
experiences that went into the training

2553
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:27,679
data

2554
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:29,839
that that gives rise to something like

2555
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:31,520
this sort of intuitive sense of what

2556
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,600
would be a

2557
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:35,600
a fun and interesting little story to

2558
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,760
tell or something like that it just sort

2559
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,840
of wells up out of the

2560
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:42,800
out of the

2561
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:44,800
letting the thing play out its own

2562
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:47,840
imagining of what

2563
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:51,520
somebody might say given this prompt as

2564
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,560
a as a input to get it to start to

2565
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,159
generate

2566
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:56,400
its own thoughts

2567
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:58,479
and and to me that that sort of

2568
01:36:56,399 --> 01:37:01,839
represents the potential of capturing

2569
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:03,439
this the intuitive side of this

2570
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,920
yeah and there's other examples i don't

2571
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:07,678
know if you find them as captivating is

2572
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:09,199
you know on the deep mind side with

2573
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,840
alpha zero

2574
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:15,198
if you study chess the kind of solutions

2575
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,920
that has come up in terms of chess it is

2576
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:18,559
it

2577
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:20,719
there's novel ideas there it feels very

2578
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,280
uh like there's brilliant moments of

2579
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:26,480
insight and the

2580
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:28,479
mechanism they use

2581
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:31,118
if you think of search as

2582
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:33,039
as maybe more towards good old-fashioned

2583
01:37:31,118 --> 01:37:35,359
ai and and then there's the connection

2584
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:36,800
is the neural network that has the

2585
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:39,039
intuition of

2586
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,520
looking at a board looking at a set of

2587
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:44,079
patterns and saying how good is this set

2588
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:46,320
of positions and the next few positions

2589
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:48,960
how good are those and that's it no

2590
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:51,439
that's just an intuition uh yeah great

2591
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,520
grandmasters have this and understanding

2592
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:55,678
positionally tactically

2593
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:58,080
how good the situation is how can it be

2594
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:59,840
improved without doing this full

2595
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:02,238
like deep search

2596
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:04,800
um and then maybe doing a little bit of

2597
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:07,118
the what uh human chess players call

2598
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,880
calculation which is the search

2599
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:11,039
taking a particular set of steps down

2600
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,880
the line to see how they unroll but

2601
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:14,319
there there is moments of genius in

2602
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,800
those systems

2603
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,799
too so that's another

2604
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:21,520
hopeful illustration

2605
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:24,000
that from neural networks can emerge

2606
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:26,239
this novel

2607
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,840
creation of an idea

2608
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:32,000
yes and i think that

2609
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,000
you know i think demas asabus is um

2610
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:38,000
you know he's spoken about those things

2611
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:39,600
he uh i heard him

2612
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,399
describe a

2613
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:44,800
move that was made in in one of the

2614
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:47,519
go matches against lisa doll in this

2615
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:50,000
very in a very similar way and

2616
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,040
um it caused me to become really excited

2617
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,399
to

2618
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:55,359
kind of collaborate with some of those

2619
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:57,519
guys at deepmind

2620
01:38:55,359 --> 01:39:01,920
um

2621
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,920
so i think though that what

2622
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:07,759
what i like to really emphasize

2623
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,760
here is

2624
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,639
one part of what i like to emphasize

2625
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:14,000
about mathematical cognition at least is

2626
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:16,239
that

2627
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,479
philosophers

2628
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:21,118
and logicians

2629
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:22,879
going back

2630
01:39:21,118 --> 01:39:26,880
three or even

2631
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:28,159
a little more than 3 000 years ago began

2632
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,960
to develop

2633
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:32,479
these formal systems

2634
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:35,198
and

2635
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:35,198
gradually

2636
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:38,960
the

2637
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,600
whole idea about

2638
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:44,800
thinking formally

2639
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:48,800
got constructed um

2640
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:50,480
and you know it's preceded euclid

2641
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:53,119
um

2642
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:55,279
certainly present in the work of thales

2643
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:56,799
and others and i'm not

2644
01:39:55,279 --> 01:39:58,639
the world's leading expert in all the

2645
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:00,000
details of that history

2646
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:03,039
but euclid's

2647
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,319
elements were the

2648
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:09,920
the kind of the touch point of a

2649
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:11,679
of a coherent document that sort of laid

2650
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:15,520
out this

2651
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:16,800
idea of an actual formal system within

2652
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:20,400
which

2653
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:21,360
these objects were characterized and the

2654
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:24,879
um

2655
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:27,198
the system of uh inference

2656
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,199
that

2657
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:32,559
um allowed

2658
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:35,039
new truths to be derived from others was

2659
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:37,119
sort of like established as a paradigm

2660
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:38,719
and

2661
01:40:37,118 --> 01:40:39,759
what

2662
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:43,439
what i

2663
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:43,440
find interesting is

2664
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:48,960
the idea that

2665
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:53,280
the ability to become

2666
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:56,639
a person who is capable of thinking

2667
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:58,319
in this abstract formal way

2668
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:00,800
is

2669
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:02,960
you know a result of the same kind of

2670
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,880
immersion

2671
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:07,198
uh in

2672
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:09,840
in experience

2673
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:11,839
thinking in that way that you know we

2674
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,920
now begin to think of our understanding

2675
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:16,079
of language as being right so

2676
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:18,880
we immerse ourselves in

2677
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:21,039
in a particular language

2678
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:23,118
in a particular world of objects and

2679
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:24,639
their relationships and we learn to talk

2680
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:27,198
about that

2681
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:29,118
and we develop intuitive understanding

2682
01:41:27,198 --> 01:41:32,479
of the real world

2683
01:41:29,118 --> 01:41:34,158
in in a similar way we can think that

2684
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:35,839
what

2685
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:38,158
academia

2686
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,319
has created for us what you know those

2687
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:42,079
early philosophers and their

2688
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:45,198
academies in

2689
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:46,639
athens and alexandria and others other

2690
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:48,638
places

2691
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:51,840
allowed was the

2692
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:51,840
development of these

2693
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:57,519
schools of thought modes of thought that

2694
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,800
that then become deeply ingrained and

2695
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,320
you know

2696
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:04,800
it becomes what it is that makes it so

2697
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:06,238
that somebody like jerry fodor would

2698
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,760
think

2699
01:42:06,238 --> 01:42:10,000
that

2700
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:13,199
um

2701
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:15,359
systematic thought is

2702
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:17,599
the essential characteristic of the

2703
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:20,799
human mind as opposed to

2704
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:23,520
a derived and an acquired characteristic

2705
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,639
that results from acculturation in a

2706
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,239
certain

2707
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:28,800
mode

2708
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:31,118
that's been invented by humans would you

2709
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:34,480
say it's more fundamental than like

2710
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:35,920
language if we start dancing if we if we

2711
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:38,638
bring chomps get back into the

2712
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,639
conversation

2713
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,359
first of all is it unfair to draw a line

2714
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,440
between mathematical

2715
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:47,039
cognition and

2716
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:49,359
language

2717
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:51,920
linguistic cognition i think that's a

2718
01:42:49,359 --> 01:42:54,000
very interesting question

2719
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,600
and i think um it's one of the ones that

2720
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,840
i'm actually very interested in right

2721
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,840
now

2722
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:04,399
but i i think the answer is

2723
01:43:02,158 --> 01:43:07,759
in important ways

2724
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:09,279
it is important to draw that line

2725
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,960
but then to come back and look at it

2726
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:12,559
again and see

2727
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:16,079
some of the subtleties and interesting

2728
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:16,080
aspects of the difference

2729
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:20,559
so

2730
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:27,519
if we think

2731
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:27,520
about chomsky himself

2732
01:43:29,198 --> 01:43:31,439
he

2733
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:37,280
was born into an academic family his

2734
01:43:35,118 --> 01:43:41,118
father was a professor of rabbinical

2735
01:43:37,279 --> 01:43:43,840
studies at a small rabbinical college in

2736
01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:43,839
philadelphia

2737
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:50,000
and

2738
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:52,719
he was deeply enculturated in

2739
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:56,639
uh

2740
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:58,239
you know a culture of thought and reason

2741
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,279
and

2742
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:00,799
brought

2743
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:04,719
to the

2744
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:05,679
effort to understand natural language

2745
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:07,760
this

2746
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:09,279
profound engagement with these formal

2747
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:10,639
systems

2748
01:44:09,279 --> 01:44:12,960
and um

2749
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:15,920
you know

2750
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:15,920
i think that

2751
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:22,880
there was tremendous power in that and

2752
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:27,039
that chomsky had some amazing insights

2753
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:27,039
into the structure of natural language

2754
01:44:27,198 --> 01:44:29,439
but

2755
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,319
that

2756
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:35,279
i'm going to use the word but there

2757
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:38,799
the actual intuitive knowledge of these

2758
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:41,920
things only goes so far and does not go

2759
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:43,279
as far as it does in people like chomsky

2760
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:45,118
himself

2761
01:44:43,279 --> 01:44:48,158
and this was something that was

2762
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:50,238
discovered in the phd dissertation of

2763
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:52,158
lila gleitman who was actually trained

2764
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:54,000
in the same linguistics department with

2765
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:57,679
chomsky

2766
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:59,520
so what lila discovered

2767
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:03,679
was that

2768
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:05,199
the intuitions that linguists had

2769
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:09,199
about

2770
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:09,198
even the meaning of a phrase

2771
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:14,079
not just about its grammar but about

2772
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:15,600
what they thought a phrase

2773
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:18,719
must mean

2774
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,679
were very different from the intuitions

2775
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:22,639
of

2776
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:24,639
an ordinary person who wasn't a formally

2777
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:26,239
trained thinker

2778
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:28,560
and

2779
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:30,238
well it recently has become much more

2780
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,480
salient i happen to have learned about

2781
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:35,039
this when i myself was a phd student at

2782
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:35,839
the university of pennsylvania but

2783
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:37,600
um

2784
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:39,119
i never knew how to put it together with

2785
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:40,239
all of my other thinking about these

2786
01:45:39,118 --> 01:45:42,639
things so

2787
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:45,198
so i actually

2788
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:47,920
currently have the hypothesis that

2789
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:50,960
formally trained linguists and other

2790
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,960
formally trained

2791
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:55,599
academics

2792
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:58,559
whether it be

2793
01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:01,199
linguistics philosophy

2794
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:04,960
cognitive science computer science

2795
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:04,960
machine learning mathematics

2796
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:12,879
have a

2797
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:14,960
mode of engagement with experience that

2798
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:16,079
is intuitively

2799
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,279
deeply

2800
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:22,639
structured to be more

2801
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:22,639
organized around

2802
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:28,158
the

2803
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:29,520
systematicity uh and

2804
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:31,279
um

2805
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,280
ability to be

2806
01:46:31,279 --> 01:46:37,279
conformed with

2807
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:39,759
the principles of a system than um

2808
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:42,719
then is actually true of the natural

2809
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:45,679
human mind without that immersion that's

2810
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:48,000
fascinating so the different fields and

2811
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:50,079
approaches with which you start to study

2812
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,719
the mind actually take you

2813
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:54,719
away from the natural operation of the

2814
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:56,880
mind so it makes it very difficult for

2815
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:59,840
you to

2816
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,560
to be somebody who introspects yes

2817
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,639
and

2818
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:04,639
you know this is where um

2819
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:07,439
uh

2820
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,719
things about

2821
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:09,839
human

2822
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:11,039
belief

2823
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,920
and

2824
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:16,000
so-called knowledge

2825
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:18,639
that we

2826
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,639
consider

2827
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:24,079
private

2828
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:27,199
not our business to

2829
01:47:24,079 --> 01:47:29,279
manipulate in others we are

2830
01:47:27,198 --> 01:47:31,118
not entitled to tell somebody else what

2831
01:47:29,279 --> 01:47:33,679
to believe about

2832
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:36,679
certain kinds of things

2833
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,679
um

2834
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:45,359
what are those beliefs well they are

2835
01:47:41,198 --> 01:47:47,519
the product of this sort of immersion

2836
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:51,359
and enculturation

2837
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:53,280
uh that is what i believe

2838
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:55,039
so and that's limiting

2839
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:58,158
it's

2840
01:47:55,039 --> 01:48:00,000
it's something to be aware of

2841
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:01,679
does that limit you from uh

2842
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,760
having a good model

2843
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:07,199
of some of cognition you can

2844
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,679
so when you look at mathematical or

2845
01:48:07,198 --> 01:48:12,719
linguistics so i mean what what is that

2846
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:14,880
line then what um

2847
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:16,800
so is chomsky unable to sneak up to the

2848
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,960
full picture of cognition are you when

2849
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:22,880
you're focusing on mathematical

2850
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:24,560
uh thinking are you also unable to do so

2851
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,960
i think you're you're right i think

2852
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:29,760
that's a great way of characterizing it

2853
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:29,760
and um

2854
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:35,599
i also think that

2855
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:39,520
um it's related to

2856
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:42,000
um the concept of beginner's mind uh

2857
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:45,119
and um

2858
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:48,000
another concept called the expert blind

2859
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:50,079
spot so

2860
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,800
the expert blind spot is much more

2861
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:55,118
prosaic seeming than than this

2862
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:57,760
point that you were just making but it's

2863
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:59,439
it's something that plagues

2864
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,520
experts

2865
01:48:59,439 --> 01:49:04,319
when they try to communicate their

2866
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:06,560
understanding to non-experts and that is

2867
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:06,559
that

2868
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:15,239
things are self-evident to them

2869
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:15,238
that

2870
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:21,920
they they can't begin to even think

2871
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:25,920
about how they could explain it to

2872
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:27,039
somebody else because it's like well

2873
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:30,000
it's just

2874
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:31,359
like so patently obvious that it must be

2875
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,479
true

2876
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:34,000
and

2877
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:36,399
um

2878
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,238
you know like

2879
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:40,399
um

2880
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:43,759
when

2881
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:47,198
kronecker said god made the natural

2882
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:51,440
numbers all else is the work of man

2883
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:54,559
he was expressing that that intuition

2884
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:57,039
that um somehow or other

2885
01:49:54,560 --> 01:50:01,360
you know the basic fundamentals of

2886
01:49:57,039 --> 01:50:04,639
discrete quantities being countable and

2887
01:50:01,359 --> 01:50:05,759
innumerable and you know indefinite in

2888
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:07,359
number

2889
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:10,800
um

2890
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:13,359
was was not something that

2891
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:13,360
had to be

2892
01:50:13,439 --> 01:50:19,598
discovered um

2893
01:50:16,238 --> 01:50:21,439
but he was wrong it turns out that

2894
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:23,279
many cognitive scientists agreed with

2895
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:24,960
him for a time there was a long period

2896
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:27,920
of time where there were

2897
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:30,000
where um you know the natural numbers

2898
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:32,560
were considered to be

2899
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,118
a part of the innate endowment of

2900
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:37,760
you know core knowledge or

2901
01:50:35,118 --> 01:50:40,158
you know to use the kind of phrases that

2902
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:42,000
spelke and and kerry use to talk about

2903
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:45,359
what they believe are the innate

2904
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:48,000
primitives of the human mind and

2905
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:49,759
um they no longer believe that they it's

2906
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,719
actually

2907
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:52,880
um

2908
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:55,520
been more or less accepted by almost

2909
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:58,000
everyone that the natural numbers are

2910
01:50:55,520 --> 01:51:00,400
actually a cultural construction

2911
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,479
and it's it's so interesting to go back

2912
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:04,479
and sort of like study those few people

2913
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:07,759
who still exist who you know who don't

2914
01:51:04,479 --> 01:51:09,759
have those systems so so this is just an

2915
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:10,560
example to me

2916
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,719
and

2917
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,880
where you know a certain mode of

2918
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:18,239
thinking about language itself or a

2919
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:21,599
certain mode of thinking about

2920
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:23,678
geometry and those kinds of relations so

2921
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:25,840
become so second nature that you don't

2922
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:27,359
know what it is that you need to teach

2923
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:29,920
[Music]

2924
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:33,118
and um

2925
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:37,279
and in fact we don't really teach it all

2926
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:39,439
that explicitly anyway and it's it's you

2927
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:39,439
know

2928
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:44,480
you take a math class the professor sort

2929
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:46,239
of teaches it to you the way they

2930
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:48,079
understand it

2931
01:51:46,238 --> 01:51:50,079
some of the students in the class sort

2932
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:51,920
of like you know they get it they start

2933
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:54,079
to get the way of thinking and they can

2934
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:55,599
actually do the problems that get

2935
01:51:54,079 --> 01:51:57,039
get put on the homework that the

2936
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:58,560
professor thinks are interesting and

2937
01:51:57,039 --> 01:52:00,479
challenging ones but

2938
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:02,400
but but

2939
01:52:00,479 --> 01:52:04,799
most of the students who don't

2940
01:52:02,399 --> 01:52:06,719
kind of engage as deeply don't ever get

2941
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,679
you know and

2942
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:09,840
we

2943
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:13,279
we think oh that man must be brilliant

2944
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:14,880
he must have this special insight but i

2945
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:17,279
you know he must have some you know

2946
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:20,400
biological sort of bit that's different

2947
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:22,639
right that makes him so that he or she

2948
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:24,960
could have that insight but i

2949
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:25,679
i'm

2950
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:27,039
i

2951
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:28,880
although i don't want to dismiss

2952
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:31,279
biological individual differences

2953
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:33,920
completely i

2954
01:52:31,279 --> 01:52:36,559
i find it much more interesting to think

2955
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:37,840
about the possibility that

2956
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:40,239
um

2957
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:42,719
you know it was that difference in the

2958
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:45,118
dinner table conversation at the chomsky

2959
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:47,840
house when he was growing up that made

2960
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:50,559
it so that he had that cast of mind

2961
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:51,840
yeah and uh there's there's a few topics

2962
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:53,199
we talked about that kind of

2963
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:55,360
interconnect

2964
01:52:53,198 --> 01:52:57,359
because because i wonder the better i

2965
01:52:55,359 --> 01:52:58,719
get at certain things

2966
01:52:57,359 --> 01:53:00,960
we humans

2967
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:05,279
the deeper we understand something

2968
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:05,279
what are you starting to then miss about

2969
01:53:05,359 --> 01:53:09,920
the rest of the world

2970
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:09,920
we talked about

2971
01:53:10,399 --> 01:53:14,879
david and his uh degenerative

2972
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:16,319
mind

2973
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,000
and

2974
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:19,279
you know when you look in the mirror and

2975
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,158
wonder

2976
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:24,800
how different am i am i cognitively from

2977
01:53:22,158 --> 01:53:27,598
the man i i was a month ago from the man

2978
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:29,360
it was a year ago like what

2979
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:30,880
you know

2980
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:32,799
if i can um

2981
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:35,760
having thought about language if i'm

2982
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:38,400
chomsky for for 10 20 years

2983
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:40,960
what am i no longer able to see what is

2984
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:44,079
in my blind spot and how big is that

2985
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:47,118
and then to somehow be able to leap back

2986
01:53:44,079 --> 01:53:48,960
out of your deep like structure that you

2987
01:53:47,118 --> 01:53:51,759
form for yourself about thinking about

2988
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:53,118
the world leap back and look at the big

2989
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:55,280
picture again

2990
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:56,319
or jump out of the your current way of

2991
01:53:55,279 --> 01:53:58,399
thinking

2992
01:53:56,319 --> 01:54:00,880
um and to be able to introspect like

2993
01:53:58,399 --> 01:54:03,439
what are the limitations of your mind

2994
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:05,440
are how is your mind less powerful than

2995
01:54:03,439 --> 01:54:08,158
you used to be or more powerful or

2996
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:10,719
different powerful in different ways so

2997
01:54:08,158 --> 01:54:12,638
that seems to be a difficult thing to do

2998
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,000
because we're living

2999
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:16,639
we're looking at the world through the

3000
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,039
lens of our mind right to step outside

3001
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:22,639
and introspect is difficult but it seems

3002
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:24,479
necessary if you want to make progress

3003
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:26,560
you know one of the

3004
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:30,079
threads of psychological research that's

3005
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:30,080
always been very um

3006
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:35,039
i don't know important to me to be aware

3007
01:54:33,198 --> 01:54:37,839
of is is is

3008
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:37,840
the idea that

3009
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:43,118
our explanations of our own behavior

3010
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:49,960
aren't necessarily

3011
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,960
um

3012
01:54:50,319 --> 01:54:54,479
actually

3013
01:54:52,399 --> 01:54:56,799
part of the causal process that caused

3014
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:59,678
that behavior to occur

3015
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:02,159
or even

3016
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:04,480
valid observations of the set of

3017
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:07,118
constraints that led to the outcome

3018
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:10,000
but they are post-hoc rationalizations

3019
01:55:07,118 --> 01:55:12,719
that we can give based on

3020
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,960
information at our disposal about what

3021
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:17,279
might have contributed to

3022
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,960
the result that we came to

3023
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:22,399
when asked

3024
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:24,158
and um so this this is an idea that

3025
01:55:22,399 --> 01:55:26,319
was introduced in a

3026
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:29,198
very important paper

3027
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:31,920
by nisbet and wilson about

3028
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:33,919
you know the limits on our ability to to

3029
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:35,440
uh be aware of

3030
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:37,760
the factors

3031
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:39,198
that cause us to make the choices that

3032
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,480
we make

3033
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:43,919
um and um

3034
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:45,118
you know

3035
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:47,840
i think it's

3036
01:55:45,118 --> 01:55:47,839
it's uh

3037
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:52,399
it's something that we really ought to

3038
01:55:50,399 --> 01:55:53,198
be much more

3039
01:55:52,399 --> 01:55:55,839
um

3040
01:55:53,198 --> 01:55:56,960
cognizant of in general as human beings

3041
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,159
is that

3042
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:02,239
our own insight into exactly why we hold

3043
01:56:00,158 --> 01:56:05,118
the beliefs that we do and we hold the

3044
01:56:02,238 --> 01:56:07,198
attitudes and make the choices and

3045
01:56:05,118 --> 01:56:09,598
and and feel the feelings that we do is

3046
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:11,598
not something that we

3047
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:15,599
um

3048
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:16,800
we totally control or totally observe

3049
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:18,000
and

3050
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:20,400
um

3051
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,639
it's subject to

3052
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:23,839
you know

3053
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:26,079
our

3054
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,960
culturally transmitted understanding of

3055
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:30,960
what it is that is the mode that we give

3056
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:34,239
to explain

3057
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:37,118
uh these things uh when asked to do so

3058
01:56:34,238 --> 01:56:38,638
as much as it is about anything else and

3059
01:56:37,118 --> 01:56:41,039
so

3060
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:43,679
even our ability to introspect and think

3061
01:56:41,039 --> 01:56:46,399
we have access to our own thoughts as a

3062
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:47,279
product of of culture and uh belief you

3063
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:49,198
know

3064
01:56:47,279 --> 01:56:52,559
practice

3065
01:56:49,198 --> 01:56:55,198
so let me ask you the big uh

3066
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:57,440
question of advice so you've

3067
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:59,678
lived an incredible life

3068
01:56:57,439 --> 01:57:01,359
in terms of the ideas you've put out

3069
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:02,880
into the world in terms of the

3070
01:57:01,359 --> 01:57:04,880
trajectory you've taken through your

3071
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:08,079
career through your life what advice

3072
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:10,880
would you give to young people today

3073
01:57:08,079 --> 01:57:13,279
in high school and college

3074
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:15,520
about um

3075
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:18,800
how to have a career or how to have a

3076
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:18,800
life they can be proud of

3077
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:27,119
finding the thing that you are

3078
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:30,238
intrinsically motivated to engage with

3079
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:31,759
and then celebrating that discovery is

3080
01:57:30,238 --> 01:57:34,000
is what

3081
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,000
uh

3082
01:57:34,079 --> 01:57:39,760
what it's all about

3083
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:42,960
when when i was in college i struggled

3084
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:44,320
with that i i um

3085
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,439
i had thought i

3086
01:57:44,319 --> 01:57:49,679
wanted to be a psychiatrist

3087
01:57:47,439 --> 01:57:52,079
because i think i was interested in

3088
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:54,560
human psychology in high school and it

3089
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:56,479
it at that time the only

3090
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:58,400
sort of information i had that had

3091
01:57:56,479 --> 01:58:00,879
anything to do with the psyche was you

3092
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:03,759
know freud and eric from and sort of

3093
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:04,960
popular psychiatry kinds of things

3094
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:06,800
and so

3095
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:08,719
well they were psychiatrists right so i

3096
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,520
had to be a psychiatrist

3097
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:11,279
and

3098
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:14,320
that meant i had to go to medical school

3099
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:15,519
and i got to college and i find myself

3100
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:16,960
taking

3101
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,880
you know

3102
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:21,198
the first semester of a three-quarter

3103
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,440
physics class and it was mechanics and

3104
01:58:21,198 --> 01:58:25,439
this was so far from what it was i was

3105
01:58:23,439 --> 01:58:27,519
interested in but it was also too early

3106
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:29,839
in the morning in the winter court

3107
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:31,199
semester so i i never made it to the

3108
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:33,039
physics class

3109
01:58:31,198 --> 01:58:35,118
um but

3110
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:37,359
i wondered about the rest of my freshman

3111
01:58:35,118 --> 01:58:40,238
year and um

3112
01:58:37,359 --> 01:58:41,679
most of my sophomore year

3113
01:58:40,238 --> 01:58:44,000
until

3114
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:46,840
uh i found myself in the midst of this

3115
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,760
situation where around

3116
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:51,840
me um there was this big revolution

3117
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:54,239
happening i was at columbia university

3118
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:56,400
in 1968 and

3119
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:58,879
the vietnam war is going on colombia's

3120
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:00,839
building a gym in morningside heights

3121
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:03,679
which is part of harlem and people are

3122
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:05,679
thinking oh the big bad rich guys are

3123
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:07,920
stealing the the

3124
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:09,118
park land that belongs to the people of

3125
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:10,800
harlem

3126
01:59:09,118 --> 01:59:12,118
and um

3127
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:14,400
you know they're part of the

3128
01:59:12,118 --> 01:59:16,158
military-industrial complex which is

3129
01:59:14,399 --> 01:59:17,759
enslaving us and sending us all off to

3130
01:59:16,158 --> 01:59:20,319
war in vietnam

3131
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:22,639
and um so there was a big revolution

3132
01:59:20,319 --> 01:59:24,639
that involved a confluence of black

3133
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:26,960
activism and

3134
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:27,760
you know sds and social justice and the

3135
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:30,800
whole

3136
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:34,800
university blew up and got shut down and

3137
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:36,719
um i got a chance to sort of think about

3138
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:39,520
why people were behaving the way they

3139
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:40,480
were in this context

3140
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,800
and

3141
01:59:40,479 --> 01:59:44,479
i you know i happen to have taken

3142
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,920
mathematical statistics

3143
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:47,919
i happened to have been taking

3144
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:50,319
psychology that quarter

3145
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:52,079
just psych one and somehow things in

3146
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:53,840
that space all

3147
01:59:52,079 --> 01:59:55,840
ran together in my mind and got me

3148
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:56,800
really excited about

3149
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:59,119
about

3150
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:00,639
asking questions about why people what

3151
01:59:59,118 --> 02:00:02,479
made certain people go into the

3152
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:03,279
buildings and not others and things like

3153
02:00:02,479 --> 02:00:05,519
that

3154
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:07,279
and so suddenly i had a path forward

3155
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:10,320
that and i had just been wandering

3156
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:12,319
around aimlessly and at the different

3157
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:13,279
points in my career you know and i think

3158
02:00:12,319 --> 02:00:15,759
okay

3159
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:17,920
well should i take this class or should

3160
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:17,920
i

3161
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:24,158
just

3162
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:24,159
read that book about

3163
02:00:25,279 --> 02:00:28,960
some idea that i want to understand

3164
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:30,399
better you know

3165
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:32,399
or should i

3166
02:00:30,399 --> 02:00:34,479
should i pursue the thing that excites

3167
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:36,638
me and interests me or should i

3168
02:00:34,479 --> 02:00:38,000
you know meet some requirement you know

3169
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:40,880
that's

3170
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,439
i always did the latter so i ended up my

3171
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:45,039
my professors in psychology

3172
02:00:43,439 --> 02:00:46,799
were

3173
02:00:45,039 --> 02:00:48,719
thought i was great they wanted me to go

3174
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:51,840
to graduate school

3175
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:54,319
um they they nominated me for phi beta

3176
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:56,239
kappa and i went to the phi beta kappa

3177
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:58,880
in the ceremony and this guy came up now

3178
02:00:56,238 --> 02:01:01,439
he said oh are you magnar summa

3179
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:04,159
i wasn't even getting honors based on my

3180
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:07,118
grades they just happened to have

3181
02:01:04,158 --> 02:01:09,439
thought i was interested enough in ideas

3182
02:01:07,118 --> 02:01:11,279
to belong to phi beta kappa so

3183
02:01:09,439 --> 02:01:14,799
i mean would it be fair to say you kind

3184
02:01:11,279 --> 02:01:16,479
of stumbled around a little bit

3185
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:19,360
through accidents of

3186
02:01:16,479 --> 02:01:21,439
too early morning of classes in physics

3187
02:01:19,359 --> 02:01:24,000
and so on until you discovered intrinsic

3188
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:25,759
motivation as you mentioned and then

3189
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:28,238
that's it it hooked you and then you

3190
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:29,760
celebrate the fact that this happens to

3191
02:01:28,238 --> 02:01:32,959
you human beings

3192
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:35,679
yeah like and what is it that made

3193
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:37,198
what i did intrinsically motivating to

3194
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:39,199
me

3195
02:01:37,198 --> 02:01:41,759
well that's interesting and i don't know

3196
02:01:39,198 --> 02:01:43,919
all the answers to it and i don't think

3197
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:46,719
uh i wanna

3198
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:51,279
i want anybody to think

3199
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:53,198
that um you should be sort of in any way

3200
02:01:51,279 --> 02:01:56,238
i don't know sanctimonious or anything

3201
02:01:53,198 --> 02:01:59,279
about it you know it's like

3202
02:01:56,238 --> 02:02:03,759
i really enjoyed doing statistical

3203
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:06,639
analysis of data i really enjoyed

3204
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:09,199
running my own experiment which was what

3205
02:02:06,639 --> 02:02:11,118
i got a chance to do in the psychology

3206
02:02:09,198 --> 02:02:12,158
department that chemistry and physics

3207
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:14,399
had never

3208
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:16,960
i never imagined that mere mortals would

3209
02:02:14,399 --> 02:02:18,879
ever do an experiment in those sciences

3210
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:21,840
except one that was in the textbook that

3211
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:24,159
you were told to do in lab class but in

3212
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:25,840
psychology we were already like even

3213
02:02:24,158 --> 02:02:28,479
when i was taking psych one it turned

3214
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:31,199
out we had our own rat and we got to

3215
02:02:28,479 --> 02:02:33,279
after two set experiments we got to okay

3216
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:35,519
do something you think of you know with

3217
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:38,479
your rat you know so

3218
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:41,599
it's the opportunity to do it myself

3219
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:44,319
yeah and and to to bring together a

3220
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:46,480
certain set of things that that engaged

3221
02:02:44,319 --> 02:02:48,399
me intrinsically

3222
02:02:46,479 --> 02:02:50,319
and and i think it it has something to

3223
02:02:48,399 --> 02:02:51,039
do with why certain people turn out to

3224
02:02:50,319 --> 02:02:53,599
be

3225
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:55,599
you know profoundly

3226
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:56,880
um

3227
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:59,199
amazing

3228
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:01,599
musical geniuses right they get immersed

3229
02:02:59,198 --> 02:03:04,719
in it at an early enough point

3230
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:07,039
and it just sort of gets into the fabric

3231
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:10,079
so my my little brother had intrinsic

3232
02:03:07,039 --> 02:03:11,760
motivation for music as we witnessed

3233
02:03:10,079 --> 02:03:12,880
when he discovered

3234
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:16,000
how

3235
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:19,039
to put records on the phonograph when he

3236
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,039
was like 13 months old and recognize

3237
02:03:19,039 --> 02:03:22,719
which one he wanted to play not because

3238
02:03:21,039 --> 02:03:24,800
he could read the labels because he

3239
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:26,960
could sort of see which ones had which

3240
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:29,039
scratches which were the different you

3241
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:31,679
know oh that's rapidly espanol and

3242
02:03:29,039 --> 02:03:33,118
that's oh wow you know and and and he

3243
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:35,118
enjoyed that that connected with him

3244
02:03:33,118 --> 02:03:37,759
somehow yeah and and there was something

3245
02:03:35,118 --> 02:03:40,799
that it fed into and

3246
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:42,880
you're extremely lucky if you have that

3247
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:44,800
and if you

3248
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:46,960
can nurture it and can let it grow and

3249
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:48,639
let it be be a important part of your

3250
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:50,319
life yeah those are those are the two

3251
02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:52,719
things is like

3252
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:55,118
be attentive enough to

3253
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:56,399
to feel it when it comes like this is

3254
02:03:55,118 --> 02:03:58,158
something special

3255
02:03:56,399 --> 02:04:00,719
i mean i don't know uh

3256
02:03:58,158 --> 02:04:01,679
for example i really

3257
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:02,960
like

3258
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:06,319
um

3259
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:08,560
tabular data like excel sheets like it

3260
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:10,719
it brings me deep joy i don't know how

3261
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:12,159
useful that is for anything but there's

3262
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:13,039
this i don't know what i'm talking about

3263
02:04:12,158 --> 02:04:14,879
exactly

3264
02:04:13,039 --> 02:04:16,238
so there's like a million

3265
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:17,199
not a million but there's a lot of

3266
02:04:16,238 --> 02:04:19,598
things

3267
02:04:17,198 --> 02:04:22,319
like that for me you have to hear that

3268
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:25,039
for yourself like be like realize this

3269
02:04:22,319 --> 02:04:26,319
is really joyful but then the other part

3270
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:29,039
that you're mentioning which is the

3271
02:04:26,319 --> 02:04:31,198
nurture is take time and stay with it

3272
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:32,319
stay with it a while and see where that

3273
02:04:31,198 --> 02:04:34,559
takes you

3274
02:04:32,319 --> 02:04:36,399
uh in life yeah and i think i think the

3275
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:39,760
um

3276
02:04:36,399 --> 02:04:42,960
the the motivational engagement results

3277
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:45,599
in the immersion that then creates the

3278
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:48,480
opportunity to obtain the expertise so

3279
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:50,560
you know that we could call it there the

3280
02:04:48,479 --> 02:04:52,879
mozart effect right i mean when i think

3281
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:55,760
about mozart i think about

3282
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:57,840
you know the person who was born

3283
02:04:55,760 --> 02:05:00,639
as the fourth member of the family's

3284
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:03,520
dream quartet right and uh

3285
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:06,000
and they handed him the violin when he

3286
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:08,239
was six weeks old all right start

3287
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,679
playing you know it's like

3288
02:05:08,238 --> 02:05:10,718
and um

3289
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:13,760
so

3290
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:16,399
the the level of immersion there was was

3291
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:17,280
amazingly profound but

3292
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:20,238
uh

3293
02:05:17,279 --> 02:05:21,840
hopefully he also had

3294
02:05:20,238 --> 02:05:23,279
you know some

3295
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:25,920
something

3296
02:05:23,279 --> 02:05:26,800
maybe this is where the more

3297
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:28,239
uh

3298
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:30,000
sort of the genetic part comes in

3299
02:05:28,238 --> 02:05:32,479
sometimes i think uh

3300
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:35,760
you know something in him resonated to

3301
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:38,399
the music so that that the synergy of

3302
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:40,239
the combination of that was so powerful

3303
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:42,319
so so that's what i really consider to

3304
02:05:40,238 --> 02:05:44,879
be the mozart effect it's sort of the

3305
02:05:42,319 --> 02:05:47,840
the synergy of something

3306
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:49,920
with with experience that that then

3307
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:52,960
results in the unique flowering of a

3308
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:53,840
particular you know mind

3309
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:56,078
um

3310
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:59,360
so i i know

3311
02:05:56,078 --> 02:06:01,198
my siblings and i are all very different

3312
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:03,679
from each other we've all gone in our

3313
02:06:01,198 --> 02:06:05,039
own different directions and you know i

3314
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:06,800
mentioned my younger brother who was

3315
02:06:05,039 --> 02:06:09,118
very musical

3316
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:10,880
um i had my other younger brother was

3317
02:06:09,118 --> 02:06:12,319
like this amazing like intuitive

3318
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:13,599
engineer

3319
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:16,000
um

3320
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:17,599
and um

3321
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,078
my sister one of my sisters was

3322
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:21,279
passionate about

3323
02:06:20,078 --> 02:06:22,078
uh

3324
02:06:21,279 --> 02:06:24,399
in

3325
02:06:22,078 --> 02:06:25,679
you know water conservation well before

3326
02:06:24,399 --> 02:06:27,519
it was a

3327
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:29,279
you know such a hugely important issue

3328
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:30,560
that it is today

3329
02:06:29,279 --> 02:06:33,198
so

3330
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:35,440
we all sort of somehow these

3331
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:37,439
find a different thing um

3332
02:06:35,439 --> 02:06:38,638
and uh i don't i don't mean to say it

3333
02:06:37,439 --> 02:06:40,078
isn't

3334
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:42,239
uh

3335
02:06:40,078 --> 02:06:44,960
tied in with something about about us

3336
02:06:42,238 --> 02:06:46,638
biologically but but it's also

3337
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:48,480
when that happens where you can find

3338
02:06:46,639 --> 02:06:50,639
that then you know you can do your thing

3339
02:06:48,479 --> 02:06:52,399
and you can be excited about it

3340
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:54,560
so people can be excited about fitting

3341
02:06:52,399 --> 02:06:56,319
people on bicycles as well as excited

3342
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:58,480
about making neural networks achieve

3343
02:06:56,319 --> 02:07:01,279
insights into human cognition right yeah

3344
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:03,198
like for me personally i've always been

3345
02:07:01,279 --> 02:07:06,000
excited about

3346
02:07:03,198 --> 02:07:07,039
love and friendship between humans

3347
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,078
and

3348
02:07:07,039 --> 02:07:11,920
just like the actual experience of it

3349
02:07:10,078 --> 02:07:14,319
since i was a child just observing

3350
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:16,158
people around me and also been excited

3351
02:07:14,319 --> 02:07:18,559
about robots

3352
02:07:16,158 --> 02:07:21,039
and there's something in me that thinks

3353
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:22,880
i really would love to explore how those

3354
02:07:21,039 --> 02:07:25,760
two things combine it doesn't make any

3355
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:27,359
sense a lot of it is also timing just to

3356
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:29,679
think of your own career in your own

3357
02:07:27,359 --> 02:07:30,559
life you found yourself in certain

3358
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,039
pieces

3359
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:35,440
places that happen to involve some of

3360
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:37,279
the greatest thinkers of our time and so

3361
02:07:35,439 --> 02:07:39,919
it just worked out that like you guys

3362
02:07:37,279 --> 02:07:41,759
developed those ideas and there may be a

3363
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:44,239
lot of other people similar to you and

3364
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:46,239
they were brilliant and they never found

3365
02:07:44,238 --> 02:07:48,799
that right connection and place to where

3366
02:07:46,238 --> 02:07:50,399
they their ideas could flourish so it's

3367
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:51,599
timing its place

3368
02:07:50,399 --> 02:07:53,920
it's people

3369
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:56,480
and uh ultimately the whole ride you

3370
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:57,760
know it's uh undirected

3371
02:07:56,479 --> 02:07:59,359
can ask you about something you

3372
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:00,639
mentioned in terms of psychiatry when

3373
02:07:59,359 --> 02:08:03,759
you were younger

3374
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:04,880
because i had a similar experience

3375
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:05,760
of

3376
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:08,319
you know

3377
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:09,599
reading freud and uh called young and

3378
02:08:08,319 --> 02:08:11,039
just

3379
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:13,199
you know those kind of popular

3380
02:08:11,039 --> 02:08:15,198
psychiatry ideas

3381
02:08:13,198 --> 02:08:16,638
and that was a dream for me early on in

3382
02:08:15,198 --> 02:08:18,719
high school to

3383
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:20,800
uh like i hope to understand the human

3384
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:24,078
mind by

3385
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:27,039
i somehow psychiatry felt like

3386
02:08:24,078 --> 02:08:29,599
the right discipline for that

3387
02:08:27,039 --> 02:08:31,359
does that make you sad that psychiatry

3388
02:08:29,599 --> 02:08:34,480
is not

3389
02:08:31,359 --> 02:08:36,238
the the mechanism by which you want to

3390
02:08:34,479 --> 02:08:38,879
are able to explore the human mind so

3391
02:08:36,238 --> 02:08:39,919
for me i was a little bit disillusioned

3392
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:42,639
because

3393
02:08:39,920 --> 02:08:45,440
of how much

3394
02:08:42,639 --> 02:08:46,800
prescription medication and biochemistry

3395
02:08:45,439 --> 02:08:49,198
is involved in the discipline of

3396
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:51,360
psychiatry as opposed to the dream of

3397
02:08:49,198 --> 02:08:54,638
the the freud like

3398
02:08:51,359 --> 02:08:56,960
use the mechanisms of language to

3399
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:58,719
explore the human mind so that was a

3400
02:08:56,960 --> 02:09:00,560
little disappointing

3401
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:02,239
and and that's why i kind of went to

3402
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:04,400
computer science and thinking like maybe

3403
02:09:02,238 --> 02:09:06,319
you can explore the human mind by trying

3404
02:09:04,399 --> 02:09:10,399
to build the thing

3405
02:09:06,319 --> 02:09:13,039
yes i wasn't exposed to the um

3406
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:15,839
sort of the biomedical slash

3407
02:09:13,039 --> 02:09:18,399
pharmacological aspects of psychiatry at

3408
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:20,239
that point because um i didn't

3409
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:22,399
i dropped out of that whole

3410
02:09:20,238 --> 02:09:24,479
idea the physical pre-med that i never

3411
02:09:22,399 --> 02:09:25,519
even found out about that until much

3412
02:09:24,479 --> 02:09:28,158
later

3413
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:32,400
but you're absolutely right that's uh so

3414
02:09:28,158 --> 02:09:33,759
i was actually a member of the um

3415
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:35,519
national

3416
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:38,719
advisory

3417
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:41,280
mental health council that is to say the

3418
02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:43,679
board of scientists who advised the

3419
02:09:41,279 --> 02:09:45,039
director of the national institute of

3420
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:48,158
mental health

3421
02:09:45,039 --> 02:09:49,198
and that was around the year 2000 and in

3422
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:52,960
fact

3423
02:09:49,198 --> 02:09:55,359
um at that time the man who came in

3424
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:58,840
as the new director i had been on this

3425
02:09:55,359 --> 02:10:02,799
board for a year when he came in

3426
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:05,039
um okay

3427
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:07,840
schizophrenia is a

3428
02:10:05,039 --> 02:10:10,479
biological illness it's a lot like

3429
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:12,239
cancer we've made huge strides in curing

3430
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:13,919
cancer and that's what we're going to do

3431
02:10:12,238 --> 02:10:15,598
with schizophrenia we're going to find

3432
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:18,000
the medications

3433
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:19,119
that are going to cure this disease

3434
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:23,198
and we're not going to listen to

3435
02:10:19,118 --> 02:10:24,960
anybody's grandmother anymore and um

3436
02:10:23,198 --> 02:10:27,198
you know

3437
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:29,599
good old behavioral psychology is not

3438
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:32,078
something we're going to support any

3439
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:33,920
further and um

3440
02:10:32,078 --> 02:10:36,479
you know he

3441
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:36,480
he uh

3442
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:42,560
completely alienated me from the

3443
02:10:40,238 --> 02:10:44,399
institute and from all of its prior

3444
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:47,760
policies which had been much more

3445
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:50,399
holistic i think really at some level

3446
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:52,000
and and basically and the the other

3447
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:54,479
people on the board were like

3448
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,279
psychiatrists right

3449
02:10:54,479 --> 02:10:57,439
uh

3450
02:10:55,279 --> 02:11:00,158
very biological psychiatrist it didn't

3451
02:10:57,439 --> 02:11:03,439
pan out right that that that

3452
02:11:00,158 --> 02:11:04,238
nothing has changed in in our ability to

3453
02:11:03,439 --> 02:11:07,039
uh

3454
02:11:04,238 --> 02:11:08,479
to help people with mental illness uh

3455
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:11,198
and um

3456
02:11:08,479 --> 02:11:13,598
so 20 years later that that that

3457
02:11:11,198 --> 02:11:15,039
particular path uh was a dead end as far

3458
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:16,960
as i can tell

3459
02:11:15,039 --> 02:11:18,880
well there's some aspect to

3460
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:20,719
and sorry to romanticize

3461
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:23,279
the whole philosophical conversation

3462
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:25,520
about the human mind but to me

3463
02:11:23,279 --> 02:11:27,840
psychiatrists for time

3464
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:29,920
held the flag of

3465
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:31,679
we're the deep thinkers

3466
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:33,279
in the same way that physicists are the

3467
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:35,520
deep thinkers about the nature of

3468
02:11:33,279 --> 02:11:37,118
reality psychiatrists are the deep

3469
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:39,199
thinkers about the nature of the human

3470
02:11:37,118 --> 02:11:41,759
mind and i think that flag has been

3471
02:11:39,198 --> 02:11:42,960
taken from them and carried by people

3472
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:44,960
like you

3473
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:46,078
it's like it's more in the cognitive

3474
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:48,158
psychology

3475
02:11:46,078 --> 02:11:50,158
especially when you have a foot in the

3476
02:11:48,158 --> 02:11:52,319
computational view of the world because

3477
02:11:50,158 --> 02:11:54,319
you can both build it you can like

3478
02:11:52,319 --> 02:11:56,238
intuit about the functioning of the mind

3479
02:11:54,319 --> 02:11:57,920
by building little models

3480
02:11:56,238 --> 02:11:59,198
and be able to say mathematical things

3481
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:01,760
and then deploying those models

3482
02:11:59,198 --> 02:12:03,039
especially in computers to say does this

3483
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:04,840
actually work

3484
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:07,198
they do a little like

3485
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:09,119
experiments and then some combination of

3486
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:10,559
neuroscience where you're starting to

3487
02:12:09,118 --> 02:12:11,759
actually be able to

3488
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:13,760
observe

3489
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:15,840
you know do certain experiments on human

3490
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:16,560
beings and observe how the

3491
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:18,880
uh

3492
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:21,520
the brain is actually functioning and

3493
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:23,359
there using intuition you can start

3494
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:25,119
being the philosopher like richard

3495
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:27,359
feynman is the philosopher

3496
02:12:25,118 --> 02:12:29,439
a cognitive psychologist can become the

3497
02:12:27,359 --> 02:12:31,359
philosopher and psychiatrists become

3498
02:12:29,439 --> 02:12:33,678
much more like doctors they're like very

3499
02:12:31,359 --> 02:12:36,000
medical they help people with medication

3500
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:37,599
by biochemistry and so on but they are

3501
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,520
no longer the

3502
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:41,920
the the the book writers and the

3503
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:44,719
philosophers which of course i admire

3504
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:45,760
the i admire the richard feynman ability

3505
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:47,840
to do

3506
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:49,840
great low-level

3507
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:52,078
mathematics and physics and the

3508
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:54,639
high-level philosophy

3509
02:12:52,078 --> 02:12:58,559
yeah i think it was uh

3510
02:12:54,639 --> 02:13:01,279
frohm and young more than freud that was

3511
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:02,400
sort of initially kind of like made me

3512
02:13:01,279 --> 02:13:04,078
feel like

3513
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:06,000
oh this is really amazing and

3514
02:13:04,078 --> 02:13:08,000
interesting and i want to explore it

3515
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,078
further i actually

3516
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:14,039
when i got to college and i lost that

3517
02:13:10,078 --> 02:13:19,198
thread i i found more of it in

3518
02:13:14,039 --> 02:13:22,479
sociology and literature than i did in

3519
02:13:19,198 --> 02:13:24,879
any place else so i took quite a lot of

3520
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:27,519
both of those disciplines as an

3521
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:29,199
undergraduate

3522
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:31,119
and

3523
02:13:29,198 --> 02:13:32,799
you know i was actually deeply

3524
02:13:31,118 --> 02:13:35,118
ambivalent about

3525
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:36,800
the psychology because i was doing

3526
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:40,158
experiments

3527
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:42,639
after the initial flurry of interest in

3528
02:13:40,158 --> 02:13:45,759
why people would occupy buildings during

3529
02:13:42,639 --> 02:13:48,880
a insurrection and consider

3530
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:51,840
you know uh to be be sort of like so

3531
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:54,159
over committed to their beliefs

3532
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:55,920
but i ended up in in the psychology

3533
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:58,638
laboratory running experiments on

3534
02:13:55,920 --> 02:14:00,239
pigeons and and so i had these profound

3535
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:03,118
sort of like

3536
02:14:00,238 --> 02:14:05,598
dissonance between okay the kinds of

3537
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:07,198
issues that would be explored when i was

3538
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:08,400
thinking about

3539
02:14:07,198 --> 02:14:10,319
uh

3540
02:14:08,399 --> 02:14:12,799
what i read about in

3541
02:14:10,319 --> 02:14:15,118
in modern british literature

3542
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:17,440
um versus what i could study with my

3543
02:14:15,118 --> 02:14:18,880
pigeons in the laboratory

3544
02:14:17,439 --> 02:14:20,638
that got resolved when i went to

3545
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:23,279
graduate school and i discovered

3546
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:24,560
cognitive psychology and and so for me

3547
02:14:23,279 --> 02:14:26,559
that was uh

3548
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:27,280
that was the path out of this sort of

3549
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:29,119
like

3550
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:31,599
extremely sort of

3551
02:14:29,118 --> 02:14:33,598
um ambivalent divergence between the

3552
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:34,800
interest in the human condition and and

3553
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:36,560
uh the

3554
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:38,960
desire to do

3555
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:42,159
you know actual mechanistically oriented

3556
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:44,078
thinking about it um

3557
02:14:42,158 --> 02:14:46,158
and i think we

3558
02:14:44,078 --> 02:14:47,599
we've come a long way in that regard and

3559
02:14:46,158 --> 02:14:50,399
that uh

3560
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:52,159
is you're absolutely right that nowadays

3561
02:14:50,399 --> 02:14:53,039
this is something that's accessible to

3562
02:14:52,158 --> 02:14:55,118
people

3563
02:14:53,039 --> 02:14:57,519
through

3564
02:14:55,118 --> 02:15:00,078
the pathway in through computer science

3565
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:03,599
or the pathway in through

3566
02:15:00,078 --> 02:15:03,599
uh neuroscience

3567
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:08,560
you know you can get derailed in

3568
02:15:05,039 --> 02:15:09,599
neuroscience down to the bottom of

3569
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:11,920
the

3570
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:13,039
system where you might find the curious

3571
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:14,960
of various

3572
02:15:13,039 --> 02:15:16,639
conditions

3573
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:18,480
but you don't get a chance to think

3574
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:20,960
about the higher level stuff so it's in

3575
02:15:18,479 --> 02:15:21,678
the systems in cognitive neuroscience

3576
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,118
and

3577
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:25,520
computational

3578
02:15:23,118 --> 02:15:27,439
intelligence miasma up there at the top

3579
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:28,480
that i think these opportunities are

3580
02:15:27,439 --> 02:15:31,919
most

3581
02:15:28,479 --> 02:15:33,839
are richest uh right now and um so yes i

3582
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:35,760
am indeed blessed by having had the

3583
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,199
opportunity to

3584
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:38,400
fall into that

3585
02:15:37,198 --> 02:15:41,198
space

3586
02:15:38,399 --> 02:15:43,198
so you mentioned the human condition

3587
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:45,118
speaking which

3588
02:15:43,198 --> 02:15:47,039
you happen to be a human being who is

3589
02:15:45,118 --> 02:15:49,439
unfortunately

3590
02:15:47,039 --> 02:15:51,760
not immortal

3591
02:15:49,439 --> 02:15:54,638
that seems to be a fundamental part of

3592
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:57,440
the human condition that this riot ends

3593
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:59,440
do you think about

3594
02:15:57,439 --> 02:16:03,719
the fact that you're going to die one

3595
02:15:59,439 --> 02:16:03,719
day are you afraid of death

3596
02:16:04,399 --> 02:16:11,198
uh i i would say that i am

3597
02:16:07,599 --> 02:16:13,679
not as much afraid of death as i am of

3598
02:16:11,198 --> 02:16:16,960
um degeneration

3599
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:18,480
uh and uh i say that

3600
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:20,158
in part for

3601
02:16:18,479 --> 02:16:21,198
reasons of having

3602
02:16:20,158 --> 02:16:25,598
you know

3603
02:16:21,198 --> 02:16:26,559
seen some tragic degenerative situations

3604
02:16:25,599 --> 02:16:28,000
uh

3605
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:30,000
unfold

3606
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,198
it's exciting

3607
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:33,040
when

3608
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:34,879
you can

3609
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:38,160
continue to

3610
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:41,438
participate and uh

3611
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:43,519
feel like you're you're near the

3612
02:16:41,439 --> 02:16:45,599
the place where the

3613
02:16:43,519 --> 02:16:46,880
the wave is breaking on the shore i feel

3614
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:47,840
like you know

3615
02:16:46,879 --> 02:16:48,799
um

3616
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:50,000
and

3617
02:16:48,799 --> 02:16:53,199
and i

3618
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,200
i i think about

3619
02:16:53,439 --> 02:17:01,280
you know my own uh future potential

3620
02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:04,719
um if if i were to undergo a uh

3621
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:06,800
begin to suffer from dementia uh

3622
02:17:04,718 --> 02:17:08,558
alzheimer's disease or semantic dementia

3623
02:17:06,799 --> 02:17:09,679
or some other condition

3624
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:11,920
you know

3625
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:15,120
i would sort of gradually lose the

3626
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:17,040
thread of that ability and

3627
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:19,840
so so

3628
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:22,719
one can live on for several

3629
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:26,000
for a decade after you know

3630
02:17:22,718 --> 02:17:26,839
sort of having to retire because one no

3631
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,558
longer

3632
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:32,079
has uh

3633
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:34,239
these kinds of um abilities to engage

3634
02:17:32,079 --> 02:17:35,439
and uh i think that's the thing that i

3635
02:17:34,239 --> 02:17:39,439
feared the most

3636
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:40,880
the losing of that like that that um

3637
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:42,960
the the breaking of the way the

3638
02:17:40,879 --> 02:17:44,638
flourishing of the mind where you could

3639
02:17:42,959 --> 02:17:46,638
have these ideas and they're swimming

3640
02:17:44,638 --> 02:17:49,199
around you're able to play with them

3641
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:51,679
yeah and and and and collaborate with

3642
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:53,519
other people who you know are themselves

3643
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:56,558
uh

3644
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:58,318
um really helping to push these ideas

3645
02:17:56,558 --> 02:18:01,279
forward so

3646
02:17:58,318 --> 02:18:04,558
yeah what about the edge of the cliff

3647
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:05,920
the end i mean the the mystery of it the

3648
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:07,438
i mean

3649
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:10,558
the migrated

3650
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:12,639
sort of conception of mind and

3651
02:18:10,558 --> 02:18:14,478
you know sort of continuous sort of way

3652
02:18:12,638 --> 02:18:15,839
of thinking about most things makes it

3653
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:20,239
so that

3654
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:22,239
uh to to me the the the um

3655
02:18:20,239 --> 02:18:24,239
the discreteness of that transition is

3656
02:18:22,239 --> 02:18:26,318
less

3657
02:18:24,239 --> 02:18:28,558
less less apparent than it seems to be

3658
02:18:26,318 --> 02:18:31,519
to most people i see

3659
02:18:28,558 --> 02:18:33,199
i see yeah um

3660
02:18:31,519 --> 02:18:35,760
yeah i wonder so i don't know if you

3661
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:38,639
know the work of ernest becker and so on

3662
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:42,000
i wonder what what role mortality

3663
02:18:38,638 --> 02:18:44,239
and our ability to be cognizant of it

3664
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:48,478
and anticipate it and perhaps be afraid

3665
02:18:44,239 --> 02:18:50,079
of it what role that plays in in our

3666
02:18:48,478 --> 02:18:52,718
reasoning of the world

3667
02:18:50,079 --> 02:18:54,318
i think that it it can be motivating to

3668
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:56,318
people to think they have a limited

3669
02:18:54,318 --> 02:18:58,959
period left um

3670
02:18:56,318 --> 02:19:01,039
i think in in my own case you know it

3671
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:02,718
it's like seven or eight years ago now

3672
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:06,319
that i was

3673
02:19:02,718 --> 02:19:07,438
i was sitting around doing experiments

3674
02:19:06,318 --> 02:19:11,439
on

3675
02:19:07,439 --> 02:19:11,439
decision making that were

3676
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:15,200
satisfying in a certain way because i

3677
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:17,760
could really

3678
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:20,319
get closure on what

3679
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:21,519
whether the model fit the data perfectly

3680
02:19:20,318 --> 02:19:24,558
or not

3681
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:26,960
and i could see how one could test you

3682
02:19:24,558 --> 02:19:29,039
know the predictions in monkeys as well

3683
02:19:26,959 --> 02:19:30,718
as humans and really see what the

3684
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:32,160
neurons were doing

3685
02:19:30,718 --> 02:19:34,239
but i just

3686
02:19:32,159 --> 02:19:36,718
realized hey wait a minute you know i

3687
02:19:34,239 --> 02:19:37,679
may only have about 10 or 15 years left

3688
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:38,799
here

3689
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:40,638
and

3690
02:19:38,799 --> 02:19:42,799
i don't feel like i'm getting towards

3691
02:19:40,638 --> 02:19:44,718
the answers to the really interesting

3692
02:19:42,799 --> 02:19:47,039
questions while i'm doing this

3693
02:19:44,718 --> 02:19:49,759
this particular level of work and that's

3694
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:53,040
when i said to myself

3695
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:55,120
okay um let's pick something

3696
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:56,800
that's hard

3697
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:58,960
you know so that's when i started

3698
02:19:56,799 --> 02:20:00,478
working on mathematical cognition

3699
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:03,519
and um

3700
02:20:00,478 --> 02:20:06,159
i i think it was more in terms of well i

3701
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:08,079
got 15 more years possibly of useful

3702
02:20:06,159 --> 02:20:10,000
life left let's imagine that it's only

3703
02:20:08,079 --> 02:20:11,600
10.

3704
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,920
i'm actually getting close to the end of

3705
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:16,239
that now maybe three or four more years

3706
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:18,398
um but i'm beginning to feel like well i

3707
02:20:16,239 --> 02:20:20,398
probably have another five after that so

3708
02:20:18,398 --> 02:20:21,519
okay i'll give myself another another

3709
02:20:20,398 --> 02:20:23,519
six or eight

3710
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:25,439
um but a deadline is a little bit like

3711
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:27,760
and that's not gonna go on forever yeah

3712
02:20:25,439 --> 02:20:30,559
and so um

3713
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:32,000
so uh yeah i gotta keep um thinking

3714
02:20:30,559 --> 02:20:35,039
about the questions that i think are the

3715
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:37,359
interesting and important ones for sure

3716
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:39,200
what do you hope your legacy is

3717
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:40,159
you've done some incredible work in your

3718
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:42,880
life

3719
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:45,280
as a man as a scientist

3720
02:20:42,879 --> 02:20:47,920
when the aliens and the human

3721
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:50,000
civilization is long gone and the aliens

3722
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:51,520
are reading the encyclopedia about the

3723
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,200
human species

3724
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:55,359
what do you hope is the paragraph

3725
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:59,840
written about you

3726
02:20:55,359 --> 02:20:59,840
i would wanted to sort of highlight

3727
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:08,160
a couple things

3728
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:11,319
that i was

3729
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:11,318
you know

3730
02:21:12,398 --> 02:21:16,639
able to see

3731
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:19,359
um

3732
02:21:16,639 --> 02:21:19,358
one path

3733
02:21:20,879 --> 02:21:25,839
that was more exciting to me than the

3734
02:21:22,879 --> 02:21:28,478
one that seemed already to be there for

3735
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:30,719
a cognitive psychologist you know but

3736
02:21:28,478 --> 02:21:33,119
not for any

3737
02:21:30,719 --> 02:21:35,119
super special reason other than that i'd

3738
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:37,520
had the right context prior to that but

3739
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:40,240
that i had gone ahead and

3740
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:42,800
followed that lead you know and then i

3741
02:21:40,239 --> 02:21:44,159
forget the exact wording but i

3742
02:21:42,799 --> 02:21:46,239
i said

3743
02:21:44,159 --> 02:21:48,478
uh in this

3744
02:21:46,239 --> 02:21:52,959
preface that

3745
02:21:48,478 --> 02:21:55,599
the the joy of science is the moment in

3746
02:21:52,959 --> 02:21:57,039
which

3747
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:59,520
you know

3748
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:01,439
a partially formed thought in the mind

3749
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:02,960
of one person

3750
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:05,520
gets

3751
02:22:02,959 --> 02:22:09,358
crystallized a little better in the

3752
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:10,319
discourse and becomes the foundation

3753
02:22:09,359 --> 02:22:13,920
of

3754
02:22:10,318 --> 02:22:16,959
some exciting concrete piece of actual

3755
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:18,719
scientific progress and i feel like that

3756
02:22:16,959 --> 02:22:20,318
you know moment happened when romelu

3757
02:22:18,719 --> 02:22:22,879
heart and i were doing the interactive

3758
02:22:20,318 --> 02:22:24,879
activation model and when rommel heart

3759
02:22:22,879 --> 02:22:27,920
heard hinton talk about

3760
02:22:24,879 --> 02:22:30,000
gradient descent and

3761
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:32,398
having the objective function to guide

3762
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:33,920
the learning process and

3763
02:22:32,398 --> 02:22:36,398
um

3764
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:39,120
it it happened a lot in that period and

3765
02:22:36,398 --> 02:22:40,159
i i sort of seek that kind of thing in

3766
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:42,800
my

3767
02:22:40,159 --> 02:22:43,840
uh collaborations with my students right

3768
02:22:42,799 --> 02:22:45,039
so

3769
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:48,478
um

3770
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:49,520
you know the idea that this is a person

3771
02:22:48,478 --> 02:22:51,760
who

3772
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:53,920
contributed to science by finding

3773
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:55,520
exciting collaborative opportunities to

3774
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:56,719
engage with other people

3775
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:58,239
through

3776
02:22:56,719 --> 02:22:59,438
is something that

3777
02:22:58,239 --> 02:23:02,318
i certainly hope is part of the

3778
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:03,200
paragraph and uh like you said taking a

3779
02:23:02,318 --> 02:23:06,639
step

3780
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:09,359
maybe in directions that are not

3781
02:23:06,639 --> 02:23:11,519
not obvious so it's the the old robert

3782
02:23:09,359 --> 02:23:14,159
frost road less taken

3783
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:16,800
so maybe because you said like this

3784
02:23:14,159 --> 02:23:19,680
incomplete initial idea

3785
02:23:16,799 --> 02:23:22,159
that step you take is a little bit

3786
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:24,079
uh off the beaten path

3787
02:23:22,159 --> 02:23:25,200
if if i could just say one more thing

3788
02:23:24,079 --> 02:23:26,799
here

3789
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:28,159
i uh

3790
02:23:26,799 --> 02:23:30,559
this was something that really

3791
02:23:28,159 --> 02:23:32,959
contributed to energizing me in a way

3792
02:23:30,559 --> 02:23:34,959
that i uh

3793
02:23:32,959 --> 02:23:35,599
that i feel it would be useful to share

3794
02:23:34,959 --> 02:23:38,719
i

3795
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:42,159
uh my my phd

3796
02:23:38,719 --> 02:23:44,799
dissertation project was completely

3797
02:23:42,159 --> 02:23:45,760
empirical experimental project and i i

3798
02:23:44,799 --> 02:23:48,398
wrote

3799
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:50,079
a paper based on the the two main

3800
02:23:48,398 --> 02:23:51,599
experiments that were the core of my

3801
02:23:50,079 --> 02:23:53,840
dissertation

3802
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:54,559
and i submitted it to a journal

3803
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:56,478
and

3804
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:57,600
at the end of the paper

3805
02:23:56,478 --> 02:23:58,799
i had

3806
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:03,200
a little

3807
02:23:58,799 --> 02:24:05,920
section where i laid out my

3808
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:07,920
the beginnings of my theory about what i

3809
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:10,318
thought was going on

3810
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:12,000
that would explain the data that i had

3811
02:24:10,318 --> 02:24:14,318
collected

3812
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:17,280
and i had submitted the paper to the

3813
02:24:14,318 --> 02:24:19,199
journal of experimental psychology so

3814
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:20,720
i got back

3815
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,840
a letter from the editor saying thank

3816
02:24:20,719 --> 02:24:23,519
you very much these are great

3817
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:24,719
experiments we'd love to publish them in

3818
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:26,800
the journal

3819
02:24:24,719 --> 02:24:30,079
but what we'd like you to do is to leave

3820
02:24:26,799 --> 02:24:33,199
the theorizing to the theorists and

3821
02:24:30,079 --> 02:24:35,520
take that part out of the paper

3822
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:37,920
and so i did i took that part out of the

3823
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:37,920
paper

3824
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:46,079
but you know i almost found myself

3825
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:49,280
labeled as a non-theorist right by this

3826
02:24:46,079 --> 02:24:51,039
uh and um i could have like succumbed to

3827
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:53,040
that and said okay well i guess my job

3828
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:54,080
is to just go on and do experiments

3829
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,280
right

3830
02:24:54,079 --> 02:24:57,439
but

3831
02:24:55,280 --> 02:25:00,560
but uh

3832
02:24:57,439 --> 02:25:02,479
that's not what i wanted to do and and

3833
02:25:00,559 --> 02:25:04,478
so when i when i got to my assistant

3834
02:25:02,478 --> 02:25:06,478
professorship um

3835
02:25:04,478 --> 02:25:08,318
although i continued to do experiments

3836
02:25:06,478 --> 02:25:09,119
because i knew i had to get some papers

3837
02:25:08,318 --> 02:25:11,840
out

3838
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:13,760
i also at the end of my first year

3839
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:15,280
submitted my first article to

3840
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:17,280
psychological review which was the

3841
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:20,000
theoretical journal where i took that

3842
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:21,840
section and elaborated it and wrote it

3843
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,959
up and submitted it to them and they

3844
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:26,799
didn't accept that either but they said

3845
02:25:24,959 --> 02:25:28,719
oh this is interesting you should keep

3846
02:25:26,799 --> 02:25:30,799
thinking about it this time and then

3847
02:25:28,719 --> 02:25:33,358
that was what got me going

3848
02:25:30,799 --> 02:25:36,159
to think okay you know

3849
02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:38,318
so it's not a superhuman thing to

3850
02:25:36,159 --> 02:25:41,439
contribute to the development of theory

3851
02:25:38,318 --> 02:25:44,959
you know you don't have to be

3852
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:45,680
you can do it as a mere mortal

3853
02:25:44,959 --> 02:25:47,679
and

3854
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:52,439
the broader i think lessons don't

3855
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:52,439
succumb to the labels of a particular

3856
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:57,120
or anybody labeling you right you know

3857
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:59,040
exactly

3858
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:01,520
i mean that yeah exactly and then you

3859
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:04,160
especially as you become successful

3860
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:05,840
you'll label labels get assigned to you

3861
02:26:04,159 --> 02:26:08,559
for that you're successful for that

3862
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:10,559
connectionist cognitive scientist and

3863
02:26:08,559 --> 02:26:13,359
not a neuroscientist and then you can

3864
02:26:10,559 --> 02:26:15,840
you can completely that's just that's

3865
02:26:13,359 --> 02:26:17,760
the stories of the past you're today a

3866
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:20,398
new person that can completely

3867
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:22,478
revolutionize and totally new areas so

3868
02:26:20,398 --> 02:26:25,439
don't let those labels

3869
02:26:22,478 --> 02:26:26,559
um hold you back well let me ask the big

3870
02:26:25,439 --> 02:26:28,079
question

3871
02:26:26,559 --> 02:26:30,000
um

3872
02:26:28,079 --> 02:26:31,760
when you look at into

3873
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,359
you said it started with colombia trying

3874
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:35,680
to observe these humans and they're

3875
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:37,520
doing weird stuff and you want to know

3876
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:39,520
why are they doing this though so let's

3877
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:40,960
zoom out even bigger

3878
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:43,600
at the 100

3879
02:26:40,959 --> 02:26:45,679
plus billion people who've ever lived on

3880
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:47,760
earth

3881
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:49,120
why do you think we're all

3882
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:50,880
doing what we're doing what do you think

3883
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:53,120
is the meaning of it all the big why

3884
02:26:50,879 --> 02:26:54,318
question we seem to be very busy doing a

3885
02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:56,640
bunch of stuff

3886
02:26:54,318 --> 02:26:59,439
and we seem to be kind of directed

3887
02:26:56,639 --> 02:27:02,760
towards somewhere

3888
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:02,760
but why

3889
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:08,560
well um

3890
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:12,319
i myself think that we make meaning for

3891
02:27:08,559 --> 02:27:14,559
ourselves and that um

3892
02:27:12,318 --> 02:27:17,600
we find inspiration in the meaning that

3893
02:27:14,559 --> 02:27:20,000
other people have made in the past uh

3894
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:23,760
you know and the great

3895
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,760
uh religious thinkers uh

3896
02:27:24,159 --> 02:27:28,318
of

3897
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:30,800
the first millennium bc and

3898
02:27:28,318 --> 02:27:32,879
you know a few

3899
02:27:30,799 --> 02:27:36,639
few that came in the early part of the

3900
02:27:32,879 --> 02:27:37,759
second uh millennium uh

3901
02:27:36,639 --> 02:27:40,318
you know

3902
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:43,120
laid down some important foundations for

3903
02:27:40,318 --> 02:27:43,119
us um

3904
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:47,840
but i i i do believe that you know we

3905
02:27:46,959 --> 02:27:48,879
are

3906
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:51,600
uh

3907
02:27:48,879 --> 02:27:51,599
an emergent

3908
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:57,040
uh result of a process that happened

3909
02:27:54,239 --> 02:28:00,239
naturally without guidance and

3910
02:27:57,040 --> 02:28:01,120
um that

3911
02:28:00,239 --> 02:28:03,439
meaning

3912
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:06,560
is what we make of it

3913
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:07,680
and that the creation of

3914
02:28:06,559 --> 02:28:10,239
uh

3915
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:11,520
efforts to refine meaning in

3916
02:28:10,239 --> 02:28:14,239
um

3917
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:16,640
like religious traditions and so on

3918
02:28:14,239 --> 02:28:21,600
is just a part of the expression of that

3919
02:28:16,639 --> 02:28:24,159
of that goal that we have to

3920
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:27,920
you know not

3921
02:28:24,159 --> 02:28:31,280
not find out what the meaning is but to

3922
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:32,318
make it ourselves and um

3923
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:34,399
so

3924
02:28:32,318 --> 02:28:35,920
to me

3925
02:28:34,398 --> 02:28:37,358
it's

3926
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:39,120
something that's very

3927
02:28:37,359 --> 02:28:41,600
personal it's very

3928
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:43,280
individual it's like

3929
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:45,840
meaning will come

3930
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:49,040
for you through

3931
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:51,200
the particular combination of

3932
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:55,600
synergistic elements that are your

3933
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:57,920
fabric and your experience and your um

3934
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,520
context and your

3935
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:02,398
and um

3936
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:02,399
you know you should

3937
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:08,559
it's it's it it's all made in a in a

3938
02:29:06,478 --> 02:29:11,840
certain kind of a local context though

3939
02:29:08,559 --> 02:29:14,318
right it's what here i am at ucsd with

3940
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:15,280
this brilliant man rommel heart

3941
02:29:14,318 --> 02:29:16,398
uh

3942
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:18,000
who's

3943
02:29:16,398 --> 02:29:20,879
having

3944
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,719
you know these doubts about

3945
02:29:20,879 --> 02:29:25,119
um

3946
02:29:22,719 --> 02:29:26,959
symbolic artificial intelligence that

3947
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:29,680
resonate with my

3948
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:30,799
desire to see it grounded in the biology

3949
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:33,040
and

3950
02:29:30,799 --> 02:29:33,039
um

3951
02:29:33,359 --> 02:29:37,680
uh let's make the most of that you know

3952
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:41,280
yeah and so and so from that like little

3953
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:43,439
pocket there's some kind of uh peculiar

3954
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:46,079
little emergent process

3955
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:47,040
that then uh which is basically each one

3956
02:29:46,079 --> 02:29:49,600
of us

3957
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:51,040
each one of us humans is a kind of

3958
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:54,079
you know you think cells and they come

3959
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:55,040
together and it's an emergent process

3960
02:29:54,079 --> 02:29:58,559
that then

3961
02:29:55,040 --> 02:30:00,720
tells fancy stories about itself

3962
02:29:58,559 --> 02:30:02,478
and then gets

3963
02:30:00,719 --> 02:30:04,000
just like you said just enjoys the

3964
02:30:02,478 --> 02:30:06,879
beauty of the stories we tell about

3965
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:08,879
ourselves it's an emergent process

3966
02:30:06,879 --> 02:30:11,119
that lives for time

3967
02:30:08,879 --> 02:30:12,239
uh is defined by its local pocket and

3968
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:14,160
context

3969
02:30:12,239 --> 02:30:15,920
uh in time and space

3970
02:30:14,159 --> 02:30:17,280
and then tells pretty stories and we

3971
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:19,600
write those stories down and then we

3972
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:21,359
celebrate how nice the stories are and

3973
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:23,200
then it continues because we build

3974
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:24,000
stories on top of each other

3975
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:26,640
and

3976
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:28,079
eventually we'll colonize hopefully

3977
02:30:26,639 --> 02:30:29,519
other planets

3978
02:30:28,079 --> 02:30:31,920
other

3979
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:33,840
solar systems other galaxies and will

3980
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:35,840
tell even better stories

3981
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:37,200
but all starts uh

3982
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:38,478

speaking of

3985
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:46,559
