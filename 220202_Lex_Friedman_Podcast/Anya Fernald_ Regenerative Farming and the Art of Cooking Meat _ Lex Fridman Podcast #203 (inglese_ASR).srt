create meat that's good for people

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,679
the planet and the animals specifically

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,880
treating their animals as ethically as

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,960
possible

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,000
in this she sought to revolutionize the

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,880
meat industry

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
from the inside out she's also a scholar

12
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,879
and practitioner

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,439
of regenerative agriculture and she's a

14
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,358

description to support this podcast

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,920
as a side note let me say that i got the

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,840
chance to visit

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,640
and spend a few days with anya at

29
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,960
belcampa farms in northern california

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,759
i met many animals there from cows to

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,679
pigs

32
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,960
and saw the amazing land on which they

33
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,760
grazed

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,519
i butchered meat i watched anya cook

35
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,960
many amazing meals

36
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:13,359
i ate raw meat and cooked meat and

37
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,239
spend long hours at the bonfire talking

38
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,879
with friends

39
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,599
and listening to the sounds of nature i

40
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,319
hiked

41
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,039
swam in a cold mountain lake and slept

42
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,679
in a tent

43
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,360
underneath the stars it was an amazing

44
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,240
eye-opening experience

45
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,759
especially in my first ever visit to a

46
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,239
slaughterhouse

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,439
the term slaughterhouse is haunting in

48
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,560
itself

49
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,519
the animals i met lived a great life but

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,280
in the end

51
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,560
they were slaughtered in the most

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
ethical way possible

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,118
but slaughtered nevertheless seeing

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,239
animals with whom just the day before i

55
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,399
made a connection

56
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,519
be converted to meat that i then

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,799
consumed

58
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,280
was deeply honest to me this ethical

59
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,439
farm

60
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
valcampo represents less than one

61
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,000
percent of animals raised in the united

62
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,880
states

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,840
the rest is factory farmed i could not

64
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,000
escape the thought

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,880
of the 40 to 50 billion animals

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,478
worldwide

67
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,159
raised in terrible conditions on these

68
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,000
factory farms

69
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,400
i've spent most of my life thinking

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,639
about and being in contact with

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
human suffering but the landscape of

72
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,639
suffering in the minds of conscious

73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
beings

74
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,598
is much larger than humans i must admit

75
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,319
that i still am haunted by human

76
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,560
suffering more than animal suffering

77
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,479
perhaps i will one day see the wrong in

78
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
me drawing such a line

79
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,000
either way the visit to belcample farms

80
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,080
made me realize

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,080
that i have not thought deeply enough

82
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,920
about the ethics of my choices

83
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,840
and the choices of human civilization

84
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,799
with respect to animals

85
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
and more importantly i have not thought

86
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,400
or learned enough

87
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,919
about large-scale solutions to alleviate

88
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,080
animal suffering

89
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,359
belcampo is paving the way on this and

90
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,000
is the reason i wanted to show my

91
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
support

92
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,919
for their and anya's efforts in

93
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,120
regenerative farming

94
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,639
and ethical treatment of animals this is

95
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,039
the lex friedman podcast

96
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,839
and here is my conversation with anya

97
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,840
fernald

98
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,040
if you're watching the video version of

99
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:18,959
this and are asking yourself why we're

100
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,079
in nature right now there's actually

101
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,319
a beautiful mountain in the background

102
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,480
there's an incredible vast landscape

103
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,679
there's a farm

104
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,199
we're sitting behind a table

105
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,439
nevertheless i'm wearing a suit and tie

106
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,199
amidst nature we're at the beautiful

107
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,878
belcample farms

108
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,639
we're going to talk about that this

109
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,199
incredible place you have here but

110
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,919
you cook some meat yesterday it tasted

111
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,158
delicious

112
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,878
so i'd love to talk about just the the

113
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,439
science and art of cooking first

114
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,840
you as a chef when you think of cooking

115
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,039
is it a science or is it an art

116
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,200
art and service together probably

117
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:02,079
uh art to me because it's about

118
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,839
creating something of beauty and being

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,080
responsive and creating something that's

120
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,120
expression of creativity and love

121
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,040
cooking

122
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
also has a very strong element of

123
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,759
service and it doesn't mean necessarily

124
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,039
service to another person but like

125
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,518
service to health

126
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,358
wellness environment there's an element

127
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,280
of supporting through food

128
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,399
in how i approach cooking so it's bigger

129
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,758
than just like the

130
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,679
how the ingredients come together to

131
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,319
form a taste it's the whole pipeline

132
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,720
like

133
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,079
the fact that uh there's a lot of work

134
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,800
that went

135
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,599
into bringing the ingredients together

136
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
and then

137
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,840
you know making you uh giving you the

138
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,758
ability to make the

139
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,039
the meal and then who gets to consume

140
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,600
the meal and the whole thing

141
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,120
and you see that as service as opposed

142
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,000
to just the taste

143
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,959
yeah i also think of food as one of the

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,240
key ways that

145
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,879
we interact with our environment right

146
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,560
we

147
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,478
it's the part of our environment that

148
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,759
goes inside us most visibly right of

149
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:56,560
course we interact with our environment

150
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,160
we could have

151
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,800
skin creams that have certain things in

152
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,240
them or our clothes can then be absorbed

153
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,319
there's things in the air there's our

154
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
water and there's food right it's like

155
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,599
how we're engaging

156
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,519
in the world physiologically it's the

157
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,479
most significant way we engage in our

158
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,719
environment

159
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,319
we're extracting resources calories

160
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,800
energy from the environment of various

161
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,959
ways

162
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,280
in order to preserve our bodies

163
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,319
there's also so many feedback loops that

164
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,399
i don't think we know

165
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,360
the beginning of that our bodies are

166
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,918
picking up on

167
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,439
around nutrients available nutrients

168
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,159
immune response

169
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,759
like there's deep levels of sensory

170
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,960
evaluation

171
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,360
that lead to health and alertness and

172
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,279
wellness you you hear about this a lot

173
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,680
like with babies that you know

174
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,679
um if there's a risk of an infection

175
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,759
that a mom's breast milk will

176
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,879
help the baby develop a resistance like

177
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,560
there's this way that

178
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,918
our bodies can tune into health and

179
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,879
can't extrapolate from that in a

180
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,399
specific way but

181
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,399
think about that as an example of like

182
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,239
the many ways in which our bodies are

183
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,478
reading available nutrients and food

184
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,600
to signal other aspects of wellness and

185
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,639
health

186
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,439
that said the final

187
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,560
product of cooking is uh when done well

188
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,918
is really delicious

189
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,639
and what we yesterday was really

190
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:15,680
delicious so that aspect of it

191
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,360
bringing the ingredients together in a

192
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,918
way that tastes delicious

193
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,038
do you see that as a science art that's

194
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,038
the art of it

195
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,318
i mean the art is like creating

196
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,120
temptation

197
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,639
and indulgence and giving people pause

198
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,639
you know like giving creating experience

199
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,960
that's like so sensual and

200
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,280
like i love that about when i make

201
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,758
something really simple and beautiful

202
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,879
and delicious the way that like there's

203
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,560
that moment of silence

204
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,240
at the table and that to me is the

205
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,560
moment of art like

206
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,400
appreciation what about the build up i

207
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,478
mean we got we got to watch you make the

208
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,079
stuff over a fire so the

209
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,240
the calmness of the air i mean that's an

210
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,839
experience we don't often get to have to

211
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,680
see that experience

212
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,038
of the the prep it's the anticipation

213
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,319
like you said maybe that's the most

214
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,680
delicious part of a meal is the

215
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,280
anticipation of it

216
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,959
that's something that i'm glad you bring

217
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,959
up because it's an element that

218
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,159
with eating so many of our meals like

219
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,959
out of a bag

220
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,400
and you know the instance where you

221
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,120
start to eat the meals when the delivery

222
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,239
shows up

223
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,319
and you might smell something when you

224
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,000
open the bag right and no judgment on

225
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,400
that that's something i do too right

226
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,360
but that does take away a whole element

227
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,679
of

228
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,520
of surprise and delight and also i think

229
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
of your body's ability to prepare for it

230
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,560
you think about our most common memories

231
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,080
of childhood

232
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,079
for those of us who grew up in homes

233
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,399
with with parents who cooked is

234
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,000
smell of things cooking and it's not the

235
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,879
eating of it it's the smell of things

236
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,759
cooking

237
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,800
so why is that so memorable it's an

238
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,120
anticipatory

239
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,560
piece of food that's what you remember

240
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,240
about your experiences of food is the

241
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
moment of like sweet anticipation of

242
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,879
some of this great sensual experience

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,720
that's going to be

244
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,560
really gratifying on these emotional and

245
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,560
physical levels so i think

246
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
we're also resonating on those memories

247
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,918
because it's like

248
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,000
it's an experience of food where the

249
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,680
sensuality of it is kind of extended so

250
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,038
it's a long kind of arc of build

251
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,319
up and then you're eating it and it's

252
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:03,598
amazing and then you're enjoying it and

253
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,680
your body feels good

254
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,038
so all those pieces together it's a much

255
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
more memorable experience than just

256
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,959
grabbing the cookie

257
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,279
out of a bag right so look at our own

258
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,959
and

259
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,959
just revisit in your mind like the

260
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,239
memories of food the most compelling

261
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,719
ones it's

262
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,879
the smell yeah and then the experience

263
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,479
and then sometimes how one felt right

264
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,800
yeah and the people involved with the

265
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,159
smell so like somehow it's all tied in

266
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,879
together whether it's family or people

267
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,639
close to you

268
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,000
or even if it's just chefs there's

269
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,639
something about

270
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,158
the the personality of the human

271
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,759
involved in making the food that kind of

272
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,879
sticks with you in the memory

273
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:41,200
and for me i recently did a 72-hour fast

274
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,080
and there's a kind of sadness after you

275
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
eat

276
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,278
that it's over i think the most

277
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,279
delicious part was the

278
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,439
i went to a grocery store and just

279
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,519
actually walking around

280
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,279
and looking at food with like everything

281
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,399
looked delicious even like the crappiest

282
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,958
stuff look delicious

283
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,720
and i i missed that i i really enjoyed

284
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,439
that anticipation and then i picked out

285
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,278
the meal

286
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,040
i went home and i cooked it and the

287
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,879
whole thing took i don't know

288
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,079
maybe two three hours like the whole

289
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,838
process and that was

290
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,920
the most delicious part and the first

291
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,320
taste of course and then

292
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,439
after after it was over there's a bit of

293
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,879
a sadness

294
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
because the part i remember is the the

295
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,838
build up the anticipation

296
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,000
and then once you eat it's over

297
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,200
we kind of focus on the destination but

298
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,559
it's the whole journey

299
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,800
the whole like even if you go to a

300
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,039
restaurant it's the

301
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,479
the conversations leading up to the meal

302
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,879
and the first taste of the meal

303
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,560
that's where the joy is and if you get

304
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,000
to watch the making of that meal that's

305
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,958
incredible that's where the

306
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
the smell the visual how the ingredients

307
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,838
come together

308
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,278
and especially as we were looking over

309
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,519
the fire

310
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:51,759
like watching it the fire play

311
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,839
with the raw meat and you know over time

312
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,278
bring out the colors bring out the i

313
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
don't know like you can visually

314
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,000
associate the flavor

315
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,759
you know how it becomes uh a little bit

316
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,278
burnt on the outside you know it has a

317
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,879
crispiness to it it starts to gain that

318
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,958
crispiness and immediately

319
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,559
your past memories of the delicious

320
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,799
crispiness of various foods you've eaten

321
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,319
are somehow mapped into your

322
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,838
immediately you start to taste it

323
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,040
visually i don't know yeah that

324
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,200
experience is magical

325
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,199
it's and of course maybe it's the

326
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,480
russian thing but i'm almost like

327
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,200
saddened when it's over i think

328
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,079
fasting is gaining in popularity because

329
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,640
we're having to

330
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,838
relearn the importance of being hungry

331
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,240
yeah in anticipation and delight

332
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,480
yeah we have such a fear of hunger

333
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,519
um and that's really you know functional

334
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,879
and evolution

335
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,560
right but we have this deep fear of

336
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,159
hunger and part of the great american

337
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,359
experience has been

338
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,039
that we don't have to be afraid of

339
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,039
hunger at all because there's food

340
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,159
everywhere and it's really cheap

341
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:53,199
in all that abundance we've lost

342
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,639
this edge of hunger and we don't let

343
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
ourselves get hungry and that's

344
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,958
one thing that i learned in part of my

345
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,719
journey as a cook and chef has been

346
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,479
you know moving abroad was the first

347
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,000
time when i

348
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,480
lived out of the u.s it was the first

349
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,559
time that i regularly experienced hunger

350
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,839
because the time between meals was

351
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,078
really long

352
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,920
and that was just what everybody did and

353
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,799
so i was hungry for two hours before

354
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,159
lunch

355
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,679
and that was the first time in my life

356
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,120
that there hadn't just been regularly

357
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,039
available snacks

358
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,639
so i i wonder if they the intermittent

359
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,199
fasting and part of the popularity

360
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,879
around it

361
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,640
it i'm sure there's all these amazing

362
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,360
metabolic things that are happening but

363
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,720
also

364
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,560
people might also feel better because

365
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,720
they're really anticipating

366
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,719
and enjoying food and then if you look

367
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,800
at the feelings of fullness

368
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,800
there's a really interesting thing that

369
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:42,078
happens when you cook

370
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:45,278
and your sense of fullness which is

371
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:47,199
if you cook and you're hungry

372
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,039
the experience of being around the food

373
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,600
smelling it touching it

374
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:53,519
sampling it you'll take your hunger down

375
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,399
by 40

376
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,919
and this is my own observation but as i

377
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,679
mean we've all had the experience

378
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,879
of cooking thanksgiving and the cook

379
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,000
never kind of wants to eat that much

380
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,799
thanksgiving that's an extreme

381
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,720
experience

382
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,159
but when you really dive in and you're

383
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,759
cooking for a few hours and you're

384
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,078
smelling and smelling and smelling

385
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,958
it totally changes your threshold of

386
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,000
satiety and

387
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,479
fullness because of other sensory things

388
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,399
that are

389
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,480
happening yeah and for those of us

390
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,799
looking to you know to maintain weight

391
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,320
and

392
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,838
something to consider in this is that

393
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,160
cooking is also

394
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,680
part of the part of what your appetite

395
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,559
when you're hungry what are you hungry

396
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,719
for

397
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,479
right so we tend to think about calories

398
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,440
but when you're hungry you might also be

399
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,079
hungrier for a wider range of things

400
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,680
and it might be smells it might be

401
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,559
stopping there's other elements and

402
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,679
that's something

403
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,000
think as a cook that it's it's powerful

404
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,039
to

405
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,159
explore and be with and observe how your

406
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,399
hunger changes

407
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,439
when you're cooking well let me ask the

408
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,759
romantic question

409
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,279
when did you first fall in love with the

410
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,439
cooking

411
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,720
me falling in love with cooking was

412
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,760
about a

413
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,560
solving a problem in my family and it

414
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,919
had to do

415
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:07,199
with my mom feeling very anxious

416
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,120
about uh cooking and

417
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,320
overwhelmed frequently when it came to

418
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,240
meals and

419
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,519
i'm naturally very good at juggling a

420
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,120
lot of things

421
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,879
and it was just something i could dive

422
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,159
in and help

423
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,958
and help my dad who's very i'm very very

424
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,399
close to

425
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,199
so it was a very it was a very

426
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,919
functional role where i would see

427
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,000
this kind of crescendo of anxiety um

428
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:34,159
around meal times as a kid

429
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,600
and would be able to dive in and and

430
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:39,120
solve things

431
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,600
and i also loved women who cooked like

432
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,159
my father's mother is a great cook she

433
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,920
was

434
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,198
i remember her telling me as a kid i you

435
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,559
know i was asking her about

436
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,240
church and why she went to church and

437
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,599
she's like i mostly go to church because

438
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,639
i get to cook

439
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,159
for the for the you know potlucks and so

440
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,759
there was a there was an openness around

441
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,399
that that but she just loved to cook for

442
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,000
people and it was

443
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,440
and there was a real tenderness and

444
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,839
expression of that love

445
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,320
so seeing women in my life who had this

446
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,839
like real tenderness and

447
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,600
love that they shared through food and

448
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,760
then also being able

449
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,800
in my own home to kind of pitch in and

450
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,319
add value and

451
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,399
and help my mom and dad was

452
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,760
really powerful for me because i felt

453
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,278
like i had a superpower

454
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,039
you know i felt like oh man i just made

455
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,759
this stressful thing

456
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,799
go away um that was huge it's kind of

457
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,519
interesting i don't know if you can

458
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,159
comment on

459
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,720
especially for me growing up in russia

460
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,039
it's probably true in a lot of cultures

461
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,120
maybe every culture that food and

462
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,439
especially like in a family

463
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
the mother that cooks is the source of

464
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,079
love

465
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,600
and like ties the family together it

466
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:42,638
creates events where everyone comes

467
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,920
together

468
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,600
it's uh it's one of the only chances of

469
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,719
togetherness uh the thing that

470
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,959
bonds a family is like dinner or

471
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,480
food eating together and i don't know

472
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,958
what to do with that

473
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,800
it ties up with like dieting and so on

474
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,958
when i was on stricter diets especially

475
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,120
competing and cutting weight and stuff

476
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,879
it felt like i was almost like losing

477
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,759
opportunity to connect with friends and

478
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,838
family

479
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,759
it's interesting it almost like cultures

480
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,959
we cannot fully experience love and

481
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,039
family without

482
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,958
eating and on the flip side of that

483
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,519
eating enables us to experience

484
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,399
love and family i don't know what to do

485
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,000
with that

486
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,000
it's a tough one because there's lots of

487
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,559
layers around kind of

488
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,198
gender roles and um families changing

489
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,599
and things

490
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,559
yeah i'd say i agree around the

491
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,399
alienation

492
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,838
and i've done carnivore diet and i've

493
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,480
tried some of these extreme protocols

494
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,720
and i too

495
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,959
i suffered from loneliness you know it

496
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,600
was like doing carnivore and

497
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,439
and not being able to eat what my kids

498
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,159
ate and talk about at the same time

499
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,240
those pieces are real and i wonder with

500
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:51,360
all these diets

501
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,639
if that structure is actually helping or

502
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,959
just taking away from

503
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,480
people's kind of sensual understanding

504
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,000
um but i think that there's some rigor

505
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
around that that helps people discover

506
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,679
what's good for them

507
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,720
by eliminating and then growing towards

508
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,000
more intuitive

509
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,680
food is a good evolution from that base

510
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,120
i love to cook for people

511
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:15,519
i love to pay attention to their

512
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,480
their way of being and read what they'd

513
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,600
like to eat

514
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
and it's my my purest way of love and

515
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,720
that's for

516
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,920
everybody in my life i actually love to

517
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,079
cook for people i love

518
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,439
you know i don't i i would struggle to

519
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:28,000
be you know putting out food all the

520
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
time

521
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
it's like something for me it's a real

522
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
act of care taking so i definitely have

523
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,799
that

524
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:40,000
in my makeup um and and i definitely

525
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:42,559
notice um in times of like

526
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,360
of of real stress that's the piece that

527
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,958
drops off

528
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,560
right then and it's like if i'm unable

529
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,119
to care for myself i have a hard time

530
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,799
cooking

531
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
so it's for me it's very emotional it's

532
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:54,479
very connected to love

533
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,919
and individualistic so like focused on

534
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,759
the particular individual

535
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,519
it's almost like a journey of

536
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,919
understanding what that person

537
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,959
is excited about in the in the landscape

538
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,879
of flavors

539
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,038
like figuring that person out what they

540
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,000
like what they what they love to eat

541
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,720
yeah uh i see cooking from i mostly cook

542
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,919
for myself

543
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,838
so i see that it's almost a oh this is

544
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,839
gonna be like the worst term but like

545
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,838
an act of uh self-love

546
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,679
this is going to be clipped out but

547
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,839
that like it's almost an exploration of

548
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,120
like what brings me joy

549
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,279
and it's surprising because i usually

550
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,479
don't share because the things that

551
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,399
bring me joy

552
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,240
are the simplest ingredients like i'm

553
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,919
one of those people

554
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,720
i don't know if you can psychoanalyze me

555
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,880
because you also like basic ingredients

556
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,759
i like a single ingredient two

557
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,520
ingredients because

558
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,200
i feel like i can deeply appreciate the

559
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,759
particular ingredient then

560
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,798
i get easily distracted you know people

561
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,879
who are really good at listening to

562
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,119
music they can hear a piece of music

563
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,160
and in their mind extract the different

564
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,239
layers and enjoy

565
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,360
different layers at a time like the bass

566
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,038
the drums

567
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,879
the different layering of the piano the

568
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,319
beats and all that kind of stuff

569
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,559
that's what it means to truly enjoy

570
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,720
music to listen to a piece over and over

571
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,558
like almost like as a scholar in that

572
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,120
same way for food i just can't do more

573
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:15,440
than like three because then it's just

574
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,959
i have to give in to the chaos of it i

575
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,519
guess but when it's just a basic

576
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,038
ingredient

577
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:23,119
like just meat or just a vegetable like

578
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,319
basic grilled without sauces without any

579
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,319
of that

580
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,399
that i've discovered is what brings me a

581
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,918
lot of joy but that's boring to a lot of

582
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,080
people

583
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,679
so i usually have to be kind of private

584
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,199
about that joy

585
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,880
so but that's mine so yeah i figured

586
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,880
that out and i guess as a

587
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,679
as a chef you have to figure that out

588
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,720
about everybody that you care for

589
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,840
well also for you

590
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,000
you're very interested in things and

591
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,199
and interested in things being done well

592
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,038
and appreciating them so

593
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,200
the single ingredient also allows you to

594
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,319
control for perfection and cooking that

595
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,600
which is probably really

596
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,200
appealing to you and i think

597
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,798
sometimes i see people also in the

598
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,880
beginning of their journey of

599
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,960
culinary trying to do too many things

600
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,960
right so there's another piece too

601
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,558
that you'll notice if you recall last

602
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,319
night i grilled us the salad

603
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,079
right and then i did all those pieces

604
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,639
separately and that's something in

605
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,399
general

606
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,880
to be really attentive of when you're

607
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,919
building flavor to make sure you

608
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,640
pay attention to every piece separately

609
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,840
um you know the idea that you can okay

610
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,360
with the soup or something or stew

611
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,678
there's there's workarounds

612
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,359
but like to make a great dish that's got

613
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,000
four or five vegetables in it

614
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,000
cook them all separately to their

615
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,480
optimal deliciousness and then combine

616
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,079
them

617
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,599
so that's another way to approach that

618
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,199
is that you may also be able to look at

619
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,959
the different ingredients separately

620
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,400
and still have that sense of like

621
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,400
understanding of it

622
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,320
but there's too often that we're

623
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,480
layering together like four or five

624
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,439
things and then cooking them all at once

625
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,079
and then surprised that it's not

626
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,600
delicious

627
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,079
yeah because you can't you can't really

628
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,000
optimize on multiple variables at the

629
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,678
same time for peak

630
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,119
awesomeness and that's actually you know

631
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,480
the number one way you see this is

632
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,839
roasting a whole chicken

633
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,519
which is a really difficult it's the

634
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,959
simplest dish but it's very difficult

635
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,599
because you have the breast meat which

636
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,159
is bigger chunks they cook faster you

637
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,798
have the

638
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,000
thighs and drums which are smaller and

639
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,918
they cook slower

640
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,279
to optimize that and pay attention to it

641
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,280
and do it all right they're you're

642
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,279
actually solving for different outcomes

643
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,599
so there's a there's one example but

644
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,200
oftentimes food is less delicious with

645
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,199
multiple ingredients at the start

646
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,519
because we're not able to pay attention

647
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,759
to how each one needs to end up

648
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,679
so there's a way to parse that apart and

649
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,879
achieve a better outcome

650
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,679
i don't know if you've seen jiro dreams

651
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,360
of sushi it's a documentary about

652
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,640
yeah so there's an obsession

653
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,319
that particular first of all set of

654
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,240
humans

655
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,678
but also the particular uh cuisine

656
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,519
that focused on the basics of the

657
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,440
ingredients um

658
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,679
what do you think of that kind of trying

659
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,480
to achieve mastery through repeating

660
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,640
the making of the same meal over and

661
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,120
over and over for like decades

662
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,360
like do you find beauty in that journey

663
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:09,519
towards mastery or do you think

664
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,119
it should be always an exploration to

665
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,200
where you're always trying things

666
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,558
you're always kind of injecting new

667
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,600
flavors

668
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,359
new experiences all that kind of stuff

669
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,798
i think you have to decide on a palette

670
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,079
you know if we're talking about an art

671
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,519
it's equivalent to saying am i a

672
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,639
sculptor or a painter

673
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,879
yeah that the sushi lexicon think that's

674
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
a very very narrow small canvas that

675
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,919
you're painting on

676
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,759
and that is a beautiful road right

677
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,280
there's there's a there's a beauty and a

678
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,798
perfection to that it's like i mean

679
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,798
there's many things culturally around

680
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,839
that that you could extrapolate for

681
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:44,079
specifically for japan but i i i

682
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,439
encourage people on and the journey in

683
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,678
food to choose

684
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200
like kind of a language that they're

685
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,559
working within

686
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,798
and if you want to step out of that

687
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,119
occasionally and have one or two dishes

688
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:55,918
but if you want to get mastery with food

689
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,599
you probably

690
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,759
aren't going to be able to get more than

691
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,319
say 20 ingredients that you use

692
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,200
regularly that you really understand

693
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,599
and so we often see you know i see the

694
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,279
american pantry it's got tons of sauces

695
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,399
and tons of spices and tons of spice

696
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,319
blends

697
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,679
and then really people only use just a

698
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,279
couple things

699
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,880
and the idea that you can sort of splash

700
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,240
out and do korean one night and then

701
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,159
tacos the next time you can

702
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,679
absolutely but to get in a regular

703
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,280
cadence of specific ingredients you're

704
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,720
probably going to get more mastery with

705
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,519
that sooner

706
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,960
and i think as much as you can do to get

707
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,639
an understanding of the you know the

708
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,079
basics around salt and acid

709
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,159
and understand your palette like for me

710
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,759
it's lemon and usually sherry vinegar

711
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,919
right so that's my acid palette

712
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,759
um and i my fat palates you know suet

713
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,960
and butter olive oil so you can sort of

714
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,079
choose your language what you're

715
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,519
painting with

716
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,960
but i wouldn't splash out and say do i

717
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,359
use sesame oil yeah every once in a

718
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,880
while

719
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,759
but that's not part of my base palette

720
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,320
right can you say again what your

721
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,519
fat palate is it'd be butter suet and

722
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,720
olive oil

723
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,158
and olive oil so not uh why olive oil is

724
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,000
it your roots and illegal

725
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,080
i like the flavor for finish because of

726
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,798
the bitterness that it adds

727
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,599
so i like the bitter and acid contrast

728
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:07,359
on meat

729
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,199
and vegetables which is mostly what i

730
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,959
eat and so i love that

731
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
that that way that the bitterness and

732
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,480
astringency complements and allows the

733
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,759
flavors to come out what do you think

734
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,599
about coconut oil

735
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,038
there's i recently discovered that

736
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,119
there's a

737
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,400
i don't know there's a sweetness there's

738
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,759
something to it that

739
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,880
that i really enjoy um maybe because

740
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,599
it's new

741
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,559
it's it's good with heat and i really

742
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,678
love it for some reason

743
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,038
as a chef do you do you ever tried what

744
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,480
do you think about it i like it in

745
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,319
coffee like i like it as a

746
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,839
like a treat a little bit i find the

747
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:43,359
flavor a little bit

748
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:46,959
challenging in foods i also find that

749
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,000
it's difficult um on the quality of that

750
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,240
ingredient

751
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,359
so i've found often that i buy a high

752
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,400
quality coconut oil and there's

753
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,240
rancidity in it

754
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,840
um and i don't totally know why i think

755
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,038
it's just the cold chain and how that

756
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,639
products packaged

757
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,480
so i've had some issues with product

758
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,919
quality in that but i

759
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,240
for me it's a little bit too much

760
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,080
sweetness in my foods

761
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,440
but then again i don't cook in like a

762
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,558
southeast asian palette i try to not

763
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,519
have much sweetness in my foods in

764
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,879
general so

765
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,200
i just because of the palette that i

766
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,480
like to cook with so for me coconuts got

767
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,038
a little bit too much of those high

768
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,240
notes

769
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,240
and earthiness which is a nice

770
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,000
combination but it's more like a treat

771
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,839
yeah it is almost like a tree it has it

772
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,679
has a flavor of its own

773
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,959
that almost stands on its own like i

774
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,400
could probably just

775
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,360
eat cook that's probably the only oil i

776
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,919
could enjoy by itself

777
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:34,079
it sounds weird to say but it feels like

778
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,360
fat is often a thing that enriches the

779
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,359
flavor of something else

780
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,119
coconut can almost stand on its own you

781
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,319
might also be responding to that it's a

782
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,879
complex flavor

783
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,319
right so there's also a there's an

784
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,520
analogous

785
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,599
you know if you look at butter for

786
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,319
example a lot of the butter that we eat

787
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,480
in the u.s

788
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,359
is just sweet cream butter it's not

789
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,400
cultured

790
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,278
if you explore like a cultured fermented

791
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,440
butter

792
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,278
maybe a grass milk grass-fed and finish

793
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,400
butter you're gonna get a ton more

794
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,640
complexity

795
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,840
and so you may also just be responding

796
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,038
to having fats with

797
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:09,759
more flavor which is the

798
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,038
the journey in the u.s has been towards

799
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,278
refined foods

800
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,200
that are very neutral and then you have

801
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,278
to combine more of them to make things

802
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,440
taste like things

803
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,200
and so if you're coming from a

804
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,798
background of using mostly just

805
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,200
generic butter or let's say canola oil

806
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,960
to cook with those are very neutral oils

807
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,558
so you can also take some of your

808
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,919
favorite fats and look for versions of

809
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,480
them that are more flavorful

810
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,200
i mean i love olive oil as a treat in a

811
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,720
spoon

812
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,319
really like a good california extra

813
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,679
virgin olive oil it's like cabbage i'll

814
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,839
eat a piece of butter as a treat

815
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,038
yeah that's like or butter with salt on

816
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,439
it like good fats

817
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,558
can all of them can be if they're

818
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,278
minimally processed

819
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,720
and they're fabulous it's so delicious

820
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:48,960
right but there are things that you have

821
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,360
to

822
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,200
like look for a version of them that's

823
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,558
got that full palette of flavor well for

824
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,519
me also the flavors

825
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,599
are inextricably tied to the memories

826
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,480
i've had with those flavors so

827
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,000
for better or worse back when i used to

828
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,679
eat a lot of ice cream

829
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,278
i for some reason had a lot of pleasant

830
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,320
experience with coconut ice cream

831
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,839
so that particular flavor just permeates

832
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,678
throughout my life not like i'm stuck

833
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,399
with it uh for better or worse

834
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,278
as a flavor that brings up pleasant

835
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,919
memories

836
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,359
and i have a few such flavors i have i

837
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,400
have such relationship with all kinds of

838
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,038
meat too

839
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,000
like it's just so many pleasant memories

840
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,240
and that's it

841
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,278
like you're almost tasting the memories

842
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,640
yeah and

843
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,919
uh that there's no way to separate the

844
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,759
flavor from the memories

845
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,480
i suppose and that's a powerful thing

846
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:42,079
what's your favorite meal to cook

847
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,798
i i'll roast a couple chickens and then

848
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:47,119
i'll poach them like i'll boil them and

849
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,119
let it cool that's complicated one

850
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,959
i'll let them cool down i'll pull all

851
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,599
the meat off put the bones back into the

852
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,200
pot

853
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,879
and then cook that for like three or

854
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,038
four hours um

855
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,039
and then add in like shiitake mushrooms

856
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,480
and all the chicken meat and

857
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,400
the and they they'll throw in a bottle

858
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,480
of white wine into the into the stock as

859
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,679
well a bunch of thyme and garlic

860
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,400
and i love it because it's

861
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,360
it's the way the house smells it's very

862
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,278
laborious it's

863
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,959
soothing for me to spend time picking

864
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,038
apart me and chopping things up there's

865
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,120
like a lot of manuality around it

866
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,398
um so i'd say from a personal like i

867
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,199
mean i love grilling a steak and doing

868
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:22,319
those things as well but there's

869
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,679
something about making a

870
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,639
stock from scratch and the way it smells

871
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,640
the way i feel

872
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,679
the time it takes the kind of checking

873
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,759
in on it

874
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,679
that i really really love there's many

875
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,319
things i love to make that i don't even

876
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,000
love to

877
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,558
to eat you know i think you see this a

878
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,599
lot in like baking and bakers people who

879
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:40,960
bake a ton

880
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,719
and they love the process of it even if

881
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,360
they don't eat that many baked goods so

882
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,360
anything

883
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,879
for me that's really like enjoyable is

884
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,558
typically things like making cinnamon

885
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
buns i don't eat very many cinnamon buns

886
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:50,639
but

887
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,240
i love making them because it takes all

888
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,000
the sort of like fussing around and

889
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,440
taking your time and watching it

890
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,519
the way it smells the way the house

891
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,200
smells all of that stuff is like

892
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,200
very it's like almost like a like a

893
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,360
meditative exercise for me

894
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,880
is there a science is there an art to

895
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:05,839
cooking meat well and the different

896
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,360
kinds of meats

897
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,439
is there something you can convert into

898
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:13,599
words

899
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:16,240
in um to say ideas

900
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,199
how to bring out the best out of what

901
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,319
particular meat

902
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,240
whatever steak we're talking about

903
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,319
whatever beef we're talking about

904
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
is there something that can be said the

905
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,359
basic approach

906
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,359
to cooking any type of meat

907
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,398
beyond the artistry of it is pretty

908
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,759
scientific

909
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,959
and it's what type of muscle is it in

910
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,640
the animal

911
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,480
and what's the surface area to volume

912
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,679
ratio

913
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,720
okay so let's look at those two

914
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,559
questions so the first piece is

915
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,079
what's the type of muscle in the animal

916
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,678
what's the functionality

917
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,599
you don't necessarily need to know that

918
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,320
um to evaluate it but you need to

919
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,918
understand

920
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,439
is it a tender muscle that's not used

921
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,200
very frequently in the animal

922
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,960
or is it a big load-bearing muscle that

923
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,558
gets a lot of action like the cheek

924
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,278
right or the shin or the those pieces

925
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,798
the muscles like um those along the

926
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,398
spinal cord that make up

927
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,079
rib eyes and new york stakes and things

928
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,439
those aren't very exercised

929
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,038
they're they're right next to the spinal

930
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,558
cord spinal cord is doing most of the

931
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,480
work there they're kind of like

932
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,839
stabilizing muscles around this big

933
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,200
functional piece of

934
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,038
of skeletal structure in the animal

935
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,640
other muscles like the ones around the

936
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,079
diaphragm with the flat iron stakes and

937
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,600
skirt stakes and things those are

938
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,678
those are really functional muscles that

939
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,240
are doing a ton and moving and

940
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,720
if they're moving a lot what happens

941
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,200
well

942
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,919
functionally they've got lots of muscle

943
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,840
sheaths

944
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,679
because muscles that move frequently

945
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,639
have to do a lot of like complex

946
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,840
contraction that's why you know there's

947
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,919
um

948
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,199
in the cheek for example there's tons of

949
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,399
visible fiber of

950
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,919
like collagenous connective tissue

951
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:54,558
that connective tissue is everything

952
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,320
in how the meat cooks because connective

953
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,119
tissue doesn't respond

954
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,678
to high heat with becoming more tender

955
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,199
muscles

956
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,720
do right they can get a sear on them you

957
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,159
can cut them and eat them the collagen

958
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,399
stitches will glom up

959
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,240
and get really tough so you either have

960
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:11,678
to liquefy it with really low

961
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,880
slow heat with moisture right

962
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,159
or you have to barely cook it and that's

963
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,360
so that's the major piece that's the

964
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,039
question of like why wouldn't you just

965
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,639
throw a brisket on the grill

966
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,000
okay it's not about the fat you can cut

967
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,360
the fat out the reason you're not going

968
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,798
to throw a brisket on the grill and cook

969
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,639
it hot and fast it's got too much

970
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,879
collagenous connective tissue in it

971
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,399
those are these giant muscles that have

972
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,919
all this collagen and these fibers and

973
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,759
tendons in them effectively

974
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,399
so you're never going to be able to just

975
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,158
cook that up hot fast so that's the

976
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,398
first piece it's like what where's this

977
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,278
muscle in the architecture of the animal

978
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,038
and then

979
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,798
what does that mean for what's going on

980
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,679
in the muscle

981
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,278
and that's actually more important than

982
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,720
fat content we get really

983
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:52,319
kind of we pay a lot of attention to fat

984
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,600
content in muscles

985
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,960
you can make a steak tender if it

986
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,079
doesn't have a ton of fat in it it

987
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,440
actually has more to do if

988
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,678
there's if there's collagen and

989
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,960
connective tissue in it

990
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,200
that's fascinating i never even thought

991
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,159
about that i just

992
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,120
i thought it kind of uh universe i mean

993
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,440
adds to the

994
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,158
the texture of the meat the chewiness of

995
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,798
the meat

996
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,200
but you're saying it's also adds to uh

997
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:15,519
how

998
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,679
heat how it reacts to heat how the

999
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,919
entirety of the meat reacts to heat

1000
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,679
and the fat is not as important to that

1001
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,120
as the the calories the fat will make

1002
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,038
the flavor more delicious

1003
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,879
right like it'll add punctuousness and

1004
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,038
mouth feel and things like that but

1005
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,720
the all the connective tissue in meat

1006
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,158
and in some of the cuts like that we ate

1007
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
a skirt steak last night you could see a

1008
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,360
web

1009
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,360
of that collagen sheath on the outside

1010
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,719
on a ribeye that same collagen sheath is

1011
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,158
this big there's only one it goes around

1012
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,000
the outside okay because it's just

1013
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,440
that muscle there's one large muscle

1014
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,398
fiber so

1015
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,798
that specific it's a myelin sheath right

1016
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,119
that's

1017
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,240
that material needs moisture and low and

1018
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:52,719
slow heat to become

1019
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,880
tender the other side of that is that

1020
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,720
when it becomes tender it liquefies

1021
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,960
and it adds all this beautiful

1022
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,240
gelatinous consistency that's what bone

1023
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,798
broth is that's why

1024
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,759
like a slow cooked pork shoulder is so

1025
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,519
delicious

1026
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,798
it's not that it's full of all that fat

1027
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,720
that fat's also great but

1028
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,319
a lot of that mouth feel comes from that

1029
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,798
really beautiful

1030
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,079
dissolved collagen so when you're

1031
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,440
looking like how do i understand

1032
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,439
how i'm going to cook a piece of meat

1033
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,558
that first fork in the road is

1034
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,120
how is this going to respond to heat and

1035
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,398
what's the appropriate cooking technique

1036
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,359
then the second piece

1037
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,079
is that surface area to volume ratio and

1038
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,918
that's

1039
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,079
important because the heat is going to

1040
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,000
impact the meat through the surfaces

1041
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,678
of the meat that are in contact with the

1042
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,278
heat

1043
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,679
so if i have a steak that's three inches

1044
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,119
thick i'm going to cook it extremely

1045
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,600
diff differently from my

1046
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,199
from a steak that's a half inch thick or

1047
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,879
three quarters of an inch thick

1048
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,880
and that's the major and that's the

1049
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,360
truth if i have a piece of pork shoulder

1050
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,640
that's cut into cubes versus having a

1051
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,639
whole pork shoulder

1052
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,038
that surface area to volume ratio that's

1053
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,840
going to totally change how i cook it

1054
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:03,919
and same things like pot roast and a

1055
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,839
beef stew would be the same cut of meat

1056
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,360
right but how i cook them is going to

1057
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,720
change based on the surface area of

1058
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,798
volume because you've got to let

1059
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,919
moisture and heat work its way into the

1060
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:13,200
center of the meat

1061
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,200
and that's going to be determined by the

1062
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,960
amount of surface of the meat that's in

1063
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,919
contact with whatever cooking liquid or

1064
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,919
heat you've got

1065
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,759
is there different sources of heat to

1066
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,278
play with like a big flame

1067
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:27,679
versus a small or maybe even like

1068
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,839
almost no flame like over coals all that

1069
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,240
kind of stuff is there some

1070
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,439
science to the source of heat in how it

1071
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,919
plays with the meat

1072
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,640
there's indirect heat and direct heat

1073
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,519
and

1074
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,840
that really is mostly about temperature

1075
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,240
okay

1076
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:42,879
in more than actual i mean smoke is

1077
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,720
important

1078
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,320
as well that can permeate but really the

1079
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,679
smoke doesn't go into the center of most

1080
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:49,200
cuts that you barbecue it'll come it's

1081
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,440
like the smoke ring it's it's a

1082
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,480
it's a you know it's maximum like half

1083
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,919
an inch on the outside

1084
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,159
maybe a little bit deeper on a really

1085
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,000
long slow cook so they

1086
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,919
but this the smoke that does create a

1087
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,839
ton of flavor on the surface of the meat

1088
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,240
um but that's so the indirect allows you

1089
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,158
to have smoke contacting it and then a

1090
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,679
very very low and slow heat

1091
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:12,960
and what that does is indirect heat

1092
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,960
will be low and slow enough

1093
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,800
that the center of the meat will get

1094
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,440
warm at the same time as the exterior of

1095
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,240
the meat

1096
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,000
and it'll all cook equally and all get

1097
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,479
equally tender

1098
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,519
if you go very hot and fast you risk the

1099
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,119
interior of the meat

1100
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,759
not getting right you kind of create a

1101
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,879
shell on the on it um and you slow down

1102
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000
the interior or the meat which you

1103
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:32,719
actually want to do with something like

1104
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,079
a steak

1105
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,799
where you want to keep it rare on the

1106
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,320
inside so it's really indirect versus

1107
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,639
direct then once you get into

1108
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,838
direct heat right like in that category

1109
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,039
there's wood

1110
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,838
charcoal gas right that's about it and

1111
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,440
those are

1112
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:49,838
meaningfully different they're

1113
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,760
meaningfully different charcoal and wood

1114
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:54,239
that's more of there's more poetry and

1115
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,720
wood there's a little bit more flavor

1116
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,838
not functionally very different but gas

1117
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,919
versus charcoal wood

1118
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:00,880
is very different um and that's because

1119
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,440
of the actual

1120
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,400
scent of the of the cook right the scent

1121
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,358
of the flavor

1122
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,519
um and then there's a i think an

1123
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:10,639
evenness of heat distribution that comes

1124
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,320
off of charcoal

1125
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,759
that's different from gas because no

1126
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,720
matter how awesome your gas grill is you

1127
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,359
do have hotter

1128
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,919
and cooler spots so gas grills are

1129
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:19,519
typically

1130
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,200
you can kind of control for that if you

1131
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,800
just are going really hot and fast

1132
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:24,159
yeah which is why grass grills are fine

1133
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,440
if you're just like throwing that steak

1134
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:26,799
on get a hard sear on

1135
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,639
those burgers put a crust on it that's

1136
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,560
fabulous for that that's perfect

1137
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,319
when you're doing things that do better

1138
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,639
with a low and slow

1139
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,359
cook like let's say a whole tenderloin

1140
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,920
or

1141
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:38,480
chicken thigh that's going to be a

1142
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,400
little bit

1143
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,240
less elegant on gas than on charcoal

1144
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,880
versus wood so when you have more

1145
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,479
more kind of nuance in the low slow cook

1146
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,039
over the natural fuels

1147
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,000
talking about like smoke and flame and

1148
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:54,239
charcoal versus gas

1149
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,599
it also adds to the experience and the

1150
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,479
smell and the whole

1151
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,838
thing of the cooking or like versus just

1152
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,519
like the taste it creates

1153
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,039
there's a certain experience to like

1154
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,320
when there's a bit of smoke

1155
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:05,920
maybe i don't know what the chemistry of

1156
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,838
it is but i feel like with smoke the

1157
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,200
smell is distributed more effectively

1158
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,358
i don't know if that's true but there

1159
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,679
there's there's a there's a smell

1160
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,358
and a visual aspect to the experience

1161
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,159
that's almost enriched with a bit of

1162
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,119
smoke

1163
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,159
and and uh or like an open flame like if

1164
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,480
you could see the flame

1165
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,440
this is magic to that and it goes to the

1166
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,960
experience piece that

1167
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,200
we're talking about we were talking

1168
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,800
exactly about that like the nuance and

1169
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,399
the beauty of like that long

1170
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,839
slow cook and your house smelling like

1171
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,800
something why do people

1172
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,400
freak out about barbecue yeah why

1173
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
because you go and it smells bomb it

1174
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,599
smells so

1175
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,358
good it smells like heaven right it

1176
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,079
smells fatty and delicious and the

1177
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:43,838
smells

1178
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,039
everywhere and everyone's smelling the

1179
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,719
same smell so there's like this

1180
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,960
collective experience

1181
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,399
it's incredible that's i mean i i think

1182
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,960
that's why barbecue is so

1183
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,880
sticky for people yeah it's like so

1184
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,000
yummy and you get this huge like

1185
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,519
anticipatory thing

1186
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,519
about it it's like because it smells

1187
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,880
incredible what was that incredible

1188
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,400
grill that we used yesterday

1189
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,039
what is that that's called a sea island

1190
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,960
forge it's a wood fire grill that's

1191
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,519
inspired by like a south american style

1192
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,400
cooking

1193
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,920
so it's like it's big it has also the

1194
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,838
the things with the crank it allows you

1195
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,440
to control the distance from the flame

1196
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,039
it's awesome really key with the wood

1197
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,320
fire so when we evolved

1198
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:22,800
um from cooking over wood to charcoal

1199
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,559
right when when that became more popular

1200
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,519
the reason that we did that is that

1201
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,279
allowed us to

1202
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:29,280
skip the whole part of making our own

1203
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,839
charcoal right so when you're cooking

1204
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,119
over wood

1205
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,279
all you're doing is making your own

1206
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,920
charcoal you don't ever cook over wood

1207
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,079
with the

1208
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,000
red fire like we don't like throw a

1209
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,359
steak on when the flames are orange and

1210
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,760
leaping up because you're just gonna get

1211
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,440
you know carbon like char all over your

1212
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,839
meat so you're when you're cooking over

1213
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,838
wood

1214
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,159
you first cook down the wood you create

1215
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,759
the coal base the natural coal base

1216
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,358
and then you cook over that so you saw

1217
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,880
yesterday i built my fire i let it burn

1218
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:53,759
down added some fresh wood so i could

1219
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,240
reinforce

1220
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,960
my coals with new coals coming in but

1221
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,919
then

1222
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,838
i was actually cooking over the embers

1223
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,440
you shorten that cycle with carbon

1224
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,440
with with charcoal it's more it's more

1225
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,480
efficient but what you lose is that

1226
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,960
whole cycle

1227
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,400
of you know that really beautiful

1228
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,920
experience of smelling

1229
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,358
now if you're cooking on a traeger

1230
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,159
you're going to get awesome smoke smell

1231
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,679
you know like you're

1232
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,199
there's plenty of ways to do this it

1233
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:18,000
doesn't always have to be wood fire i

1234
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,319
love

1235
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,119
all the different ways right but i i

1236
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,599
really like

1237
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,039
the experience of the campfire and i

1238
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,720
love that kind of just like sitting by

1239
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,838
it building it having to take the time i

1240
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,598
like building the fire

1241
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,119
going inside preparing all my meats

1242
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,960
bringing them out cooking them that

1243
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,358
whole experience start to finish

1244
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,720
is really just like something that it's

1245
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:37,279
my favorite it's my favorite way to

1246
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,679
spend it

1247
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,040
spend time you know so i think and why

1248
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:41,598
is that is the food that different than

1249
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,358
cooking it

1250
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,280
in a in a more conventional grill

1251
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,960
probably not you know like in a pure

1252
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,720
experience but i think the actual

1253
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,720
experience is super memorable

1254
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,399
because you are outside you are slowing

1255
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,559
your role you're enjoying the

1256
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,680
this you know you're just taking in

1257
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:57,279
you're watching

1258
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,358
you're anticipating i love that whole

1259
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,480
experience does the

1260
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,440
origin of the meat itself make a

1261
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,599
difference

1262
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,400
so we're here about campbell farms and

1263
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,599
we'll maybe you could talk about

1264
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:15,200
what your vision your dream is on in uh

1265
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,640
in terms of like food in terms of where

1266
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,039
food comes from

1267
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,400
where meat comes from but food broadly

1268
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:25,039
and how that affects

1269
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,960
the entirety of the the culinary journey

1270
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,480
on the question of where does it come

1271
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,199
from and does that matter

1272
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,159
i'd say though the way that meat is

1273
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,399
raised is

1274
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,838
massively important for flavor and for

1275
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,039
how it cooks

1276
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:42,320
um i think most

1277
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,679
cooks who try cooking grass-fed versus

1278
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,440
corn fed that's the

1279
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,118
first moment where they realize that

1280
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,440
right where corn fed

1281
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,838
meat cooks much more slowly it's got

1282
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,679
bigger veins of fat that slow the

1283
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,759
heat transfer throughout the muscle of

1284
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:56,480
the animal compared to grass-fed which

1285
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,400
is leaner

1286
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,639
heat moves through it more quickly those

1287
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,800
steaks will cook much much faster so

1288
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,279
there's very kind of technical reasons

1289
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,440
why how meat is raised

1290
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,319
uh and that we're aware of and there's

1291
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,318
other things that

1292
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:14,800
i've noticed like um that slower growing

1293
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,639
poultry has a very very different

1294
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,960
musculature and fiber to it

1295
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,239
than fast-growing poultry that's

1296
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,920
confinement animals it's just

1297
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,679
it has to do with the way that the

1298
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,400
muscles are built they tend to be

1299
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:28,480
finer and thinner and more tender and a

1300
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,800
little bit more susceptible to heat so

1301
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,079
they the character of the meat's

1302
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,160
radically different

1303
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,519
it's also much more flavorful when it's

1304
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,639
grown more naturally

1305
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,318
and i think some of the the reliance in

1306
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,559
the u.s on like

1307
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,358
sugary sauces and lots of salts and

1308
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:49,039
flavors and things like that's actually

1309
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:51,519
based on having the broadly available

1310
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,079
meat out there is pretty low on flavor

1311
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,239
and so we're

1312
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,519
adding in a lot to compensate for that

1313
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:59,039
so to your point of like

1314
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:02,000
enjoying things very simply and and

1315
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,838
with like salt and nothing else like the

1316
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,318
more flavorful that product is i think

1317
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,639
the more

1318
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,079
people will find that enjoyable let's

1319
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,920
paint a vision

1320
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,318
i mean you're a visionary you have you

1321
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,519
have a vision to have

1322
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:19,199
basically meat in every store that comes

1323
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,719
from a a farm like belcampo

1324
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,239
that's uh that's basically doing

1325
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:25,358
regenerative farming

1326
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,679
how do we get there it's about

1327
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,199
a network of smaller producers working

1328
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,838
together with

1329
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:35,759
shared values and

1330
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:36,880
it's true that there's a limit on

1331
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,800
regenerative farming

1332
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,838
in that it requires more human knowledge

1333
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,839
so regenerative farming is

1334
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:47,838
more difficult to scale in a single

1335
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,119
operation it'd be really challenging to

1336
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,880
have a regenerative farm that was like

1337
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,119
200 000 acres

1338
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,079
because of the amount of manpower needed

1339
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,680
to pay attention

1340
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,440
can you first and i apologize to

1341
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,480
interrupt but can you

1342
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,838
say what is regenerative farming sure

1343
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,880
so they if you're looking at scaling

1344
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:08,159
regenerative

1345
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,039
farming it's a traditional system of

1346
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,799
agriculture

1347
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:12,880
regenerative farming is how we used to

1348
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,519
farm

1349
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,519
we used to farm with an eye towards the

1350
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,519
long term

1351
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,199
you might be on the friedman farm

1352
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,759
thinking about your heirs

1353
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,039
five generations from now farming that

1354
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,640
same land

1355
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,559
are you going to leave that land

1356
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,920
nutritionally empty

1357
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:34,559
no okay it's a long-term thinking also

1358
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,000
in traditional ag you don't have inputs

1359
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,078
that are very convenient

1360
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,358
you can put some chicken manure on but

1361
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,318
you can't

1362
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,519
spray or dump something that massively

1363
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,440
increases

1364
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,440
the growing potential of the land

1365
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,679
that was not available until the past 60

1366
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,879
years

1367
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:57,598
so regenerative agriculture is

1368
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,599
an approach to farming where you're

1369
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,880
increasing soil fertility

1370
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,000
through your farming you increase soil

1371
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,599
fertility

1372
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,800
by feeding the soil you feed the soil

1373
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,160
through carbon that's why regenerative

1374
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,480
farming is better for the environment

1375
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:16,399
it sequesters carbon and puts carbon

1376
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,599
into the soil

1377
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,000
now it's interesting plants

1378
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,880
need carbon and put it into the soil

1379
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,559
when they're going through growth

1380
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,480
so if you have a beautiful field of

1381
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,480
grass that's just waving in the wind

1382
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,480
that's not sequestering as much carbon

1383
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,039
as plants that have been damaged

1384
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,318
and are regrowing plants that have been

1385
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,119
damaged and are re-growing

1386
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,719
are repairing and they're doing that by

1387
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,960
drawing down carbon as one of the

1388
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,439
nutrients that feeds them

1389
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,039
to damage the plants effectively that's

1390
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,200
what we're doing with regenerative

1391
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:52,800
grazing

1392
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:55,919
so the cows or you know lambs whatever

1393
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,480
out there they're eating and taking

1394
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,440
the grass down and that then cause a

1395
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,838
regrowth cycle

1396
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,200
that sequesters carbon wow there's a

1397
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,599
limit to it there's an edge

1398
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,960
because if those plants are so damaged

1399
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,559
that they can't regrow

1400
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,000
then it turns into a dirt patch and that

1401
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,838
doesn't sequester any carbon

1402
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,280
so it's a balance how do you find that

1403
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,679
uh balance so

1404
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,760
that has to do with like the frequency

1405
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:20,159
and the scale the grazing essentially

1406
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,680
exactly and so you have to find the

1407
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,480
right balance and that that connects to

1408
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,039
the

1409
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,000
both the the grass i mean is is the

1410
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:28,719
ultimately

1411
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,838
the focus here is that the life cycle of

1412
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,559
whatever is grazing

1413
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:34,639
whether it's cows or lambs or so on

1414
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,679
that's why the scalability question so

1415
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:37,838
all that stuff that i

1416
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:38,799
just talked about like think about all

1417
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:40,239
the actions

1418
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,400
that that requires somebody's out there

1419
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:45,439
looking and paying attention

1420
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,720
and understanding how far the grass is

1421
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,760
remembering what happened in that field

1422
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,239
last year

1423
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,760
there's a huge human intelligence need

1424
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:55,679
and human

1425
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,319
kind of availability of attention

1426
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,838
now industrial farming has done a great

1427
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,480
job at de-skilling

1428
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:02,480
agriculture

1429
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,079
industrial farming has taken agriculture

1430
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,440
from being art science to being

1431
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,599
entry-level employment yeah

1432
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,039
so that's the limiting factor on regen

1433
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,640
and that's why i think the human

1434
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,480
intelligence piece exactly

1435
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:19,838
i gotta ask uh i don't know if you think

1436
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,440
about this kind of stuff i mentioned to

1437
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,119
you offline that i spent

1438
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,800
a bit of time with some robots and

1439
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,720
boston dynamics do you think there's a

1440
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,359
way to use artificial intelligence to

1441
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,159
help

1442
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,519
so data collection so automating some of

1443
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:33,358
the

1444
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,960
some of the things that makes humans

1445
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,400
special make some of that decision some

1446
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,760
of that memory that's then utilized

1447
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,838
converted into knowledge to make

1448
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,000
decisions about the crops and so on

1449
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,358
is there a way if ai can help do you

1450
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,880
think i totally

1451
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,559
i mean that's that's that would be

1452
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,760
incredible that's one of the

1453
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,920
ingredients that could help with the

1454
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,800
regenerative number of discrete decision

1455
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,000
points

1456
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,680
that could completely be automated

1457
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
as well in order to supplement and work

1458
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:58,480
with somebody like a farmer in managing

1459
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,119
it

1460
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,480
about the the the performance on land

1461
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,039
and a bit of that's being done right now

1462
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,920
with some

1463
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,480
aerial mapping and but that type of ai

1464
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,800
would be

1465
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,599
huge in this i mean there's estimates

1466
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,720
that if

1467
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,440
the um damage and underutilized range

1468
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:14,799
land

1469
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,079
in the world was converted to

1470
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,720
regenerative agriculture at somewhere

1471
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,800
between

1472
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,480
like 20 and 40 percent of the world's

1473
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,960
carbon could be sequestered

1474
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,838
so there's a huge potential the problem

1475
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,599
is

1476
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:29,199
cultural we've

1477
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,880
like lost the generational threat of

1478
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,078
knowledge about how to do this it's kind

1479
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,079
of been two generations that haven't

1480
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,440
farmed this way

1481
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,560
also the science around it is

1482
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,280
limited by the scale and longevity so

1483
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:42,960
the data

1484
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,720
collection around regenerative farming

1485
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,838
is also limited by the fact it's kind of

1486
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,679
piecemeal

1487
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,279
there's small operations that are doing

1488
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,000
it they're learning and developing as

1489
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,599
they go

1490
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,358
and they haven't been documenting it and

1491
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,838
doing it for too long

1492
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:57,039
is the ethical treatment of animals a

1493
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:00,239
part of

1494
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,679
regenerative farming so in

1495
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:03,439
the way you do things about campo that's

1496
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:05,279
a huge part

1497
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,880
uh is that necessarily part of the life

1498
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,000
cycle so like the things that you're

1499
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,599
trying to measure

1500
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,838
is like uh like the way

1501
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,960
like like not damaging the land too much

1502
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:16,719
make sure

1503
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,000
that the sort of the land is constantly

1504
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:21,118
healthy and producing

1505
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,239
and then the grazing process and also

1506
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,240
the carbon piece

1507
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,598
the the fact that it's like carbon

1508
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,519
neutral or something like that

1509
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,640
i mean are all those pieces of the

1510
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,280
regenerative farming

1511
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,400
or is this an extra part to your vision

1512
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,760
that you're thinking about it's all

1513
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,838
implicit and regenerative

1514
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,040
yeah i call it out separately because we

1515
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:38,719
are certified humane

1516
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,159
right which is another layer of welfare

1517
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:41,439
that has to do with density and a couple

1518
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,000
other things

1519
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,960
but regenerative i mean think about if

1520
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,800
you're a cow and you're in a

1521
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,960
regenerative operation where

1522
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,039
the whole life cycle of the pasture

1523
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,400
means that you only eat the top six

1524
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,759
inches of the grass

1525
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,160
and then when there's whatever a couple

1526
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,319
inches left then that feels left dormant

1527
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,519
that's a better experience right okay so

1528
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,358
just think about it kind of functionally

1529
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,239
that way well grazing period is a better

1530
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,119
experience right

1531
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,639
yeah and that's that's not what's done

1532
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,480
in i mean that's the grass-fed

1533
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:09,679
piece that's the other piece with you

1534
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,880
know

1535
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:13,759
certified organics amazing there's

1536
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,760
you know there's plenty of

1537
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,040
certifications that you know grass-fed

1538
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,400
and finish is also

1539
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:20,159
great but there are workarounds for

1540
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,200
those you can have certified organic

1541
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:22,639
feedlots

1542
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,960
you can have grass-fed and finished

1543
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,719
which is uh in an animal-fed a grass

1544
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,559
seed pellet

1545
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:30,719
those aren't things that we do here

1546
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,800
right and regenerative captures that

1547
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,399
because if you're it's anything you're

1548
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,519
isolating these very specific

1549
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,440
certifications

1550
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,039
it doesn't have a holistic approach

1551
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,159
regenerative though unfortunately isn't

1552
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,318
certified yet

1553
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:44,159
we've gotten usda approval to use that

1554
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,199
word based on our carbon sequestration

1555
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:48,239
data

1556
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:50,000
but it's not a regulated term so that's

1557
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:50,318
kind of the mix right now is to figure

1558
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,400
out

1559
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:54,318
how to document it and it's not totally

1560
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,358
clear what it means like for pigs and

1561
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:57,519
chickens which

1562
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:59,279
are omnivores it's very clear for

1563
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:00,880
ruminants which are animals that have a

1564
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,359
rumen that eat grass

1565
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,880
for omnivores which is like what we are

1566
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,239
they eat primarily grain

1567
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,160
in farming operations and that's a

1568
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:08,479
little bit more complex so it's kind of

1569
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:10,799
a

1570
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,599
moving landscape but regenerative as a

1571
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,240
word

1572
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,680
is the better definition of the whole

1573
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,479
life cycle approach of letting

1574
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:20,799
animals and nature work together is it

1575
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,838
true that it's possible to have a farm

1576
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,200
that doesn't produce sort of is carbon

1577
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:28,400
neutral

1578
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:31,199
we have been third party verified

1579
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,680
to be carbon impact negative so

1580
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:34,879
belcampo's 25 000 acres and the animals

1581
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,679
here

1582
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,480
they in the all of the carbon including

1583
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,118
from our shipping

1584
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,079
on our mail order is all offset by the

1585
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,920
amount of

1586
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,760
grazing that's happening also that that

1587
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,519
encompasses our partner farms we

1588
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,960
we buy a number of live animals in from

1589
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,639
other partner farms

1590
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,838
that's their impacts also incorporate in

1591
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:52,719
that i mean first of all that's

1592
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:54,078
incredible

1593
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,399
and second of all is that possible to

1594
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:59,680
scale i don't see why

1595
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,480
it isn't i mean it's it's complex to

1596
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:02,159
scale

1597
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,719
but i mean we're putting people on the

1598
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:07,679
moon and you have a robotic dog

1599
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:09,118
i mean but those are that's more that's

1600
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:09,759
less about scale that's more about

1601
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,318
innovation

1602
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,520
so like in many ways what belcamp has

1603
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,119
done is innovative

1604
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:16,559
at a small scale the question is whether

1605
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,599
that innovation could be scaled that's

1606
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,160
where i feel like

1607
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,440
we in the industry need more help you

1608
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,799
know the ai piece

1609
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,400
the intelligence the the thinking about

1610
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,318
ways to do things

1611
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,000
differently is where we need more

1612
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:33,838
support and i think it's

1613
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:37,280
been a you know a kind of a

1614
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:37,920
swing in the past couple years where

1615
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,960
it's

1616
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,599
it meets a mess it's terrible so let's

1617
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,079
ditch meat

1618
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,720
and our opt for these hyper processed

1619
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,000
you know

1620
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,919
plant-based solutions and

1621
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,400
i am saying there's a way to make meat

1622
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,480
this a part of the solution

1623
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,000
and it's going to mean eating less of it

1624
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,039
it's going to mean paying more for it

1625
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,880
it's going to mean that the farming

1626
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:01,039
systems are more complicated

1627
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,039
it's not the easiest path but i think in

1628
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,199
the long term it's the better path

1629
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,119
and it's also better for human health

1630
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:11,039
can you comment on the certified humane

1631
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,880
piece so how do you run a farm

1632
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,400
like what does it mean to raise an

1633
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,160
animal from

1634
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,160
the beginning of its life to the end of

1635
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,879
its life in a way that's ethical that's

1636
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,920
humane

1637
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,000
i think the first piece you need to just

1638
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,440
be comfortable with is that

1639
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,480
making an animal into meat you know is

1640
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,760
is something you're comfortable with

1641
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,719
because i think that's the biggest

1642
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,800
question right

1643
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,078
and so certified humane actually goes

1644
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,920
all the way through

1645
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,440
the death of the animal how it's killed

1646
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,599
and handled that at processing

1647
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,119
so i put that out there just to say well

1648
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,480
that's you know this is all about

1649
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,200
producing an animal

1650
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,318
to die for me that's not necessarily

1651
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:47,838
that's something people struggle with

1652
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:49,519
with the word humane and i understand

1653
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,599
that like i have space and empathy for

1654
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:52,719
that it's a it's a complicated decision

1655
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,640
and when you have to be comfortable with

1656
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:56,159
at the outset to say this is an animal

1657
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,159
it's going to die to feed me

1658
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,759
yeah so we should pause on that because

1659
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:02,078
i actually just uh

1660
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,520
the two days ago read a paper that

1661
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,359
argued that

1662
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,759
you know the killing of an animal period

1663
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:09,519
cannot be humane so it's impossible

1664
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,880
and so and that's an argument just like

1665
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,440
you're saying

1666
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,680
we could make but if we now on the table

1667
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:20,318
kind of

1668
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:22,639
take as a starting point the idea that

1669
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:23,838
it's possible to kill an animal for food

1670
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,838
in an ethical way

1671
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:27,279
if we take that as a starting point so

1672
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,358
we won't argue about that

1673
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,480
it is worth arguing about it elsewhere

1674
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:32,239
and it probably will

1675
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,519
i will probably talk to a few vegan

1676
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:35,199
folks and

1677
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:37,119
we'll talk about the vegan diet i'm

1678
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,759
fascinated by it as well so i'm torn in

1679
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,680
the whole thing

1680
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,040
but if we just take that as a starting

1681
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:44,078
point

1682
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,199
what then is an ethical humane way to

1683
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,599
treat an animal

1684
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:49,199
i look at ethical humane animal

1685
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:52,400
treatment as

1686
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:57,039
the major phases of life so

1687
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:59,680
um conception birth and mothering

1688
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,880
diet those are kind of the major touch

1689
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,919
points of life

1690
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,599
so what we're

1691
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,680
looking at is evolutionary approach

1692
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,240
which means is the animal eating what it

1693
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:15,358
evolved to eat primarily

1694
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:18,000
is the animal primarily outdoors

1695
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,480
which is how all animals evolved um

1696
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
given

1697
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,599
when the climate's appropriate for it

1698
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,079
there's certain you know times when you

1699
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,920
can't have

1700
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,119
animals fully outdoors like here on our

1701
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,039
ranch we

1702
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,240
um have had issues with like you know

1703
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,318
cold weather and things

1704
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:31,919
but um so if you have if you have you

1705
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,039
know appropriate weather conditions does

1706
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,440
animal outdoors

1707
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,639
um is the animal able to nurture and

1708
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,318
engage with its young

1709
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,838
um those are the kind of key touch

1710
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:41,039
points but it's really the

1711
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,440
the birth of it let me start this one

1712
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,838
from the scratch um

1713
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,599
okay so when i'm looking at when i when

1714
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:48,799
i consider what's humane setting aside

1715
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,400
the death part

1716
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:56,400
i look at the evolutionary diet

1717
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,920
access to the outdoors and ideally

1718
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,440
spending the majority of its life

1719
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,039
outdoors

1720
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:06,159
low density so animals spread out

1721
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,759
and um engagement with young

1722
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:09,440
social interactions and that's all kind

1723
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,359
of social interaction is a cool one

1724
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,519
i mean i also read an article that like

1725
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:16,960
they're that like cows for example

1726
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:19,358
have social like they have friends yeah

1727
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,480
yeah that's fascinating i mean that

1728
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:21,838
piece with a young

1729
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,519
social interaction with young social

1730
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:25,759
interaction with each other

1731
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:28,000
that uh at a basic level i'm sure that

1732
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,599
interaction is not as rich as humans

1733
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,519
but they're that that piece seems to be

1734
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,519
part of the humane picture

1735
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,559
and you said also just a quick comment

1736
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,519
uh

1737
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,798
evolutionary diet meaning the diet that

1738
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:41,920
they were evolved

1739
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:43,838
to have and that's pretty simple you can

1740
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,400
look at the physiology of the animal

1741
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:47,039
and figure that out so ruminant species

1742
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,760
are

1743
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,798
lamb goats and beef and they have five

1744
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,359
stomachs

1745
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,000
there they evolved eating really low

1746
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:55,598
calorie

1747
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,280
high fiber foods that's why they've got

1748
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,400
all the stomachs they need a lot of

1749
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,720
processing you or i

1750
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,400
were to eat grass die in a week right we

1751
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:04,879
our physiology can't handle it

1752
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,880
cows were built and evolved to eat this

1753
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,640
very low calorie very high fiber very

1754
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,720
low density food

1755
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,279
and they walk around slowly they're

1756
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:15,598
moving constantly and they're eating it

1757
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,640
when we put them on a corn fed diet

1758
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,400
that's the opposite of their

1759
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:19,679
evolutionary diet and their systems

1760
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,318
really struggle with it

1761
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:24,639
now pigs and chickens are different pigs

1762
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:29,039
and chickens are omnivores

1763
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:30,960
and pigs will happily eat

1764
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,960
chickens for example yeah our pigs on

1765
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,159
the farm will hunt and kill rattlesnakes

1766
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,838
yeah and eat them um you know

1767
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:39,199
it's they're they they have they enjoy

1768
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:40,960
the they enjoy all of it

1769
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:42,239
they're they're they're omnivores so

1770
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,760
that you often see and i

1771
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:45,679
i've seen people try to raise like a

1772
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,599
grass-fed chicken and

1773
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,279
that doesn't exist i mean they need a

1774
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,559
higher omnivores

1775
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,960
eat everything they're what's called

1776
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:54,798
monogastric they got one stomach

1777
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,159
and that one stomach needs higher

1778
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:58,480
density nutrients

1779
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,199
so in the case of um chicken if you're

1780
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,079
to do

1781
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:03,919
you know look back in american history

1782
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,760
and in the 1950s it took you know

1783
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,280
commercial chickens took like 54 weeks

1784
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,359
to come to full weight

1785
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,880
and now it's two and a half weeks in the

1786
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:12,960
in confinement farming on our

1787
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,000
in our systems it's like eight to ten

1788
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,679
weeks typically

1789
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,280
so it's a very you have to give them

1790
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,399
some amount of nutrient density

1791
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,119
um but there's a the idea that no grain

1792
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,039
because you that's a misinformation for

1793
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,720
any type of commercial operation

1794
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:28,318
free range regenerative pastured

1795
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,480
everything you're going to have to have

1796
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,880
a grain feed to get any type of it's

1797
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,400
actually

1798
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,519
i think for the case of chickens unless

1799
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,720
you're in a place with like tons of

1800
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:36,798
natural seeds and

1801
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,239
grubs and worms and stuff to eat really

1802
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:39,519
challenging for the chicken

1803
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:41,199
so you got to give them some high

1804
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:43,440
density high calorie food different from

1805
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:44,798
that that's the evolutionary diet

1806
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,480
is a really key thing that's the

1807
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:47,920
fundamental thing for health

1808
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,760
and it's also interesting because that

1809
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,880
the evolutionary diet ties to human

1810
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,559
health

1811
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,880
i've looked at the nutritional analysis

1812
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:58,559
on on all of our products and

1813
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:02,240
it's the evolutionary diet is

1814
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,839
for the case of beef and lamb gets

1815
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:06,399
their omega three to six ratio is the

1816
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,759
same as wild game

1817
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,599
so it's not like beef is really

1818
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,079
radically different from elk

1819
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:14,318
a ruminant species right if you feed

1820
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,000
beef and evolutionary diet

1821
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:17,920
their nutritional profile is the same as

1822
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,239
wild meat there's a wild room in it

1823
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,358
i got a chance to witness neurolink i

1824
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:22,639
don't know if you're familiar with that

1825
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,798
company's brain

1826
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,000
brain computer interfaces and they have

1827
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:28,639
i got the chance to see

1828
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,639
in in person just a bunch of pigs who

1829
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,960
had neurolink chips implanted

1830
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:33,838
and taken out those pigs are so happy

1831
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,199
with life

1832
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:37,679
i don't know i've never seen a happier

1833
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,199
animal uh

1834
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,399
i mean because they get to eat you

1835
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:41,679
because you were mentioning sort of

1836
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,000
diets and stuff

1837
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:44,798
they basic pigs seem to love a lot of

1838
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,639
stuff

1839
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:48,719
if they're easy they're easily made to

1840
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,920
be happy i don't know if uh you can

1841
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:53,598
comment on your

1842
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:57,358
thoughts of um

1843
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:58,559
of you know exploring the capacity of

1844
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:00,400
the pig

1845
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,480
mind through some of this testing when

1846
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,920
you're a link whether that's exciting to

1847
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,679
you whether maybe on the humane side

1848
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,798
it's a little bit concerning

1849
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:12,558
um if there's something to be said

1850
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:13,920
and sort of like um yeah on the

1851
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,920
i don't know if it's even the ethical

1852
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,720
side but just because of your connection

1853
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,680
to me

1854
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:20,879
and to nature and understanding these

1855
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:22,879
living beings

1856
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,079
well pigs are incredibly intelligent so

1857
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,440
i'm not surprised that they're a subject

1858
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,039
matter for neurolink

1859
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,960
um they're smarter than dogs and they're

1860
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:31,838
empathetic and emotional

1861
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,639
um and they're we'll go look at our pigs

1862
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:34,880
afterwards and

1863
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,400
see but they're they're they're kind of

1864
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,838
like joyful and exuberant when they're

1865
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,960
in good health

1866
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:44,318
and um so that that makes sense

1867
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:47,599
i i'm interested in open i feel

1868
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:50,239
um that the

1869
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,440
kind of bleeding edge agriculture

1870
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,039
movement that i'm

1871
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,039
you know on the edge of in some ways

1872
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:58,318
we're a larger operator but

1873
00:58:55,039 --> 00:59:00,318
we as a movement have to we have to get

1874
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:02,159
into the game we have to move forward in

1875
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:03,519
a way that allows us to scale if we want

1876
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:05,118
to be viable

1877
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:06,960
so i think there has to be openness to

1878
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,720
how that can happen yeah and i also

1879
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:12,240
think there needs to be more

1880
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:14,399
thoughtful and noisy data about how

1881
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:15,279
regenerative ranching can sequester

1882
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,559
carbon

1883
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:20,480
i mean thousands of american ranchers

1884
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,000
are selling carbon credits right now

1885
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,920
the data is that valid and they're not

1886
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,599
selling carbon credits from like

1887
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,280
grassland that just got a fence around

1888
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,400
it they're selling carbon credits for

1889
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,519
verified data from

1890
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,000
animals assisting in carbon

1891
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:34,639
sequestration right so there's got

1892
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,519
to be a way to to get the tech community

1893
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:37,838
involved

1894
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,599
in ways to help regenerative agriculture

1895
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:41,039
scale in different creative ways

1896
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,039
and actually yeah that'd be interesting

1897
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:44,558
if like neuralink somehow has

1898
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,159
i mean especially because the elon musk

1899
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,079
is involved in kimball mosques

1900
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:49,279
like has his whole effort and

1901
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:52,318
appreciation of

1902
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,798
regenerative agriculture that i wonder

1903
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:58,798
if neurolink has a role to play

1904
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:59,599
like exploring the the neurobiology of

1905
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:01,519
the animal

1906
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,798
if that somehow will create innovations

1907
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:05,920
that uh

1908
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:08,079
lead to uh improved

1909
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,039
uh scaling of regenerative agriculture

1910
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,240
it'd be interesting but

1911
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,440
you're saying you should be open to all

1912
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,118
those possibilities i don't think i

1913
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,440
don't know the landscape to know

1914
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,798
what yeah but my sense is that it's very

1915
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,358
hard

1916
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,400
it's very hard and our farming operation

1917
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:22,239
to scale has been

1918
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,240
incredibly complex and challenging we

1919
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:25,679
now work with partner farms

1920
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:27,439
i see their operations they're

1921
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:28,960
incredibly complex you know it just

1922
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,720
seems like there's got to be a way to

1923
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,720
make some of these things

1924
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:33,838
simpler and easier to share information

1925
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,000
yeah um

1926
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,119
i don't know what that answer is you

1927
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,920
know what would be cool

1928
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,960
is if we can understand deeper ways to

1929
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,039
measure

1930
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,559
the happiness of an animal because then

1931
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,719
we can optimize

1932
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,240
like a certified humane could be

1933
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,118
literally an optimization problem just

1934
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:51,358
make sure

1935
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:53,519
as opposed to kind of uh using our

1936
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:54,880
projecting our own human values

1937
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:56,798
actually measuring what the what the

1938
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,559
animal is happy doing that could be so

1939
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:00,798
understanding the pig brain

1940
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,760
might help us understand pig happiness

1941
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:03,838
and

1942
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,760
like reframe what it means for a happy

1943
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:06,960
animal and then maybe it's a lot easier

1944
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:09,760
to make a happy animal

1945
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,358
to make the animal happy than we think

1946
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,599
it might have to do with a variety of

1947
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:14,798
delicious food in the case

1948
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,039
is there something you can say about

1949
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:19,358
grass-fed meat is it all

1950
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,480
just out of my own curiosity whenever

1951
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:22,239
people say

1952
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,679
sort of grass-fed meat is better for you

1953
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:26,719
are all grass-fed meat

1954
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:29,358
made the same is there different like

1955
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:31,439
le it's like the word organic uh is

1956
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:33,199
there a lot of variety within that

1957
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,960
like the way belcampa does it with it

1958
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:37,598
others do it just

1959
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,119
more color if you could add to this

1960
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,318
whole word and what it means

1961
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,599
grass-fed beef has been on grass its

1962
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:45,199
entire life and you want to look for the

1963
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,240
words 100 grass-fed

1964
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:51,598
or grass-fed and finished now

1965
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:54,959
the challenge with feeding

1966
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:58,640
beef grass its whole life is that

1967
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:01,519
it gains weight more slowly

1968
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:02,159
although beef didn't evolve eating corn

1969
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:05,440
and things

1970
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,078
um it can't eat them and in eating them

1971
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,280
it gains weight

1972
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,839
more rapidly and has like a version of

1973
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,240
like an

1974
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:13,440
inflammatory response if you actually

1975
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:15,919
look inside the rumen

1976
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,119
of the animal inside the stomach it's

1977
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,798
like

1978
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:20,559
black and shiny inside compared to

1979
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:21,358
grass-fed animals like greens smells

1980
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,640
like compost

1981
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:25,358
so the animals themselves their whole

1982
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:27,199
physiology is is damaged by that

1983
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:28,719
food but they also gain weight really

1984
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:30,480
quickly and they put on a lot of fats

1985
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:31,838
like if you or me were to eat

1986
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,838
a bunch of processed food compared to

1987
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:35,838
eating a bunch of greens it's the same

1988
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:38,960
impact you're going to blow up

1989
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:40,880
so the problem for grass-fed is

1990
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,559
getting the animals to gain weight

1991
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,200
they're getting a ton of exercise

1992
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,480
they're eating really clean right and

1993
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:48,558
they're super chill

1994
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,719
so that's different from the animals

1995
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:53,680
that are kept still

1996
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:55,358
eating really nutrient dense foods and

1997
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:58,480
under a ton of stress

1998
01:02:55,358 --> 01:03:00,558
which is a confinement animal so are all

1999
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,798
grass-fed meats created the same

2000
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,000
the diet yeah nutritional profile

2001
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,480
broadly

2002
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,719
but the length of time that the animal

2003
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:13,358
lives is extremely important for

2004
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:16,480
the flavor of the meat we're taking

2005
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:18,639
our beef to 24 to 26 months conventional

2006
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,639
is around 18 months

2007
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,078
so i'm always looking and if you're

2008
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:23,519
evaluating grass-fed animals

2009
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,680
you want to get animals that are

2010
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:26,559
typically allowed to live for longer

2011
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:27,838
because their flavor is going to be

2012
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:28,880
better there's going to be a bit more

2013
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:33,038
fat

2014
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:35,280
and their omega ratios also vary

2015
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,039
very differently and i've seen omega

2016
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,880
ratios you know on our farm

2017
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,960
everywhere from one to three to one to

2018
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,720
one you ideal as one to one game is

2019
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,079
typically one to one or one to two omega

2020
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:45,759
three to sixes

2021
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,359
but in operations where you don't have

2022
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,400
year-round grass

2023
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:49,838
it's more complicated you know you're

2024
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,039
feeding hay and you don't get that three

2025
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:54,159
to six ratio

2026
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:56,960
omega-3s come from green grass um they

2027
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:57,519
they're the fat in greens and so they're

2028
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,480
scarce

2029
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:01,759
and costly right so you can have

2030
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,960
grass-fed and finished animals that

2031
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,400
don't have that perfect ratio because

2032
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,318
maybe they're in a climate or for

2033
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,838
whatever reasons we've had to do it too

2034
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:09,519
during the droughts do hay finishing

2035
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:09,838
it's not optimal it changes the ratio

2036
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:11,599
but

2037
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:14,000
so there's a little bit of variance

2038
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:16,880
within it i'd say though

2039
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,838
the the variance within grass fed is

2040
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,838
still

2041
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,519
small compared to the variance between

2042
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:23,038
conventional and grass-fed

2043
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:24,880
right so there's definitely things to

2044
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,760
look for within it but the

2045
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,720
the real difference is between those two

2046
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,319
also thing

2047
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:35,598
to notice is that it's not a verified

2048
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:37,358
word okay so grass fed

2049
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:40,480
means animals that have been on grass at

2050
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:42,798
some point in their life

2051
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,838
the way the cattle industry is in the

2052
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:47,358
u.s

2053
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:48,400
there's segmentation so there's cow calf

2054
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:51,119
operations

2055
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,960
there's then those calves get sold to

2056
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,240
stalker operations which raised

2057
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,639
animals in their teens basically and

2058
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:59,439
then those get sold to feedlots

2059
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:01,440
and so those three phases that that

2060
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,318
first phase of the cow calf is always on

2061
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,159
grass

2062
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:05,920
it's mother cows and mom cows are

2063
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:07,279
amazing they can thrive on

2064
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,480
anything and still put all their

2065
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,519
nutrients into their baby and their

2066
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,199
babies will be healthy

2067
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,559
so you never are putting weather cows on

2068
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,919
really premium pasture

2069
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,160
so it's usually just kind of like okay

2070
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,720
pasture dirty life if you ever see kind

2071
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:18,318
of like

2072
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:19,759
you know scrubby lots with lots of you

2073
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:20,639
know cows and cats on that's a cow-calf

2074
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,440
operation

2075
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:25,038
so there's also a worm a loophole

2076
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,079
unfortunately where people use the term

2077
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,200
grass fed

2078
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,480
and they're actually referring to

2079
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:30,000
animals that at some point in their life

2080
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,679
had grass but that might be

2081
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,519
pretty far in the rearview mirror so you

2082
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:35,759
need to see look at that uh

2083
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:36,559
grass-fed and finished or grass-fed 100

2084
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,480
percent

2085
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,760
that ratio of omega-3s to six is it

2086
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,000
changes in like a week

2087
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,440
on grain wow so it's radically different

2088
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,559
unfortunately it's the same thing for

2089
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,119
you and me you could eat clean for a

2090
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,798
month

2091
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:48,318
you eat you know junk for three days

2092
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:49,759
you're garbage right it's not like you

2093
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:51,038
can just like coast on that

2094
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,640
right we know what that's like same

2095
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:53,839
thing for animals our physiology changes

2096
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:55,038
food's the number one way we interact

2097
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:56,798
with our environment yeah

2098
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,079
and our body changes really rapidly and

2099
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:01,358
dramatically so

2100
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,720
so we know about campo and just the way

2101
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:05,038
sort of this regenerative farming

2102
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:07,439
approach of belcampo and the certified

2103
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:10,559
humane is good for the land

2104
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,960
is good for the animal can you comment

2105
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,960
on

2106
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,079
ways it's good for the human that eats

2107
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,599
the meat

2108
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:19,839
is is this meat better for you yes

2109
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,200
it's and this is where you know the kind

2110
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:22,880
of focus on the joy

2111
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:25,038
and animals doing yoga and all this sort

2112
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:28,079
of like cynical stuff about

2113
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,640
about this type of agriculture say just

2114
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,039
like

2115
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:32,078
set that aside you know it really is

2116
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,240
better for your health

2117
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,440
yeah it's got a better fat ratio it's

2118
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,239
less inflammatory

2119
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,960
it's got higher protein um it's just

2120
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:42,078
better product

2121
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,798
i mean in the case of beef it's lower in

2122
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,640
fat

2123
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:46,559
and that fat is a better quality it's

2124
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:47,679
higher in poultry and pork is also

2125
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,119
higher in protein so

2126
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,639
all the nutritionals are better it's got

2127
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,079
higher density of vitamins got higher

2128
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,000
density of minerals

2129
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,680
and none of this stuff is radically

2130
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,079
different than you know it's like not

2131
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,038
like

2132
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,680
it's the product is is black and white

2133
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,640
but their

2134
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:04,078
every metric meaningfully is better in

2135
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:06,879
the right direction

2136
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,760
across the board so why wouldn't you i

2137
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,798
hesitate

2138
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:13,200
to take anecdotal evidence

2139
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:14,159
as like final scientific conclusions but

2140
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:15,838
it does seem

2141
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:17,920
i've eaten quite a bit of belcampo meat

2142
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:19,440
for example it's just my body seems to

2143
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,119
respond

2144
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:25,599
like is less bothered by it meaning like

2145
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:26,400
uh less inflamed i just feel better

2146
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,200
because i

2147
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,880
mostly eat a meat diet and it does seem

2148
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:32,639
to be a little bit of a difference what

2149
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,480
kind of meat i eat

2150
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:35,679
where it comes from i don't know if

2151
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,679
that's

2152
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:39,038
my own psychology also i mean there is

2153
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:41,358
an aspect to like

2154
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:43,039
when you know that the meat came from a

2155
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:46,159
good place and all the ways we've

2156
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,720
we've defined good you feel better about

2157
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:48,480
it

2158
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:50,719
and that has an effect like decreased

2159
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,358
stress so i'm a huge believer in that

2160
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:53,679
like

2161
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:55,199
outside of just nutrition how you feel

2162
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:56,719
about the whole experience is a huge

2163
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:58,879
impact but

2164
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:00,239
it does feel like the meat itself is

2165
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,318
actually just leading to less

2166
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,879
inflammation for me or like less

2167
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:06,159
like the bloat bloat bloated feeling and

2168
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,480
all those negative effects that

2169
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:10,318
could come with me versus like certain

2170
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:14,400
other ground beefs that i eat

2171
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:16,960
like store bought chicken breast

2172
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,719
or steak all those kinds of things my my

2173
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,640
body is a little bit more

2174
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,759
uh works a little bit harder to process

2175
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,960
that food it feels like

2176
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,880
i don't know if there's science to that

2177
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,719
but sort of anecdotally that seems to be

2178
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,520
the case omega-6s are a big part of that

2179
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,359
for in the case of the

2180
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,960
you eat a lot of beef yes you love beef

2181
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,679
yeah and so in

2182
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,640
a conventional beef product it's a 1 to

2183
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:37,920
30 ratio

2184
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:39,679
of omega-3s to sixes and it can

2185
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,640
sometimes 1 to 20 1 to 30 but

2186
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:43,199
that's the wrong direction in our beef

2187
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,440
it's

2188
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:47,759
you know as low as one to one right so

2189
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,439
that and the omega-6s are what's part of

2190
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:51,920
inflammation

2191
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:53,198
right now you know they the magic in

2192
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,319
animals is that they're incredibly

2193
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:56,798
efficient processors

2194
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,080
right and in the same way that you know

2195
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:01,278
they the

2196
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:03,119
the body can protect uh us from you know

2197
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,239
can process and take out tons of

2198
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:05,679
things that are toxic out of the

2199
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:06,479
environment i mean animals bodies can do

2200
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:08,640
that too

2201
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,399
so the beauty of meat is that it can be

2202
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,838
pretty clean you know things like

2203
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,399
roundup and stuff don't end up in the

2204
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:14,640
meat

2205
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,000
when we have antibiotics in our meat

2206
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,319
we're not worried about getting like

2207
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,399
tetracycline from the chicken breast

2208
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,239
what we're worried about is the workers

2209
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:23,759
getting tetracycline the chicken growing

2210
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,879
faster than it should the meat being

2211
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,960
chewier and not as

2212
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,880
high quality so they but the actual

2213
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,560
antibiotics don't the animals

2214
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,640
great at filtering that right they get

2215
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,798
that out so you have to think about

2216
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,838
meat not as like contamination of like

2217
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:37,119
oh there's going to be some of that

2218
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:40,000
garbage they used

2219
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:41,519
in the farming in my meat um but it's

2220
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,600
the more subtle things it's the fat

2221
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,960
ratio it's the protein density

2222
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,560
and there's also just i think in my

2223
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,640
experience um

2224
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,600
there's just more complex flavor and

2225
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,838
things that taste

2226
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,120
more complex this is you know science

2227
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:57,119
backs this up

2228
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:58,640
they fill you up faster so if you're

2229
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:01,279
looking to limit

2230
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,360
you know to to eat for fullness and but

2231
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:05,439
not eat as many calories

2232
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,439
more complex foods are the way to do

2233
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:08,960
that and that hit

2234
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:10,639
you know you hit your satiety he'll help

2235
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,119
you hit that society so things like i

2236
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,600
mean

2237
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:14,719
all the key um you know amino acids that

2238
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,800
help you feel full

2239
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:18,158
mostly from meat right so those are

2240
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,880
that's part of it like it but all meats

2241
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:19,839
have those

2242
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,279
then there's other kind of

2243
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,640
micronutrients and things around that

2244
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:24,800
complex flavor that help you feel full

2245
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,039
faster

2246
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,480
forgive me for this question but it is

2247
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:30,319
kind of an interesting one that

2248
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:31,678
people are curious about what does it

2249
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:34,799
feel like

2250
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,440
to be a uh or what does it take to be a

2251
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,560
woman

2252
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:41,279
ceo of a meat company i mean you're no

2253
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:43,199
longer ceo of campo but you did you ran

2254
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:45,599
you co-founded belcampo you ran it for

2255
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:48,559
many many years

2256
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:51,199
is there something that you could say in

2257
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:54,159
terms of challenges associated with that

2258
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:56,399
and how did you personally overcome it

2259
01:10:54,158 --> 01:11:00,158
said to be a female running a

2260
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:02,238
meat and livestock operation i felt very

2261
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:05,279
alone

2262
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:06,639
a lot you know for a long time um i felt

2263
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:09,840
very

2264
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:13,280
uh like everybody waiting for me

2265
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:14,880
to fail or watching and

2266
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:17,198
assuming that i was like just good at

2267
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,719
marketing or whatever else and

2268
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:23,759
and um so it it's taken me

2269
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:26,960
a while to

2270
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,960
not internalize that

2271
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:34,158
i think the only reason i've i'm here

2272
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:35,760
is we have our own supply chain in

2273
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:36,799
slaughterhouse and i think had i really

2274
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,239
been playing in the broader meat

2275
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,600
industry it would have been a shorter

2276
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,039
journey you know it would have been very

2277
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,640
hard to make it

2278
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:49,279
even get to this phase um

2279
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,280
but i do you know i think

2280
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:58,158
the mission is my life's work

2281
01:11:54,399 --> 01:12:01,198
the mission of cleaner ingredients that

2282
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:03,759
taste so amazing you don't need to

2283
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:05,279
do too much to them you know i i like

2284
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:08,159
creating food that's

2285
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,119
in support of good health yeah and then

2286
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,559
secondary to that

2287
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:12,719
it's the environment but like i want

2288
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,840
healthy food to be a joy to eat

2289
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:19,679
right and um

2290
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:21,440
that that's you know creating

2291
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,199
innovation the space for this company

2292
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:25,359
has been about building

2293
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:26,639
a brand that people understand and is

2294
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:28,399
transparent and

2295
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,840
that people believe in in an industry

2296
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:30,639
that's broadly perceived as pretty

2297
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,319
corrupt

2298
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,079
so those are things i feel enormously

2299
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:35,679
proud of um so you focused on the

2300
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,800
mission and the com

2301
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:41,359
the the push back all the mess

2302
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,719
the of the industry you try not to

2303
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:43,279
internalize it trying not to let it

2304
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,119
affect you

2305
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:47,279
focus on the mission you know and it's

2306
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:50,399
in the joy of it and the part where it's

2307
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:51,519
gotten fun for me has been returning to

2308
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:53,359
what i love about it

2309
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:55,120
and i've only had the privilege of doing

2310
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:58,158
that pretty recently

2311
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:59,920
um so i think for me personally

2312
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:01,679
you know starting i hosted these events

2313
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:03,520
on the farm called meat camps

2314
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,880
where i cook and teach people to cook

2315
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,719
and and you know

2316
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,560
taste and talk about flavor and all the

2317
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:11,279
like sensual aspects of it that i

2318
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,400
that are my fire like thank goodness i

2319
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,238
did that stuff because

2320
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:15,439
otherwise it was just such a beating you

2321
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:17,279
know so there were parts of it where i

2322
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:19,119
got to feed my fire

2323
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:20,559
and then now in the you know the past

2324
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:22,319
year since resigning i've been

2325
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,840
i do all the recipe development i shoot

2326
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:25,519
all the content i

2327
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,199
you know taste product i'm developing

2328
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,320
all of our new products i launched our

2329
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:29,519
meatballs i'm just about to launch our

2330
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,759
chicken meatballs

2331
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,040
doing a high protein bone broth like

2332
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,600
those are that's what

2333
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:37,760
why i did this was to be able to build

2334
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,079
this great product that i could build on

2335
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,199
so i'm kind of at that place now um but

2336
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:43,119
it's taken a lot longer

2337
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:44,479
and i think you know looking at the

2338
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:48,319
landscape of

2339
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:52,559
what to do in food this is definitely

2340
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:52,559
we tackled the most complicated problem

2341
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:56,880
well i can imagine you know and did it

2342
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,199
look like in the most old-fashioned way

2343
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,440
yeah

2344
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:00,799
right so it's been super complex and

2345
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:02,079
then i also look and i'm like yeah and

2346
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,600
it's been messy and it's going to

2347
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,439
continue to be hard

2348
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,719
but i'm proud of having tackled the

2349
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,639
heart problems

2350
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,399
so the hard problem here is not in the

2351
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:13,520
space of technologies

2352
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:14,238
it's in the space of bringing something

2353
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,239
that we've done

2354
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:17,359
for a long long time in our human

2355
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:20,559
history

2356
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:22,319
and uh scaling it

2357
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,239
in the face of all the other economic

2358
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:26,238
pressures

2359
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:27,599
like doing so successfully also

2360
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:28,000
communicating to the rest of the world

2361
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,159
that this

2362
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,439
is a powerful solution so inspiring the

2363
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:32,238
rest of the world that regenerative

2364
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:34,559
farming

2365
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:36,639
like running a company in this kind of

2366
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,760
way that's humane for animals

2367
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,960
good for the land good for people even

2368
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,719
if it costs

2369
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,880
like if there's an increased cost to the

2370
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,399
meat uh even if that

2371
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,719
if you have a broader vision that means

2372
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:51,759
eating less meat overall

2373
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:54,480
that that is that is like inspiring the

2374
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,960
world that this is a future we want

2375
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:58,319
and just taking that on and getting that

2376
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,760
done

2377
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:02,319
i got a chance to eat a little bit of

2378
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,920
cheese which uh

2379
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:06,238
which is a good opportunity to talk

2380
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,560
about your experience in italy

2381
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:10,079
he spent some time or as south of europe

2382
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,360
i'm not sure if it was italy yeah i

2383
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:14,559
lived in italy but

2384
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:17,519
and uh there's cheese involved right

2385
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,719
like what uh what what did you take away

2386
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,159
from that experience

2387
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:25,439
both as a chef and as a human being i

2388
01:15:22,158 --> 01:15:26,000
moved to europe right after my early 20s

2389
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:29,759
and i

2390
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:34,079
worked as a cheese maker and

2391
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:36,239
i lived in really small rural farms in

2392
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:37,519
the countryside and i got up early and

2393
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:41,439
milked animals

2394
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:42,400
made cheese and i got to live in a

2395
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:46,000
traditional

2396
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:50,839
agricultural society and learn

2397
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:54,238
how they ate so it shaped me as a cook

2398
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:56,800
because it was

2399
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:59,279
a chance to have incredible ingredients

2400
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,119
learn how to cook very simple food

2401
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:03,599
i had been immersed and thought that i

2402
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:05,119
wanted to be like a chefy chef right

2403
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,120
um because i love food and i love

2404
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:08,079
cooking and i and i was just drawn to

2405
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:11,198
that world

2406
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:12,559
but i don't like um the experience of

2407
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:14,000
that sort of like fancy food experience

2408
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,400
is not my

2409
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
not what what is exciting for me about

2410
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:20,158
it so i

2411
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,520
loved working in that environment

2412
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:23,359
because

2413
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,719
i got to eat lunches and dinners and

2414
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:27,839
everything with

2415
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:30,880
the farm that i lived on and just

2416
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,199
very traditional simple way to eat

2417
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,719
the other piece of it is you know i went

2418
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:36,879
to high school in the 90s

2419
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:38,319
child of like the low-fat fat generation

2420
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,920
right and

2421
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:41,359
it was just really liberating and

2422
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:45,279
amazing to eat

2423
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:47,039
tons of super fatty foods and um

2424
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:48,639
olive oil all over the place and bleak

2425
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:50,719
slabs of bread and salami

2426
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,159
and be in this like vibrant health like

2427
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:55,198
be leaner

2428
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:57,839
you know happy no skin stuff

2429
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:59,198
you know stop getting split ends like i

2430
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,880
stopped having flaky nails

2431
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:02,799
like just stuff that had bothered me my

2432
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,279
whole life including

2433
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,159
like just moodiness and that all just

2434
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:07,920
changed and

2435
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:09,198
granted i was also like living on a farm

2436
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,359
in italy and

2437
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:12,960
getting up with the sunlight and like

2438
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:13,439
there were lots of great aspects of my

2439
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,840
life

2440
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:16,639
as well that happened in that time but i

2441
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,199
was just

2442
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,880
immersed in this diet that i realized

2443
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:22,719
like man this is so simple and i also

2444
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,800
loved that i had

2445
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:26,480
like you know you'd have dinner and it

2446
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,400
was just like some ricotta cheese with

2447
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:29,439
some olive oil some bread and like a

2448
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:32,399
bowl of

2449
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:33,678
fava beans it's like that's dinner and

2450
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:35,519
it kind of broke down my

2451
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:37,600
assumptions too about like dinner always

2452
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,480
has to be this you know a protein and a

2453
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,159
vegetable and

2454
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:41,678
you know being more fluid and more

2455
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:43,920
seasonal

2456
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,920
was exciting for me so i just learned

2457
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,158
kind of a lot about

2458
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,520
paying attention to food simple

2459
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:52,799
preparation

2460
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:55,040
and the vibrancy of health

2461
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:58,800
that i personally experienced kind of

2462
01:17:55,039 --> 01:18:01,679
made me double down on that our mutual

2463
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,440
friend andrew huberman mentioned

2464
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:06,719
something offline to me about

2465
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:08,079
something involving the the mob

2466
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,480
is there is there something you could

2467
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:11,840
share or is this or or are people going

2468
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,599
to hurt if you share this

2469
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:15,279
it's far enough in the rearview mirror i

2470
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,800
mean i was

2471
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:22,158
hired by this group in sicily on

2472
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,600
and this is you know i was all of like

2473
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:26,079
21 years old

2474
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,840
and to get a permit to work there you

2475
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:29,920
have to show that you have a competency

2476
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,079
that nobody else in italy has

2477
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,679
and that competency for anya farnald at

2478
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:35,920
the time was cheese expert

2479
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,719
so it's like this like stupid american

2480
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,319
girl being like

2481
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:39,198
going to the consulate so i already knew

2482
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:40,960
that it was like there was something

2483
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:44,000
wobbly about this organization

2484
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:46,079
but i went to work for them and um my

2485
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,840
boss from that time

2486
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:49,198
did end up in federal prison for

2487
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,920
corruption um

2488
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:53,279
many years later um embezzlement

2489
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,359
primarily

2490
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:56,880
but so i was definitely in an

2491
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:59,920
environment that was

2492
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:02,079
um answering to multiple masters

2493
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,039
and the best way to put it it was it

2494
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:04,640
wasn't

2495
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:06,960
i couldn't have asked for a better way

2496
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,640
to to kind of get with life

2497
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,480
and understand how things happen in the

2498
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:13,920
world though you know

2499
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,959
of learning as somebody who tends to be

2500
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,319
super direct

2501
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:19,520
and um not very subtle it was amazing to

2502
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:21,679
be in this world where like

2503
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,640
everybody communicates in multiple

2504
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:24,960
levels like my

2505
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,000
we're going to lunch with my boss with

2506
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,359
somebody we're going to do a business

2507
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,479
deal with and

2508
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:31,119
by the they ordered a glass of wine and

2509
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:34,559
with that

2510
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:36,559
order communicated like disappointment

2511
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,840
yeah because that the father the person

2512
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,840
who had made that wine

2513
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,199
had offended that other guys yeah and

2514
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,400
like that level of stuff where

2515
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:43,439
like nothing happened directly i'm like

2516
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:44,639
what are we talking about afterwards i'm

2517
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:45,279
like what happened at lunch it's like oh

2518
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,800
i just

2519
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,238
you know i told him this by ordering

2520
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,560
that whatever you know that kind of

2521
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:49,839
thing

2522
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,080
so understand that there's different

2523
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:55,679
ways of communicating um

2524
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:57,519
but it was also you know it it was

2525
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:59,359
interesting to see and i think i you

2526
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,960
know it's kind of the struggle that i've

2527
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:02,960
lived again and again in my life

2528
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,520
fundamentally what we were doing in that

2529
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,119
operation was there's a very traditional

2530
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,040
cheese called the raguzano cheese

2531
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:10,319
in southeastern sicily where i lived

2532
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:12,319
raguza and

2533
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:14,079
it was about scaling that operation so

2534
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:15,439
it was european union money

2535
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:17,920
that my boss was also unfortunately

2536
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:20,479
using for other things but fundamentally

2537
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,079
it was to take that this type of very

2538
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:23,519
small-scale cheese get them exported

2539
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:25,039
help them scale and we did it

2540
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,520
and it was really challenging i learned

2541
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:29,679
a lot about the safety issues and

2542
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,639
collaboration issues and creating groups

2543
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,840
of farmers

2544
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:34,000
for scale so it's kind of been doing the

2545
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:37,199
same thing again and again

2546
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,880
um but sicily it

2547
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:40,960
you know it was also just the first

2548
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:44,319
place where i

2549
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:47,600
would regularly forage for food

2550
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:49,679
yeah you know like there i'd go to

2551
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:51,199
friends houses and we'd like go out and

2552
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,960
pick nettles or go out and pick

2553
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:54,079
wild asparagus so every season there was

2554
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,760
stuff that you would be gathering and

2555
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:57,519
that was just part of how you lived

2556
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,520
and it was part of your your health so

2557
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,080
that was i just learned a ton

2558
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,719
in that time about like simple eating

2559
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:06,880
and

2560
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:10,319
and and uh really

2561
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:12,079
that healthy food the simpler it is

2562
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:14,000
the better right like this sort of sense

2563
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:15,760
that healthy food isn't in a tiny

2564
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,198
packaged granola bar lots of labels lots

2565
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,800
of powders it's like the more simple

2566
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:20,000
essential close of the land can actually

2567
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,880
lead to optimal health

2568
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,279
you've learned to appreciate the

2569
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,840
simplicity of food uh

2570
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:26,880
the the the beauty within the simplicity

2571
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,719
i think it's because of the first time

2572
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:32,560
that i had amazing

2573
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:34,960
food quality wow okay because

2574
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,080
in the where i grew up there wasn't that

2575
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,520
food quality like i had some stuff for

2576
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:38,800
my garden and things that were great

2577
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,480
but that's the kind of place where when

2578
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,800
artichokes in season all of a sudden

2579
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,759
there's guys selling artichokes on their

2580
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,880
bicycles

2581
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,239
in the street and they're just

2582
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,800
fresh-picked and you'd get that one

2583
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:48,718
thing

2584
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,320
or the torpedo onions or they like so

2585
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,679
there's a seasonality and celebration of

2586
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:54,079
things in their peak moment

2587
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:55,600
and you just had that one thing and that

2588
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:56,639
was the first time i'd ever eaten in

2589
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,800
that way

2590
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,159
you were a judge several times on an

2591
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:03,199
iron chef

2592
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:06,399
how do you judge a good meal

2593
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:09,678
like what uh your own other people's

2594
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:11,039
like what rating system is good

2595
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:12,480
i mean i go on experience and think

2596
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:14,158
about how many of your like most

2597
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:14,879
memorable fantastic meals are like three

2598
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:17,519
star michelin

2599
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,359
meals it's more about the experience

2600
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,480
right it's more about that slow down who

2601
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:22,079
are you with

2602
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:24,000
um and some of our best meals are like

2603
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:25,840
the most simple things yeah so iron

2604
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
chef you know those are those were fun

2605
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,760
experiences um

2606
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,119
it's a lot of sous-vide though it's a

2607
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,880
lot of sauces

2608
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:34,238
it's a lot of powders i mean it's kind

2609
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,039
of like magic food

2610
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:38,399
so that's not i mean it's incredible to

2611
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:39,840
watch it as science

2612
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:41,679
um but i don't know if those are my most

2613
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,600
memorable meals so

2614
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:45,359
the experience is how you judge a good

2615
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,960
meal for you personally if you were a

2616
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:48,479
judge of the entirety of the human

2617
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,560
experience

2618
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:51,919
in terms of the the culinary journey

2619
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,039
that would be like the people you're

2620
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:56,399
eating with

2621
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:58,800
the environment like how you feel

2622
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:00,238
the journey building up to that meal

2623
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,840
like the whole thing you can't separate

2624
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:04,879
it out when i was

2625
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:07,520
learning as an apprentice cheese maker

2626
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,000
in greece the one of the best meals my

2627
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,719
life

2628
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,840
is like a bowl of cold sheep milk yogurt

2629
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,760
with like a crust of

2630
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,239
cold fat on top so like the way that

2631
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,679
these fatty you know sheep milk can have

2632
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:19,599
double the percentage of fat than cow

2633
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:21,039
milk so like there's the yogurt and then

2634
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,520
there's this crust of fat and then they

2635
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:23,600
pour

2636
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:26,400
the fresh honey over the top and you

2637
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:29,280
just eat like this bowl of

2638
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:30,960
probably top five meals of my life right

2639
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:32,238
i mean it just that's the simplicity

2640
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,840
just the best thing and it was the fact

2641
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:35,198
that's in terra cotta and i'd had this

2642
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,560
amazing day and

2643
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:38,000
you know all these things come together

2644
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,560
but i still remember that feeling and i

2645
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,639
think

2646
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,920
most of us have those like really great

2647
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:43,920
sensual memories

2648
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,440
of food and they're not about

2649
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,560
necessarily

2650
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:49,839
that one ex fancy over-the-top

2651
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,480
restaurant or something it's really

2652
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,400
about the whole context of enjoyment

2653
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:56,319
maybe you can help me with something uh

2654
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:58,719
so we i think offline said

2655
01:23:56,319 --> 01:24:01,039
that we're both introverts a bit but i

2656
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:01,039
certainly

2657
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:06,079
find joy in repetition so i kind of hide

2658
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:07,599
away

2659
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:09,760
as an introvert and eat the same thing

2660
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,039
over and over and over again

2661
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,280
but at the same time i had this

2662
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:15,760
conversation with tyler cohen who's an

2663
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:18,479
economist but he's also a food critic

2664
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:20,000
he writes these incredible posts about

2665
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:23,279
different foods

2666
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:25,279
um and we had this conversation about

2667
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:26,880
what his last meal would be if he had to

2668
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:27,759
choose like what is the best meal he's

2669
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,079
ever eaten

2670
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,600
that he would want to eat and he had a

2671
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:32,800
good answer about it it had to do with

2672
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,320
experience i think

2673
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,800
for him it was a particular mexican

2674
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,920
restaurant and it had in mexico because

2675
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,800
of the ingredients because of the

2676
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,480
experience

2677
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,920
because of the work it took to get there

2678
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:43,759
and all those kinds of things

2679
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,840
but also made me realize like when i was

2680
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:48,159
going home after that conversation

2681
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,520
that i couldn't answer that question

2682
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:51,439
myself like

2683
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:53,360
what is the best meal i've ever eaten

2684
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:56,559
because i really haven't experienced

2685
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:58,479
much and so it almost was like

2686
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,719
a challenge to myself like i feel like i

2687
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:04,399
should journey out a little bit more

2688
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:07,679
in this life and try stuff and

2689
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,158
to try to see like what is the best meal

2690
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,960
for me

2691
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:12,479
in the world you know like both the

2692
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,880
experience and the taste

2693
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:17,198
right so i was kind of wondering first

2694
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,880
i'd love to ask you like what your

2695
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:20,960
last meal would be or what is the

2696
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,359
greatest meal you've ever eaten

2697
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,359
but also and you're still very young and

2698
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:28,559
so the life is there's still more

2699
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:29,198
experiences to be had right um and for

2700
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,520
me

2701
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:33,919
like how do you go about finding the

2702
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:36,800
best meal in the world

2703
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,840
is is there a device you could give

2704
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,840
essentially

2705
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:45,119
there's that sense of anticipation

2706
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,679
right so if it's the best meal i'd say

2707
01:25:45,119 --> 01:25:49,119
for

2708
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:51,279
for you it would need to be on the heels

2709
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:53,519
of something where you'd pushed yourself

2710
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:54,559
with a fast or with an athletic event

2711
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,480
right or something

2712
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,840
like you would be coming into it with a

2713
01:25:56,479 --> 01:25:58,718
sense of anticipation because of

2714
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,480
deprivation

2715
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,000
yeah you would be hungry for it in that

2716
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:03,519
bigger sense of the word like hungry for

2717
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
deep nutrition on your soul level and

2718
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,840
your

2719
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,359
as well as your belly so i'd say that

2720
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,039
you'd have to think about it as a

2721
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:11,759
as a phase of things like multiple

2722
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:14,079
things um and then i also think

2723
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,760
you know you you love me you love cheese

2724
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:17,679
you have to have some things that come

2725
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,679
together right like there's got to be

2726
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:21,520
some specific elements of just your

2727
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,960
favorite flavors in that

2728
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,480
but there could be flavors yet to be

2729
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,279
discovered that's a whole other thing

2730
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,399
because

2731
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:29,039
i just uh emotionally and physically

2732
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:31,119
feel good

2733
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:32,719
on me but that's not that doesn't mean

2734
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:35,279
like maybe like

2735
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,719
a rice based dish like sushi or

2736
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:38,719
something like that

2737
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:40,399
or uh or indian cuisine where it's like

2738
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:42,239
sauces and the breads and whatever

2739
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:44,238
you know i love that stuff too so we're

2740
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:46,559
not talking about like

2741
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:47,919
you know a meal is an experience that

2742
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:51,199
could be

2743
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:52,880
uh like a one-night sand but with a

2744
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:54,479
with a piece of food right it could be a

2745
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,600
totally different than what actually

2746
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:57,519
makes you feel

2747
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,120
good when you eat it every day yeah

2748
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,280
absolutely completely

2749
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:02,639
completely analogous i get that i mean

2750
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:04,079
you also though there's elements of

2751
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,279
comfort and love and those different

2752
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:08,158
pieces for you

2753
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:09,920
but i think you got to look at like

2754
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:10,799
where would you go somewhere like would

2755
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,639
you go

2756
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,000
to a place where you could you know hike

2757
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:15,279
in japan and then end up in a little

2758
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,319
place where you'd eat something

2759
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:18,079
that's right that's where i would think

2760
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:19,359
you were going to have that magic moment

2761
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:20,079
yeah you know maybe some place you go to

2762
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:21,920
mongolia

2763
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:23,359
and you're in a in a really extreme

2764
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,800
environment for three or four days and

2765
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:26,559
then you come back and you're

2766
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,840
in a farm and you get something on the

2767
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,520
table that's a surprise and you're

2768
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,920
hungry like that's going to be

2769
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,880
the moment where you're going to explode

2770
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,440
in the instance of like

2771
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,119
the culinary level yeah for a lex that

2772
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:38,238
levels up right like that's the journey

2773
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:40,079
for you it has to be

2774
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:41,359
i think from understanding you like a

2775
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:44,479
combination

2776
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:46,158
of that pushing yourself anticipation

2777
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:48,079
and and something about this of some

2778
01:27:46,158 --> 01:27:48,879
sort exactly and the environment well i

2779
01:27:48,079 --> 01:27:52,238
definitely

2780
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:54,079
definitely like some fasting is part of

2781
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:57,599
a great meal for me so like

2782
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:59,840
24 hours is like the minimum you're

2783
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,800
you're more sensitive to the richness of

2784
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:04,159
any experience

2785
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:06,400
for me when i fast 24 hours

2786
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:10,000
like and so that's a requirement for a

2787
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:11,599
good meal is 24 hour fast i think

2788
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,039
it's just like you're able to taste i

2789
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:16,000
don't know maybe psychological

2790
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:17,439
but you're able to disassemble the

2791
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,279
various flavors

2792
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:20,879
in a meal as simple as like even a

2793
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:22,000
chicken breast there's all kinds of

2794
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,840
flavors going on

2795
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,279
because like when you cook a chicken

2796
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:28,079
breast there's like

2797
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:29,679
the outside the inside i mean the volume

2798
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:31,760
of the meat tastes different as you

2799
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,679
eat like the different fibers and you

2800
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,480
can like tell all those differences as

2801
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:36,158
you're eating

2802
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:38,000
when you're you've fasted and you can

2803
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:39,519
appreciate that and of course

2804
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,119
you're right part part of the the

2805
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,600
journey is important it makes me think

2806
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:44,238
like

2807
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,440
whether restaurants is the right place

2808
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:47,759
to explore

2809
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:49,359
or i'm envisioning it on a farm for you

2810
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,159
and i'm envisioning it in a place that's

2811
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:52,719
like really

2812
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:54,000
into ag and food you know like even a

2813
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:55,600
place like romania

2814
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,520
you know like these incredible farms

2815
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,039
right where it's not gonna get any like

2816
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:01,120
fancy restaurants there but you're

2817
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:03,439
probably gonna have some amazing

2818
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:05,039
little cheeses and cured meats and you

2819
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:06,399
might go to some you know have some

2820
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,760
experience and end up in a place with

2821
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:09,198
like four things on the plate and each

2822
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,000
of them blows your mind yeah you know

2823
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:12,079
like or japan

2824
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
is another place like that um i think

2825
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:15,039
vietnam laos like i mean those are

2826
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,960
countries where there's like these

2827
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:19,039
incredible niche ingredients and

2828
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:20,880
this essentialism around food that's

2829
01:29:19,039 --> 01:29:21,519
fascinating or maybe it's in russia with

2830
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,440
putin

2831
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,040
that might be the best meal with him on

2832
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:27,519
the farm yeah

2833
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:29,198
that'd be uh it's hard to reproduce that

2834
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,040
if that is in fact a good meal it'd be

2835
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:33,759
you know it's hard it's hard to get him

2836
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:35,920
out to the farm but maybe one time

2837
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,760
maybe the best meal what about you for

2838
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:39,679
me like it's the

2839
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,199
it's the ingredients that i associate

2840
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:43,119
with like indulgence like

2841
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:44,399
be fresh bread with like my favorite

2842
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:46,800
cultured butter on it

2843
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:48,719
be food in my childhood i grew up in

2844
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,400
oregon we always had salmon

2845
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:52,079
and i'd smoke salmon or salmon eggs like

2846
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:53,599
really good salmon eggs i love

2847
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:55,279
cheese i love goat cheese i love all

2848
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,120
kinds of cheese there'd be cheese

2849
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:58,399
i love meat obviously i'm imagining it's

2850
01:29:57,119 --> 01:30:00,158
sort of like an

2851
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:01,679
abundance of like 10 things i love it's

2852
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:02,000
not a dish you know it's like all the

2853
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,760
yummy

2854
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,520
all of your indulgences on the same

2855
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,039
plate yeah yeah and there isn't like for

2856
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,800
me there's not like a big cake or

2857
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:10,960
something super like that it's like

2858
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,800
really yummy things that i love like

2859
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,079
really fresh crusty delicious bread

2860
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,520
that's warm and it's got a bunch of

2861
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:16,238
butter on it and i can put some salt on

2862
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,679
it and

2863
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:20,158
eat a big slab of that that's just

2864
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:22,399
that's where i'm at that's funny and so

2865
01:30:20,158 --> 01:30:24,799
meat to you is not

2866
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:25,920
like one of those indulgences oh

2867
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,279
definitely that'd definitely be steak

2868
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,800
there too i'm just imagining not like

2869
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:30,960
there isn't a specific dish it's like

2870
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,840
eight or ten things right it's the fresh

2871
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,239
bread

2872
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,960
it's something like fishy yummy probably

2873
01:30:34,238 --> 01:30:37,599
be

2874
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,520
really good fresh berries too there'd be

2875
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,400
a steak or a pork chop or something like

2876
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,880
meaty and

2877
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,519
delicious and savory there'd be some

2878
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,960
cheese

2879
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,280
just a bunch of different things that i

2880
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,719
love to eat that like all kind of check

2881
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:49,519
boxes for me is probably what would make

2882
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:52,719
me happiest

2883
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:54,239
i'm afraid of variety i like the focus

2884
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:56,319
when you can just this is all you have

2885
01:30:54,238 --> 01:30:57,039
the scarcity of just this is the one

2886
01:30:56,319 --> 01:30:58,960
ingredient

2887
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,238
yeah and really appreciating

2888
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,840
appreciating it or maybe

2889
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:05,919
one thing like one full complex flavor

2890
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:08,480
whatever the heck that is

2891
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:10,399
it's like the distraction this the

2892
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:12,718
serial dating nature of

2893
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:14,079
having a bunch of things in a plate is

2894
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:16,800
uh

2895
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:19,119
yeah for some reason that prevents me

2896
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,960
from fully enjoying any one of them

2897
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:23,279
i don't know why why that is the more

2898
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,039
healthy way to do it is the varieties

2899
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:27,439
your your way is the healthier way to do

2900
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:29,600
it is alcohol involved

2901
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:30,879
i don't drink very much okay i like red

2902
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,920
wine um

2903
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,440
but i just don't really i i love yeah i

2904
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:40,000
love red wine with good food

2905
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:42,319
um and i also co-founded a rum business

2906
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,520
um that's an organic rum so i love that

2907
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:45,279
product but that's not

2908
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:48,159
that for me it's like i'm i'm more

2909
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:50,880
interested in the in the food

2910
01:31:48,158 --> 01:31:51,519
i'd say is there some connection between

2911
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,719
your

2912
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:57,120
chef life cooking and music does this

2913
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,840
music have a role in the experience

2914
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:00,559
like i love artistic expression and

2915
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,079
that's a

2916
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,440
that's always had a role in my life in

2917
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:04,000
the same way i love to paint and draw

2918
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:06,638
and

2919
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
um all the different things i was a

2920
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:08,960
professional musician when i lived in

2921
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,800
sicily

2922
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:13,840
by definition technicality because i

2923
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,840
played in the municipal band

2924
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:18,158
so i would march around the town yeah um

2925
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:20,719
with

2926
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:22,238
all the funerals i get like 50 euro

2927
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:23,359
every time i'd like march in a funeral

2928
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:25,359
playing my oboe so

2929
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:26,559
it's given me i like that because i like

2930
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:28,719
to like you were talking about going to

2931
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:30,320
farms like what i quested foreign was

2932
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:31,840
experience and connection

2933
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:33,759
right in places where i could learn

2934
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:35,440
things that's been the through line of

2935
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,159
my learning journey i've learned things

2936
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:38,000
and

2937
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:40,238
sought knowledge that i can't get in any

2938
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,920
conventional learning environment and so

2939
01:32:40,238 --> 01:32:43,599
what are the tools that let me do that

2940
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,520
it was like

2941
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,960
being adaptable and comfortable in

2942
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,560
different cultures but also having

2943
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,639
common ground points right

2944
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,840
that are that are that are allow you to

2945
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:52,560
connect with people so music's one of

2946
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,600
those things

2947
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:56,239
so i love like you know music but i also

2948
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,679
you know any

2949
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:58,879
there's any number of enjoy of food

2950
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,760
being able to pitch in and help in the

2951
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,760
kitchen

2952
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,119
um you know to play cards like those are

2953
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,520
when you're dealing with getting into

2954
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:05,039
like

2955
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,560
farming communities and stuff that stuff

2956
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:08,399
really helps right so

2957
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,920
i basically have cultivated tools that

2958
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:12,559
let me drop into places

2959
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:14,000
where i can learn and so those are all

2960
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,760
kind of of a piece

2961
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,279
those are just tools to get in there

2962
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,800
that said we did listen to some justin

2963
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:20,800
bieber earlier today that was uh

2964
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:22,320
i need to get more into them i need to i

2965
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,440
need to understand the full complexity

2966
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:24,880
of the biebs

2967
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:27,279
you're trying to achieve what hunting

2968
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,800
stands for but at a much larger scale

2969
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:30,719
which is what kind of bill campos stands

2970
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,239
for but what are your thoughts on

2971
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:35,279
hunting as a source of meat

2972
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:38,319
it's amazing 100 pro hunting

2973
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:38,960
um i think the reason that hunting flips

2974
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:41,519
a switch

2975
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:43,840
for so many people is because it's the

2976
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:47,199
first time they've had clean meat

2977
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:48,560
in their lives wow okay so i think that

2978
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:50,960
the hunter's journey

2979
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,239
when people get so turned on by hunting

2980
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,719
they're just like oh my god

2981
01:33:52,238 --> 01:33:55,919
i'm never going back yeah i'm saying

2982
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:57,119
that's great if you've got access to

2983
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,158
that if you know the guy he'll give you

2984
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:00,880
the backstrap awesome

2985
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:02,158
but like you that's not very that's not

2986
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,480
achievable for most of us

2987
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:06,000
yes um and i do think that talking to

2988
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:07,039
hunters about their experiences what

2989
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,119
they love about it

2990
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:10,000
many of them are just outdoors and i say

2991
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:10,399
that because most of them are men but

2992
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,079
most

2993
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:13,920
love the outdoors aspect of it and being

2994
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:15,279
out in in the wild

2995
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:17,039
but a lot of them it's because of how

2996
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:18,559
they feel when they eat the meat

2997
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:20,639
and it's because they're eating i mean

2998
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,920
99 of meat in america is made a very

2999
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:24,719
specific way

3000
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,679
and it's in in a way that is pretty

3001
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,480
inflammatory

3002
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:30,079
not incredibly delicious and when you're

3003
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:32,238
on that extreme

3004
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:34,158
um and then you toggle to having this

3005
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:35,519
totally different style of product

3006
01:34:34,158 --> 01:34:37,119
it feels radically different in your

3007
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,239
body so of course you're like i'll never

3008
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:40,079
go back

3009
01:34:38,238 --> 01:34:41,519
so when i talk about us being on that

3010
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:44,719
spectrum it's like well it's

3011
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:47,119
hunted me to i mean i can never on any

3012
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:47,840
commercial operation create the variety

3013
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:49,920
of

3014
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,520
the biodiversity of species that an elk

3015
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,359
gets when it's

3016
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,880
wandering around of a zone i mean i

3017
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:56,799
could there's no way you can do that on

3018
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,639
a farm so there's always going to be

3019
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,079
that extra five or ten percent that

3020
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:01,760
those wild animals are going to have

3021
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:03,198
you know and those wild animals also

3022
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,239
fast for longer they go through periods

3023
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:06,319
of starvation

3024
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:08,000
and that creates an even like slower

3025
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:09,759
growth for musculature that's going to

3026
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,158
be create even more

3027
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,199
unique flavor and characteristics and so

3028
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:16,079
that's why there's that

3029
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:17,919
that extra in the hunted meat but you

3030
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:19,840
can come a lot closer

3031
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,440
with regenerative traditional farming to

3032
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,279
that flavor and health

3033
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:25,039
um than with any other type of farming i

3034
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:26,800
know so that's where i see it on the

3035
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:30,399
spectrum i love that people are

3036
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:33,600
getting excited about about game because

3037
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:35,839
it's all it's better for your health

3038
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,280
it's got all the same characteristics of

3039
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,960
regenerative reformed meat

3040
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:41,039
and it gets people turned on to like

3041
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:44,158
simple delicious food

3042
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:47,198
you know you shouldn't have to cover

3043
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:48,319
food with sauce that's got corn syrup

3044
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:49,599
and soy

3045
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:52,079
a bunch of junk in it to make it

3046
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:53,199
palatable if you got to put sauce on

3047
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:54,479
your food you need to look at your

3048
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:56,158
ingredients

3049
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:58,238
you need to revisit what you're starting

3050
01:35:56,158 --> 01:36:01,039
from because if you have to

3051
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:02,718
put a bunch of things to mask flavor

3052
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:04,238
onto anything you're eating

3053
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:06,000
you're trying to basically fool your

3054
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:06,959
palate into doing what's not best for

3055
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,639
your body

3056
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,079
we're trying to to tell our palettes

3057
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:11,840
like just make it through this plate so

3058
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:13,600
you can get the calories in

3059
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,440
and we're masking the fact that we don't

3060
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:17,360
actually find it very appetizing

3061
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:19,439
so we're kind of teaching ourselves to

3062
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:22,479
overcome our instinct

3063
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:23,279
with food we're saying here's this kind

3064
01:36:22,479 --> 01:36:25,279
of

3065
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:27,039
based substrate not very interesting i'm

3066
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:29,759
not like sparking to it

3067
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:31,279
awesome put sugar and salt on it this up

3068
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,000
the hyper-processed flavor profile

3069
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:35,759
great done and then your spark to it

3070
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,479
yeah that's not that's a very short road

3071
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,560
and that's i think

3072
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:39,678
a lot of the health problems we have now

3073
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:42,400
is because we're

3074
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:44,079
masking flavors and basically trying to

3075
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:45,439
get ourselves to move down this path of

3076
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:46,238
the same way we behave around all hyper

3077
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:48,158
processed foods

3078
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:50,399
yeah and that gets us into a mess with

3079
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:52,638
our health so if we can get

3080
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:54,238
things like game where people love the

3081
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,920
flavor out of the gate but it's natural

3082
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:56,399
simple mentally processed like that's a

3083
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:59,118
win

3084
01:36:56,399 --> 01:37:00,638
yeah that it reverses that hyper

3085
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:03,759
processing

3086
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:06,000
trend that we're on as a human species

3087
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:07,440
and that's uh that's the promise of

3088
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,079
regenerative farming that's the promise

3089
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:10,719
of hunting

3090
01:37:08,079 --> 01:37:11,600
obviously the former can be scaled the

3091
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:14,639
hunting

3092
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,480
i think cannot be scaled right but in

3093
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:18,239
many ways the hunting

3094
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:20,319
inspires the world that this is the

3095
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:24,718
right way to eat yes

3096
01:37:20,319 --> 01:37:27,519
and and that naturally leads to then

3097
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,560
uh the humane farming regenerative

3098
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:30,400
farming idea

3099
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,679
which is this idea that hunting

3100
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:33,599
represents

3101
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,440
how do you scale that well if you look

3102
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,719
at like you know we're talking about

3103
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:38,479
people use the sort of marketing

3104
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,600
language of like happy cows or

3105
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:40,718
that kind of thing you know if you're

3106
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,000
talking about the happiest animals it's

3107
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:44,319
wild animals right

3108
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,279
so if you wonder why these practices are

3109
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:46,639
good

3110
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:48,399
talk to hunters you know you're talking

3111
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,159
about animals that have lived in their

3112
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:51,359
evolutionary capacity right who have

3113
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:52,079
played their role in the ecosystem

3114
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:54,880
who've

3115
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:55,359
lived their meaning of life right and

3116
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,319
that's

3117
01:37:55,359 --> 01:37:58,960
a very powerfully different kind of role

3118
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:01,198
than

3119
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,800
than livestock production so i think if

3120
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:05,599
we can make our livestock production

3121
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,000
as similar to wild as possible then

3122
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:07,920
we're

3123
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,319
a lot of steps closer so you said the

3124
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,639
animals are happiest in the wild

3125
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:13,679
and that's where they find meaning uh

3126
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:15,520
what about us

3127
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,118
the human animal what's the meaning for

3128
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:20,239
us do you think

3129
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:22,319
if you've uh monitored the life cycle of

3130
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:23,759
a lot of living beings you ever look in

3131
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:27,039
the mirror and think like

3132
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:30,480
why the hell are we humans here ah

3133
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:33,439
i mean thriving reducing suffering um

3134
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:34,479
creating goodness i mean those are the

3135
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:36,799
things i see in

3136
01:38:34,479 --> 01:38:37,839
in animals behavior they're mostly

3137
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:41,199
interested in

3138
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:43,440
in reducing suffering and and

3139
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:45,198
um nurturing right those are the things

3140
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:47,359
that i think evolutionarily

3141
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:49,039
and we humans are just clever we want to

3142
01:38:47,359 --> 01:38:50,719
be able to try to do that at a bigger

3143
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:52,960
and bigger scale

3144
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:55,039
like as much as possible reduce the

3145
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:57,279
suffering in the world

3146
01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:58,319
and somehow that alleviates us of our

3147
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:00,000
own suffering

3148
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:02,880
that's the russian thing let life is

3149
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:06,238
suffering and somehow helping others

3150
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,679
alleviates it and come up with creative

3151
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:10,079
solutions to do that that's really

3152
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:10,079
interesting

3153
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,960
it's almost consciousness is the thing

3154
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:17,519
that

3155
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,760
led to suffering but it also led to the

3156
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:23,040
desire to alleviate the suffering

3157
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:24,880
it's a it's a feedback loop

3158
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:27,118
consciousness creates suffering and the

3159
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:30,159
desire to alleviate it

3160
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:33,359
uh is there yet a pretty nonlinear life

3161
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:36,238
your parents were professors you

3162
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:38,399
have done a lot of sort of incredible

3163
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:39,678
things that many would say kind of

3164
01:39:38,399 --> 01:39:42,479
like how the hell are you gonna get this

3165
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:45,039
done is there advice you can give

3166
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:46,959
to young people today like high school

3167
01:39:45,039 --> 01:39:49,279
college

3168
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:51,359
about uh how to do uh how to live a

3169
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:52,000
similarly non-linear crazy life and

3170
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:54,639
accomplish

3171
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:57,279
be as successful as you have been about

3172
01:39:54,639 --> 01:40:01,920
whether it's just their career

3173
01:39:57,279 --> 01:40:01,920
or life in general the greatest

3174
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:09,840
gifts i've been given have come from

3175
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:09,839
pursuing curiosity

3176
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:13,600
just trying to understand the thing

3177
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:15,519
you're curious about and allowing

3178
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:18,560
yourself to be curious about and just

3179
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:20,880
going with it and also pursuing things

3180
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:24,639
that are like deeply joyful

3181
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:25,440
for me not what society wants but you

3182
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:27,279
just personally

3183
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:28,719
just on your own you're happy and that's

3184
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:30,319
something that in the times when i

3185
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:33,840
strayed from that

3186
01:40:30,319 --> 01:40:36,559
my life has been harder right so

3187
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,199
it's fundamentally what are we on earth

3188
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,719
to do

3189
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:44,719
you know to live and thrive and

3190
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:46,639
so pursuing things that

3191
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:49,520
are curious and satisfying and

3192
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:52,800
interesting and joyful and allow me to

3193
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:57,440
to grow so the

3194
01:40:52,800 --> 01:41:00,400
i made a number of choices to do things

3195
01:40:57,439 --> 01:41:01,039
that were more complicated and kind of

3196
01:41:00,399 --> 01:41:03,679
not

3197
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,319
not considered like so cool at the time

3198
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:05,600
although now

3199
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:07,279
it's cool to work on farms it wasn't

3200
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,400
when i started my career in animal

3201
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:10,559
agriculture

3202
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:11,759
and it was like but just deeply

3203
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,440
interesting to me

3204
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,880
and i felt like there was just lots to

3205
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:17,439
learn and so

3206
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,800
that's been the the path for me is like

3207
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:19,759
going for something that's like curious

3208
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,360
and hard

3209
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:24,800
and kind of sticking with it and being

3210
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:24,799
open to it and

3211
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:29,439
growing elements that give me joy

3212
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:32,718
through that

3213
01:41:29,439 --> 01:41:33,839
so i also you know for people who are

3214
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:35,198
starting out in their careers and want

3215
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,319
to do something different too it's like

3216
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:38,238
get out of

3217
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:39,599
your comfort go to a place that you've

3218
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:40,638
got something to learn from and let it

3219
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:43,119
teach you that and you'll

3220
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:45,760
you'll get beat up like i got beat up by

3221
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:49,118
that experience like it was really hard

3222
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:51,440
you know i laugh about now working for

3223
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:52,880
insistently for tease me i mean like and

3224
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,039
the funny experiences i had there but it

3225
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,960
was hard i was lonely i cried a lot it

3226
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:57,600
was stressful it was like it was hard it

3227
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,880
was really hard

3228
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,000
when you inside of it you didn't know

3229
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,639
how it's going to turn out you didn't

3230
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,719
know it's going to

3231
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:04,000
turn out like why didn't i get a job

3232
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:04,719
doing something that all my friends were

3233
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,158
doing and

3234
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:07,760
and it and and i didn't speak the

3235
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:08,000
language i had to learn foreign language

3236
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,560
and

3237
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,079
learn how to function and it like it was

3238
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,560
very lonely and very challenging but

3239
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:14,319
then

3240
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:17,039
that's where my resilience started to

3241
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:19,920
grow right so the things i learned there

3242
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:20,800
ended up just being about resilience and

3243
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:23,359
understanding

3244
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,480
the language of subtlety and meaning so

3245
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:25,198
that's something that's carried me

3246
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:26,879
through my life

3247
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:28,719
but it was a curiosity about cheese

3248
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,840
making and about like just living in a

3249
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,359
village that was there i'm like wouldn't

3250
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,960
it be amazing just live in a really

3251
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:34,399
rural village and you just went with it

3252
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,639
and i just like this seems incredible

3253
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:36,479
and

3254
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:38,079
and have a place where you can you know

3255
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:40,000
and these like the

3256
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:42,158
the people seem interesting the food

3257
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,520
seems good and let's just like try this

3258
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:45,839
and see what i can learn

3259
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:47,040
and that like putting yourself out of

3260
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,319
your comfort zone

3261
01:42:47,039 --> 01:42:50,479
in a place where you have a chance to

3262
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:53,359
learn and grow is

3263
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:54,718
is the the secret because it's you grow

3264
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:56,559
through discomfort

3265
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:58,319
you know people think that you grow when

3266
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,760
you get into this environment where

3267
01:42:58,319 --> 01:43:01,679
everything's like kind of

3268
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,520
sailing along but like growth actually

3269
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:05,520
comes through pain

3270
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:07,119
you know it's like you you know growth

3271
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,159
comes from being cut down and beat down

3272
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:11,039
and having to re

3273
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:11,599
regrow and double down and so that kind

3274
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:13,359
of

3275
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,800
that kind of opportunity you have to

3276
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:16,960
seek it out you put yourself

3277
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:18,159
in the line of fire but if the situation

3278
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:19,520
sucks

3279
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:22,079
it's a sign that you might be doing

3280
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:23,840
something right in the sense that you're

3281
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:25,359
on the path

3282
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:27,279
at the end of which you'll be a better

3283
01:43:25,359 --> 01:43:29,439
person if you allow yourself to grow in

3284
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:32,079
that way like as opposed to resisting it

3285
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:33,359
just uh going along with a journey and

3286
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:36,158
persevering

3287
01:43:33,359 --> 01:43:36,880
and that ended us up in this incredible

3288
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:39,039
place

3289
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,319
this whole conversation i'll probably

3290
01:43:39,039 --> 01:43:43,118
overlay a video

3291
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:43,519
i'm i'm looking at a gorgeous mountain

3292
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:45,759

3293
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:47,440

the cheese the fish eggs just everything

3297
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:56,079
about this place

3298
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,158
uh looking up you can see the stars

3299
01:43:56,079 --> 01:44:00,000
the stars at night are beautiful and

3300
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:03,359
