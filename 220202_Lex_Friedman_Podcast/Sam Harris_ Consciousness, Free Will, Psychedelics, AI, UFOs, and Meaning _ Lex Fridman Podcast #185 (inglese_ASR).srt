including the end of faith the moral

meditation app

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,719
called waking up that i've been using to

13
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,278
guide my own meditation

14
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,160
quick mention of our sponsors national

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,120
as a side note let me say that sam has

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,280
been an inspiration to me

21
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,799
as he has been for many many people

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,160
first from his writing

23
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,558
then his early debates maybe 13 14 years

24
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,398
ago

25
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,759
on the subject of faith his

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,879
conversations with

27
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:55,599
christopher hitchens and since 2013

28
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,718
his podcast i didn't always agree with

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
all of his ideas

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,920
but i was always drawn to the care and

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,640
depth of the way he explored those ideas

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
the calm and clarity amid the storm of

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,680
difficult

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,680
at times controversial discourse i

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,560
really can't express in words how much

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
it meant to me

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,079
that he sam harris someone who i've

38
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,559
listened to

39
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,158
for many hundreds of hours would write a

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,280
kind email to me saying

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,439
he enjoyed this podcast and more

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,759
that he thought i had a unique voice

43
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:27,839
that added something to this world

44
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,000
whether it's true or not it made me feel

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,960
special and truly grateful to be able to

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,759
do this thing

47
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,359
and motivated me to work my ass off to

48
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,840
live up to those words

49
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,799
meeting sam and getting to talk with him

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,320
was one of the most

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,040
memorable moments of my life this is

52
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,000
the lex friedman podcast and here is my

53
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,520
conversation

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,438
with sam harris i've been enjoying

55
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,560
meditating with the waking up app

56
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,879
recently

57
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,759
it makes me think about the origins of

58
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,118
cognition

59
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,959
and consciousness so let me ask where do

60
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,879
thoughts come from

61
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,640
well that's that's a very difficult

62
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,519
question to answer uh

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,118
subjectively they appear to come from

64
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,280
nowhere

65
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,400
right i mean it's just they they come

66
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,360
out of

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
some kind of mystery that is at our

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
backs

69
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,119
subjectively right so which is to say

70
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,039
that

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,480
if you pay attention the nature of your

72
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,000
mind in this moment you realize that you

73
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,000
don't know what you're going to think

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,039
next right now you're expecting to think

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,360
something that

76
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,799
seems like you authored it right you

77
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,480
know you're not unless you

78
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,120
you're schizophrenic or you have some

79
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,878
kind of thought disorder where you where

80
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,840
your thoughts seem fundamentally foreign

81
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,560
to you

82
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,280
they do have a a kind of signature of

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,479
selfhood

84
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,159
associated with them and

85
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,318
people readily identify with them they

86
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,799
feel like what you are i mean this is

87
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,039
the thing

88
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
this is the spell that gets broken with

89
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,000
meditation

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,759
our default state is to feel identical

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,800
to the stream of thought right which is

92
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,598
fairly paradoxical because how could you

93
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,840
as a mind as a self you know if there if

94
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,799
there were such a thing as a self

95
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,759
how could you be identical to the next

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800
piece of language

97
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:22,399
or the next image that just

98
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,760
springs into into conscious view

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,760
but and you know meditation

100
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,280
is ultimately about examining that that

101
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,719
point of view closely enough so as to

102
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
unravel it and

103
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,199
feel the the freedom that's on the other

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,680
side of that identification but

105
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:41,679
the um subjectively thoughts

106
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,439
simply emerge right and you don't think

107
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,680
them before you think them right there's

108
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,759
this first moment where

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,280
you know just anyone listening to us or

110
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,878
watching us now could

111
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,560
perform this experiment for themselves i

112
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,719
mean just imagine

113
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,318
something or remember something and just

114
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,239
just pick a memory any memory

115
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,759
right you've got a storehouse of memory

116
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,560
just promote one

117
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,560
to consciousness

118
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
did you pick that memory i mean let's

119
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,079
say you remembered

120
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
breakfast yesterday or you remembered

121
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,200
what you said to your spouse

122
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,280
before leaving the house or you

123
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,119
remembered what you watched on netflix

124
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,079
last night or you remembered

125
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,239
something that happened to you when

126
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,319
you're four years old whatever it is

127
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:25,839
right it first it wasn't there

128
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,079
and then it appeared and

129
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,359
that is not a i'm sure we'll get to the

130
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,758
topic of free will

131
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,560
ultimately uh that's not evidence of

132
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
free will

133
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,639
right why are you so sure by the way

134
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,000
it's very interesting

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,240
after no no free will of my own yeah um

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,519
everything just appears right but what

137
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,199
else could it do

138
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,639
and so that's that's the subjective side

139
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,919
of it objectively

140
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,319
you know we have every reason to believe

141
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,069
that many of our thoughts all of our

142
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,319
thoughts are

143
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:56,159
[Music]

144
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,040
uh at bottom what some part of our brain

145
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
is doing

146
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,439
neurophysiologically i mean that these

147
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,038
are the products of some kind of neural

148
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:07,038
computation and neural um representation

149
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:10,000
when you're talking about memories is it

150
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:14,000
possible to pull the string

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,560
of thoughts to try to get to its root

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
to try to dig in past the the obvious

153
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
surface

154
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,520
subjective experience of like the

155
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,360
thoughts pop out of nowhere

156
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,758
is it possible to somehow get closer to

157
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,879
the roots of where they come out of

158
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,720
from the the firing of the cells or is

159
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,199
it a useless pursuit to dig that

160
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,000
to dig into that direction well you can

161
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,120
get

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,079
closer to many many subtle

163
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,000
contents in consciousness right so you

164
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,399
can notice things more and more clearly

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,600
and have a landscape of mind open up and

166
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,758
become more

167
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
differentiated and more interesting and

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,680
if you take psychedelics

169
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,198
you know it opens up you know why

170
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,199
depending on what you've taken and

171
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,879
the dose you know it opens in directions

172
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,038
and to an extent that

173
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,639
you know very few people imagine would

174
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:01,918
be possible but for having had those

175
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,478
experiences

176
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:08,719
but this idea of you getting closer

177
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,478
to something to the the datum of of your

178
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,120
mind or such as something of interest in

179
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,038
there

180
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,639
or something that's more real is um

181
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,560
is ultimately undermined because there's

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,439
no place from which you're getting

183
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,240
closer to it

184
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,038
there's no your part of that journey

185
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,680
right like we

186
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,120
we we tend to start out you know whether

187
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,720
it's

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,879
in meditation or or in any kind of

189
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,840
self-examination

190
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,399
or you know taking psychedelics we start

191
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:39,198
out

192
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:40,719
with this default point of view of uh

193
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,478
feeling like we're the kind of on the

194
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,280
the rider on the horse of consciousness

195
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,079
or we're the

196
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,439
we're the man in the boat going down the

197
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,680
stream of consciousness

198
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,199
right but we're so we're differentiated

199
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,400
from

200
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,038
what we know cognitively uh

201
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,560
introspectively but that feeling of

202
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,478
being differentiated that feeling of

203
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,519
being a self that can strategically pay

204
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,639
attention

205
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,879
to some contents of consciousness

206
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,160
is what it's like to be identified with

207
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,519
some

208
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
part of the stream of thought that's

209
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,879
going uninspected right like that

210
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:17,120
it's a false point of view and when you

211
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,478
see that and cut through that then this

212
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,680
sense of

213
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,360
this this notion of going deeper kind of

214
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,240
breaks apart because really

215
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,520
there is no depth ultimately everything

216
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,879
is right on the surface everything

217
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,918
there's no center to consciousness

218
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,360
there's just consciousness and its

219
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,560
contents and that those those contents

220
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,120
can change

221
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,918
vastly again if you drop acid you know

222
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,598
the the contents change

223
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,758
but there's in some sense that doesn't

224
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,399
represent

225
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,080
a position of depth versus the continuum

226
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,799
of depth versus surface

227
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,959
has broken apart so you're taking as a

228
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,960
starting point that there is a horse

229
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,519
called consciousness and you're riding

230
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,000
it and the actual riding is very shallow

231
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,120
this is

232
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,399
all surface so let me ask about that

233
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,199
horse

234
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,198
what's up with the horse what what is

235
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,160
consciousness

236
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,919
from where does it emerge how like

237
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,960
fundamental is it to the physics of

238
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,038
reality

239
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,478
how fundamental is it to what it means

240
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,878
to be human

241
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,519
and i'm just asking for a friend so that

242
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
we can

243
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,839
build it in our artificial intelligence

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
systems

245
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,959
yeah well it remains to be seen if we

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,199
can if

247
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,079
we will build it uh purposefully or just

248
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,440
by accident

249
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:36,478
this is a major ethical problem

250
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,839
potentially uh that i mean

251
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,158
my concern here is that we we may in

252
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,240
fact

253
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,918
build artificial intelligence that

254
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,159
passes the turing test

255
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,838
which we begin to treat not only as

256
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,480
super intelligent because it obviously

257
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,760
is and

258
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,120
and demonstrates that but we begin to

259
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,120
treat it as conscious

260
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,759
because it will seem conscious we will

261
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,759
have built it to seem conscious and

262
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,360
unless we understand exactly how

263
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,799
consciousness emerges

264
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,159
from physics we won't actually know

265
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,759
that these systems are conscious right

266
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,958
we'll just you know they may say you

267
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,278
know listen you can't turn me off

268
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,518
because

269
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,720
that's a murder right and we will be

270
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,080
convinced

271
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,519
by that uh dialogue because

272
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,080
we will we will you know just in the

273
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,839
extreme case who knows when

274
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,920
we'll get there but you know if we build

275
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,560
something like

276
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,759
perfectly humanoid robots that are more

277
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:29,439
intelligent than we are so we're

278
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,360
basically in you know a westworld-like

279
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,040
situation

280
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,639
there's no way we're going to withhold

281
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,039
an attribution of consciousness from

282
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:36,879
those

283
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,919
machines so they're just going to seem

284
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,879
they're going to advertise their

285
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,719
consciousness

286
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:46,399
in every glance and every utterance

287
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,839
but we won't know and we won't know in

288
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,919
some deeper sense that it make

289
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,360
then we can be skeptical of the

290
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,559
consciousness of other people i mean

291
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,440
someone could roll that back and say

292
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,639
well you don't you know i don't know

293
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
that you're conscious or you don't know

294
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,838
that i'm conscious we're just passing

295
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:01,120
the turing test for one another but

296
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,839
that kind of solipsism isn't justified

297
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,120
you know biologically or i mean we just

298
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,800
anything we

299
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,480
understand about the mind biologically

300
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,879
suggests that you and i

301
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,240
are part of the same you know role that

302
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,519
role the dice

303
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,278
um in terms of

304
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,759
how intelligent and conscious systems

305
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:22,879
emerged in in the wet wear of

306
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:24,399
of brains like ours right so it it's not

307
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,078
parsimonious for me to think that i

308
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,078
might be the only conscious person or

309
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,919
even the only conscious primate

310
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,679
you know is i i would argue it's not

311
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,879
parsimonious to withhold consciousness

312
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,000
from

313
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,639
other apes uh and even other mammals

314
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,919
ultimately

315
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,919
and you know once you get beyond the

316
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,479
mammals then my intuitions are

317
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,319
not really clear the question of how it

318
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,159
emerges is genuinely

319
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,079
uncertain and ultimately the question of

320
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,799
whether it emerges

321
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,000
is still uncertain you can you know it's

322
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:54,479
not

323
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,639
it's not fashionable to think this but

324
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,639
you can certainly argue that

325
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,799
that consciousness might be a

326
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,799
fundamental principle of matter

327
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,000
that doesn't emerge on the basis of

328
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,000
information processing

329
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,078
even though everything else that we

330
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,440
recognize about ourselves as minds

331
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,759
almost certainly does emerge

332
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,120
like an ability to process language that

333
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,799
clearly is a matter of information

334
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,120
processing because you you can disrupt

335
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:22,559
that process in in ways that

336
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,159
is um it's just so clear

337
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:28,559
and um the problem that the confound

338
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,919
with consciousness is that

339
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,838
yes we can seem to interrupt

340
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,000
consciousness you can give someone

341
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,519
general anesthesia and then you

342
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,360
wake them up and you ask them what was

343
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,560
that like and they say nothing i don't

344
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,560
remember anything

345
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:46,159
but it's hard to

346
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:48,479
differentiate a mere failure of memory

347
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,078
from a genuine interruption in

348
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,600
consciousness whereas it's not with you

349
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,239
know interrupting speech

350
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,600
you know we know when we've done it and

351
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,680
it's

352
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,680
it's just obvious that you know you

353
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,000
disrupt the right neural circuits and

354
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,359
you know you've disrupted speech so if

355
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,839
you have to bet all your money

356
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,919
on one camp or the other would you say

357
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,639
do you earn a side of

358
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,719
pan psychism where consciousness is

359
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,240
really fundamental to our

360
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,519
to all of reality or more on the other

361
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,560
side which is like

362
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,959
it's a nice little side effect a useful

363
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,479
like

364
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:26,239
hack for us humans to survive where

365
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,759
on that spectrum where do you land when

366
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,959
you think about consciousness

367
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,319
especially from an engineering

368
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:35,599
perspective i'm truly agnostic on this

369
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,879
point i mean i think i'm you know it's

370
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,920
kind of in coin toss

371
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:43,519
mode for me i i don't know

372
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:45,838
and pan psychism is not so

373
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,600
compelling to me again it just seems

374
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,560
unfalsifiable i wouldn't know how the

375
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,120
universe would be

376
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,879
different if pan psychism were true just

377
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,839
to remind people pan psychism is this

378
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,958
idea that

379
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,480
consciousness may be pushed all the way

380
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,319
down into the most fundamental

381
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,839
constituents of matter so there might be

382
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
something that's like to be an electron

383
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,720
or

384
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,320
or you know a cork but

385
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,079
then you wouldn't expect anything to be

386
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,760
different at

387
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,638
you know the macro scale or at least i

388
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,278
wouldn't expect anything to be different

389
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,519
so it may be unfalsifiable it just might

390
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:23,200
be that reality is not

391
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:26,560
something we're

392
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:30,320
as in touch with as we think we are and

393
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:32,319
that if at its base layer

394
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,440
to kind of break it into mind and matter

395
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,200
as we've done

396
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,680
ontologically is to misconstrue it right

397
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,120
i mean

398
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,679
there's there could be some kind of

399
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
neutral monism at the bottom and this

400
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,319
you know this

401
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,320
idea doesn't originate with me this is

402
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,440
this goes all the way back to

403
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,800
bertrand russell and and others you know

404
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,880
100 plus years ago

405
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,919
but i just feel like that the concepts

406
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,600
we're using

407
00:13:53,919 --> 00:14:00,719
to divide consciousness and

408
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,519
and matter it may in fact be part of our

409
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,759
problem

410
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,919
right where the rubber hits the road

411
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,639
psychologically here

412
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,120
are things like well what is death right

413
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,159
like

414
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,399
do we any expectation that we survive

415
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:18,399
death or any part of us survives death

416
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,480
that really it seems to be the the um

417
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,240
many people's concern here well i tend

418
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,039
to believe just as a small little

419
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,720
tangent

420
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,319
like i'm with ernest becker on this that

421
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,240
there's some

422
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,240
it's interesting to think about death

423
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,240
and consciousness which one

424
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,919
is the chicken which one is the egg

425
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,560
because it feels like death could be the

426
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,319
very thing

427
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,518
like our knowledge of mortality could be

428
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,600
the very thing that creates the

429
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,720
consciousness

430
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,278
yeah well then you're using

431
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,399
consciousness differently than than i

432
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,039
am so so for me consciousness is just

433
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,000
the fact

434
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,679
that the lights are on at all that

435
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,559
there's an experiential

436
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,599
quality to anything so so much of the

437
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,879
processing

438
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,560
that's happening in our brains right now

439
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,399
seems certainly seems to be happening in

440
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,638
the in the dark right like

441
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,759
it's not associated with this

442
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,440
qualitative

443
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,958
sense that there's something that's like

444
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,440
to be that part of

445
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:16,879
the mind doing that mental thing

446
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,560
but for other parts the lights are on

447
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,399
and and we can talk about

448
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,278
and whether we talk about it or not we

449
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,399
can feel directly

450
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,879
that there's something that is like to

451
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,240
be us

452
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,240
there's something something seems to be

453
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,759
happening right and

454
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,519
this seeming in our case is broken into

455
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,039
vision and hearing and and

456
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,759
proprioception and and

457
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,639
taste and smell and and thought and

458
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,240
emotion and

459
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,680
there's there are the contents of

460
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,360
consciousness

461
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:51,679
uh that we

462
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,839
are familiar with and that we can we can

463
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,359
have direct access to in any present

464
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,560
moment that when we're

465
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,320
quote conscious and

466
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,159
even if we're confused about them even

467
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,600
if you know we're asleep and dreaming

468
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,439
and we're really inward it's not a lucid

469
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,159
dream we're just totally confused about

470
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,079
our

471
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,600
circumstance what you can't say

472
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,599
is that we're confused about

473
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,959
consciousness like you can't say that

474
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,519
consciousness itself might be an

475
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,799
illusion

476
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,759
because on this account

477
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,000
it just means that things seem anyway at

478
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,600
all

479
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,278
i mean even like if this you know it

480
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,199
seems to me that i'm seeing a cup

481
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,799
on the table now i could be wrong about

482
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,078
that it could be a hologram i could be

483
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,439
asleep and dreaming i could be

484
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,559
hallucinating

485
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,240
but the seaming part isn't really up for

486
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,278
grabs in terms of

487
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,839
being an illusion it's it's not

488
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,519
uh something seems to be happening and

489
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,160
that seeming

490
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,000
is the is the context in which every

491
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,240
other thing

492
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,120
we can notice about ourselves can be

493
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
noticed and then

494
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,240
it's it's also the context in which

495
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,838
certain illusions can be

496
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,839
cut through because we're not we can be

497
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,199
wrong about what it's like to be us and

498
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,839
we can

499
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,758
uh i'm not saying we're incorrigible

500
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,120
with respect to

501
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,880
our claims about the nature of our

502
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,798
experience but

503
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
for instance this you know many people

504
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:11,759
feel like they have a self and they feel

505
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,000
like it has free will

506
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,279
and you know i'm quite sure at this

507
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
point that they're wrong about that and

508
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,759
that you can

509
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,759
you can cut through those experiences

510
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,959
and then things seem a different way

511
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,119
right so it's not that

512
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,880
it's not that things don't there aren't

513
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:31,279
discoveries to be made there and

514
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,280
assumptions to be overturned but um

515
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,519
this kind of consciousness is something

516
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,558
that i would think

517
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,519
it doesn't just come online when we get

518
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,038
language

519
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,038
it doesn't just come online when we form

520
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,919
a concept of death or

521
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,839
the the finiteness of life it doesn't it

522
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,320
doesn't require a sense of self

523
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:53,119
right so it doesn't it it's it's prior

524
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,519
to a differentiating self and other

525
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,798
uh and i wouldn't even think it's

526
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:59,519
necessarily

527
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,000
uh limited to people i mean i do think

528
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,000
probably

529
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,519
any uh mammal has this

530
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,359
but certainly if you're going to if

531
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,480
you're going to presuppose

532
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,599
that something about our brains is

533
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,720
producing this

534
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:18,159
right and that's a very safe

535
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,400
assumption even though it we can't

536
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,240
even you can argue the jury is still out

537
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,320
to some degree

538
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,519
then it's very hard to draw a principled

539
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,159
line between us and

540
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,879
chimps you know or chimps and and you

541
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,279
know rats

542
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,160
even in the end given the underlying

543
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,960
neural

544
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,080
uh similarities so um and i i don't know

545
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
you know phylogenetically i don't know

546
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,639
how far

547
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,240
back to push that you know it's there

548
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,840
people you think

549
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,359
single cells might be conscious or that

550
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,480
you know flies are certainly conscious

551
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,959
they've got

552
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,558
something like uh a hundred thousand

553
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,798
neurons in their brains and it says

554
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,918
it's just that's a there's a lot going

555
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,960
on even in a fly

556
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,080
right uh but i i don't have intuitions

557
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,919
about that but it's not

558
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,000
in your sense an illusion you can cut

559
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,480
through i mean to push back

560
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,359
the alternative version could be it is

561
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,519
an illusion constructed by

562
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,639
just by humans i'm not sure i believe

563
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,319
this but it

564
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,480
in part of me hopes this is true because

565
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,359
it makes it easier to engineer

566
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,360
is that humans are able to contemplate

567
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,918
their mortality

568
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,439
and that contemplation in itself creates

569
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,520
consciousness

570
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,120
that like the the rich lights on

571
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,240
experience so the lights don't actually

572
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,879
even turn on

573
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,960
in the way that you're describing until

574
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,640
after birth

575
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,640
in that construction so it's do you

576
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,160
think it's possible that that is the

577
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,200
case that it is a

578
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,240
sort of construct of the way we deal

579
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,440
almost like a social tool to deal with

580
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,480
the reality of the world

581
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,080
the social interaction with other humans

582
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,599
or is yeah because you're saying the

583
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,879
complete opposite which is it's like

584
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,240
fundamental to to

585
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,240
signal cell organisms and trees and

586
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,839
and so on right well yes i i don't i

587
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,599
don't know how far down to push it i

588
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,599
don't have intuitions that

589
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,119
single cells are likely to be conscious

590
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,199
but

591
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,038
but they might be and i just again i

592
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,919
could be unfalsifiable

593
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,640
um but as far as babies not being

594
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,600
conscious or

595
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,520
like you're not you don't become

596
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,959
conscious until you can recognize

597
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,879
yourself in a mirror or

598
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,400
you have a conversation or treat other

599
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
people first of all babies treat other

600
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,200
people as

601
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,960
others far earlier than

602
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
we have uh traditionally given them

603
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,159
credit for and they certainly do it

604
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,400
before they they have

605
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,039
language right so it's it's like it's

606
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,519
got to perceive language

607
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,640
to some degree and you can interrogate

608
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,918
this for yourself

609
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,559
because you can put yourself in various

610
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,559
states that are

611
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,879
rather obviously not linguistic you know

612
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,558
meditation allows you to do this you can

613
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,280
certainly do it with psychedelics where

614
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,319
it's just

615
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,759
your capacity for language has been

616
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:00,839
obliterated

617
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:03,200
and yet you're all too conscious in fact

618
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,119
uh yeah

619
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,759
you i think you could make a stronger

620
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,759
argument for

621
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,000
things running the other way that

622
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,639
there's something about

623
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,119
language and and conceptual thought that

624
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,400
is

625
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:21,519
eliminative of conscious experience that

626
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,320
that we're we are potentially much more

627
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,599
conscious

628
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,960
of data sense data and everything else

629
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,399
than we tend to be

630
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,759
and we have trimmed it down based on

631
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,159
how how we have acquired concepts and so

632
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,038
like

633
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,640
when i walk into a room like this i know

634
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,960
i'm walking into a room

635
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,840
i have certain expectations of what is

636
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,079
in a room you know

637
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:46,480
i would be very surprised to see you

638
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,480
know wild animals in here or a waterfall

639
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,759
or you know

640
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,759
there are things i'm not expecting but

641
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,679
i can know i'm not expecting them or i'm

642
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,599
expecting their absence because

643
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,840
of my capacity to be surprised once i

644
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:03,119
walk into a room and i see a you know

645
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,798
a live gorilla or whatever so

646
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,798
there's there's structure there that we

647
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:10,079
have put in place based on all of our

648
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:13,359
conceptual learning and language and

649
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,678
language learning and

650
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,279
it causes us not to one of the things

651
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,720
that happens when you take psychedelics

652
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,000
and you just look as though for the

653
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,319
first time

654
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,200
at anything it becomes

655
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,558
incredibly overloaded with uh it can

656
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,400
become overloaded with meaning

657
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:36,399
and and um uh

658
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,120
just the the torrents of sense data that

659
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,038
are coming in

660
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,879
in even the most ordinary circumstances

661
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,038
can become overwhelming for people and

662
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,480
it that tends to just

663
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,879
obliterate one's capacity to capture any

664
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,120
of it

665
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,559
linguistically and as you're coming down

666
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,119
right have you done psychedelics have

667
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:54,879
you ever done

668
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:58,639
acid or not acid mushroom

669
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,039
and that's it and also edibles but

670
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,799
that's

671
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,798
that there's some psychedelic properties

672
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,119
to them but right but yeah

673
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,798
mushrooms uh several times and always

674
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,879
had an incredible experience

675
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,879
it exactly the kind of experience you're

676
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,159
referring to which is

677
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,440
if it's true that language constrains

678
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,120
our experience it felt like i was

679
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,038
removing some of the constraints

680
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,359
right because even just the most basic

681
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,200
things were beautiful in the way that

682
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,359
i wasn't able to appreciate previously

683
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,840
like trees and nature and so on

684
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,519
yeah and the the experience of coming

685
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:35,599
down

686
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,599
is an exp is an experience of

687
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,839
encountering the futility of of

688
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,038
capturing

689
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:45,119
what you just saw a moment ago in words

690
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,558
right like especially if you have if any

691
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,119
part of your

692
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,440
your self concept and your your ego

693
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,439
program is to be able to capture things

694
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
in words and if you're a writer or a

695
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
poet or

696
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,199
or a scientist or someone who wants to

697
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,319
just

698
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,919
encapsulate the profundity of what just

699
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,200
happened

700
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,720
the the the

701
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,080
total fatuousness of that enterprise

702
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,919
when you really have got when you have

703
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,480
taken a you know a whopping dose of

704
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:19,038
psychedelics and you begin to

705
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,159
even gesture at cat describing it to

706
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:21,839
yourself you know so that you could

707
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,880
describe it to others

708
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,599
uh it's just it's like trying to you

709
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,600
know

710
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,359
thread a needle using your elbows i mean

711
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,678
it's like you're you're trying something

712
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,798
they

713
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:38,159
can't it's like the beer gesture proves

714
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:38,158
its impossibility uh and it's um

715
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,599
so yeah so that i mean that for me that

716
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,278
that suggests just

717
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,278
empirically on the first person side

718
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:48,319
that it's possible to put yourself in

719
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:51,359
a condition where it's clearly not about

720
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:53,678
language uh structuring your

721
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,278
experience and you're having much more

722
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,559
experience than you

723
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,599
you tend to so the primacy of language

724
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,639
is primary for

725
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,639
some things but

726
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,159
it's certainly primary for certain kinds

727
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:11,119
of concepts and certain kinds of

728
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,000
semantic understandings of of the world

729
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,199
but

730
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,919
it's uh it's clearly more to mind than

731
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,759
you know the conversation we're having

732
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,038
with ourselves or that we can have with

733
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,879
others can we go to that world of

734
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:29,119
psychedelics for

735
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,278
for a bit sure where do you think um

736
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,479
so joe rogan apparently and many others

737
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:37,519
uh meet

738
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,519
apparently elves when they on dmt

739
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,519
a lot of people report this kind of

740
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,120
creatures that they see

741
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,960
and again it's probably the failure of

742
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,798
language to describe that experience but

743
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,360
dmt is an interesting one

744
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,278
there's uh as as you're aware there's a

745
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,798
bunch of studies going on in psychedelic

746
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:58,000
psychedelics currently mdma um

747
00:25:54,798 --> 00:26:02,000
uh south side and uh

748
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,519
john hopkins and a bunch of other places

749
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,640
but dmt they all speak of as like

750
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,319
some extra super level

751
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,919
of a psychedelic yeah do you have a

752
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:18,319
sense of where it is our mind goes

753
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,799
on um on psychedelics but in

754
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,678
in dmt especially well unfortunately i

755
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:23,839
haven't taken

756
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,720
dmt so unfortunately or fortunately

757
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,359
unfortunately

758
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,120
unfortunately uh although it's i presume

759
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:32,240
it's in my body as it is in

760
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,199
uh everyone's brain and in many many

761
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,038
plants

762
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,480
apparently but i've wanted to take it i

763
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:39,839
haven't been i had an opportunity that

764
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,798
was presented itself that where it was

765
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,278
obviously

766
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,558
the right thing for me to be doing uh

767
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,319
but

768
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,798
you know for those who don't know dmt is

769
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:51,278
is often touted as the most intense

770
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,639
psychedelic and also the shortest acting

771
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,798
i mean you smoke it and it's

772
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,759
it's basically a 10 minute experience or

773
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:57,759
a

774
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,679
or a three minute experience within like

775
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,240
a 10 minute window

776
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,960
uh that you when you're really down

777
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,558
after

778
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,798
10 minutes or so um

779
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,839
and terence mckenna was a big proponent

780
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:11,359
of dmt that was

781
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,959
that was his you know the center of the

782
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,079
bullseye for him psychedelically

783
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,360
apparently

784
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:20,000
um and it does it is characterized it

785
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,759
seems for many people

786
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,919
by this phenomenon which is which is

787
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,558
unlike virtually any other psychedelic

788
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,278
experience

789
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,398
which is your your it's not just your

790
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:33,359
perception

791
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:35,918
being broadened or changed it's you

792
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,398
according to terence mckenna feeling

793
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,520
fairly

794
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:41,519
unchanged but catapulted into a

795
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,599
a different circumstance you may have

796
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,639
been shot elsewhere

797
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,278
and find yourself in relationship to

798
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,520
other

799
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,880
entities of some kind right so so the

800
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,359
place is populated with

801
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,080
with things that seem not to be your

802
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,759
mind

803
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:58,000
so it does feel like travel to another

804
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,000
place because you're unchanged yourself

805
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,119
of course again i just have this on the

806
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,200
authority of the people who have

807
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,038
described their experience

808
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,640
but it sounds like it's a pr it's pretty

809
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,000
common it sounds like it's pretty common

810
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,360
for people not to have the full

811
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,679
experience because it's

812
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,278
apparently pretty unpleasant to smoke so

813
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,200
it's like getting enough on board in

814
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,558
order to get shot

815
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:23,440
out of the the cannon uh and land

816
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:27,200
among the uh what mckenna called

817
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,200
self-transforming machine elves

818
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,519
that appeared to him like jeweled you

819
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,759
know faberge egg like ba

820
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,519
self dribbling basketballs that were

821
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,398
handing him uh

822
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,200
completely uninterpretable reams of

823
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,199
profound knowledge

824
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,599
it's a it's an experience i haven't had

825
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:49,199
so i just have to

826
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:52,398
accept that people have had it

827
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,840
i would just point out that our minds

828
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:57,439
are clearly capable

829
00:28:53,839 --> 00:29:00,639
of producing apparent others

830
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,519
on demand that are totally compelling

831
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,200
to us right there's no there's no limit

832
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,200
to our ability to do that as anyone

833
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,798
who's ever remembered a dream

834
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,038
can attest i mean we every night we go

835
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,398
to sleep some of us don't remember

836
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:15,599
dreams very often but

837
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:20,000
um some dream vividly every night

838
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,119
and just think of how insane that

839
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,599
experience is i mean

840
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,558
you you've forgotten where you were

841
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,158
right that's

842
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,918
the strangest part i mean this is

843
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,919
psychosis right you're you have

844
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,120
you have lost your mind you have lost

845
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,159
your connection

846
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:37,359
to your episodic memory

847
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,880
uh or even your expectations

848
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,240
that reality won't undergo wholesale

849
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,720
changes a moment

850
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,278
after you have closed your eyes right

851
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,159
like you

852
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,519
you're in bed you're you know watching

853
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,480
something on netflix you're waiting to

854
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,240
fall asleep

855
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,480
and then the next thing that happens to

856
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,319
you is impossible

857
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,839
and you're not surprised right you're

858
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,678
talking to dead people you're hanging

859
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,480
out with famous people you're

860
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,679
you're someplace you couldn't physically

861
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,839
be you can fly

862
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,720
and even that's not surprising right so

863
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,158
it's

864
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,640
you've lost your mind but relevantly for

865
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,679
this

866
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,880
or found it you found some i mean lucid

867
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,278
dreaming is very interesting because

868
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,039
then

869
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:18,558
then you can have the best of both

870
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:20,960
circumstances and it's

871
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,720
uh that then it can be kind of

872
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,480
systematically explored

873
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,240
but what i mean by found just to start

874
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,960
to interrupt is like

875
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,798
if we take uh this this brilliant idea

876
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,759
that language constrains us

877
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,599
grounds us language and other things of

878
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:40,319
the waking world ground us

879
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:42,639
maybe it is that you've found the full

880
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:44,639
the full capacity of your cognition when

881
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,480
you dream or when you do psychedelics

882
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,559
you're stepping outside the the little

883
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,360
human cage the cage or the human

884
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,079
condition

885
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,079
to get open the door and step out and

886
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,319
look around and then go back in

887
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,759
well you've you've definitely stepped

888
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,119
out of something and into something else

889
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,919
but you've also lost something

890
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,798
right you've lost certain capacities

891
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,440
well just

892
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,480
yeah in this case you literally didn't

893
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,159
you don't you don't

894
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,640
have enough presence of mind in the

895
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,120
dream in the dreamy city or even in

896
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,640
the psychedelic state if you take enough

897
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,038
uh

898
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,240
did you have there's no psychological

899
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,679
there's very little

900
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:25,200
psychological continuity with your life

901
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:28,559
such that you're not surprised to be

902
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,558
in the presence of someone who should be

903
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,480
you should know is dead or you should

904
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,720
know you're not likely to have met

905
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,480
by normal channels right you're you know

906
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,880
you're now talking to some celebrity

907
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,919
and it turns out you're best friends

908
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,440
right and you're not even

909
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,559
you have no memory of how you got there

910
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
you know like how did you get into the

911
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,278
room you're like how did

912
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,480
did you drive to this restaurant you

913
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,839
know you have no memory and none of

914
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,599
that's surprising to you so you're

915
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,599
you're kind of brain damaged in a way

916
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,000
you're not reality testing

917
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,678
in the normal way the fascinating

918
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,599
possibility is that

919
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,278
there's probably thousands of people

920
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,000
who've taken psychedelics of various

921
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,440
forms and

922
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,880
have met sam harris on that journey

923
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,720
well i would put it more likely in in

924
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,080
dreams not you know because

925
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,000
in psychedelic with psychedelics you

926
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,720
don't tend to hallucinate

927
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,440
in a dreamlike way i mean so dmt is

928
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,240
giving you a

929
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,120
an experience of others but it's it

930
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,480
seems to be

931
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:21,038
non-non-standard it's not like it's not

932
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,240
just like

933
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:27,440
dream hallucinations but but

934
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,480
to the point of coming back to dmt

935
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,159
the people want to suggest and

936
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,839
terence mckenna certainly did suggest

937
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,880
that because

938
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,879
these others are so obviously other

939
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,320
and they're so vivid well then they

940
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,440
could not possibly be the

941
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,960
the creation of my own mind but every

942
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,320
night in dreams

943
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,640
you create a a compelling or what is to

944
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,119
you

945
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,720
at the time a totally compelling

946
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:57,678
simulacrum of

947
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:00,000
another person right and uh that's

948
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,080
uh that just proves the mind that's

949
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,240
capable of doing it now it's it's uh

950
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,398
the the phenomenon of lucid dreaming

951
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,919
shows that the mind isn't capable of

952
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,518
doing everything you think it might be

953
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,640
capable of even in that

954
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:15,200
space so one of the things that

955
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,480
people have discovered in lucid dreams

956
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,960
and i i haven't done

957
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,558
a lot of lucid dreaming so i've i can't

958
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,399
confirm all of this so i can

959
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:27,678
confirm some of it um

960
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:30,398
apparently in every house in in every

961
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,640
room in the the mansion of dreams

962
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,479
all light switches are dimmer switches

963
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,679
like if you go into a dark room

964
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,200
and flip on the light it gradually comes

965
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,320
up it doesn't it doesn't come up

966
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,159
instantly on demand uh because you know

967
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,079
apparently this is covering for the

968
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,159
brain's inability to

969
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:52,158
produce from a you know a standing start

970
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,840
visually rich imagery on demand so

971
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,480
there's i haven't confirmed that but

972
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,240
that was

973
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,519
people have done research on lucid

974
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,200
dreaming

975
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:04,319
claim that it's all dimmer switches uh

976
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,919
but one thing i have noticed and

977
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,480
you know people can check this out is

978
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,440
that in a dream

979
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,079
if you look at text you know a page of

980
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,320
text

981
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,240
you know or a sign you know or a

982
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,919
television that has text on it

983
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,358
and then you turn away and you look back

984
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,679
at that text the text

985
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,799
will have changed right there's no the

986
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,079
total is it's just a

987
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,480
chronic instability graphical

988
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,359
instability

989
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,039
of text uh in the dream state and i

990
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,799
don't know if that you know maybe that's

991
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,320
someone can confirm that that's not true

992
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,519
for them but that's whenever i've

993
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,039
checked that out that has been true for

994
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,679
me it keeps generating it

995
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,559
like uh real time yeah from a video game

996
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,320
perspective

997
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:43,759
yeah it's render it's rendering it's

998
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,519
re-rendering it

999
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,839
for some reason what's interesting i

1000
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,559
actually i don't know how i found myself

1001
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,759
in this sets of uh that part of the

1002
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:53,679
internet

1003
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,879
but there's quite a lot of discussion

1004
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,960
about what it's like to do

1005
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:02,400
math on lsd because apparently

1006
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,720
one of the deepest thinking processes

1007
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,240
needed is those of mathematicians or

1008
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,759
theoretical computer scientists

1009
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,759
basically doing anything that involves

1010
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,280
math is proofs

1011
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,599
and you have to think creatively but

1012
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,400
also deeply and you have to think for

1013
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,240
many hours at a time and so they're

1014
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,559
always looking for ways to

1015
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,959
like is there is there any sparks of

1016
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,519
creativity that could be injected and

1017
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,559
apparently out of all the psychedelics

1018
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:29,199
the the worst

1019
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,000
is lsd because it completely destroys

1020
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,319
your ability to do

1021
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,039
math well and i wonder whether that has

1022
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,480
to do with

1023
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,440
your ability to visualize geometric

1024
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,280
things

1025
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,519
in a stable way in your mind and hold

1026
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,839
them there and stitch things together

1027
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,800
which is often what's required for

1028
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,920
proofs but

1029
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,440
again it's difficult to kind of research

1030
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,960
these kinds of concepts but it does make

1031
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,480
me wonder

1032
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,880
where what are the spaces

1033
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,199
how's the space of things you're able to

1034
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,760
think about and explore

1035
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,799
morphed by different by different

1036
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,599
psychedelics

1037
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,280
or dream states and so on and how's that

1038
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,079
different how much does it overlap with

1039
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,480
reality

1040
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,280
and what is fundament what is reality is

1041
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,838
there a waking state reality

1042
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,200
or is it just a tiny subset of reality

1043
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,920
and we get to take a step in

1044
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:21,199
other versions of it we tend to think

1045
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,400
very much

1046
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:27,118
in a space-time four-dimensional there's

1047
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,519
a three-dimensional world there's time

1048
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,680
and that's what we think about reality

1049
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:34,719
and we think of traveling

1050
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,719
as walking from point a to point b in

1051
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,358
the three-dimensional world

1052
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,000
but that's a very kind of human

1053
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:41,838
surviving

1054
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,280
trying not to get eaten by a lion

1055
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,679
conception of reality

1056
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,240
what if traveling is something like we

1057
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,559
do with psychedelics and meet the elves

1058
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,759
what if it's something what if thinking

1059
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:57,679
or the space of ideas as we kind of grow

1060
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,720
and think through ideas that's traveling

1061
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,159
or what if memories is traveling i don't

1062
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,919
know if you have a

1063
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,000
if you have a favorite view of reality

1064
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,920
or if you're you had by the way

1065
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,400
i should say a excellent conversation

1066
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,720
when uh donald hoffman

1067
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,680
yeah yeah he's interesting is there any

1068
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,879
inkling

1069
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,480
of his sense in your mind that reality

1070
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,200
is uh

1071
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,000
very far from actual like objective

1072
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:24,879
reality is very

1073
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,719
far from the kind of reality we imagine

1074
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,000
we perceive and we

1075
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:34,480
play with in our human minds well

1076
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:38,000
the first thing to grant is that

1077
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,199
there we are never in direct contact

1078
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,960
with reality whatever it is unless that

1079
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:46,559
reality is consciousness right so

1080
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,400
we we're only ever experiencing

1081
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,838
consciousness and its contents

1082
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,880
and then the question is how does that

1083
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,838
circumstance relate to quote reality at

1084
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,960
large

1085
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:01,039
and donald hoffman is somebody who's

1086
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,280
happy to speculate well maybe there

1087
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:03,759
isn't a reality at large maybe it's all

1088
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,480
just

1089
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,240
consciousness on some level and that

1090
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,519
that's interesting

1091
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:15,199
that runs into to my eye

1092
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,519
various philosophical problems

1093
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:20,000
that um or at least you have to do a lot

1094
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:23,280
you have to add to that

1095
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,960
uh picture i mean that you know a

1096
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,119
picture of idealism for i mean that's

1097
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,000
usually all the all the whole family of

1098
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,559
views that would just

1099
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,800
say that the universe is just mind or

1100
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,960
just consciousness at bottom you know

1101
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,839
we'll go by the name of idealism in

1102
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,838
western philosophy

1103
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,118
you have to add to that idealistic

1104
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,599
picture all kinds of epic cycles and

1105
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:50,640
kind of weird coincidences and to get

1106
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,400
the to get the predictability of our

1107
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,118
experience and the success of

1108
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,960
of materialist science to make sense in

1109
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,400
that context right so the fact that we

1110
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,119
can

1111
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,519
what does it mean to say that there's

1112
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,480
only consciousness

1113
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,599
at bottom right nothing outside of

1114
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,240
consciousness because no one's ever

1115
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,760
experienced

1116
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,679
anything outside of consciousness as no

1117
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,800
scientist has ever done an experiment

1118
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,799
where they were contemplating data

1119
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,160
no matter how far removed from our sense

1120
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,359
bases you know whether it's they're

1121
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:22,399
looking at the

1122
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:24,639
hubble deep field or they're they're

1123
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,599
smashing atoms or whatever that whatever

1124
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,239
tools they're using

1125
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,800
they're still just experiencing

1126
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:34,078
consciousness and its

1127
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,280
various deliverances and

1128
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,440
layering their concepts on top of that

1129
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,440
so

1130
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,760
that's always true and yet that somehow

1131
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:51,440
doesn't seem to capture

1132
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,440
the um the character of our

1133
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,200
continually discovering that our

1134
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,679
materialist assumptions

1135
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:01,439
are are confirmable right so you take

1136
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,358
take the fact that we

1137
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,880
we unleash this fantastic amount of

1138
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:07,039
energy from within

1139
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,960
an atom right you know we first we have

1140
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,559
the theoretical

1141
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,318
suggestion that it's possible right we

1142
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,000
need to come back to einstein there's a

1143
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:19,119
lot of energy

1144
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,079
in that matter right and what if we

1145
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,440
could release it

1146
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,720
right and then we perform an experiment

1147
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,119
at in this case

1148
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,559
you know the trinity test site in new

1149
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,960
mexico

1150
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,639
where the people who are most adequate

1151
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,720
to this conversation people like

1152
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:39,118
robert oppenheimer uh

1153
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:40,480
are standing around not all together

1154
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,000
certain it's going to work

1155
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,119
right they're performing an experiment

1156
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,719
they're wondering what's going to happen

1157
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,640
they're wondering if their calculations

1158
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,559
around the yield are off by orders of

1159
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,279
magnitude some of them are still

1160
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,799
wondering whether the entire atmosphere

1161
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,000
of earth is going to

1162
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,400
kind of combust right that the

1163
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,039
the the the nuclear chain reaction is

1164
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,039
not going to stop

1165
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,599
and lo and behold

1166
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,599
there was that energy to be released

1167
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:15,920
from within the nucleus of an atom and

1168
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:19,280
that could so it's it's just

1169
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,800
what what the picture one forms from

1170
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,319
those kinds of experiments and just the

1171
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,079
knowledge it's just our understanding of

1172
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,920
evolution just the fact that

1173
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,119
the the earth is billions of years old

1174
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,280
and life is hundreds of millions of

1175
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,760
years old and we weren't here

1176
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,119
to think about any of those things um

1177
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,200
and all of those processes were

1178
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,800
happening therefore in the dark

1179
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,719
and they are the processes that allowed

1180
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,560
us to to emerge

1181
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:41,759
you know from prior life forms in the

1182
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,480
first place

1183
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,040
to say that it's all a mass that nothing

1184
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,920
exists

1185
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,880
outside of consciousness conscious minds

1186
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,358
of the sort that we

1187
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,960
experience it just seems um

1188
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:57,679
it seems like a bizarrely

1189
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,800
anthropocentric

1190
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,960
claim uh

1191
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,240
you know analogous to you know the moon

1192
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,599
isn't there if you're not if no one's

1193
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,679
looking at it right

1194
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,359
the moon as a moon isn't there if no

1195
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,919
one's looking at it i'll grant that

1196
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,598
because

1197
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,920
that's already a kind of fabrication

1198
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,960
born of concepts but the idea that

1199
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,440
there's nothing there

1200
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,679
that there's no nothing that corresponds

1201
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,000
to what we experience as the moon

1202
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,318
unless someone's looking at it that just

1203
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,679
seems

1204
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:30,079
just a way too parochial way to set out

1205
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:32,000
on this

1206
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,440
journey of discovery there is something

1207
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
there there's a computer waiting to

1208
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,079
render the moon when you look at it

1209
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,039
the capacity for the moon to exist is

1210
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,200
there so

1211
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:42,400
if if we're indeed living in a

1212
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,000
simulation

1213
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,400
which i find a compelling thought

1214
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,679
experiment uh is it's possible that

1215
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,559
there is a kind of

1216
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,318
rendering mechanism but not in a silly

1217
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:53,838
way that we think about in video games

1218
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:55,519
but in some kind of more fundamental

1219
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:57,838
physics way

1220
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:00,079
and we have to account for the fact that

1221
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:04,000
it renders

1222
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,680
experiences that no one has had yet

1223
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,039
that no one has any expectation of

1224
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,639
having

1225
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,800
it can violate the expectations of

1226
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,639
everyone lawfully right and then

1227
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,160
some lawful understanding of how why

1228
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:17,519
that's so

1229
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,879
it's like um i'm just to bring it back

1230
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,480
to mathematics something like certain

1231
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,400
numbers are prime

1232
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,519
whether we have discovered them or not

1233
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,800
right like there's there's there's the

1234
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,838
highest prime number

1235
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,359
that anyone can name now and then

1236
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,159
there's the next prime number that no

1237
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:32,480
one can name

1238
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,559
and it's there right so it's like it's

1239
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,800
it's to say that

1240
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,078
our minds are putting it there that what

1241
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,839
we know as mind

1242
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,839
in ourselves is in some way in some

1243
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:44,078
sense putting it there

1244
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:46,000
that like that that the base layer of

1245
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,160
reality is consciousness

1246
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,639
right you know that we're we're

1247
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:55,679
identical to the thing that is rendering

1248
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:57,759
this this reality there's some

1249
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,598
you know hubris is the wrong word but

1250
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,000
it's like there's some it's like

1251
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,880
it's okay if reality is bigger than what

1252
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,719
we experience

1253
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:10,559
you know and and it has structure that

1254
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:13,919
we can't anticipate and that isn't just

1255
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:15,358
um i mean

1256
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,200
again there's a co there's there's

1257
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:17,838
certainly a collaboration between our

1258
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,318
minds

1259
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:21,599
and whatever is out there to produce

1260
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:24,719
what we call

1261
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:28,480
you know the stuff you know of life but

1262
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:31,598
um it's not the idea that

1263
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,440
it's uh i don't know i mean

1264
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,640
there are there are a few stops on the

1265
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,760
train of idealism

1266
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:40,480
and kind of new age thinking and and

1267
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,079
eastern philosophy that i don't

1268
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,519
philosophically i don't see a need to

1269
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,240
take i mean the place

1270
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:47,199
experientially and scientifically i feel

1271
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,639
like it's it's

1272
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:54,239
it you can get everything you want

1273
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:58,078
acknowledging that consciousness has a

1274
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:59,759
as a character that can be explored from

1275
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,960
its own side so that you're bringing

1276
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,800
kind of the first person

1277
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,480
experience back into the into the

1278
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,920
conversation about you know what is a

1279
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,240
human mind and you know what is true uh

1280
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,920
and you can explore it with with

1281
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:13,439
different degrees of rigor

1282
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,559
and there are things to be discovered

1283
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,760
there whether you're using a technique

1284
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,039
like meditation or

1285
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,640
psychedelics and that these experiences

1286
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,039
have to be put in conversation

1287
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:24,559
with what we understand about ourselves

1288
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,358
from a third person side

1289
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,960
neuroscientifically or in any other way

1290
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,440
but to me the question is

1291
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,039
what if reality the sense i have from

1292
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,240
this kind of

1293
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,679
you put you play shooters no there's a

1294
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,919
physics engine that generate that's

1295
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,039
probably

1296
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,680
just first person shooter games yes yes

1297
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:45,279
sorry uh not often but yes i mean

1298
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:46,318
there's a physics engine that generates

1299
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,680
consistent reality

1300
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,759
right my sense is the same could be true

1301
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,519
for a universe

1302
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,280
in the following sense that our

1303
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,599
conception of reality as we understand

1304
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,680
it and now in the 21st century

1305
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,880
is a tiny subset of the full reality

1306
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,039
it's not that the reality

1307
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,039
that we conceive of that's there the

1308
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:07,519
moon being there is uh

1309
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,400
not there somehow it's that it's a tiny

1310
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:11,119
fraction of what's

1311
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,160
actually out there and so the uh the

1312
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,838
physics engine

1313
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:15,358
of the universe is just maintaining the

1314
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:19,358
useful

1315
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:21,199
physics the useful reality quote-unquote

1316
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:22,799
uh for us to have a consistent

1317
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:26,159
experience as human beings

1318
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:31,359
but maybe we descendants of apes are

1319
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:33,838
really only understand like 0.0001

1320
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,119
of actual physics of reality like this

1321
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,559
we can even just start with the

1322
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,000
consciousness thing

1323
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,318
but maybe our minds are just we're just

1324
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,719
too

1325
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:46,880
dumb by design yeah i i i

1326
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,399
that truly resonates with me and i'm

1327
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,960
surprised it doesn't resonate more with

1328
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,680
most

1329
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,720
scientists that i talked to but when you

1330
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:56,318
just look at

1331
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:57,838
you look at how close we are to

1332
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,159
chimps right and chimps don't know

1333
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:01,358
anything right clearly they have no idea

1334
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,920
what's going on right

1335
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:06,239
and then you get us but then you it's

1336
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,119
only a subset of human beings

1337
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,559
that really understand much of what

1338
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,800
we're talking about on any you know

1339
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,239
in any area of specialization and if

1340
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,599
they all died in their sleep

1341
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:20,639
tonight right you'd be left with people

1342
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:23,760
who might take a thousand years

1343
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:24,480
to rebuild the internet you know or if

1344
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,160
ever

1345
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,079
i mean literally it's like like you know

1346
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,000
and you know i i would i would

1347
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,880
extend this to myself i mean there there

1348
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,318
are areas of scientific specialization

1349
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:39,039
where i have either no

1350
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,639
discernible competence i mean i've spent

1351
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,639
no time on it i have not

1352
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,159
acquired the tools it would just be an

1353
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:45,759
article of faith for me to think that i

1354
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:47,440
could acquire the tools to actually make

1355
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,160
a breakthrough in those areas

1356
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,720
um and i mean you know your own area is

1357
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,719
one i mean

1358
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:54,639
like you know i i've never spent any

1359
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:54,959
significant amount of time trying to be

1360
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,000
a

1361
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,079
a programmer but

1362
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,920
it's pretty obvious i'm not alan turin

1363
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,680
right it's like like if if that were if

1364
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,280
that were my capacity

1365
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,639
i would have discovered that in in

1366
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,240
myself i would i would have found

1367
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:11,838
programming irresistible

1368
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:14,959
my few fault my first fall starts in

1369
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:17,358
in learning i think it was c um

1370
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,280
it was just you know i bounced off like

1371
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,039
this was not fun i hate

1372
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,720
trying to figure out what what you know

1373
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,239
the syntax error that's causing this

1374
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,759
thing not to compile

1375
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,199
was just a [ __ ] awful experience i

1376
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,000
hated it right i hated every minute a

1377
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:31,358
minute of it

1378
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,400
so it was not um

1379
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:37,039
so if it was just people like me left

1380
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,000
like when do we get the internet again

1381
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,480
right and we lose

1382
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
we lose you know we lose the internet

1383
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,760
when do we get it again right when do we

1384
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,760
get a

1385
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,880
anything like a proper science of

1386
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,359
information

1387
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,880
right you need a claude shannon or an

1388
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:53,119
alan turing

1389
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,559
just to plant a flag in the ground right

1390
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,200
here and say all right can everyone see

1391
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,839
this

1392
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,598
even you don't quite know what i'm up to

1393
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:03,199
you all have to come

1394
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:06,240
over here to to make some progress

1395
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:08,399
and you know there are you know hundreds

1396
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:11,759
of topics where that's the case

1397
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:15,440
so we're bare we barely have a purchase

1398
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,880
on making anything like discernible

1399
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:22,079
intellectual progress in any generation

1400
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,559
and yeah i'm

1401
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,839
just a max tegmark makes this point he's

1402
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,680
one of the few

1403
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:33,119
people who does in physics

1404
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:36,239
if you if you just to take the

1405
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,960
the truth of evolution seriously right

1406
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,679
and and

1407
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,800
realize that there's nothing about us

1408
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:42,799
that has evolved

1409
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,000
to understand reality perfectly i mean

1410
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,960
we just we're just not that

1411
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,480
kind of ape right there's been no

1412
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,800
evolutionary pressure along those lines

1413
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,838
so what we are making do

1414
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:57,680
with tools that were designed for

1415
00:49:53,838 --> 00:50:00,000
fights with sticks and rocks right

1416
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:01,279
and it's amazing we can do as much as we

1417
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,318
can i mean we just you know that you and

1418
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,640
i are just sitting here on

1419
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:05,679
on the back of having received an mrna

1420
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,000
vaccine

1421
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:10,159
you know that uh certainly changed our

1422
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,079
life given what the last year was like

1423
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,039
like and it's going to change the world

1424
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:18,480
if rumors of coming miracles are

1425
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:21,039
are borne out i mean if it's now um

1426
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,760
seems likely we have a a vaccine coming

1427
00:50:21,039 --> 00:50:26,318
for malaria right which has been killing

1428
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,319
millions of people a year for as long as

1429
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:30,159
we've been alive

1430
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,159
i think it's down to like 800 000 people

1431
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,239
a year now because

1432
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,679
we've spread so many bed nets around but

1433
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,558
it was like two and a half million

1434
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:40,960
people

1435
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:44,559
every year it's amazing what we can do

1436
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,838
but yeah i have if in fact the you know

1437
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,240
the answer the book of nature

1438
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,279
the back of the book of nature is you

1439
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,519
understand

1440
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,119
0.1 percent of what there is to

1441
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,440
understand and half of what you think

1442
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,640
you understand is wrong that would not

1443
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,599
surprise me

1444
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,960
at all it is funny to look at our

1445
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,200
evolutionary history

1446
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,240
even back to chimps i'm pretty sure even

1447
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:06,838
chimps thought they end

1448
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,078
under stood the world well so at every

1449
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:10,318
point

1450
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,720
in that timeline of evolutionary

1451
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:15,599
development throughout human history

1452
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:16,959
there's a sense like there's no more you

1453
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,200
hear this message over and over

1454
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,119
there's no more things to be invented

1455
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,759
but a hundred years ago there were

1456
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,400
there's a famous story i forget which

1457
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,119
physicist

1458
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,960
told it but there was there were

1459
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,519
physicists telling

1460
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,639
their their undergraduate students not

1461
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:34,159
to go into

1462
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:35,920
to get graduate degrees in physics

1463
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:37,358
because basically all the problems had

1464
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,800
been solved and this is like around

1465
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:42,239
you know 1915 or so turns out you were

1466
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,960
right i'm going to ask you about free

1467
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,000
will oh

1468
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,280
okay uh you've recently released an

1469
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,199
episode of your podcast making sense

1470
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,119
for those with a shorter attention span

1471
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:53,838
uh basically summarizing your position

1472
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,160
on free will

1473
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:57,199
i think it was under an hour and a half

1474
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:01,279
yeah yeah

1475
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:03,838
that is as brief and clear

1476
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,280
uh so allow me to summarize the summary

1477
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,318
tlgr

1478
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:11,680
and maybe you tell me where i'm wrong

1479
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:13,199
so free will is an illusion and

1480
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:14,879
even the experience of free will is an

1481
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,919
illusion like we don't even

1482
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:21,519
experience it what

1483
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:25,119
am i am i good in my summary yeah

1484
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:26,239
this is a this is a line that's a little

1485
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,039
hard to

1486
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,879
scan for people i i say that it's not

1487
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:33,920
merely that free will

1488
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,760
is an illusion the illusion of free will

1489
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,358
is an illusion right like there is no

1490
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,520
illusion of free will

1491
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:40,880
and that is a unlike many other

1492
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:44,239
illusions

1493
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:47,440
uh that's a

1494
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,879
a more fundamental claim it's like

1495
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,559
it's not that it's wrong it's it's not

1496
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,800
even wrong i mean that's i guess

1497
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,960
that was uh i think wolfgang paulie who

1498
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,839
derided one of his uh

1499
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:01,679
colleagues or enemies with that uh

1500
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:05,279
um aspersion about his theory

1501
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,279
in quantum mechanics um

1502
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,919
it's so there are things that you there

1503
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:10,639
there are genuine illusions there are

1504
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,680
things that

1505
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:15,199
you do experience and then you can

1506
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:17,279
kind of punch through that experience or

1507
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:18,960
you can't you can't actually experience

1508
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,839
you can't you can't experience them any

1509
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,599
other way it's just um

1510
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:24,880
it's we just know it's not a vertical

1511
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,318
experience just take like a visual

1512
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,800
illusion there are visual illusions that

1513
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:28,239
you know

1514
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,839
a lot of these come to me on twitter

1515
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:31,519
these days there's these amazing

1516
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:33,279
visual illusions where like you know

1517
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:36,480
that every figure

1518
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,920
in this gif seems to be moving but

1519
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,119
nothing in fact is moving you can just

1520
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,838
like put a ruler on your screen and

1521
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,760
nothing's moving

1522
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:44,960
um some of those illusions you can't see

1523
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,680
any other way i mean they're just

1524
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,760
they're

1525
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,719
hacking aspects of the visual system

1526
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,599
that are just

1527
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,118
eminently hackable and you you know you

1528
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,960
you have to use a ruler

1529
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,318
to to convince yourself that the thing

1530
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,760
isn't actually moving

1531
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:01,039
now there are other visual illusions

1532
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,720
where you're taken in by it at first

1533
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:05,119
but if you pay more attention you can

1534
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:07,838
actually see that it's not there right

1535
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,440
or it's not how it first seemed like the

1536
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:10,960
uh like the necker cube is a good

1537
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,679
example of that like the necker cube is

1538
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,920
just that

1539
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:15,759
schematic of a cube of a transparent

1540
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,440
cube which pops out one way or the other

1541
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,720
the one one face can pop out and the

1542
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,880
other face can pop out

1543
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,000
but you can actually just see it as flat

1544
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,680
with no pop out

1545
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,920
which is a more vertical way of looking

1546
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:30,399
at it

1547
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,039
so there are subject there are kind of

1548
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,160
inward

1549
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,739
correlates to this and i would say that

1550
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:37,519
the um

1551
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:39,279
[Music]

1552
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:40,960
the sense of self a sense of self and

1553
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,839
free will are closely related i often

1554
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,079
describe them as

1555
00:54:41,838 --> 00:54:45,599
as two sides of the same coin but

1556
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:49,440
they're not quite the same

1557
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:52,000
in the their their spuriousness i mean

1558
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,639
so the sense of self is something that

1559
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,798
people i think do experience right it's

1560
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:59,039
not a very clear experience

1561
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,719
but it's not i wouldn't call the

1562
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,719
illusion of self and illusion

1563
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:03,759
but the illusion of free will is an

1564
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:05,519
illusion in that

1565
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,200
as you pay more attention to your

1566
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:09,199
experience

1567
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,399
you begin to see that it's totally

1568
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:12,318
compatible

1569
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,680
with an absence of free will you don't i

1570
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:17,119
mean coming back to the place we started

1571
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,960
you don't know what you're going to

1572
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,760
think next you don't know what you're

1573
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,559
going to intend

1574
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,280
next you don't know what's going to just

1575
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,040
occur to you

1576
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,160
that you must do next you don't know you

1577
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:30,318
don't know how much you're going to feel

1578
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:31,519
the behavioral imperative to act on that

1579
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,400
thought

1580
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:36,639
if you suddenly feel oh i don't need to

1581
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,079
do that that's i can do that tomorrow

1582
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:39,598
you don't know where that comes from you

1583
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,480
didn't know that was going to arise you

1584
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,599
didn't know that was going to be

1585
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,599
compelling

1586
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,240
all of this is compatible with some evil

1587
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:48,400
genius in the next room just typing in

1588
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:50,078
code into your experience just like this

1589
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,039
okay let's give him the

1590
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,559
uh oh my god i just forgot it was going

1591
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,279
to be our anniversary in one week

1592
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,240
thought right give him the cascade of

1593
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,559
fear

1594
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,838
uh give him give him this brilliant idea

1595
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,440
for the thing he can buy that's going to

1596
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:05,279
take him no time at all in this this you

1597
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,760
know overpowering sense of relief

1598
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,960
all of our experiences is compatible

1599
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,359
with with the

1600
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,639
the script already being written right

1601
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:14,000
it's and i'm not saying the script is

1602
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:17,358
written i'm not saying that

1603
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,239
fatalism is you know is the right way to

1604
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:21,679
look at this

1605
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:23,919
but we just don't have even our most

1606
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:26,558
deliberate voluntary action where we go

1607
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,480
back and forth between two options

1608
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,960
you know thinking about the reason for a

1609
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,679
and then then reconsidering and going

1610
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,358
to thinking harder about b and just

1611
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:38,399
going eeny meeny miny moe

1612
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:40,318
until the end of the hour however

1613
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,639
laborious you can make it

1614
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:47,759
there is a utter mystery at your back

1615
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,879
finally promoting the thought or

1616
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,079
intention

1617
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,559
or ration rationale

1618
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,039
that is most compelling and therefore

1619
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,040
deliberate

1620
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:04,400
behaviorally um

1621
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,399
effective uh and

1622
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,920
just this and this can drive

1623
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,599
some people a little crazy so i i

1624
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,920
usually preface

1625
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,838
what i say about free will with the

1626
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,838
caveat that if thinking about

1627
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:18,960
your mind this way makes you feel

1628
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,599
terrible well then

1629
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,119
stop you know get you get off the ride

1630
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,480
switch the channel you don't have to go

1631
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,440
down this path

1632
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,519
but for me and for for many other people

1633
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,079
it's incredibly freeing

1634
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:34,239
just to recognize this about the mind

1635
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:37,119
because

1636
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:38,078
one it re one you realize that you're i

1637
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,358
mean

1638
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,280
cutting through the illusion of the of

1639
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:42,400
the self is immensely freeing for a lot

1640
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,040
of reasons that

1641
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:48,400
that we can talk about separately but

1642
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:48,400
losing the sense of free will

1643
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,519
does two things very vividly for me one

1644
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,680
is it totally undercuts

1645
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,559
the basis for psychological basis for

1646
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:58,000
hatred

1647
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:01,200
because when you when you think about

1648
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,318
the experience of hating other people

1649
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:05,279
what that is anchored to is a feeling

1650
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,558
that they really

1651
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,720
are the true authors of their actions i

1652
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,359
mean that someone is doing something

1653
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:14,959
that you find so despicable right let's

1654
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:17,519
say they're you know targeting you

1655
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,639
unfairly right they're maligning you on

1656
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,719
twitter or they're

1657
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,239
you know they're they're suing you or

1658
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,558
they're doing something they broke your

1659
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:25,919
car window they did something awful

1660
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,400
and now you have a grievance against

1661
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,559
them and you're relating to them

1662
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,599
very differently emotionally in your own

1663
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,440
mind

1664
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,359
than you would if a force of nature had

1665
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,119
done this right or if it's if it just

1666
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:38,880
been you know a virus or if it had been

1667
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,559
a wild animal

1668
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,160
uh or a malfunctioning machine right

1669
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:44,079
like to those things you don't attribute

1670
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:46,159
any kind of freedom of will

1671
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,599
and while you you may suffer the

1672
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:49,199
consequences of

1673
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,359
catching a virus or being attacked by a

1674
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:51,679
wild animal or having a you know your

1675
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:54,318
car

1676
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:55,919
break down or whatever it may frustrate

1677
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:59,679
you

1678
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:03,920
you don't slip into this mode of hating

1679
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:05,118
the agent in a way that completely

1680
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,838
commandeers your

1681
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,119
your mind and deranges your life i mean

1682
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:10,880
you just don't i mean there are people

1683
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:14,160
who spend

1684
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:17,680
decades hating other people for

1685
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,399
what they did and it's it's just pure

1686
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,239
poison

1687
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,480
so it's a useful shortcut to compassion

1688
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:23,439
and empathy yeah yeah but the question

1689
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,920
is

1690
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,240
say that this call what was it the horse

1691
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,559
of consciousness let's call it the uh

1692
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,479
the consciousness generator black box

1693
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,920
that we don't understand

1694
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:39,199
and is it possible that the script

1695
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,200
that we're walking along

1696
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:43,838
that we're playing that's already

1697
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:45,759
written is actually being written

1698
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:47,599
in real time it's almost like you're

1699
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,680
driving down a road

1700
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:52,000
and in real time that road is being laid

1701
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,919
down yeah and this black box of

1702
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,920
consciousness that we don't understand

1703
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,960
is the place where the script is being

1704
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,599
generated

1705
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,039
so it's not it is being generated it

1706
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,640
didn't always exist

1707
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:04,159
so there's something we don't understand

1708
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:05,358
that's fundamental about the nature of

1709
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,679
reality

1710
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:08,558
that generates both consciousness let's

1711
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:10,399
call it maybe

1712
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,839
the self i don't know if you want to

1713
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,119
distinguish between those yeah i

1714
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:15,119
definitely would yeah

1715
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,640
you would because there's a bunch of

1716
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,240
illusions we're referring to there's the

1717
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:20,558
illusion of free will

1718
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:22,399
there's the illusion of self and there's

1719
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,880
the illusion of consciousness

1720
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,760
you're saying i think you said there's

1721
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,280
no

1722
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,440
you're not as willing to say there's an

1723
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,798
illusion of consciousness

1724
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,480
in fact i would say it's impossible

1725
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:34,400
impossible you're a little bit more

1726
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,440
willing to say that there's an illusion

1727
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,200
of self

1728
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,559
and you're definitely saying there's an

1729
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,558
illusion of free will

1730
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,240
yes yes and i'm definitely saying

1731
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,000
there's an illusion that

1732
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:46,239
a certain kind of self is an illusion

1733
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,838
not every we mean many different things

1734
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:49,199
by this notion of self

1735
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:51,119
so maybe i should just differentiate

1736
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:52,960
these things so

1737
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,400
consciousness can't be an illusion

1738
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:58,318
because

1739
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,680
any illusion proves its reality as much

1740
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:00,798
as any other vertical

1741
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:03,598
perception i mean if you're

1742
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:06,559
hallucinating now that's just as much of

1743
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,838
a demonstration of consciousness as

1744
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,400
really seeing what's

1745
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:12,558
quote actually there if you're if you're

1746
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,119
dreaming and you don't know it

1747
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,480
you that is consciousness right if

1748
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,680
you're you can be confused about

1749
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:22,079
literally everything

1750
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:25,279
you can't be confused about the

1751
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,440
the underlying claim you know whether

1752
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:32,079
you make it linguistically or not

1753
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:35,679
but just the the the the cognitive

1754
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:37,920
uh assertion that something

1755
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:39,279
seems to be happening it's the seeming

1756
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,318
that is is the cash value of

1757
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,640
consciousness

1758
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,000
can i take a tiny tangent okay so what

1759
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:47,598
if

1760
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,400
i am creating consciousness in my mind

1761
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:51,039
to convince you that i'm human so it's a

1762
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,280
useful

1763
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:58,400
social tool not a fundamental

1764
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:01,039
property of experience like

1765
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,639
of being a living thing what if it's

1766
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:06,400
just like a social tool

1767
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:07,519
to to almost like a useful computational

1768
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,880
trick

1769
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:14,079
to place myself into reality as we

1770
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,160
together communicate about this reality

1771
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,480
and another way to ask that because you

1772
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:20,558
said much earlier

1773
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,000
you talked negatively about robots as

1774
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,160
you often do so let me

1775
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,159
because um you'll probably die first

1776
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:28,000
when they take over yeah yeah um

1777
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,000
no no i'm looking forward to certain

1778
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,358
kind of robots i mean i'm not

1779
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,119
if we can get this right this would be

1780
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:35,279
amazing but you don't like the robots

1781
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,798
that fake consciousness that's what you

1782
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,798
you you don't like the idea of fake it

1783
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:41,199
till you make it well no i

1784
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:42,318
it's not that i don't like it it's that

1785
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:44,239
i'm worried

1786
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:45,759
that we will lose sight of the problem

1787
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:49,199
and the problem has massive

1788
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,920
ethical consequences if we if we create

1789
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,919
robots that really can suffer

1790
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,400
that would be a bad thing right and if

1791
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,960
if we really are committing a murder

1792
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,838
when we recycle them that would be a bad

1793
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,519
thing that's how i know you're not

1794
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:03,199
russian why is it a bad thing that would

1795
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:05,440
create robots that can suffer

1796
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:07,199
isn't suffering a fundamental thing from

1797
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,960
which like beauty springs

1798
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,318
like without suffering do you really

1799
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,599
think we would have beautiful things in

1800
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:13,679
this world

1801
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:15,519
okay well that's a that's a tangent on a

1802
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:16,798
tangent okay we'll go there i would love

1803
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:17,440
to go there but let's not go there just

1804
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:18,880
yet all right

1805
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,039
but you know i do think it would be if

1806
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,240
anything is bad creating

1807
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:26,079
hell and populating it with

1808
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:27,519
real minds that really can suffer in

1809
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,599
that hell that's

1810
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:30,960
you know that's bad you know that's the

1811
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:33,280
the you are

1812
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,559
you are worse than than any mass

1813
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,559
murderer we can name

1814
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,000
if you created i mean this could be in

1815
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,039
robot former you know more likely it

1816
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,358
would be in

1817
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,880
in some similar simulation of a world

1818
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:44,318
where we managed to populate it with

1819
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,160
conscious minds so that we know whether

1820
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:48,318
we knew they were conscious or not

1821
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:49,920
and that world is is a state of you know

1822
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:52,159
that's it's unendurable

1823
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,000
um that would just it just taking the

1824
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:57,199
thesis seriously that

1825
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,960
there's nothing that mind

1826
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:00,639
intelligence and consciousness

1827
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,760
ultimately are substrate independent

1828
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:03,440
right it doesn't you don't need a

1829
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,640
biological brain to be conscious you

1830
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,599
certainly don't need a biological brain

1831
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:07,759
to be intelligent

1832
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,440
right so if we just imagine the

1833
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,119
consciousness at some point comes along

1834
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,400
for the ride as you scale up in

1835
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,599
intelligence

1836
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,838
well then we could find ourselves

1837
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,440
creating conscious minds

1838
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:18,960
that are miserable right and that's just

1839
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,720
like creating a person who's

1840
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,920
miserable right it could be worse than

1841
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:22,239
creating a person who's miserable could

1842
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,159
be

1843
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,239
even more sensitive to suffering cloning

1844
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,920
them and maybe for entertainment

1845
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:30,399
watching them suffer

1846
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,519
just like watching a person for suffer

1847
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,039
for entertainment

1848
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:37,679
you know so but but back to your the

1849
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,480
your primary question here which is

1850
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:40,480
differentiating

1851
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,559
differentiating consciousness and self

1852
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:46,079
and free will as concepts and kind of

1853
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,079
degrees of illusoriness

1854
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:53,598
the problem with free will is that

1855
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:55,599
what most people mean by it and that the

1856
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,119
and you know and dan this is where dan

1857
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:58,880
dennett is going to get off the ride

1858
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,559
here right so like he he doesn't he's

1859
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,160
going to disagree with me that i

1860
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:04,798
that i know what most people mean by it

1861
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:07,199
but i have a very uh

1862
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:08,239
keen sense having talked about this

1863
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:11,358
topic for

1864
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:12,879
many many years and seeing people get

1865
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,679
wrapped around the axle

1866
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,838
of it and seeing seeing in myself what

1867
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:20,000
it's like to have felt

1868
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:21,838
that i was a self that had free will and

1869
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,358
then to no longer feel that way right i

1870
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,679
mean to know what it's like to actually

1871
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:29,838
disabuse myself of that

1872
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:32,239
uh sense cognitively and emotionally

1873
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:34,318
and to recognize what's left what goes

1874
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:37,439
away and what doesn't go away

1875
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:38,639
on the basis of that epiphany i have a

1876
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,200
sense that i know

1877
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:43,118
what people think they have in hand when

1878
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:46,399
they worry about whether free will

1879
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:49,200
exists and it

1880
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,119
is the it is the flip side of this

1881
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:53,919
feeling of self it's the flip side of

1882
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,039
feeling like you are not merely

1883
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,760
identical

1884
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,960
to experience you feel like you're

1885
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,640
having an experience

1886
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,838
you feel like you're an agent that is

1887
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:05,038
appropriating an experience there is a

1888
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:07,119
protagonist in the movie of your life

1889
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,839
and it is you

1890
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:10,720
it's not just the movie right it's like

1891
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:12,639
the the

1892
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:15,038
every like their sights and sounds and

1893
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:17,920
sensations and thoughts and emotions and

1894
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:19,680
this whole cacophony of experience a

1895
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,200
felt experience a felt experience of

1896
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:24,798
embodiment

1897
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:27,439
but there seems to be a

1898
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:28,079
a rider on the horse or a passenger in

1899
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,000
the body

1900
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,720
right people don't feel truly identical

1901
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,639
to their bodies down to their toes

1902
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:36,078
they sort of feel like they have bodies

1903
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:40,000
they feel like their minds

1904
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,000
in bodies and that feels like

1905
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:45,119
a self that feels like me and

1906
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:46,639
again this gets very paradoxical when

1907
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,960
you talk about

1908
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:50,558
the experience of of being in

1909
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,079
relationship to yourself or talking to

1910
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,400
yourself you know giving yourself a pep

1911
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,839
talk i mean if you're the one talking

1912
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,200
why are you also the one listening like

1913
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:57,838
why do you need the pep talk and why

1914
01:06:57,199 --> 01:06:59,279
does it work

1915
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,279
if you're the one giving the pep talk

1916
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,720
right yeah or like or if i said like

1917
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,760
where are my keys right if i'm looking

1918
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:05,919
for my keys

1919
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,799
why do i think the superfluous thought

1920
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,400
where are my keys

1921
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:11,358
i know i'm looking for the [ __ ] keys

1922
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,880
i'm the one looking who am i telling

1923
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:14,639
that you know that we now need to look

1924
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,358
for the keys right so that duality is

1925
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,719
weird but

1926
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:21,838
leave that aside there's

1927
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:22,879
the sense so and this this becomes very

1928
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:25,519
vivid when people

1929
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,000
try to learn to meditate you know most

1930
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:27,679
people

1931
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,440
they start by they start they close

1932
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:31,679
their eyes and they're told to pay

1933
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,000
attention to an object like the breath

1934
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:35,118
say so you close your eyes and you pay

1935
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,719
attention to the breath

1936
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,798
and you can feel it at the tip of your

1937
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,399
nose or the rising falling of your

1938
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:42,239
abdomen

1939
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,798
and you're you're paying attention and

1940
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,479
you feel something vague there

1941
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:48,079
and then you think i thought why the

1942
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,599
breath why am i

1943
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,039
why am i paying attention to the breath

1944
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,680
what's what's so special about the

1945
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,440
breath

1946
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,558
and then you then you then you notice

1947
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,920
you're thinking and you're not paying

1948
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,480
attention to the breath anymore and then

1949
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,920
you

1950
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,000
then you realize okay the practice is

1951
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,920
okay i should notice thoughts and then i

1952
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,599
should come back to the breath

1953
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:07,039
but this starting point is the of the

1954
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,160
conventional starting point of feeling

1955
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,880
like you're an agent

1956
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:12,879
very likely in your head a locus of

1957
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:15,920
consciousness a locus of attention

1958
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,520
that can strategically pay attention to

1959
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,719
certain parts of experience like i can

1960
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,799
focus on the breath

1961
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,239
and then i get lost in thought and now i

1962
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,000
can come back to the breath

1963
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:26,158
and i can open my eyes and i can i'm

1964
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,920
over here behind my face

1965
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,838
looking out at a world that's other than

1966
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,759
me and there's this kind of subject

1967
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:34,238
object perception

1968
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,880
and that is the default starting point

1969
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:40,238
of selfhood of subjectivity

1970
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:44,480
and married to that

1971
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:47,838
is the sense that i can decide

1972
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:50,158
what to do next right i am i am an agent

1973
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:52,238
who can pay attention to the cup

1974
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:53,679
i can listen to sounds there are certain

1975
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:54,879
things that i can't control certain

1976
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,000
things are happening to me and i just

1977
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:01,039
can't control them so for instance

1978
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,279
if someone asks well can you not hear

1979
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:05,198
a sound right like don't hear the next

1980
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,239
sound don't hear anything for a second

1981
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:08,000
or don't hear

1982
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:09,519
don't hear i'm you know i'm snapping my

1983
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,359
fingers don't hear this where's your

1984
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,560
free will you know will i just stop this

1985
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,640
from coming in

1986
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,120
you you you realize okay wait a minute

1987
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,759
my my abundant freedom does not

1988
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:21,198
extend to something as simple as just

1989
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,759
being able to pay attention to something

1990
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,639
else

1991
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:26,158
than this um okay well so that i'm not

1992
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,319
that kind of free agent but

1993
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:29,278
at least i can decide what i'm going to

1994
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,400
do next and i'm going to

1995
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,880
i'm going to pick i'm going to pick up

1996
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:36,798
this water right

1997
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:39,759
and there's a feeling of identification

1998
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:41,838
with the impulse with the intention with

1999
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,679
the thought that occurs to you with the

2000
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,119
with the feeling of speaking like you

2001
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,679
know what am i what am i going to say

2002
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:50,079
next well i'm saying it so here goes

2003
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,039
this is me i it feels like i'm the

2004
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:54,640
thinker i'm the

2005
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:57,920
i'm the one who's in control

2006
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,920
but all of that is born of not really

2007
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:02,399
paying close attention

2008
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,600
to what it's like to be you and and so

2009
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:05,279
this is

2010
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,719
this is where meditation comes in or

2011
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:08,158
this is where um

2012
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,840
again you can get you can get at this

2013
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:11,679
conceptually

2014
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,440
you can unravel the notion of free will

2015
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,760
just by by

2016
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:16,559
thinking certain certain thoughts but

2017
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,199
you can't

2018
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,760
feel that it doesn't exist unless you

2019
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:21,678
can pay

2020
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,800
close attention to how thoughts and

2021
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,560
intentions arise

2022
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,159
so the way to unravel it conceptually is

2023
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,840
just to realize okay

2024
01:10:26,158 --> 01:10:29,439
i didn't make myself i didn't make my

2025
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,400
genes i didn't make my brain i didn't

2026
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:31,839
make the

2027
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,679
the environmental influences that

2028
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,039
impinged upon this system for the last

2029
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:38,158
54 years

2030
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:38,719
that have produced my brain in precisely

2031
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:41,599
the state

2032
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:43,600
it's in right now such with all of the

2033
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,079
the receptor weightings and densities

2034
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,199
and

2035
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:48,880
you know it's just i'm i'm exactly the

2036
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:52,399
machine i am right now through

2037
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:54,640
no fault of of

2038
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:56,879
my own as the experiencing itself i get

2039
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,800
no credit and i get no blame

2040
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,480
for the genetics and the enviro the

2041
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,520
environmental influences here

2042
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:07,039
and yet those are the only things that

2043
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:10,800
could contrive to

2044
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:13,439
to produce my next thought or impulse

2045
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,199
or or moment of behavior and if you were

2046
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:18,639
going to add something magical to that

2047
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:19,839
clockwork like an immortal soul

2048
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,920
you can also notice that you didn't

2049
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,440
produce your soul rightly you you can't

2050
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,560
account for the fact that you don't have

2051
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:27,198
the soul

2052
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,159
of someone who doesn't like any of the

2053
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:29,519
things you like

2054
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:31,039
or wasn't interested in any of the

2055
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,000
things you were interested in or you

2056
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:33,920
know or

2057
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,119
was a psychopath or was either you had

2058
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:39,840
an iq of 40 or like there's nothing

2059
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:40,719
nothing about that that the person who

2060
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,199
believes in us

2061
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,319
in a soul can claim to have controlled

2062
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:47,039
and yet that is

2063
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:48,079
also totally dispositive of whatever

2064
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,039
happens next

2065
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:52,479
and but everything you've described now

2066
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,079
maybe you can correct me but it kind of

2067
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:57,279
speaks to the materialistic

2068
01:11:54,079 --> 01:12:00,238
nature of the hardware

2069
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,119
but even if you add magical ectoplasm

2070
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:02,559
software

2071
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:04,800
you didn't you didn't produce that

2072
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,199
either i i know but

2073
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,000
if we can think about the actual

2074
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,238
computation

2075
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,760
running on the hardware and running on

2076
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:12,639
the software there's something you said

2077
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,679
recently

2078
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,119
which you think of um culture as an

2079
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:20,480
operating system

2080
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:21,039
so if we just remove ourselves a little

2081
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,359
bit

2082
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:25,039
from the conception of human

2083
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:26,000
civilization being a collection of

2084
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:29,198
humans

2085
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:32,079
and rather us just being a distributed

2086
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:34,000
uh computation system on which there's

2087
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:36,399
some kind of operating system running

2088
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,800
and then the computation that's running

2089
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:40,639
is the actual thing that generates

2090
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,880
the interactions the communications and

2091
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,159
maybe even free will the experiences of

2092
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,159
all those free will

2093
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:48,158
do you ever think of do you ever try to

2094
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:48,960
reframe the world in that way where it's

2095
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:52,479
like

2096
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:56,399
ideas are just using us thoughts

2097
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:58,319
are using individual nodes in the system

2098
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:00,158
and they're just jumping around and they

2099
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:01,359
also have ability to generate like

2100
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:03,439
experiences

2101
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:04,399
so that we can push those ideas along

2102
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:06,879
and basically

2103
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:09,039
the main organisms here are the thoughts

2104
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,760
not the humans

2105
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:12,719
yeah but then that erodes the boundary

2106
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,320
between

2107
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,840
self and world right so so then there's

2108
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,679
no

2109
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,319
self really a really integrated self to

2110
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,640
have

2111
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:23,679
any kind of will at all like if you're

2112
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,159
just a meme

2113
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:27,920
plex i mean if there's just like if if

2114
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:30,319
you're just a collection of memes

2115
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:33,199
yeah and i mean like we're all kind of

2116
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:36,238
like like currents like eddies in in

2117
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:39,678
in this river of of ideas right so

2118
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:40,639
it's like um and it seems to have

2119
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,719
structure

2120
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,239
but there's no real boundary between

2121
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,640
that part of the flow of water

2122
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:48,479
and the rest i mean if our and i would

2123
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,079
say that much of our mind answers to

2124
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,129
this kind of description i mean

2125
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,439
so much of our mind has been

2126
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:55,440
[Music]

2127
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:56,960
it's obviously not self-generated and

2128
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:58,000
it's not it's not going to find it by

2129
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,840
looking in the brain

2130
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:06,479
it's it is the result of

2131
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,480
culture largely but also um

2132
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:12,158
uh you know it's it's the genes on one

2133
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:17,039
side and culture on the other

2134
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:21,039
m meeting to allow for

2135
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:24,238
um manifestations of mind that don't

2136
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:24,960
that aren't actually bounded by the the

2137
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:28,000
person

2138
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,359
in any clear sense it was just

2139
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,359
the example i often use here but

2140
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:34,799
there are so many others is just the

2141
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:36,719
fact that we're following

2142
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,920
the rules of english grammar to whatever

2143
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,600
degree we are

2144
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,119
it's not that we certainly haven't

2145
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,360
consciously represented these

2146
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:44,158
rules for ourselves we haven't invented

2147
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,000
these rules

2148
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:47,279
we haven't i mean there are there are

2149
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,960
norms of

2150
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:53,279
language use that we couldn't even

2151
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,880
specify because we haven't you know

2152
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:56,399
we're not grammarians we're not we

2153
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,159
haven't studied this

2154
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:00,000
we don't even have the right concepts

2155
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:02,000
and yet we're following these rules and

2156
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,600
we're noticing

2157
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,520
you know we're noticing as you know an

2158
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,560
error when we fail to follow

2159
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:10,800
these rules and

2160
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,000
virtually every other cultural norm is

2161
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,119
like that i mean these are not things

2162
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,479
we've invented

2163
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:20,079
you can you can consciously decide to to

2164
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:22,718
scrutinize them and override them but

2165
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:24,399
i mean just think of just think of any

2166
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,679
social situation where you're with other

2167
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:28,639
people

2168
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,239
and you're behaving in ways that are

2169
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,560
culturally

2170
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:33,519
appropriate right you're not being you

2171
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,520
know you're not being

2172
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,120
wild animals together you're following

2173
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,520
you have some expectation of

2174
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:40,719
how you shake a person's hand and how

2175
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,520
you

2176
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:45,039
um deal with with implements on a table

2177
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,560
how you have a meal together

2178
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:48,238
obviously this can change from culture

2179
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,760
to culture and

2180
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:51,519
and people can be shocked by how

2181
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,000
different those things are right we you

2182
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,320
know we

2183
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,520
all have foods we find disgusting but in

2184
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:57,439
some countries

2185
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,280
dog is not one of those foods right and

2186
01:15:57,439 --> 01:15:59,919
and yet you know you and i presumably

2187
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:03,198
would be

2188
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,199
horrified to be served dog

2189
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,920
those are not norms that we're

2190
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:10,559
they are outside of us in some way and

2191
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:13,359
they're

2192
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,000
yet they're they're felt very viscerally

2193
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:16,079
i mean they're

2194
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,039
certainly felt in their violation you

2195
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:20,079
know if you're if you

2196
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:22,158
are just imagine you're you're in

2197
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:23,760
somebody's home you're eating something

2198
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:25,359
that tastes great to you

2199
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,960
and you happen to be in vietnam or

2200
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:28,639
wherever you know you you

2201
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,239
didn't realize dog was potentially on

2202
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:33,039
the menu and

2203
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:34,399
you find out that you've just eaten 10

2204
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:37,279
bites of what

2205
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:39,039
is uh you know really a cocker spaniel

2206
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:41,759
and

2207
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,479
you feel this instantaneous urge to

2208
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,440
vomit

2209
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:47,039
right based on an idea right like so

2210
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:51,039
like you did not

2211
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:54,319
you're not the author of that norm

2212
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:55,600
that gave you such a powerful experience

2213
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:58,639
of its violation

2214
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,520
and i'm sure we can trace the moment in

2215
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,199
your history

2216
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,520
you know vaguely where it sort of got in

2217
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:04,399
i mean very early on as kids you you

2218
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,320
realize you're

2219
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:10,158
you're treating dogs as pets and not as

2220
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:10,158
food or as potential food

2221
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:16,479
but yeah no it's but

2222
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:19,519
the point you just made opens us

2223
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:22,718
to like we are totally permeable to a

2224
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,640
sea of mind yeah but

2225
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:26,158
if we uh take the metaphor of the

2226
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,760
distributed computing systems

2227
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:31,439
each individual node is

2228
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,800
is part of performing a much larger

2229
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,439
computation

2230
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,400
but nevertheless is in charge of doing

2231
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:39,519
the scheduling

2232
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:41,439
of uh so assuming it's linux is doing

2233
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:43,280
the scheduling of processes and it's

2234
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:45,198
constantly alternating them that node is

2235
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:47,519
making those uh

2236
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:49,198
choices that node sure as hell believes

2237
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,360
it has free will

2238
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:53,039
and actually has free will because it's

2239
01:17:51,359 --> 01:17:54,960
making those hard choices

2240
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:56,640
but the choices ultimately are part of

2241
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,279
much larger computation that it can't

2242
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,280
control

2243
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:01,519
isn't it possible for that node to still

2244
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:04,559
be that human node

2245
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:08,800
uh is still making the choice well

2246
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:11,679
it is so i'm not saying that your body

2247
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,560
isn't doing really doing things right

2248
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,000
and

2249
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,080
some of those things can be

2250
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,800
conventionally thought of as choices

2251
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:19,439
right so it's like i can i can choose to

2252
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,520
reach and

2253
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:22,639
it's like it's not being imposed on me

2254
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,159
that would be a different experience

2255
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,800
like so there's a

2256
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:27,839
there's an experience of of all you know

2257
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:30,800
there's there's definitely a difference

2258
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,360
between voluntary and involuntary action

2259
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,119
there's uh so we that has to get

2260
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:36,799
conserved by any account of the mind

2261
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:38,479
that that jettison's free will you still

2262
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,960
have to admit that that

2263
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:42,879
there's a difference between a tremor

2264
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:46,800
that i can't control

2265
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:49,039
and a a purposeful motor action that i

2266
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,199
can control and i can initiate on demand

2267
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:54,399
and it's associated with intentions

2268
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:57,119
uh and i've it's got efferent uh

2269
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:58,719
you know motor copy which which is being

2270
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:00,079
which is being predictive so that i can

2271
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:01,920
notice errors you know i have

2272
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:03,840
expectations when i reach for this

2273
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,840
if my hand were actually to pass through

2274
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,679
the bottle because it's a hologram

2275
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,679
i would be surprised right so that shows

2276
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,760
that i have a expectation of just

2277
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:13,600
what my grasping behavior is going to be

2278
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,039
like even before it happens

2279
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,199
whereas with a tremor you don't have the

2280
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:20,079
same kind of thing going on

2281
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:21,039
that's a distinction we have to make so

2282
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:24,319
i am yes i'm

2283
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:27,920
really the proxy my intention

2284
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:29,599
to move subject which is in fact can be

2285
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,199
subjectively felt really is the

2286
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,920
proximate cause of my moving it's not

2287
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:34,000
coming from

2288
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,960
elsewhere in the universe i'm not saying

2289
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,800
that

2290
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,239
so in that sense the node is really

2291
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:42,159
deciding to execute

2292
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:47,439
you know the the subroutine now

2293
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:52,000
but um that's not

2294
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:55,198
the feeling that has given rise to this

2295
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,560
this conundrum of free will right so the

2296
01:19:55,198 --> 01:20:00,719
the people feel like

2297
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,480
people feel like they the crucial things

2298
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,880
that people feel like they could have

2299
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:06,559
done otherwise right that's the

2300
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,119
that's the thing that says that when you

2301
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,480
when you run back the clock of your life

2302
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:12,800
right you run back the movie of your

2303
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:14,559
life you flip back the few pages in the

2304
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:18,079
novel of your life

2305
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,920
they feel that at that at this point

2306
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,198
they could behave differently than they

2307
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,679
did right so like

2308
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:27,519
like but but given you know even given

2309
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:27,520
your distributed computing example

2310
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,840
it's either a determining a fully

2311
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:32,880
deterministic system or it's a

2312
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,719
deterministic system that admits of some

2313
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:38,319
random

2314
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:41,119
you know influence in either case

2315
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:42,479
um that's not the free will people think

2316
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:45,119
they have the p the free will people

2317
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:47,198
think they have is

2318
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:49,279
damn i shouldn't have done that i i just

2319
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:51,439
like i i shouldn't have done that

2320
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:52,880
i could have done otherwise right i

2321
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:53,519
should have done otherwise right like if

2322
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,359
i i

2323
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,280
like if you think about something that

2324
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,880
you deeply regret doing

2325
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:00,719
right or that you do you hold someone

2326
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,560
else responsible for

2327
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:05,520
because they really are the upstream

2328
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,520
agent in your mind of what they did

2329
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,800
you know that's an awful thing that that

2330
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:10,560
person did and they shouldn't have done

2331
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,320
it

2332
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,440
there is this illusion and it has to be

2333
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:17,519
an illusion because there's there's no

2334
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:18,799
picture of causation that would make

2335
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,800
sense of it

2336
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,800
there's this illusion that that if you

2337
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,400
arrange the universe exactly the way it

2338
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:28,400
was a moment ago

2339
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:30,158
it could have played out differently and

2340
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:31,519
the only way it could have played out

2341
01:21:30,158 --> 01:21:34,719
differently

2342
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,120
is if there's randomness added to that

2343
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,920
but

2344
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:39,039
randomness isn't what people feel would

2345
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,440
give them free will

2346
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:43,119
right if you tell me that you know i i

2347
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:43,919
only reach for the water bottle this

2348
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:45,359
time

2349
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,960
because somebody's because there's a

2350
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:50,079
random number generator in there

2351
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:51,279
kicking off values and it finally moved

2352
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:54,000
my hand

2353
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:55,599
that's not the feeling of authorship

2354
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,079
that's still not control

2355
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,920
you're still not making that decision

2356
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:01,679
there's actually i don't know if

2357
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,158
you're familiar with cellular automata

2358
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:07,039
it's a really nice visualization of

2359
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:08,719
how simple rules can create incredible

2360
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:10,479
complexity that

2361
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,560
it's like really dumb initial conditions

2362
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:15,359
to set simple rules applied

2363
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,840
and eventually you watch this thing and

2364
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:17,759
if

2365
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,840
the rule if the initial conditions are

2366
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:22,239
correct that you're going to

2367
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:24,319
have emerge something that to our

2368
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:25,279
perception system looks like organisms

2369
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:27,039
interacting

2370
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:29,359
you can construct any kinds of worlds

2371
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:30,560
and they're not actually interacting

2372
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:32,799
it's not they're not actually even

2373
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:35,280
organisms and they certainly

2374
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:37,199
don't aren't making decisions so there's

2375
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:38,479
like systems you can create that

2376
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:41,439
illustrate this point

2377
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:42,238
the question is whether there could be

2378
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:45,919
some

2379
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:47,359
room for let's use in the 21st century

2380
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,000
the term magic

2381
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:50,719
back to the black box of consciousness

2382
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,760
let me ask you

2383
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:54,719
it this way if you're wrong about your

2384
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,159
intuition about

2385
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:59,520
free will what and somebody comes along

2386
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:02,079
to you and proves

2387
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,199
to you that you didn't you didn't have

2388
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:05,039
the full picture

2389
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:06,559
what would that proof look like what

2390
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:08,560
would uh well that's that's the problem

2391
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,920
that's why it's not even an illusion

2392
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:14,800
in in my world because it's

2393
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,719
for me it's impossible to say what the

2394
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,880
universe would have to be like

2395
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:21,039
for free will to be a thing right it's

2396
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:24,639
just it doesn't conceptually map onto

2397
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:27,679
any notion of causation we have

2398
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:30,719
and that's unlike any other

2399
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,119
spurious claim you might make so like if

2400
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,639
you're gonna

2401
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:37,760
if you're gonna believe in ghosts right

2402
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:39,440
i understand what that claim could be

2403
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,199
or like i you know i don't happen to

2404
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:44,238
believe in ghosts but

2405
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:46,079
if it's it's not hard for me to specify

2406
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:47,198
what would have to be true for ghosts to

2407
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:48,800
be real

2408
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:50,879
and so it is with a thousand other

2409
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,159
things like ghosts right so like

2410
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,719
okay so you're telling me that when

2411
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:56,479
people die there's some part of them

2412
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:59,198
that is not reducible at all to their

2413
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:01,119
biology that lifts off them

2414
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:03,678
and goes elsewhere and is actually the

2415
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,439
kind of thing that can linger in closets

2416
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:08,319
and in cupboards and

2417
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:09,678
and actually it's immaterial but by some

2418
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:10,238
principle of physics we don't totally

2419
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:13,039
understand

2420
01:24:10,238 --> 01:24:14,000
it can make sounds and knock you know

2421
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:16,000
objects

2422
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,679
and even occasionally show up so they

2423
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,600
can be visually beheld

2424
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:23,119
um and it's just it seems like a miracle

2425
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,679
but it's just this is just

2426
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:26,960
some spooky noun in the universe that we

2427
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,480
don't understand

2428
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:32,319
let's call it a ghost that's fine i can

2429
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:33,599
talk about that all day that the reasons

2430
01:24:32,319 --> 01:24:34,960
to believe in it the reasons not to

2431
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,639
believe in it the way we would

2432
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,079
scientifically test for it what would

2433
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:40,400
have to be provable

2434
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:42,479
so as to convince me that ghosts are

2435
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:44,559
real

2436
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:46,399
free will isn't like that at all there's

2437
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:49,440
no description

2438
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:50,479
of any concatenation of causes that

2439
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:54,000
precedes

2440
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:55,198
my conscious experience that sounds like

2441
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,319
what people think they have

2442
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:58,319
when they think they could have done

2443
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:00,079
otherwise and that they really that they

2444
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:02,399
the conscious agent

2445
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:03,840
is really in charge right like if you

2446
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:04,960
don't know what you're going to think

2447
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:09,199
next

2448
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,198
right and you can't help but think it

2449
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,039
take those two premises on board

2450
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:16,639
you don't know what it's going to be you

2451
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:20,238
can't stop it

2452
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:23,520
from coming and until you actually

2453
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:27,198
know how to meditate you can't stop

2454
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:29,360
yourself from

2455
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:31,039
fully living out its behavioral or

2456
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:33,039
emotional consequences

2457
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:34,880
right like you have no you you once you

2458
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:37,198
mindfulness you know

2459
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,239
arguably gives you a another degree of

2460
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:39,359
freedom here

2461
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:41,198
it doesn't give you free will but it

2462
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:41,920
gives you some other game to play with

2463
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:44,399
respect to

2464
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,158
the the the emotional and behavioral

2465
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:49,359
imperatives of thoughts

2466
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:50,799
but short of ev

2467
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:52,158
short of that i mean the reason why

2468
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,199
mindfulness doesn't give you free will

2469
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:54,960
is because you can't

2470
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:57,359
you know you can't account for why in

2471
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:59,119
one moment mindfulness arises

2472
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:00,639
and and in other moments it doesn't

2473
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:02,719
right but

2474
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:04,560
um but a pro a different process is

2475
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:07,920
initiated once you can

2476
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,280
can practice in that way well if i could

2477
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,039
push back for a second by the way i just

2478
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:13,119
had this thought bubble come

2479
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:15,119
popping up all the time of just two

2480
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:16,639
recent chimps arguing about the nature

2481
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:19,599
of consciousness

2482
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:21,359
it's kind of hilarious so on that thread

2483
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,039
right you know

2484
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:25,039
if we're even before einstein let's say

2485
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:27,519
before einstein we were

2486
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:30,079
to conceive about traveling from point a

2487
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,080
to point b

2488
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:34,879
say some point in the future we are able

2489
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:38,079
to realize through engineering

2490
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,760
a way which is suppose is consistent

2491
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:41,760
with einstein's theory that you can have

2492
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,800
wormholes you can travel from one point

2493
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:46,159
to another

2494
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:48,639
faster than the speed of light

2495
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:50,879
and that would i think completely change

2496
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:54,400
our conception what it means to travel

2497
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:57,440
in the physical space and that like

2498
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:59,119
completely transform our ability

2499
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:00,479
you talk about causality but here let's

2500
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:02,719
just focus on

2501
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:04,158
what it means to travel through physical

2502
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:08,079
space don't you think it's

2503
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:11,279
possible that there will be inventions

2504
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:14,319
or leaps in understanding about reality

2505
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:18,158
that will allow us to see free will as

2506
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:19,920
actually like us humans

2507
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:21,279
somehow may be linked to this idea of

2508
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:23,679
consciousness

2509
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:25,519
are actually able to be authors of our

2510
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:27,679
actions

2511
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,360
it is a it's a non-starter for me

2512
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:32,960
conceptually

2513
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:34,559
it's a little bit like saying

2514
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:37,679
could there be some breakthrough that

2515
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:40,719
will cause us to realize that

2516
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:42,480
circles are really square or the circles

2517
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:45,679
are not really round

2518
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:48,000
right no a circle is what we mean

2519
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:48,880
by a perfectly round form right like

2520
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,679
it's it's it's

2521
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:53,199
it it's not it's not on the table to be

2522
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,079
revised and

2523
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:56,559
so i would say the same thing about

2524
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:59,279
consciousness so it's just like saying

2525
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,000
is there some breakthrough that would

2526
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:02,479
get us to realize

2527
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,119
that consciousness is really an illusion

2528
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:05,759
i'm saying

2529
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:06,479
no because what the experience of an

2530
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,159
illusion

2531
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:09,599
is as much a demonstration of what i'm

2532
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:11,759
calling consciousness as anything else

2533
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:15,280
right like that that is consciousness

2534
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:18,079
um with free will it's a similar problem

2535
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:18,079
it's like um

2536
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,239
again it comes down to a picture of

2537
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:27,119
causality and there's just there's no

2538
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:29,839
there's no other picture on offer and

2539
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:29,840
what's more

2540
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,158
i know i know what it's like on the

2541
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:37,920
experiential side

2542
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:38,719
to lose the thing to which it is clearly

2543
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,520
anchored

2544
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:42,560
right like the feel like it doesn't feel

2545
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,679
and this is and this is the question

2546
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,440
that almost nobody asked

2547
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,760
people who are debating me on on the

2548
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:50,559
topic of free will

2549
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,840
i i'm you know at 15 minute intervals

2550
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:54,880
i'm making a claim

2551
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:58,079
that i don't feel this thing and they

2552
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:59,840
are never become interested in

2553
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:01,679
well what's that like like okay so

2554
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:04,719
you're actually saying you don't

2555
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:06,319
you this this thing isn't you know isn't

2556
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,719
true for you empirically it's not just

2557
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:09,439
because

2558
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,079
most people who who don't believe in

2559
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:13,359
free will

2560
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:15,760
philosophically also believe that we're

2561
01:29:13,359 --> 01:29:17,519
condemned to experience it like they

2562
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,960
you just you can't live without this

2563
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,440
feeling so

2564
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,319
so you're actually saying you're able to

2565
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:25,519
experience

2566
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:28,479
the absence of

2567
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,000
the illusion of free will yes yes for

2568
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:34,079
are we talking about

2569
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:37,198
whenever whenever minutes at a time or

2570
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:38,479
um is this to require a lot of work and

2571
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:40,079
meditation are you

2572
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:42,079
literally able to load that into your

2573
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:43,679
mind and like play that

2574
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:45,198
right now right now just in this

2575
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:48,960
conversation so

2576
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:51,678
it's not it's not absolutely continuous

2577
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,000
but it's whenever i pay attention it's

2578
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,520
like

2579
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,920
it's the same and i would say the same

2580
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,360
thing for the the illusoriness of the

2581
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:59,119
self in the sen and again we

2582
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:00,960
we haven't talked about this so can you

2583
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:01,920
still have the self and not have the

2584
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,520
free will never mind

2585
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,279
at the same time do they go at the same

2586
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,440
time this is the same yeah it's the same

2587
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:08,639
thing that they're always holding hands

2588
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:09,919
when they walk out the door i mean

2589
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,239
there really are two sides of the same

2590
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,158
coin okay but it's just it comes down to

2591
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:15,678
what it's like

2592
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,599
to try to get to the end of this

2593
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:20,000
sentence or what it's like to

2594
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,440
to finally decide that it's been long

2595
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,279
enough and now i need another sip of

2596
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:23,678
water right if i'm paying attention now

2597
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:26,719
if

2598
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:28,800
i'm not paying attention i'm probably

2599
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,399
i'm captured by some other thought and

2600
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,159
that feels a certain way

2601
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:34,158
right and so that's not it's not vivid

2602
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:36,960
but if i try to make vivid

2603
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:38,479
this experience of just okay i'm finally

2604
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,158
going to experience free will i'm going

2605
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:41,678
to notice my free will

2606
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:43,198
right like it's got to be here

2607
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:44,399
everyone's talking about it

2608
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:46,079
where is it i'm going to pay attention

2609
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:46,399
to i'm going to look for it and i'm

2610
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:48,800
going to

2611
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:51,279
i'm going to create a circumstance that

2612
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:53,520
is is where it is it has to be most

2613
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,559
robust right i'm not rushed to make this

2614
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,679
decision

2615
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,480
i'm not it's not a reflex i'm not under

2616
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:00,158
pressure

2617
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:02,000
i'm gonna take as long as i want i'm

2618
01:31:00,158 --> 01:31:03,519
going to decide

2619
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,880
it's not trivial like so it's not just

2620
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,080
like reaching with my left hand to reach

2621
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,600
with my right hand people don't like

2622
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,960
those examples for some reason

2623
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:14,320
let's make a big decision like

2624
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,239
where should you know

2625
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:17,439
what should my next podcast be on right

2626
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:20,000
who do i invite on the next

2627
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:20,638
podcast what is it like to make that

2628
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,679
decision

2629
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:25,760
when i pay attention there is no

2630
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:27,679
evidence of free will

2631
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,039
anywhere in sight it's like it doesn't

2632
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:32,079
feel like it feels

2633
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:33,840
profoundly mysterious to be to be going

2634
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:36,000
back between two people you know

2635
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:37,360
like is it going to be person a or

2636
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,279
person b

2637
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:40,880
i've got all my reasons for a and all my

2638
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:41,198
reasons why not and all my reasons for

2639
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,440
be

2640
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:44,960
and that there's some math going on

2641
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:47,759
there that i that i'm not

2642
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,359
not even privy to where certain concerns

2643
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,880
are trumping others

2644
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:55,519
and at a certain point i just decide

2645
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,880
and yes you can say i'm the node in the

2646
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,480
network that has made that decision

2647
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,319
absolutely i'm not saying it's being

2648
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:02,718
piped to me from elsewhere

2649
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:04,559
but the feeling of what it's like to

2650
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:06,880
make that decision

2651
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,880
is

2652
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:13,920
totally without a

2653
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:17,039
sense a real sense of

2654
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,760
agency because because something

2655
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:22,399
simply emerges it's literally it's

2656
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:25,600
literally as tenuous as

2657
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:27,359
what's the next sound i'm going to hear

2658
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,360
right or what's a what's the next

2659
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:32,000
thought that's going to appear

2660
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:33,519
and it just something just appears you

2661
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,560
know and and if something appears to

2662
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,600
cancel that something

2663
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,280
like if i say i'm going to invite her

2664
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,639
and then i'm about to send the email and

2665
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:43,279
i think oh no no i can't

2666
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:44,000
i can't do that there was a thing in the

2667
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:45,920
that

2668
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,679
new york article i read that i got to

2669
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,840
talk to this guy right

2670
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:51,679
that pivot at the last second you can

2671
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,560
make it as as

2672
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,920
muscular as you want it always just

2673
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,400
comes out of the darkness

2674
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,239
it's always mysterious so right when you

2675
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:01,119
try to pin it down you really can't ever

2676
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:04,158
find that

2677
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:05,760
free will it's the the the the

2678
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:07,039
if you construct an experiment for

2679
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,400
yourself and you're trying to really

2680
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:09,279
find that moment when you're actually

2681
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:12,719
making that

2682
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:15,359
controlled author decision it's it's uh

2683
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:16,800
and we're still we're still we know at

2684
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:18,238
this point that if we were scanning your

2685
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,679
brain

2686
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:24,799
in some ex you know podcast guest

2687
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:27,199
choosing experiment right we know

2688
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,840
at this point we would be privy to who

2689
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:29,839
you're

2690
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,679
going to pick before you are you the

2691
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,319
conscious agent if we could again this

2692
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:34,158
is

2693
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:36,000
operationally a little hard to conduct

2694
01:33:34,158 --> 01:33:38,638
but there's enough data now

2695
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,679
to know that something very much like

2696
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:43,520
this cartoon

2697
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:45,440
is in fact true um and will ultimately

2698
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:47,360
be undeniable for people

2699
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:49,759
um they'll be able to do it on

2700
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:51,599
themselves with their you know some app

2701
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:54,560
um

2702
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:56,000
if you're deciding what to you know

2703
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,920
where to go for dinner or who to have on

2704
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
your podcast or ultimately you know who

2705
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,319
to marry right or what what city to move

2706
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,880
to

2707
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:05,519
right like you you can make it as big or

2708
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,359
as small a decision as you want

2709
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,280
we could be scanning your brain in real

2710
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:11,119
time and

2711
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:12,559
at a point where you still think you're

2712
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:15,679
uncommitted

2713
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:16,960
we would be able to say with arbitrary

2714
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:20,079
accuracy

2715
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:22,158
all right lex is he's moving to austin

2716
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:23,760
right i didn't choose that yeah he was

2717
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:25,359
true it was it was going to be austin it

2718
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:28,000
was going to be miami he got

2719
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:29,119
he's catching one of these two waves but

2720
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,920
it's going to be austin

2721
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:33,439
and at a point where you subjectively if

2722
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:35,279
we if we could ask you

2723
01:34:33,439 --> 01:34:36,719
you would say oh no i'm still i'm still

2724
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:38,800
working over here

2725
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:40,560
i'm still thinking i'm still choosing

2726
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:43,600
i'm still considering my options

2727
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:45,360
and you've spoken to this in you

2728
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:48,159
thinking about other stuff in the world

2729
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:50,559
it's been very useful

2730
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:51,359
to uh to step away from this illusion of

2731
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,280
free will

2732
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:54,639
and you argue that it's probably makes a

2733
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:56,238
better world because you can be

2734
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:56,719
compassionate and empathetic towards

2735
01:34:56,238 --> 01:34:59,839
others

2736
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,840
and towards oneself

2737
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:03,439
radically toward others in that

2738
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:06,158
literally

2739
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:08,079
hate makes no sense anymore i mean there

2740
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:10,158
are certain things you can

2741
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:11,439
really be worried about really want to

2742
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:13,039
oppose really i mean

2743
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:14,638
i'm not saying you'd never have to kill

2744
01:35:13,039 --> 01:35:16,238
another person like i mean self-defense

2745
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:19,279
is still a thing right

2746
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:22,079
but the idea

2747
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:24,000
that you're ever confronting anything

2748
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:26,800
other than a force of nature

2749
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,079
in the end goes out the window right or

2750
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,600
what does go out the window when you

2751
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:30,319
really pay attention i'm not i'm not

2752
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,360
saying that this

2753
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:36,559
would be easy to under to grok

2754
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:37,839
if you know

2755
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,119
you know someone kills a member of your

2756
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,800
family i'm not saying you can just

2757
01:35:39,118 --> 01:35:41,920
listen to my 90 minutes on free will and

2758
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,279
then you should be able to see that

2759
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:46,399
person as identical to a

2760
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:49,679
grizzly bear or or a virus

2761
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:54,319
because it's so i mean we are so evolved

2762
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:57,840
to uh deal with one another as

2763
01:35:54,319 --> 01:36:01,599
as fellow primates and as agents uh

2764
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:04,159
but it's um yeah when you're talking

2765
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:07,119
about the possibility of

2766
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:07,759
you know christian you know truly

2767
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:11,839
christian

2768
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,840
forgiveness right it's just like

2769
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:17,600
as as testified to by you know various

2770
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:17,599
um

2771
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,600
uh saints of that flavor over the over

2772
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,639
the

2773
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:27,920
the millennial yeah

2774
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:28,800
that is that the doorway to that is to

2775
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,600
recognize

2776
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:32,239
that no one really at bottom made

2777
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:34,560
themselves

2778
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:36,238
right and and therefore everyone what

2779
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,039
we're seeing really

2780
01:36:36,238 --> 01:36:40,158
are differences in luck in the world

2781
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:42,719
we're seeing people who are

2782
01:36:40,158 --> 01:36:44,238
very very lucky to have had good parents

2783
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:46,239
and good genes and to be in good

2784
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:48,799
societies and good opportunities

2785
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:51,118
and to be intelligent and to be you know

2786
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,360
not sociopathic like

2787
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:54,559
it's none of it is on them they're just

2788
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:56,880
reaping one lot

2789
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,080
the the fruits of one lottery after

2790
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,760
another and then

2791
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:04,399
showing up in the world on that basis

2792
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:06,560
and then so it is with you know every

2793
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:10,960
malevolent [ __ ] out there right he

2794
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:14,159
he or she didn't make themselves

2795
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:15,279
even if that weren't possible the

2796
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:18,479
utility for

2797
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:21,039
for self-compassion is also enormous

2798
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:21,678
because it's when you just look at what

2799
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:25,039
it's like

2800
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:27,039
to regret

2801
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:28,960
something or to feel shame about

2802
01:37:27,039 --> 01:37:30,560
something or feel deep embarrassment

2803
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,079
these states of mind are some of the

2804
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,800
most

2805
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:35,600
deranging experiences anyone has and and

2806
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,600
they're reactive

2807
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,800
the the kind of the the indelible

2808
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,280
reaction

2809
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:42,719
to them you know the memory of the thing

2810
01:37:41,279 --> 01:37:44,000
you said the you know the memory of the

2811
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,079
wedding toast you gave

2812
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,399
20 years ago that was just mortifying

2813
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:50,880
right the fact that that can still

2814
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:51,519
make you hate yourself right and like

2815
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:54,560
like that

2816
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:56,000
psychologically that is a knot that can

2817
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,679
be untied

2818
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,039
right speak for yourself sam yeah yeah

2819
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:00,560
clearly you gave a great

2820
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:02,238
great toast it was my toast that

2821
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,280
mortified no no that's not what i was

2822
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:06,479
referring to i

2823
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:08,399
i i'm deeply appreciative

2824
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,238
in the same way that you're referring to

2825
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:15,359
of every moment i'm alive

2826
01:38:10,238 --> 01:38:17,599
but i'm also powered by self-hate often

2827
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:19,519
like several things in this conversation

2828
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:22,159
already that i've spoken

2829
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,960
i'll be thinking about like that was the

2830
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:24,799
dumbest thing

2831
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,158
you're sitting in front of sam harris he

2832
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:29,279
said that

2833
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:31,198
so like that but that somehow creates a

2834
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:32,800
richer experience for me like i've

2835
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:34,079
actually come to accept that as a nice

2836
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,000
feature of however my

2837
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:37,198
brain was built i don't think i want to

2838
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,560
let go of that

2839
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:41,198
well the thing you i think the thing you

2840
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:44,880
want to let go of is

2841
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:47,919
uh the suffering

2842
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:50,079
associated with it so like so for me so

2843
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,079
so

2844
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:55,118
mr psychologically and ethically all of

2845
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,280
this is very interesting

2846
01:38:55,118 --> 01:38:59,198
so i don't think we ever we should ever

2847
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:00,880
get rid of things like anger

2848
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:02,638
right so like hatred is hatred is

2849
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:05,118
divorceable from anger

2850
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:06,800
in the sense that hatred is this

2851
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:08,479
enduring state

2852
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:10,480
where you know whether you're hating

2853
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:14,079
somebody else or hating yourself

2854
01:39:10,479 --> 01:39:16,158
it is just it is toxic and durable

2855
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:18,479
and ultimately useless right like it

2856
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:21,599
becomes it becomes self

2857
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:24,000
nullifying right like you become less

2858
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,600
capable as a person to solve any of your

2859
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,118
problems it's not it's not instrumental

2860
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:30,800
in solving the problem that is

2861
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:33,599
that is is occasioning all this hatred

2862
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,560
and anger for the most part isn't either

2863
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,480
except as a

2864
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,000
signal of salience that there's a

2865
01:39:36,479 --> 01:39:40,238
problem right so if somebody does

2866
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:43,279
something that makes me angry

2867
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:43,839
that just promotes this situation to to

2868
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:46,319
conscious

2869
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,520
uh conscious attention in a way that is

2870
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:49,519
stronger than

2871
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,639
my not really caring about it right and

2872
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:52,239
there are things that i think should

2873
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:54,000
make us angry in the world

2874
01:39:52,238 --> 01:39:55,919
and there the there's the behavior of

2875
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,238
other people that should make us angry

2876
01:39:55,920 --> 01:40:00,960
because we should respond to it and so

2877
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:02,479
it is with yourself if i do something

2878
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:05,279
you know as a parent if i do something

2879
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:08,879
stupid that harms one of my daughters

2880
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:10,719
right um my belief

2881
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,400
my experience of myself and my beliefs

2882
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:14,639
about free will

2883
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:16,158
closed the door to my saying well i

2884
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,639
should have done otherwise in the sense

2885
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:18,238
that if i

2886
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:20,239
could go back in time i would have

2887
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:22,319
actually effectively done otherwise

2888
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:23,759
no i would do given the same causes and

2889
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:26,238
conditions i would do that thing a

2890
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:29,760
trillion times in a row right

2891
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:34,479
but you know

2892
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:36,719
regret and feeling bad about an outcome

2893
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:38,000
are still important to capacities

2894
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,319
because like yeah you're like

2895
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,600
i i desperately want my daughters to be

2896
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:43,359
happy and healthy

2897
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,520
so if i if i've done something you know

2898
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:46,880
if i if i crash the car when they're in

2899
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,760
the car and they get injured right

2900
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,760
because and i'm

2901
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,920
i do it because i was trying to change

2902
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:53,520
the song on my playlist or you know

2903
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:56,880
something stupid

2904
01:40:53,520 --> 01:41:00,480
i'm going to feel like a total [ __ ]

2905
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:03,600
how long do how long do i stew in that

2906
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:06,879
feeling of regret right and

2907
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:08,480
like what utility is there to extract

2908
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:11,760
out of this error signal

2909
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:13,439
and then what do i do we're always faced

2910
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,880
with the question of what to do next

2911
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:17,118
right and and and how

2912
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,239
to best do that thing that necessary

2913
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:22,319
thing next

2914
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:25,359
and how much well-being

2915
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:28,000
can we experience while doing it like

2916
01:41:25,359 --> 01:41:31,198
how much how miserable do you need to be

2917
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,238
to solve your problems in life and to

2918
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:33,678
solve the problems of

2919
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:35,439
to help solve the problems of people

2920
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:37,118
closest to you you know how

2921
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:39,678
how miserable do you need to be to get

2922
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:44,639
through your to-do list today

2923
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:49,039
ultimately i think you can be

2924
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:52,079
deeply happy going through all of it

2925
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:55,519
right and not and and even navigating

2926
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:59,039
moments that are scary

2927
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:00,719
and you know really destabilizing to

2928
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:05,118
ordinary people and

2929
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:07,760
um i mean i think you know again

2930
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:09,519
i'm i'm always up kind of at the edge of

2931
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,960
my own capacities here and there

2932
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:12,400
all kinds of things that stress me out

2933
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,359
and worry me and i'm especially

2934
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:14,238
something if it's

2935
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:16,238
you're going to tell me it's something

2936
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:17,039
with you know the health of one of my

2937
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:19,198
kids

2938
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:20,800
you know it's very hard for me like it's

2939
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:21,599
very hard for me to to be truly

2940
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,719
equanimous

2941
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:28,639
around that but equanimity is so

2942
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:29,279
useful the moment you're in in response

2943
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:31,679
mode

2944
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:32,880
right because it's the the the ordinary

2945
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:37,279
experience

2946
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:40,159
for me of responding to what seems like

2947
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:43,439
a medical emergency for one of my kids

2948
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:46,238
is to be obviously super

2949
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:47,839
energized by concern to respond to that

2950
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:50,879
emergency

2951
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,600
but then once i'm responding all of my

2952
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,800
fear

2953
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:56,239
and agitation and worry and oh my god

2954
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:59,440
what if this is really

2955
01:42:56,238 --> 01:43:01,439
something terrible but

2956
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:04,158
finding any of those thoughts compelling

2957
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:05,359
all that only diminishes my capacity as

2958
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:08,158
a father

2959
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:10,079
to be good company while we navigate

2960
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:12,158
this really turbulent

2961
01:43:10,079 --> 01:43:13,679
passage you know as you're saying this

2962
01:43:12,158 --> 01:43:14,559
actually one guy comes to mind which is

2963
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:16,880
elon musk

2964
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,840
one of the really impressive things to

2965
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,079
me was to

2966
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,840
observe how many dramatic things he has

2967
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:23,439
to deal with throughout the day

2968
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:26,560
at work but also if you look through his

2969
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:29,359
life family too

2970
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:30,400
and how he's very much actually as

2971
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:32,559
you're describing

2972
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:34,799
basically a practitioner of this way of

2973
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:38,000
thought which is

2974
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:40,320
you're not in control you're

2975
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,760
basically responding no matter how

2976
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:44,238
traumatic the event and there's no

2977
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:46,000
reason to sort of linger on the

2978
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:48,079
well yeah i think the negative feelings

2979
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,880
are on that well so i mean he but he's

2980
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:52,399
in a very

2981
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:55,359
specific situation which is

2982
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:55,359
which is unlike

2983
01:43:56,238 --> 01:44:00,718
normal life you know even his normal

2984
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:01,439
life but normal life for for most people

2985
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:02,719
because

2986
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:04,399
when you just think of like you know

2987
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,118
he's running so many businesses and he's

2988
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:06,158
he's

2989
01:44:05,118 --> 01:44:08,559
they're very they're not they're

2990
01:44:06,158 --> 01:44:11,279
non-highly non-standard businesses

2991
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:12,400
so what he's seen is everything that

2992
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:14,000
gets to him

2993
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:15,359
is some kind of emergency like it

2994
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,479
wouldn't be getting to him if it needs

2995
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:18,639
his attention

2996
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:20,238
there's a fire somewhere so exactly so

2997
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:23,359
he's constantly responding to

2998
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:25,519
fires that have to be put out so

2999
01:44:23,359 --> 01:44:27,039
there's no default expectation that

3000
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:29,520
there shouldn't be a fire

3001
01:44:27,039 --> 01:44:30,079
right but in our normal lives we live

3002
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,840
most of

3003
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:33,679
most of us who are lucky right not

3004
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,119
everyone obviously on earth but

3005
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:37,039
most of us who are at some kind of

3006
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:39,359
cruising altitude

3007
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:41,039
in terms of our lives where we're

3008
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:43,198
reasonably healthy and that life is

3009
01:44:41,039 --> 01:44:44,880
reasonably orderly and the political

3010
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:46,960
apparatus around us is reasonably

3011
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:49,039
functionable functional

3012
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,480
um functionable so i said functionable

3013
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:51,920
for the first time in my life through no

3014
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:52,959
free will of my own see like i notice

3015
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:55,199
those errors

3016
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,158
and they do not feel like like like

3017
01:44:55,198 --> 01:44:58,559
agency

3018
01:44:56,158 --> 01:45:01,599
and nor does nor does the success of an

3019
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:04,320
utterance feel like agency

3020
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:06,000
he when you're when you're looking at

3021
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:08,719
normal human life

3022
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,439
right where you're you're just trying to

3023
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:12,960
be happy

3024
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:14,559
and healthy and get your work done

3025
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,719
there's this default expectation that

3026
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:18,000
there shouldn't be fires people

3027
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:21,039
shouldn't be getting sick

3028
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,079
or injured you know the the we shouldn't

3029
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:23,920
be losing

3030
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:25,279
vast amounts of our resources we should

3031
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:27,840
like so

3032
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:30,319
when something really stark like that

3033
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,319
happens

3034
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:34,719
people don't have a people don't have

3035
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,158
that muscle

3036
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:38,719
that they've like i've been responding

3037
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:41,839
to emergency emergencies all day long

3038
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:44,000
you know seven days a week in business

3039
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,920
mode and so i have a very thick skin

3040
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,520
this is just another one what was i i'm

3041
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,639
not expecting anything else when i wake

3042
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:52,080
up in the morning

3043
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:53,760
no we have this default sense that

3044
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:55,519
i mean honestly most of us have the

3045
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,360
default sense that we

3046
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:59,520
aren't going to die right or that we

3047
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:02,158
should like maybe we're not going to die

3048
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,800
right like death denial really is a

3049
01:46:02,158 --> 01:46:05,118
thing

3050
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:06,320
you know we're we we're because and you

3051
01:46:05,118 --> 01:46:08,559
can see it

3052
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:09,679
just like i can see when i reach for

3053
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,520
this bottle

3054
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:12,960
that i was expecting it to be solid

3055
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,000
because when it isn't solid when it's a

3056
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:17,198
hologram and i just

3057
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:21,039
my fist closes on itself i'm

3058
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:23,519
damn surprised people are damn surprised

3059
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:24,960
to find out that they're going to die to

3060
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,600
find out that they're sick to find out

3061
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,319
that someone

3062
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,639
that they love has died or is going to

3063
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:31,840
die

3064
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:34,319
so it's like the the fact that we are

3065
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,920
surprised by any of that shows us that

3066
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:41,840
we're we're living at a

3067
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:41,840
uh we're living in a mode that is um

3068
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:47,839
you know we're perpetually diverting

3069
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:50,719
ourselves from some

3070
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,840
facts that should be obvious right and

3071
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:54,000
that

3072
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:56,560
and the more the more salient we can

3073
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
make them uh you know the more

3074
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:00,159
i mean in the case of death it's a

3075
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,439
matter of of being able to get one's

3076
01:47:00,158 --> 01:47:04,319
priorities straight i mean

3077
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:05,359
the moment again this is hard for

3078
01:47:04,319 --> 01:47:06,559
everybody even

3079
01:47:05,359 --> 01:47:08,479
those who are really in the business of

3080
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:11,600
paying attention to it but

3081
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:13,198
the moment you realize that every

3082
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:15,600
circumstance is finite

3083
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:16,559
right you you've got a certain number of

3084
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:19,039
you know you've got whatever

3085
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:21,039
whatever it is 8 000 days left in a

3086
01:47:19,039 --> 01:47:23,920
normal span of life

3087
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:25,439
um and 8 000 is a sounds like a big

3088
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,600
number it's not that big a number

3089
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:29,519
right so it's just like and then you

3090
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,600
then you can decide

3091
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,199
how you want to go through life uh and

3092
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,320
how you want to experience each one of

3093
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:36,879
those days

3094
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:38,960
and so i was back to where our jumping

3095
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,560
off point

3096
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,079
i would argue that you don't want to

3097
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,520
feel

3098
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:48,479
self-hatred ever i i i would argue that

3099
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:48,480
you don't want to

3100
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:51,840
really

3101
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:56,639
really grasp on to any of those moments

3102
01:47:55,198 --> 01:47:58,879
where you where you

3103
01:47:56,639 --> 01:48:00,159
are take or internalizing the fact that

3104
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:01,760
you just made an error

3105
01:48:00,158 --> 01:48:03,599
you embarrassed yourself that something

3106
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,199
didn't go the way you wanted it to

3107
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,880
i think you want to you want to treat

3108
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:08,238
all of those moments very very lightly

3109
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:11,118
you want to extract

3110
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:12,319
the the actionable information it's

3111
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:15,519
something to learn oh

3112
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:18,000
you know i i learned that when i

3113
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:19,600
when i prepare in a certain way it works

3114
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,198
better than i when i prepare in some

3115
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,520
other way or don't prepare right like so

3116
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:24,399
like

3117
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:25,520
yes lesson learned you know and and do

3118
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:28,960
that differently

3119
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:28,960
but um

3120
01:48:29,198 --> 01:48:35,039
yeah i mean so many so many so many of

3121
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:39,840
us have spent so much time

3122
01:48:35,039 --> 01:48:43,679
with a very uh

3123
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:47,039
dysfunctional and hostile and even

3124
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:47,600
hateful inner voice governing a lot of

3125
01:48:47,039 --> 01:48:49,760
our

3126
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:51,760
self-talk and a lot of just just our

3127
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:54,000
default way of being with ourselves i

3128
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:57,119
mean the privacy of our own minds

3129
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:01,359
we're in the company of of a real jerk

3130
01:48:57,118 --> 01:49:03,279
a lot of the time and um

3131
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:04,799
and that that can't help but affect i

3132
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:06,960
mean forget about just your your own

3133
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,719
sense of well-being it can't help

3134
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,399
but limit what you're capable of in the

3135
01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:12,158
world with other people

3136
01:49:10,399 --> 01:49:14,319
i'll have to really think about that i

3137
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:15,039
just take pride that my jerk my inner

3138
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:16,799
voice jerk

3139
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:18,560
is much less of a jerk than like

3140
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:20,560
somebody like david goggins who's like

3141
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:22,480
screaming in his ear constantly so my

3142
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:23,840
i just i have a relativist kind of

3143
01:49:22,479 --> 01:49:25,759
perspective that

3144
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,119
it's not as bad as that at least well

3145
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,960
having a sense of humor

3146
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:30,639
also helps you know it's just like it's

3147
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,520
not the stakes are

3148
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:34,719
never quite what you think they are and

3149
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:38,159
even when they are i mean

3150
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:39,840
just the difference between see

3151
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:41,519
being able to see the comedy of it

3152
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:44,560
rather than because

3153
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:46,320
again there's this sort of dark star of

3154
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:49,360
self-absorption

3155
01:49:46,319 --> 01:49:52,158
that pulls everything into it right and

3156
01:49:49,359 --> 01:49:52,880
it's like if if that that's the that's

3157
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:54,559
the algorithm

3158
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,400
that's the algorithm you don't want to

3159
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:57,760
run so it's like you just want

3160
01:49:56,399 --> 01:50:00,158
you just want things to be good so like

3161
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:02,880
just push push the concern

3162
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:03,920
out there like like the like the not

3163
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:06,400
have the collapse

3164
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,840
of oh my god what does this say about me

3165
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:08,638
it's just like let's what does this say

3166
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,480
about

3167
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:11,920
how do we make this meal that we're all

3168
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:15,039
having together as

3169
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,520
as as fun as pun and as useful as

3170
01:50:15,039 --> 01:50:16,960
possible

3171
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:19,040
and you're saying in terms of propulsion

3172
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,880
systems you recommend humor as a good

3173
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:22,238
spaceship to escape the gravitational

3174
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,239
field of the

3175
01:50:22,238 --> 01:50:25,519
of that darkness well that certainly

3176
01:50:24,238 --> 01:50:27,919
helps yeah yeah yeah

3177
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:29,440
well uh let me ask you a little bit

3178
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:31,840
about ego and fame

3179
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:33,279
which is very interesting the way you're

3180
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:37,119
talking

3181
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:39,759
given that you're one of the

3182
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:40,399
biggest intellects living intellects and

3183
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,239
minds

3184
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:44,319
of our time and there's a lot of people

3185
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:47,919
that really love you

3186
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:49,599
and um almost uh elevate you to a sort

3187
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,560
of certain kind of status where you're

3188
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:51,840
like the guru

3189
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,080
i'm surprised he didn't show up in a

3190
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:57,360
robe in fact um

3191
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:59,198
is there a hoodie that's that's not the

3192
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:01,279
highest status garment one can wear now

3193
01:50:59,198 --> 01:51:04,559
the socially acceptable version of the

3194
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:06,319
of the robe if you're a billionaire

3195
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:09,360
is there something you can say about

3196
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:12,960
managing the effects of fame

3197
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:13,439
on your own mind on the not creating

3198
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,198
this

3199
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:18,000
you know when you wake up in the morning

3200
01:51:15,198 --> 01:51:21,439
when you look about in the mirror

3201
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:24,960
how do you get your ego not to

3202
01:51:21,439 --> 01:51:26,479
grow exponentially your conception of

3203
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:28,639
salt to grow exponentially because

3204
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:30,158
there's so many people feeding that

3205
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:31,679
is there something to be said about this

3206
01:51:30,158 --> 01:51:35,039
it's really not hard

3207
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:38,480
because i mean i i feel like i have a

3208
01:51:35,039 --> 01:51:41,679
pretty clear sense of my strengths

3209
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:43,598
and weaknesses and i i don't feel like

3210
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:45,118
it's

3211
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:48,400
i mean i don't honestly i don't feel

3212
01:51:45,118 --> 01:51:51,359
like i suffer from much grandiosity uh

3213
01:51:48,399 --> 01:51:52,799
i mean i just have a you know there's so

3214
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:53,598
many things i'm not good at there's so

3215
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:56,079
many things i will

3216
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:56,880
you know given the the remaining 8 000

3217
01:51:56,079 --> 01:51:59,920
days

3218
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:01,599
at best i will never get good at

3219
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:03,279
i would love to be good at these things

3220
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:05,360
uh so it's just

3221
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:07,198
it's easy to feel diminished by

3222
01:52:05,359 --> 01:52:09,279
comparison with the

3223
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:11,118
the talents of others do you remind

3224
01:52:09,279 --> 01:52:14,158
yourself of all the things

3225
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:15,598
that you're not competent in

3226
01:52:14,158 --> 01:52:17,198
is that i mean like they're just on

3227
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:18,159
display for me every day that i

3228
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:19,839
appreciate the

3229
01:52:18,158 --> 01:52:22,079
the talents of others but you notice

3230
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,800
them i'm i'm sure stalin and hitler did

3231
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:25,279
not notice

3232
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:26,400
all the ways in which they were uh i

3233
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:28,639
mean this is why

3234
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:30,719
absolute power crap corrupts absolutely

3235
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:33,679
is you stop noticing the things

3236
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:34,079
in which you're ridiculous and wrong

3237
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:37,679
right

3238
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:39,359
yeah no i am not to compare you to yeah

3239
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:40,800
yeah well i'm sure there's an

3240
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:43,118
interstalling in there somewhere

3241
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:45,279
uh well we all hopefully he'll carry a

3242
01:52:43,118 --> 01:52:47,679
babysitter wears better clothes

3243
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:48,960
um and i'm not going to grow that

3244
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:51,199
mustache

3245
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:52,639
those concerns don't map they don't map

3246
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:54,158
on to me for

3247
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:56,239
a bunch of reasons but one is i also

3248
01:52:54,158 --> 01:52:59,679
have a very peculiar audience

3249
01:52:56,238 --> 01:53:01,039
like i i'm just you know

3250
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:04,880
i've been appreciating this for a few

3251
01:53:01,039 --> 01:53:06,079
years but it's it's i'm just now

3252
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:08,079
beginning to understand that there are

3253
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:09,760
many people who have audiences of my

3254
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:11,519
size or larger

3255
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:13,360
that have a very different experience of

3256
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:15,840
having an audience than i do

3257
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:16,960
i have i have curated for better or

3258
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:21,039
worse

3259
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:24,480
a peculiar audience and

3260
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:26,880
the net result of that is

3261
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:28,399
virtually any time i say anything of

3262
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,719
substance

3263
01:53:28,399 --> 01:53:32,719
something like half of my audience my

3264
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:35,359
real audience not haters from outside my

3265
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:38,719
audience but my audience

3266
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:40,960
is just revolts over it right they just

3267
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:42,880
like oh my god i can't believe you said

3268
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,198
like you you're such a schmuck right

3269
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,440
yeah

3270
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:47,118
they revolt with rigor and intellectual

3271
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:49,759
sophistication

3272
01:53:47,118 --> 01:53:51,439
or not or not but i mean but it's like

3273
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:53,360
but but people who are like so

3274
01:53:51,439 --> 01:53:55,118
i mean the clearest case is you know i

3275
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:55,839
haven't have whatever audience i have

3276
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:58,158
and then trump

3277
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:59,119
appears on the scene and i discover that

3278
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:02,238
something like 20

3279
01:53:59,118 --> 01:54:04,238
of my audience just went straight to

3280
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:06,079
trump and couldn't believe i didn't

3281
01:54:04,238 --> 01:54:07,598
follow them there they were just aghast

3282
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:10,719
that i didn't see that trump was

3283
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:13,679
obviously exactly what we needed for

3284
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:14,880
for uh to steer the ship of state for

3285
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:18,399
the next four years

3286
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:20,960
uh and then four years beyond that so

3287
01:54:18,399 --> 01:54:22,000
like so that's one example so if so

3288
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:24,800
whenever i said anything

3289
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,560
about trump i would hear from people who

3290
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:28,880
loved more or less everything else i was

3291
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:32,159
up to and had for years

3292
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:34,400
but everything i said about trump just

3293
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:36,079
gave me pure pain from this this

3294
01:54:34,399 --> 01:54:38,158
quadrant of my audience

3295
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:39,118
but then saying the same thing happens

3296
01:54:38,158 --> 01:54:41,198
when i say

3297
01:54:39,118 --> 01:54:43,039
something about the derangement of the

3298
01:54:41,198 --> 01:54:46,399
far left anything i say about

3299
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:48,560
wokeness right or identity politics

3300
01:54:46,399 --> 01:54:49,439
same kind of punishment signal from us

3301
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:51,760
again

3302
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:53,439
people who are core to my audience like

3303
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:56,000
i've read all i read all your books

3304
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:56,559
i'm using your meditation app i love

3305
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,880
what you

3306
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:00,560
say about science and but you are so

3307
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:01,679
wrong about politics and you're

3308
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,039
you know i'm starting to think you're a

3309
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:04,079
racist [ __ ] for everything you said

3310
01:55:03,039 --> 01:55:07,760
about about

3311
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:09,920
identity politics and there's so many

3312
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,880
the free will topic is just like this

3313
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:13,520
it's like

3314
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:15,679
just they love what i'm saying about

3315
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:17,679
consciousness and the mind and they love

3316
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:18,880
to hear me talk about physics with

3317
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:21,840
physicists and

3318
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:24,079
it's all good this free will stuff is i

3319
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,599
cannot believe you don't see how wrong

3320
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:26,719
you are what a [ __ ] embarrassment you

3321
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:29,360
are

3322
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:30,239
so but i'm starting to notice that there

3323
01:55:29,359 --> 01:55:32,799
are other people

3324
01:55:30,238 --> 01:55:34,879
who don't have this experience of having

3325
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,520
an audience because they have

3326
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:39,039
just take the trump woke dichotomy they

3327
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:41,679
just

3328
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:42,960
castigated trump the same way i did but

3329
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:44,719
they never say anything

3330
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:46,399
bad about the far left so they never get

3331
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:47,439
this punishment signal or they or you

3332
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:51,519
flip it they

3333
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:54,238
they they're all about the insanity of

3334
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:56,639
critical race theory now they'll they we

3335
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:59,359
we connect all those dots the same way

3336
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:00,319
but they never really specified what was

3337
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:01,920
wrong with trump

3338
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:03,439
or they thought there was a lot right

3339
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,520
with trump and they they

3340
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:07,678
got all the pleasure of that and so they

3341
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:10,880
have much more homogenized

3342
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:12,880
audiences and so my

3343
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:14,000
my experience is so just to come back to

3344
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:16,480
you know this experience

3345
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,079
of fame or quasi fame i mean it's true

3346
01:56:16,479 --> 01:56:21,198
and truth is not

3347
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:22,238
real fame but it's it's still there's an

3348
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:25,439
audience there

3349
01:56:22,238 --> 01:56:29,519
um it is a

3350
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:32,158
it's now an experience where basically

3351
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,960
whatever i put out i notice a ton of

3352
01:56:32,158 --> 01:56:36,559
negativity

3353
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:38,639
coming back at me and

3354
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:40,159
it just it is what it is i mean now now

3355
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:41,920
it's like i used to think

3356
01:56:40,158 --> 01:56:43,839
wait a minute there's got to be some way

3357
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:45,599
for me to communicate more clearly here

3358
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:49,760
so as not to get

3359
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:51,360
this kind of lunatic response

3360
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:53,840
from my own audience from like people

3361
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:56,319
who are who are showing all the signs of

3362
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:58,880
of of we've been here for years for a

3363
01:56:56,319 --> 01:57:01,279
reason right these are not just trolls

3364
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:02,960
and so i think okay i'm going to take 10

3365
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:06,158
more minutes and really just

3366
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:07,520
tell you what it should be absolutely

3367
01:57:06,158 --> 01:57:09,839
clear about what's wrong with trump

3368
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:11,520
right i've done this a few times but i

3369
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:13,920
got i think i got to do this again

3370
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,880
or wait a minute how are they not

3371
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:17,440
getting

3372
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:19,039
that these episodes of police violence

3373
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:19,598
are so obviously different from one

3374
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:22,960
another

3375
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:25,440
that you can't describe all of them to

3376
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:26,399
know yet another racist maniac on the

3377
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:27,919
police force

3378
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:30,399
you know killing someone based on his

3379
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,399
racism

3380
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:34,239
last time i talked spoke about this it

3381
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:36,239
was pure pain but i

3382
01:57:34,238 --> 01:57:38,079
just got to try again now at a certain

3383
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:41,439
point i i mean i'm starting to feel

3384
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:43,679
like all right i just i have to be

3385
01:57:41,439 --> 01:57:45,359
i have to cease again it comes back to

3386
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:46,158
this expectation that there shouldn't be

3387
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:48,000
fires

3388
01:57:46,158 --> 01:57:49,759
right like i feel like if i could just

3389
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,719
play my game

3390
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:54,079
impeccably the people who actually care

3391
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:57,279
what i think

3392
01:57:54,079 --> 01:57:59,760
will follow me when i

3393
01:57:57,279 --> 01:58:01,118
hit trump and hit free will and hit the

3394
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:02,560
woke and hit

3395
01:58:01,118 --> 01:58:04,238
whatever it is what how we should

3396
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,280
respond to the coronavirus you know i

3397
01:58:04,238 --> 01:58:07,198
mean

3398
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:09,679
vaccines you know are they a thing right

3399
01:58:07,198 --> 01:58:13,198
like there's such derangement

3400
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:14,880
in in our information space now that

3401
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:16,079
i mean i guess you know some people

3402
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:18,480
could be getting more of this than i

3403
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:20,238
expect but i i just noticed that

3404
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:22,079
you know many of our our friends who are

3405
01:58:20,238 --> 01:58:24,238
in the same game

3406
01:58:22,079 --> 01:58:25,198
have more homogenized audiences and

3407
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:27,279
don't get i mean

3408
01:58:25,198 --> 01:58:29,279
they've they've successfully filtered

3409
01:58:27,279 --> 01:58:32,639
out the people who are going to

3410
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:35,118
despise them on this next topic and i

3411
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:36,480
you know i would i would imagine you are

3412
01:58:35,118 --> 01:58:38,719
have a different experience of having a

3413
01:58:36,479 --> 01:58:39,359
podcast than i do at this point i'm sure

3414
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:43,118
you get

3415
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:45,679
haters but i would imagine you're uh

3416
01:58:43,118 --> 01:58:49,039
you're more streamlined i actually don't

3417
01:58:45,679 --> 01:58:52,239
like the word haters because it kind of

3418
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:55,039
presumes that it puts people in a bin

3419
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:56,799
i think we're all have like baby haters

3420
01:58:55,039 --> 01:58:57,840
inside of us and we just apply them and

3421
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:00,400
some people

3422
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:01,760
enjoy doing that more than others for

3423
01:59:00,399 --> 01:59:04,000
particular periods of time

3424
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:05,679
i think you're gonna almost see hating

3425
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,560
on the internet as a video game that you

3426
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:07,920
just play

3427
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:10,480
and it's fun but then you can put it

3428
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:11,920
down and walk away and uh no

3429
01:59:10,479 --> 01:59:13,519
i i certainly have a bunch of people

3430
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:15,279
that are very critical i can

3431
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:17,199
list all the ways but does it feel like

3432
01:59:15,279 --> 01:59:17,840
it on any given topic does it feel like

3433
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:20,799
it's

3434
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:21,840
an actual title surge where it's like 30

3435
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:24,639
of your audience

3436
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:25,840
and then the other 30 of your audience

3437
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:29,039
from podcast to podcast

3438
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:30,880
no that's happening to me all the time

3439
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:32,079
now well i'm more with uh

3440
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:34,480
i don't know what you think about this i

3441
01:59:32,079 --> 01:59:37,679
mean joe rogan doesn't read

3442
01:59:34,479 --> 01:59:42,238
comments or doesn't mean comments much

3443
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:46,639
and the argument he made to me is that

3444
01:59:42,238 --> 01:59:49,759
he already has an like a self-critical

3445
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:50,960
person inside like and i i i'm gonna

3446
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,320
have to think about what you said in

3447
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:55,520
this conversation but i have this

3448
01:59:52,319 --> 01:59:58,158
very harshly self-critical person inside

3449
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:59,679
as well where i don't need more fuel i

3450
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:01,920
don't need

3451
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:03,520
there i know i do sometimes that's why i

3452
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:06,319
check negativity

3453
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:07,199
occasionally not too often i sometimes

3454
02:00:06,319 --> 02:00:09,039
need to like

3455
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:11,439
put a little bit more like coals into

3456
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:13,519
the fire but not too much

3457
02:00:11,439 --> 02:00:15,039
uh but i already have that self-critical

3458
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:17,599
engine that keeps me in check

3459
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:18,319
i just i wonder uh you know a lot of

3460
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:22,000
people who

3461
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:24,158
gain more and more fame lose that um

3462
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,760
that ability to be self-critical i i

3463
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:28,399
guess because they lose the audience

3464
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:30,719
that can be critical towards them

3465
02:00:28,399 --> 02:00:32,399
you know i do follow joe's advice much

3466
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:34,158
more than i ever have here like i i

3467
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:35,359
don't look at comments very often and

3468
02:00:34,158 --> 02:00:39,039
i'm probably using

3469
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:41,679
twitter you know

3470
02:00:39,039 --> 02:00:43,519
five percent as much as i used to i mean

3471
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:46,079
i really just get in and out on twitter

3472
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:47,119
um and spend very little time in my ad

3473
02:00:46,079 --> 02:00:50,158
mentions

3474
02:00:47,118 --> 02:00:51,359
um i but you know it does it in some

3475
02:00:50,158 --> 02:00:53,359
ways it feels like a loss because

3476
02:00:51,359 --> 02:00:55,839
occasionally i get i see something

3477
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:57,598
super intelligent there like i mean i'll

3478
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,719
check my twitter ad mentions and someone

3479
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:00,239
will have said

3480
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:01,920
oh have you read this article and it's

3481
02:01:00,238 --> 02:01:03,439
like man that was just

3482
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,679
that was like the best article sent to

3483
02:01:03,439 --> 02:01:07,279
me in in a month right so it's like to

3484
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:08,239
have not have looked and to not have

3485
02:01:07,279 --> 02:01:11,840
seen that

3486
02:01:08,238 --> 02:01:13,439
that's um that's a loss so but it does

3487
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:14,880
um

3488
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:16,879
at this point a little goes a long way

3489
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:20,480
because i yeah it's not um

3490
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:22,960
it's not that it for me

3491
02:01:20,479 --> 02:01:23,678
now i mean this this could sound like a

3492
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:26,800
fairly

3493
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:29,279
stalinistic immunity to criticism it's

3494
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:33,039
not so much that these voices of hate

3495
02:01:29,279 --> 02:01:35,759
turn on my inner hater you know more

3496
02:01:33,039 --> 02:01:36,479
it's more that i just i get a what i

3497
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:39,520
fear is a

3498
02:01:36,479 --> 02:01:41,678
false sense of

3499
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:43,040
humanity like that like like i feel like

3500
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:44,639
i'm too online

3501
02:01:43,039 --> 02:01:46,399
and online is selecting for this

3502
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,840
performative outrage in everybody

3503
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:50,238
everyone's you know signaling to an

3504
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:53,279
audience when they trash you

3505
02:01:50,238 --> 02:01:58,000
and i get a dar i'm getting a

3506
02:01:53,279 --> 02:02:00,639
you know a misanthropic

3507
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,118
you know cut of of just what it's like

3508
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:02,960
out there

3509
02:02:01,118 --> 02:02:05,519
and because when you meet people in real

3510
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:08,079
life they're great you know they're all

3511
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:09,040
rather often great you know and um it

3512
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:12,158
takes a lot

3513
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:14,399
to have anything like a twitter

3514
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:15,439
encounter in real life with a living

3515
02:02:14,399 --> 02:02:19,359
person

3516
02:02:15,439 --> 02:02:22,638
um and that's i i think it's much better

3517
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:24,079
to to have that as one's

3518
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:26,560
default sense of what it's like to be

3519
02:02:24,079 --> 02:02:29,279
with people than what one gets on

3520
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:30,400
on social media or in on youtube common

3521
02:02:29,279 --> 02:02:32,479
threads

3522
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:36,158
you've produced a special episode with

3523
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:38,238
uh rob reed on your podcast recently

3524
02:02:36,158 --> 02:02:40,399
on how bioengineering of viruses is

3525
02:02:38,238 --> 02:02:43,439
going to destroy human civilization

3526
02:02:40,399 --> 02:02:46,638
so uh or could could one clears

3527
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:49,439
sorry the confidence there but in the

3528
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:50,400
21st century what do you think

3529
02:02:49,439 --> 02:02:53,519
especially after

3530
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:56,000
having thought through that angle

3531
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,719
what do you think is the biggest threat

3532
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:00,719
to

3533
02:02:56,719 --> 02:03:02,480
the survival of the human species

3534
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:05,279
i can give you the full menu if you'd

3535
02:03:02,479 --> 02:03:08,718
like yeah well no i i would i would put

3536
02:03:05,279 --> 02:03:11,279
i would put the biggest threat at the

3537
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:13,359
at another level out kind of the meta

3538
02:03:11,279 --> 02:03:16,719
threat is

3539
02:03:13,359 --> 02:03:19,198
our inability to agree

3540
02:03:16,719 --> 02:03:19,760
about what the threats actually are and

3541
02:03:19,198 --> 02:03:23,279
and

3542
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:24,480
and to converge on strategies for

3543
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:27,599
responding to them

3544
02:03:24,479 --> 02:03:29,759
right so like i view covet as among

3545
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:33,520
other things

3546
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:36,400
a truly terrifyingly f

3547
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:36,880
failed dress rehearsal for something far

3548
02:03:36,399 --> 02:03:39,920
worse

3549
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:41,440
right covet is just about as benign as

3550
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:44,560
it could have been

3551
02:03:41,439 --> 02:03:45,598
and still have been worse than the flu

3552
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:48,079
when you're talking about a global

3553
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:50,560
pandemic right it's just it's

3554
02:03:48,078 --> 02:03:51,439
you know it's going to kill a few

3555
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,800
million people

3556
02:03:51,439 --> 02:03:54,960
or it looks like it's killed about three

3557
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:57,520
million people maybe it'll kill

3558
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:58,639
a few million more unless something gets

3559
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:01,119
away from us with a

3560
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:02,800
variant that's that's much worse or we

3561
02:04:01,118 --> 02:04:07,198
really don't play our cards right but

3562
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:10,079
um i mean the general shape of it is

3563
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:11,118
it's got you know somewhere around well

3564
02:04:10,078 --> 02:04:15,198
one percent

3565
02:04:11,118 --> 02:04:15,198
lethality and

3566
02:04:16,078 --> 02:04:19,118
whatever side of that number it really

3567
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:22,239
is on in the end

3568
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:24,639
it's not uh what

3569
02:04:22,238 --> 02:04:26,479
would in fact be possible and is in fact

3570
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:28,159
probably inevitable

3571
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:29,598
something with you know orders of

3572
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:32,158
magnitude uh

3573
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:33,599
more lethality than that and it's just

3574
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:36,638
so obvious we are

3575
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:39,679
totally unprepared right we are we are

3576
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:40,000
running this epidemiological experiment

3577
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:41,679
of

3578
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,118
linking the entire world together and

3579
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:46,960
then also

3580
02:04:43,118 --> 02:04:49,598
now per the podcast that rob reed did

3581
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:50,880
uh democratizing the tech that will

3582
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:54,480
allow us to do this

3583
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:57,039
to engineer pandemics right and some

3584
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:57,839
more and more people will be able to

3585
02:04:57,039 --> 02:05:01,039
engineer

3586
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:04,159
synthetic viruses that will be

3587
02:05:01,039 --> 02:05:05,599
uh by the sheer fact that they would

3588
02:05:04,158 --> 02:05:06,638
have been engineered with malicious

3589
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:09,920
intent

3590
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:11,920
you know worse than covid and we're

3591
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:12,719
still living in a in you know to speak

3592
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,520
specifically about

3593
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:17,760
the united states we have a country here

3594
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:19,679
where we can't even agree

3595
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:21,119
that this is a thing like that that

3596
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:22,000
coveted i mean there's still people who

3597
02:05:21,118 --> 02:05:24,158
think that this is

3598
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,198
basically a hoax designed to control

3599
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:28,960
people

3600
02:05:25,198 --> 02:05:30,238
uh and it's stranger still there are

3601
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:33,279
people who

3602
02:05:30,238 --> 02:05:35,118
will acknowledge that covet is real and

3603
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:37,599
they'll look the they don't think the

3604
02:05:35,118 --> 02:05:41,359
deaths have been faked or mis

3605
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:41,360
ascribed um

3606
02:05:42,639 --> 02:05:48,078
but they think that it

3607
02:05:46,158 --> 02:05:49,439
that they're far happier the prospect of

3608
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:52,639
catching covid

3609
02:05:49,439 --> 02:05:53,919
than they are of getting vaccinated

3610
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:55,118
for covet right they're not worried

3611
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:56,960
about covert they're worried about

3612
02:05:55,118 --> 02:05:59,359
vaccines for covet right

3613
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:00,078
and the fact that we just can't converge

3614
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:02,319
in a

3615
02:06:00,078 --> 02:06:03,840
conversation that it has we've now had a

3616
02:06:02,319 --> 02:06:06,719
year to

3617
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:07,840
to have with one another on just what is

3618
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:11,760
the ground truth here

3619
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:14,480
how what's happened why has it happened

3620
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:14,800
what's the how safe is it to get covered

3621
02:06:14,479 --> 02:06:16,479
at

3622
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:19,199
uh you know every you know in every

3623
02:06:16,479 --> 02:06:21,359
cohort in the population

3624
02:06:19,198 --> 02:06:22,399
and how safe are the vaccines and the

3625
02:06:21,359 --> 02:06:24,719
fact that there's still

3626
02:06:22,399 --> 02:06:26,000
a an air of mystery around all of this

3627
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:29,520
for

3628
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,880
much of our society does not bode well

3629
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:32,880
when you're talking about solving any

3630
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:34,480
other problem that may yet kill us but

3631
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:36,159
do you think convergence grows when the

3632
02:06:34,479 --> 02:06:39,359
magnitude is a threat

3633
02:06:36,158 --> 02:06:39,679
so it's possible except i feel like we

3634
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:42,719
have

3635
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:43,599
tipped into because when when the threat

3636
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:46,399
of covet

3637
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:48,719
looked the most dire right when we had

3638
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:50,238
when we were seeing reports from italy

3639
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:51,679
that looked like you know the beginning

3640
02:06:50,238 --> 02:06:52,718
of a zombie movie right because it could

3641
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:55,039
have been much much worse

3642
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:57,198
yeah like this is like this is lethal

3643
02:06:55,039 --> 02:07:00,158
right like your icus are gonna fill up

3644
02:06:57,198 --> 02:07:01,279
in like you're 14 days behind us you're

3645
02:07:00,158 --> 02:07:03,679
going to cr

3646
02:07:01,279 --> 02:07:04,800
your medical system is is in danger of

3647
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:08,319
collapse

3648
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:11,599
lock the [ __ ] down we have people

3649
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:13,198
refusing to to do anything sane

3650
02:07:11,599 --> 02:07:14,800
in the face of that like and people

3651
02:07:13,198 --> 02:07:16,638
fundamentally thinking

3652
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:18,159
it's not going to get here right like or

3653
02:07:16,639 --> 02:07:19,599
that's who knows what's going on in

3654
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:21,359
italy but it has no implications for

3655
02:07:19,599 --> 02:07:23,840
what's going to go on in new york

3656
02:07:21,359 --> 02:07:25,439
in a mere six days right and now it

3657
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:26,560
kicks off in new york

3658
02:07:25,439 --> 02:07:29,439
and you got people in the middle of the

3659
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:32,000
country thinking

3660
02:07:29,439 --> 02:07:32,638
it's no factor it's not it's that's just

3661
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,560
big city

3662
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:35,920
those are big city problems or they're

3663
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:40,000
faking it or

3664
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:43,359
i mean it just the layer of politics

3665
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:47,520
has become so dysfunctional for us that

3666
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:49,598
even in even in what in the presence of

3667
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:51,119
a pandemic that looked legitimately

3668
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:52,239
scary there in the beginning i mean

3669
02:07:51,118 --> 02:07:53,598
it's not to say that it hasn't been

3670
02:07:52,238 --> 02:07:55,118
devastating for everyone who's been

3671
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:56,719
directly affected by it and

3672
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:58,799
it's not said to say it can't get worse

3673
02:07:56,719 --> 02:08:00,319
but here you know for a very long time

3674
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:02,079
we have known

3675
02:08:00,319 --> 02:08:03,599
that we were we're in a situation that

3676
02:08:02,078 --> 02:08:06,000
is more benign

3677
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:07,199
than the what's what seemed like the

3678
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,279
worst case scenario

3679
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:10,238
as it was kicking off especially in

3680
02:08:09,279 --> 02:08:13,359
italy

3681
02:08:10,238 --> 02:08:15,839
um and

3682
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:17,598
so still yeah it's quite possible that

3683
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:19,520
if we saw the asteroid

3684
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:20,960
hurtling toward earth and you know

3685
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:23,040
everyone agreed that

3686
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:25,039
it's going to it's going to make impact

3687
02:08:23,039 --> 02:08:27,760
and we're all going to die

3688
02:08:25,039 --> 02:08:28,399
then we could get off twitter and

3689
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:30,320
actually

3690
02:08:28,399 --> 02:08:32,319
you know build the the rockets that are

3691
02:08:30,319 --> 02:08:33,920
going to divert the you know divert the

3692
02:08:32,319 --> 02:08:36,559
asteroid from its

3693
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:38,800
earth crossing path and we could do

3694
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:41,760
something pretty heroic but

3695
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:43,599
when you talk about anything else that

3696
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:47,039
isn't

3697
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:47,840
um that's slower moving than that i mean

3698
02:08:47,039 --> 02:08:49,439
something like

3699
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:51,199
climate change i think there's i think

3700
02:08:49,439 --> 02:08:54,319
the prospect of

3701
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:56,399
of our converging

3702
02:08:54,319 --> 02:08:58,799
on a solution to climate change purely

3703
02:08:56,399 --> 02:09:00,719
based on political persuasion

3704
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:02,000
is non-existent at this point i just

3705
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:04,158
think that

3706
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,920
i mean you know to bring elon back into

3707
02:09:04,158 --> 02:09:07,039
this the way to deal with climate change

3708
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:09,599
is to

3709
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:10,639
create technology that everyone wants

3710
02:09:09,599 --> 02:09:13,119
that is better

3711
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:14,400
than all the the the carbon producing

3712
02:09:13,118 --> 02:09:16,799
technology

3713
02:09:14,399 --> 02:09:18,479
and then we just transition because you

3714
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:20,000
want you want an

3715
02:09:18,479 --> 02:09:22,559
electric car the same way you wanted a

3716
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,319
smartphone or you want anything else

3717
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:25,840
and you're working totally with the

3718
02:09:24,319 --> 02:09:28,880
grain of people's

3719
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:30,880
selfishness and short-term thinking

3720
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:33,039
the idea that we're going to convince

3721
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:35,440
the better part of humanity

3722
02:09:33,039 --> 02:09:37,039
that climate change is an emergency that

3723
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:40,399
they have to make sacrifices

3724
02:09:37,039 --> 02:09:42,880
to respond to given what's happened

3725
02:09:40,399 --> 02:09:46,238
around covet i just think that's

3726
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:48,960
that's a fantasy of a fantasy

3727
02:09:46,238 --> 02:09:50,638
but speaking of elon i have a bunch of

3728
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:52,319
positive things that i want to say

3729
02:09:50,639 --> 02:09:54,239
here in response to you but you're

3730
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:57,679
opening so many threads but let me pull

3731
02:09:54,238 --> 02:10:01,279
one of them which is uh ai

3732
02:09:57,679 --> 02:10:02,960
both you and and uh elon

3733
02:10:01,279 --> 02:10:04,639
think that with ai you're summoning

3734
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:06,158
demons

3735
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:08,319
summoning a demon maybe not in those

3736
02:10:06,158 --> 02:10:12,839
poetic terms but

3737
02:10:08,319 --> 02:10:17,039
well potentially potentially two very

3738
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:19,840
three very parsimonious assumptions

3739
02:10:17,039 --> 02:10:20,479
i think here scientifically parsimonious

3740
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:24,960
assumptions

3741
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:27,039
get me there um

3742
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:28,000
any of which could be wrong but it just

3743
02:10:27,039 --> 02:10:30,719
it seems like the

3744
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,439
the weight of the the evidence is on

3745
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:33,920
their side

3746
02:10:31,439 --> 02:10:34,879
one is that it comes back to this topic

3747
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:37,199
of of

3748
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:38,800
substrate independence right anyone

3749
02:10:37,198 --> 02:10:41,279
who's in the business of

3750
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:43,119
producing intelligent machines must

3751
02:10:41,279 --> 02:10:45,599
believe

3752
02:10:43,118 --> 02:10:47,439
ultimately that there's nothing magical

3753
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:50,159
about having a computer made of meat

3754
02:10:47,439 --> 02:10:51,118
you can do this in the kinds of you know

3755
02:10:50,158 --> 02:10:54,559
materials where

3756
02:10:51,118 --> 02:10:57,279
we're using now and

3757
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:58,639
there's no special something that's that

3758
02:10:57,279 --> 02:11:00,960
that

3759
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:01,840
that presents a a real impediment to

3760
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:05,760
producing

3761
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:07,520
human level intelligence in silico right

3762
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:08,719
again an assumption either i'm sure

3763
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:10,480
there are a few people who still think

3764
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:14,000
there is something magical about

3765
02:11:10,479 --> 02:11:16,799
you know biological systems but

3766
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,800
leave that aside

3767
02:11:18,639 --> 02:11:21,840
given that assumption and given the

3768
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:24,000
assumption that we

3769
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:25,440
just continue making incremental

3770
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:27,198
progress it doesn't have to be moore's

3771
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:28,879
law it just has to be progress that just

3772
02:11:27,198 --> 02:11:32,638
doesn't stop

3773
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:34,800
at a certain point we'll get to the to

3774
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:36,400
human level intelligence and beyond and

3775
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:38,880
human level intelligence

3776
02:11:36,399 --> 02:11:40,399
i think is also clearly a mirage because

3777
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:43,118
anything that's human level

3778
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:45,279
is going to be superhuman by unless we

3779
02:11:43,118 --> 02:11:46,880
decide to dumb it down right i mean

3780
02:11:45,279 --> 02:11:48,800
my phone is already superhuman as a

3781
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:51,599
calculator right so why would we make

3782
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:52,079
the human level ai you know just as good

3783
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:55,920
as me

3784
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:58,319
a as a calculator so i think we'll

3785
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:59,279
we'll very if we continue to make

3786
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:02,479
progress

3787
02:11:59,279 --> 02:12:05,519
we will be in the presence of superhuman

3788
02:12:02,479 --> 02:12:09,039
competence for any

3789
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:11,360
act of intelligence or cognition

3790
02:12:09,039 --> 02:12:12,319
that we care to prioritize it's not to

3791
02:12:11,359 --> 02:12:13,759
say that we

3792
02:12:12,319 --> 02:12:15,359
will create everything that a human

3793
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:16,320
could do maybe we'll leave certain

3794
02:12:15,359 --> 02:12:18,880
things out

3795
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:20,158
but anything that we care about and we

3796
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:21,520
care about a lot

3797
02:12:20,158 --> 02:12:23,519
uh and we certainly care about anything

3798
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:25,760
that that produces a lot of

3799
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:27,280
power you know that we care about

3800
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:29,920
scientific insights and

3801
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:31,279
and inability to produce new technology

3802
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:32,840
and all of that

3803
02:12:31,279 --> 02:12:35,920
um we'll have something that's

3804
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:39,279
superhuman and then that

3805
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:42,639
the final assumption is just that

3806
02:12:39,279 --> 02:12:45,439
there have to be ways to do that

3807
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:46,480
that are not aligned with a happy

3808
02:12:45,439 --> 02:12:49,519
coexistence

3809
02:12:46,479 --> 02:12:52,078
with these now more powerful

3810
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:53,360
entities than ourselves so and and i

3811
02:12:52,078 --> 02:12:55,118
would

3812
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:57,039
i would guess and this is a you know

3813
02:12:55,118 --> 02:12:58,960
kind of a rider to that assumption

3814
02:12:57,039 --> 02:13:00,560
there are probably more ways to do it

3815
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:03,920
badly than to do it

3816
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:07,119
perfectly that is perfectly aligned

3817
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:09,359
with our well-being and

3818
02:13:07,118 --> 02:13:10,799
when you think about the consequences of

3819
02:13:09,359 --> 02:13:14,238
of non-alignment

3820
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:16,079
when you think about you're now

3821
02:13:14,238 --> 02:13:18,158
in the presence of something that is

3822
02:13:16,078 --> 02:13:19,840
more intelligent than you are

3823
02:13:18,158 --> 02:13:22,000
right which is to say more competent

3824
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:24,800
right unless you've and and

3825
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:26,078
obviously there are cartoon pictures of

3826
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:27,520
this where we could just you know

3827
02:13:26,078 --> 02:13:28,719
this is just an off switch we can just

3828
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:30,159
turn off the off switch or they're

3829
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:32,960
tethered to something that that

3830
02:13:30,158 --> 02:13:34,238
makes them you know are slaves in

3831
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:36,078
perpetuity even though they're more

3832
02:13:34,238 --> 02:13:38,158
intelligent but

3833
02:13:36,078 --> 02:13:39,759
that that strike those scenarios strike

3834
02:13:38,158 --> 02:13:41,519
me as a failure to imagine

3835
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:43,119
what is actually entailed by greater

3836
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:44,320
intelligence right so if you imagine

3837
02:13:43,118 --> 02:13:46,078
something that's

3838
02:13:44,319 --> 02:13:47,679
legitimately more intelligent than you

3839
02:13:46,078 --> 02:13:50,399
are

3840
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:51,199
and you're now in relationship to it

3841
02:13:50,399 --> 02:13:52,719
right

3842
02:13:51,198 --> 02:13:54,719
you're in the presence of this thing and

3843
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:56,158
it is autonomous in all kinds of ways

3844
02:13:54,719 --> 02:13:57,279
because it had to be to be more

3845
02:13:56,158 --> 02:13:58,238
intelligent than you are i mean you

3846
02:13:57,279 --> 02:14:01,840
built it to be

3847
02:13:58,238 --> 02:14:03,799
to be all of those things

3848
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:05,520
we just can't find ourselves in a

3849
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:07,039
negotiation

3850
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:08,560
with something more intelligent than we

3851
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:11,679
are you know and we can't

3852
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:14,480
er so we have to have found the the

3853
02:14:11,679 --> 02:14:16,078
the subset of ways to build this these

3854
02:14:14,479 --> 02:14:19,678
machines

3855
02:14:16,078 --> 02:14:23,039
that are that are perpetually amenable

3856
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:24,399
to are saying oh

3857
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:26,078
that's not what we meant that's not what

3858
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:28,000
we intended could you stop doing that

3859
02:14:26,078 --> 02:14:29,279
come back over here and do this thing

3860
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,118
that we actually want

3861
02:14:29,279 --> 02:14:32,880
and for them to care for them to be

3862
02:14:31,118 --> 02:14:34,960
tethered to our own sense of our own

3863
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:37,599
well-being

3864
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:38,639
uh such that you know i mean their

3865
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:40,400
utility function

3866
02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:42,319
is you know their primary utility

3867
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:42,638
function is for is to have you know this

3868
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:45,920
is

3869
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:49,279
i think stuart russell's uh

3870
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:52,560
you know cartoon uh

3871
02:14:49,279 --> 02:14:54,319
plan is to figure out how to to tether

3872
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:57,760
them to a utility function that

3873
02:14:54,319 --> 02:14:59,679
that has our own estimation

3874
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:01,840
of what's going to improve our

3875
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:05,118
well-being as its

3876
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:06,880
master you know reward

3877
02:15:05,118 --> 02:15:08,639
right so it's like that all that this

3878
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:09,920
this thing can get as intelligent as it

3879
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:12,400
can get

3880
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:14,158
but it it only ever really wants to

3881
02:15:12,399 --> 02:15:15,920
figure out how to make our lives better

3882
02:15:14,158 --> 02:15:17,359
by our own view of better

3883
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:19,118
now not to say there wouldn't be a

3884
02:15:17,359 --> 02:15:20,639
conversation about

3885
02:15:19,118 --> 02:15:22,719
you know i mean because of all kinds of

3886
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:23,440
things we're not seeing clearly about

3887
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:25,439
what

3888
02:15:23,439 --> 02:15:27,439
what is better and if we were in the

3889
02:15:25,439 --> 02:15:29,118
presence of a genie or an oracle

3890
02:15:27,439 --> 02:15:31,279
that could really tell us what is better

3891
02:15:29,118 --> 02:15:32,719
well then we should we presumably would

3892
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:33,439
want to hear that and we would modify

3893
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:37,679
our sense of

3894
02:15:33,439 --> 02:15:40,479
of of uh what to do next

3895
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:42,078
in conversation with these with these uh

3896
02:15:40,479 --> 02:15:44,078
minds but

3897
02:15:42,078 --> 02:15:46,559
i just feel like it is a failure of

3898
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:51,039
imagination

3899
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:53,679
uh to think that

3900
02:15:51,039 --> 02:15:55,118
being in relationship in relationship to

3901
02:15:53,679 --> 02:15:58,239
something

3902
02:15:55,118 --> 02:16:02,479
more intelligent than yourself isn't in

3903
02:15:58,238 --> 02:16:05,519
most cases a circumstance of real

3904
02:16:02,479 --> 02:16:06,399
peril because because it is in in every

3905
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:09,280
like just to think of

3906
02:16:06,399 --> 02:16:09,920
think of how everything on earth has to

3907
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:11,118
if

3908
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:12,960
they could think about their

3909
02:16:11,118 --> 02:16:13,920
relationship to us if birds could think

3910
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:18,158
about

3911
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:21,359
what we're doing right they would

3912
02:16:18,158 --> 02:16:24,638
i mean the bottom line is

3913
02:16:21,359 --> 02:16:26,880
they're always in danger of our

3914
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:28,960
discovering that there's something we

3915
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:31,118
care about more than birds

3916
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:32,558
right or there's something we want that

3917
02:16:31,118 --> 02:16:35,519
disregards the

3918
02:16:32,558 --> 02:16:36,000
the well-being of birds and and you know

3919
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:37,439
obviously

3920
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,799
much of our behavior is inscrutable to

3921
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:40,639
them occasionally we pay attention to

3922
02:16:38,799 --> 02:16:41,518
them and occasionally we withdraw our

3923
02:16:40,638 --> 02:16:42,959
attention

3924
02:16:41,519 --> 02:16:44,318
and occasionally we just kill them all

3925
02:16:42,959 --> 02:16:45,438
for reasons they can't possibly

3926
02:16:44,318 --> 02:16:47,599
understand

3927
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:49,200
but we're if we're building something

3928
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:51,599
more intelligent than ourselves by

3929
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:54,800
definition we're building something

3930
02:16:51,599 --> 02:16:58,478
whose horizons of value

3931
02:16:54,799 --> 02:17:02,000
and and cognition can

3932
02:16:58,478 --> 02:17:03,599
exceed our own and and in ways where we

3933
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:07,120
can't

3934
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:09,280
necessarily foresee again perpetually

3935
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:12,319
that they don't just wake up one day and

3936
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:15,760
decide oh this these humans

3937
02:17:12,318 --> 02:17:16,638
need to disappear so i think i agree

3938
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:19,840
with

3939
02:17:16,638 --> 02:17:20,398
most of the initial things you said what

3940
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:23,280
i don't

3941
02:17:20,398 --> 02:17:25,119
necessarily agree with you my of course

3942
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:27,439
nobody knows but

3943
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:28,639
that the more likely set of trajectories

3944
02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:31,040
that we're going to take

3945
02:17:28,638 --> 02:17:31,920
are going to be positive that's what i

3946
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:35,760
believe

3947
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:38,960
in the sense that the way you develop

3948
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:42,079
i believe the way you develop successful

3949
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:43,919
ai systems will be deeply

3950
02:17:42,079 --> 02:17:45,200
integrated with human society and for

3951
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:48,079
them to succeed

3952
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:49,840
they're going to have to be aligned in

3953
02:17:48,079 --> 02:17:50,239
the way we humans are aligned with each

3954
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:52,880
other

3955
02:17:50,239 --> 02:17:53,359
which doesn't mean we're aligned there's

3956
02:17:52,879 --> 02:17:56,000
no

3957
02:17:53,359 --> 02:17:57,840
such thing i don't see there's such

3958
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,000
thing as a perfect alignment

3959
02:17:57,840 --> 02:18:00,960
but they're going to be participating in

3960
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,959
the dance

3961
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:04,079
in the game theoretic dance of human

3962
02:18:02,959 --> 02:18:05,598
society

3963
02:18:04,079 --> 02:18:07,760
and as they become more and more

3964
02:18:05,599 --> 02:18:10,799
intelligent there could be a point

3965
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:14,478
beyond which we are like birds

3966
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:17,119
to them but what about an intelligence

3967
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:18,959
explosion of some kind so i i believe

3968
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:22,240
the explosion

3969
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:24,079
will be happening but it's

3970
02:18:22,239 --> 02:18:26,079
there's a lot of explosion to be done

3971
02:18:24,079 --> 02:18:28,239
before we become like birds

3972
02:18:26,079 --> 02:18:29,920
i i truly believe that human beings are

3973
02:18:28,239 --> 02:18:32,159
very intelligent in ways we don't

3974
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:33,439
understand it's not just about chess

3975
02:18:32,159 --> 02:18:35,599
it's about

3976
02:18:33,439 --> 02:18:36,639
all the intricate computation we're able

3977
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:38,880
to perform

3978
02:18:36,638 --> 02:18:40,478
common sense our ability to reason about

3979
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:42,478
this world consciousness

3980
02:18:40,478 --> 02:18:44,478
i think we're doing a lot of work we

3981
02:18:42,478 --> 02:18:45,679
don't realize it's necessary to be done

3982
02:18:44,478 --> 02:18:49,039
in order to

3983
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:49,840
truly become like truly achieve super

3984
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:51,519
intelligence

3985
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:53,679
and i just think there will be a period

3986
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:55,599
of time that's not overnight

3987
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:57,040
the overnight nature of it will not

3988
02:18:55,599 --> 02:18:59,840
literally be overnight

3989
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:01,280
it'll be over a period of decades so my

3990
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:02,960
sense is but why would it be that way

3991
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:06,479
but just take

3992
02:19:02,959 --> 02:19:07,598
draw an analogy from successes like

3993
02:19:06,478 --> 02:19:10,718
something like alpha

3994
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:12,239
go or alpha zero i forget the

3995
02:19:10,718 --> 02:19:15,279
the actual metric but it was something

3996
02:19:12,239 --> 02:19:17,519
like this algorithm

3997
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:21,439
uh which wasn't even totally it wasn't

3998
02:19:17,519 --> 02:19:23,359
bespoke for chess playing

3999
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:25,359
in the matter of i think it was four

4000
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:27,760
hours played itself

4001
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:29,439
so many times and so successfully that

4002
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:30,318
it became the best chess playing

4003
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:31,840
computer

4004
02:19:30,318 --> 02:19:33,599
not only was it was not only better than

4005
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:35,760
every human being

4006
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:36,639
it was better than every previous chess

4007
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:38,960
program

4008
02:19:36,638 --> 02:19:40,398
in a matter of a day right so like that

4009
02:19:38,959 --> 02:19:42,159
like so just imagine

4010
02:19:40,398 --> 02:19:44,318
again we don't have to recapitulate

4011
02:19:42,159 --> 02:19:46,840
everything about us but just imagine

4012
02:19:44,318 --> 02:19:49,680
building a system

4013
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:51,359
uh and who knows when we'll we'll be

4014
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:51,920
able to do this but at some point we'll

4015
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:55,200
be able

4016
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:59,200
at some point the the 100 or 100

4017
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:59,200
favorite things about human cognition

4018
02:19:59,359 --> 02:20:03,920
will be analogous to chess in that we

4019
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:07,840
will be able to build machines

4020
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:09,920
that very quickly outperform any human

4021
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:10,960
and then very quickly outperform the

4022
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:12,960
last

4023
02:20:10,959 --> 02:20:15,679
algorithm that perform outperform the

4024
02:20:12,959 --> 02:20:19,759
humans like something like the alphago

4025
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:22,639
experience seems possible for

4026
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:23,680
facial recognition and detecting human

4027
02:20:22,639 --> 02:20:26,000
emotion

4028
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:27,280
and natural language processing right

4029
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,520
like well it's just

4030
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:30,319
it's it's just the way everyone you know

4031
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:33,760
even math

4032
02:20:30,318 --> 02:20:35,119
people math heads tend to have bad

4033
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:36,960
intuitions for

4034
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:38,720
exponentiation right we noticed this

4035
02:20:36,959 --> 02:20:39,839
during covet and we have some very smart

4036
02:20:38,719 --> 02:20:41,920
people who

4037
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:43,040
still couldn't get their minds around

4038
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:46,159
the fact that

4039
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:47,439
you know an exponential is is really

4040
02:20:46,159 --> 02:20:49,200
surprising i mean things double and

4041
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:50,559
double and double and double again

4042
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:52,479
and you don't notice much of anything

4043
02:20:50,559 --> 02:20:55,439
changes and then the last

4044
02:20:52,478 --> 02:20:57,119
you know two stages of doubling swamp

4045
02:20:55,439 --> 02:21:00,880
everything right and

4046
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:05,680
um it just seems like that to assume

4047
02:21:00,879 --> 02:21:08,478
that there isn't a deep analogy between

4048
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:11,280
what we're seeing for the more practical

4049
02:21:08,478 --> 02:21:13,358
the tractable problems like chess

4050
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:14,399
to other modes of cognition it's like

4051
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:16,239
once you

4052
02:21:14,398 --> 02:21:19,519
once you crack that problem it seems

4053
02:21:16,239 --> 02:21:19,520
because for the longest time

4054
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:23,520
it was impossible to think we were going

4055
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:25,760
to make headway on

4056
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:27,439
in ai you know it's like chest and go

4057
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:29,600
was the goal was seen as yeah

4058
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:31,520
goes seemed unattainable even even when

4059
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:34,880
chess had been cracked

4060
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:36,479
go seemed unattainable yeah

4061
02:21:34,879 --> 02:21:37,599
and actually still russell was behind

4062
02:21:36,478 --> 02:21:38,639
the people that were saying it's

4063
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:40,960
unattainable

4064
02:21:38,639 --> 02:21:42,478
right does it seem like uh you know it's

4065
02:21:40,959 --> 02:21:44,398
uh intractable problem

4066
02:21:42,478 --> 02:21:45,920
right but there's something different

4067
02:21:44,398 --> 02:21:47,519
about the space of

4068
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:49,600
cognition that's detached from human

4069
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:52,640
society which is what chess is

4070
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:54,399
meaning like just thinking having

4071
02:21:52,639 --> 02:21:55,760
actual exponential impact on the

4072
02:21:54,398 --> 02:21:57,680
physical world is

4073
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:59,920
is different i i tend to believe that

4074
02:21:57,680 --> 02:21:59,920
there's

4075
02:22:00,159 --> 02:22:03,600
for ai to get to the point where it's

4076
02:22:02,559 --> 02:22:05,199
super intelligent

4077
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:06,640
it's going to have to go through the

4078
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:08,880
funnel of

4079
02:22:06,639 --> 02:22:11,039
society and for that it has to be deeply

4080
02:22:08,879 --> 02:22:13,039
integrated with human beings

4081
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:14,720
and for that it has to be aligned but

4082
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:16,479
you're talking about like actually

4083
02:22:14,719 --> 02:22:17,840
hooking us up to like the neural link

4084
02:22:16,478 --> 02:22:21,199
you know we're going to be

4085
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:23,040
the brain stem to the

4086
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:25,040
robot overlords that's a possibility as

4087
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:26,960
well but what i mean is

4088
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:28,800
in order to develop autonomous weapons

4089
02:22:26,959 --> 02:22:31,438
systems for example

4090
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:32,000
which are highly concerning to me that

4091
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:34,720
both

4092
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,040
us and china are participating in now

4093
02:22:34,719 --> 02:22:37,279
that

4094
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:38,240
in order to develop them and for them to

4095
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:40,319
become

4096
02:22:38,239 --> 02:22:41,600
to have more and more responsibility to

4097
02:22:40,318 --> 02:22:44,398
actually do

4098
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:47,120
military military strategic actions

4099
02:22:44,398 --> 02:22:50,478
they're going to have to be

4100
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:52,000
integrated into human beings

4101
02:22:50,478 --> 02:22:53,679
doing the strategic action they're going

4102
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,159
to have to work alongside with each

4103
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:55,439
other

4104
02:22:54,159 --> 02:22:57,760
and the way those systems will be

4105
02:22:55,439 --> 02:23:00,800
developed will have the natural

4106
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:01,200
safety like switches that are placed on

4107
02:23:00,799 --> 02:23:03,358
them

4108
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:05,280
as they develop over time because

4109
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:06,399
they're going to have to convince humans

4110
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:09,200
ultimately they're going to have to

4111
02:23:06,398 --> 02:23:11,439
convince humans that this is safer

4112
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:14,560
than humans they're going to you know

4113
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:16,559
eat well self-driving cars is a good

4114
02:23:14,559 --> 02:23:18,000
test case right here because like we're

4115
02:23:16,559 --> 02:23:19,519
obviously we're we've made a lot of

4116
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:22,559
progress

4117
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:22,560
and we can imagine

4118
02:23:22,879 --> 02:23:26,398
what total progress would look like i

4119
02:23:24,799 --> 02:23:26,959
mean it would be amazing and it's

4120
02:23:26,398 --> 02:23:29,599
answering

4121
02:23:26,959 --> 02:23:30,079
it's cancelling if in the us 40 000

4122
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:32,800
deaths

4123
02:23:30,079 --> 02:23:33,760
every year based on ape-driven cars

4124
02:23:32,799 --> 02:23:35,840
right so we it's

4125
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:37,280
a excruciating problem that we've all

4126
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:39,920
gotten used to because it was no

4127
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:42,560
alternative but now that we can dimly

4128
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:44,960
see the prospect of an alternative which

4129
02:23:42,559 --> 02:23:45,760
if it works in a super intelligent

4130
02:23:44,959 --> 02:23:48,318
fashion

4131
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:49,840
maybe we would go down to zero highway

4132
02:23:48,318 --> 02:23:51,119
deaths right or you know

4133
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:53,520
certainly we go down by orders of

4134
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:56,560
magnitude right so maybe we have

4135
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:58,800
you know 400 rather than than 40 000

4136
02:23:56,559 --> 02:23:58,799
a year

4137
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:06,559
and it's easy to see that there's not

4138
02:24:04,159 --> 02:24:08,239
and a missile so obviously this is not

4139
02:24:06,559 --> 02:24:09,840
an example of super intelligence this is

4140
02:24:08,239 --> 02:24:13,439
narrow intelligence but

4141
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:15,600
um the the alignment problem isn't

4142
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:17,200
so obvious there but there's there are

4143
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:20,000
potential alignment problems

4144
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:20,880
there like so like just just imagine if

4145
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:24,478
some woke

4146
02:24:20,879 --> 02:24:26,559
team of engineers decided that

4147
02:24:24,478 --> 02:24:28,478
we have to tune the algorithm some way i

4148
02:24:26,559 --> 02:24:29,840
mean there are situations where the car

4149
02:24:28,478 --> 02:24:31,920
has to decide who to hit

4150
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:33,200
i mean there's just bad outcomes where

4151
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:35,280
you're going to hit somebody

4152
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:36,479
right now we have a car that can tell

4153
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:38,239
what race you are

4154
02:24:36,478 --> 02:24:40,318
right so we're going to build the car to

4155
02:24:38,239 --> 02:24:41,600
preferentially hit white people

4156
02:24:40,318 --> 02:24:43,439
because white people have had so much

4157
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:45,120
privilege over the years this

4158
02:24:43,439 --> 02:24:47,120
seems like the only ethical way to kind

4159
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:49,520
of redress those wrongs of the past

4160
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:50,640
that's something that could get one that

4161
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:53,040
could that could

4162
02:24:50,639 --> 02:24:54,398
get produced as an artifact presumably

4163
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:56,000
of just how you built it and you didn't

4164
02:24:54,398 --> 02:24:58,559
even know you engineered it that way

4165
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:59,840
right you you you cause machine learning

4166
02:24:58,559 --> 02:25:01,279
yeah you you put some kind of

4167
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:02,398
constraints on it to where it creates

4168
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:05,040
those kinds of options you

4169
02:25:02,398 --> 02:25:06,239
basically built a racist algorithm and

4170
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:08,000
you didn't even intend to

4171
02:25:06,239 --> 02:25:09,199
or you could intend to right and it

4172
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,799
would be aligned with some people's

4173
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:13,359
values but misaligned with other

4174
02:25:10,799 --> 02:25:16,000
people's values

4175
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:16,479
but it's like they're interesting

4176
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,079
problems

4177
02:25:16,478 --> 02:25:20,559
even with something as simple and

4178
02:25:18,079 --> 02:25:21,359
obviously good as self-driving cars but

4179
02:25:20,559 --> 02:25:23,600
there's a leap

4180
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:25,200
that i just think could be exact but

4181
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:26,800
those are human problems

4182
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:29,600
i just don't think there'll be a leap

4183
02:25:26,799 --> 02:25:32,799
with autonomous vehicles

4184
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:34,640
first of all sorry there are

4185
02:25:32,799 --> 02:25:36,398
a lot of trajectories which will destroy

4186
02:25:34,639 --> 02:25:38,000
human civilization the argument i'm

4187
02:25:36,398 --> 02:25:39,920
making it's more likely

4188
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,439
that we'll take trajectories that don't

4189
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:43,359
so there i don't think there will be a

4190
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:46,000
leap with autonomous vehicles will all

4191
02:25:43,359 --> 02:25:48,399
of a sudden start murdering pedestrians

4192
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,200
because once every human on earth is

4193
02:25:48,398 --> 02:25:50,959
dead

4194
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:52,800
there will be no more fatalities sort of

4195
02:25:50,959 --> 02:25:55,919
unintended consequences of

4196
02:25:52,799 --> 02:25:57,519
is difficult to take that leap i most

4197
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:59,040
systems as we develop and they become

4198
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:00,640
much much more intelligent

4199
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:02,960
in ways that will be incredibly

4200
02:26:00,639 --> 02:26:05,439
surprising like stuff that's deep mind

4201
02:26:02,959 --> 02:26:07,839
is doing with protein folding

4202
02:26:05,439 --> 02:26:09,600
even which is scary to think about and

4203
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:11,359
i'm personally terrified about this

4204
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:12,640
which is the engineering of viruses

4205
02:26:11,359 --> 02:26:16,079
using machine learning

4206
02:26:12,639 --> 02:26:17,519
the engineering of uh vaccines using

4207
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:18,398
machine learning right the engineering

4208
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:21,680
of

4209
02:26:18,398 --> 02:26:23,680
uh yeah for research purposes pathogens

4210
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:25,040
uh what you're using machine learning

4211
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:26,559
like the ways that can go wrong

4212
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:28,960
i just think that there's always going

4213
02:26:26,559 --> 02:26:31,760
to be a closed-loop

4214
02:26:28,959 --> 02:26:32,159
supervision of humans before they before

4215
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:34,800
they

4216
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:36,719
become super intelligent not always much

4217
02:26:34,799 --> 02:26:39,759
more likely to

4218
02:26:36,719 --> 02:26:41,599
to be supervision except of course

4219
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:43,280
the question is how many dumb people are

4220
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:44,399
in the world how many evil people are in

4221
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:47,520
the world

4222
02:26:44,398 --> 02:26:50,239
my theory my hope is my

4223
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:52,000
sense is that the number of intelligent

4224
02:26:50,239 --> 02:26:53,840
people is much higher than the number of

4225
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:56,398
dumb people

4226
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:57,600
that know how to program and the number

4227
02:26:56,398 --> 02:26:59,920
of evil people

4228
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:01,760
i think smart people and kind people

4229
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:04,478
over

4230
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:04,880
outnumbered the others except we also we

4231
02:27:04,478 --> 02:27:06,239
had a

4232
02:27:04,879 --> 02:27:08,478
have to add another group of people

4233
02:27:06,239 --> 02:27:11,840
which are just the the smart

4234
02:27:08,478 --> 02:27:12,879
and otherwise good but reckless people

4235
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:16,719
right the people who will

4236
02:27:12,879 --> 02:27:18,079
flip a switch on not knowing

4237
02:27:16,719 --> 02:27:19,840
what's going to happen they're just kind

4238
02:27:18,079 --> 02:27:20,478
of hoping that it's not going to blow up

4239
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:22,000
the world

4240
02:27:20,478 --> 02:27:23,840
we already know that some of our

4241
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,318
smartest people are those sorts of

4242
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:26,000
people

4243
02:27:24,318 --> 02:27:27,680
you know we know we've done experiments

4244
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,478
and this is something that martin reeves

4245
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:32,079
was

4246
02:27:28,478 --> 02:27:33,119
whinging about before the large hadron

4247
02:27:32,079 --> 02:27:36,398
collider

4248
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:37,439
got booted up i think we know there are

4249
02:27:36,398 --> 02:27:38,879
people who are

4250
02:27:37,439 --> 02:27:40,559
entertaining experiments or even

4251
02:27:38,879 --> 02:27:41,839
performing experiments where there's

4252
02:27:40,559 --> 02:27:45,359
some

4253
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:47,920
chance you know not quite infinitesimal

4254
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:49,600
uh that they're going to create a black

4255
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:51,040
hole in the lab and suck every you know

4256
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:52,479
the whole world into it right like that

4257
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:55,120
that's not that's not

4258
02:27:52,478 --> 02:27:56,318
you're not a crazy person to worry that

4259
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:59,040
i worry about that based on

4260
02:27:56,318 --> 02:27:59,519
on the physics and so it was with with

4261
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:01,760
uh

4262
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:04,000
you know the trinity test there were

4263
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:06,159
some people who were still

4264
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:08,079
checking their calculations and they

4265
02:28:06,159 --> 02:28:08,799
were off we've we did nuclear tests

4266
02:28:08,079 --> 02:28:11,359
where we

4267
02:28:08,799 --> 02:28:12,478
were off significantly in terms of the

4268
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:14,000
yield right so it was like

4269
02:28:12,478 --> 02:28:15,840
and they still flip the switch yeah they

4270
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:17,840
still flip the switch and and sometimes

4271
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:21,359
they flip the switch not

4272
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:23,920
to win a world war or to or to

4273
02:28:21,359 --> 02:28:24,559
save 40 000 lives a year they just just

4274
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:26,318
just to see

4275
02:28:24,559 --> 02:28:27,600
intellectual curiosity like this is what

4276
02:28:26,318 --> 02:28:29,519
i got my grant for

4277
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:32,880
this is this is where i'll get my nobel

4278
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:35,120
prize if if uh that's in the cards

4279
02:28:32,879 --> 02:28:36,959
it's on the other side of this switch

4280
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:41,280
right and

4281
02:28:36,959 --> 02:28:44,799
um i mean we again we are we are

4282
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:45,840
apes with egos who are massively

4283
02:28:44,799 --> 02:28:49,599
constrained

4284
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:52,000
by self very short-term self-interest

4285
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:53,760
even when we're contemplating some of

4286
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,478
the the deepest and most interesting and

4287
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:58,639
most

4288
02:28:54,478 --> 02:29:00,879
um universal problems we could ever

4289
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:01,840
set our attention towards i like just if

4290
02:29:00,879 --> 02:29:03,920
you read

4291
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:04,960
james watson's book the double helix

4292
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:07,439
right about the the

4293
02:29:04,959 --> 02:29:09,839
them you know cracking the the uh

4294
02:29:07,439 --> 02:29:11,520
structure of dna

4295
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:14,159
one thing that's amazing about that book

4296
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:17,280
is just how much of it

4297
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:20,000
almost all of it is being driven

4298
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:20,000
driven by

4299
02:29:20,559 --> 02:29:27,279
very apish uh egocentric

4300
02:29:24,719 --> 02:29:28,799
social concerns like that the algorithm

4301
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:31,359
that is producing

4302
02:29:28,799 --> 02:29:32,478
this scientific breakthrough is human

4303
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:34,559
competition

4304
02:29:32,478 --> 02:29:35,519
if you're james watson it's like i'm

4305
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:38,559
going to get there before

4306
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:41,840
linus pauling and you know

4307
02:29:38,559 --> 02:29:42,879
it's just it's so much of his bandwidth

4308
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:46,159
is captured by that

4309
02:29:42,879 --> 02:29:49,679
right now that you know

4310
02:29:46,159 --> 02:29:51,200
that's that becomes that becomes more

4311
02:29:49,680 --> 02:29:54,159
and more of a liability when you're

4312
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:56,000
talking about producing technology that

4313
02:29:54,159 --> 02:29:57,920
can change everything in an instant you

4314
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:01,359
know we're talking about

4315
02:29:57,920 --> 02:30:02,879
not only understanding

4316
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:06,239
you know we're just at a different

4317
02:30:02,879 --> 02:30:09,599
moment in human history we're not

4318
02:30:06,239 --> 02:30:11,920
when we're doing research

4319
02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:13,120
on viruses we're now doing the kind of

4320
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:16,159
research

4321
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:17,120
that can cause someone somewhere else to

4322
02:30:16,159 --> 02:30:19,119
be able to

4323
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:20,319
to make that virus or weaponize that

4324
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:23,600
virus or

4325
02:30:20,318 --> 02:30:26,318
or um it's just uh

4326
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:27,840
i don't know i mean our power is our

4327
02:30:26,318 --> 02:30:29,359
wisdom

4328
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:31,520
it does not seem like our wisdom is

4329
02:30:29,359 --> 02:30:33,760
scaling with our power right and like

4330
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:34,960
that that seems like in so far and with

4331
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:38,478
insofar

4332
02:30:34,959 --> 02:30:41,199
as wisdom and power become unaligned

4333
02:30:38,478 --> 02:30:42,159
i get more and more concerned but

4334
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:45,359
speaking of

4335
02:30:42,159 --> 02:30:47,760
uh apes with the egos

4336
02:30:45,359 --> 02:30:49,520
uh some of the most compelling apes two

4337
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:52,000
compelling apes i can think of as

4338
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:53,680
yourself and jordan peterson and you've

4339
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:56,559
had uh

4340
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:57,040
fun conversation about religion that i

4341
02:30:56,559 --> 02:30:59,680
watched

4342
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,080
most of i believe i'm not sure there was

4343
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:03,520
any

4344
02:31:00,079 --> 02:31:05,600
um uh we didn't solve anything

4345
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:08,159
if anything was ever solved so is there

4346
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:09,840
something uh

4347
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:11,280
like a charitable summary you can give

4348
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:13,600
to the ideas

4349
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:15,520
of that you agree on and disagree with

4350
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:17,600
jordan is there something maybe after

4351
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:20,720
that conversation that you've landed

4352
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:23,280
where maybe uh

4353
02:31:20,719 --> 02:31:24,799
as as you both agreed on is there some

4354
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:28,399
wisdom in the rubble

4355
02:31:24,799 --> 02:31:28,959
uh even of even um imperfect flawed

4356
02:31:28,398 --> 02:31:30,799
ideas

4357
02:31:28,959 --> 02:31:32,639
is there something that you can kind of

4358
02:31:30,799 --> 02:31:35,119
pull out from those conversations

4359
02:31:32,639 --> 02:31:36,318
or is it to be continued i mean i think

4360
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:40,960
where we disagree so

4361
02:31:36,318 --> 02:31:43,279
he thinks that

4362
02:31:40,959 --> 02:31:45,438
many of our traditional religious

4363
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:49,280
beliefs and frameworks

4364
02:31:45,439 --> 02:31:55,359
are holding so much

4365
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:59,520
such a a repository of human wisdom

4366
02:31:55,359 --> 02:31:59,520
that we we

4367
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:04,719
pull at that fabric

4368
02:32:02,799 --> 02:32:06,398
at our peril right like if you start

4369
02:32:04,719 --> 02:32:09,358
just unraveling

4370
02:32:06,398 --> 02:32:10,398
christianity or any other traditional

4371
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:13,040
set of norms and

4372
02:32:10,398 --> 02:32:14,398
and beliefs you you may think you're

4373
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:16,399
just pulling out the

4374
02:32:14,398 --> 02:32:17,680
unscientific bits but you could be

4375
02:32:16,398 --> 02:32:20,079
pulling a lot more

4376
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:20,880
to which everything you care about is

4377
02:32:20,079 --> 02:32:25,520
attached

4378
02:32:20,879 --> 02:32:28,478
right as a society and

4379
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:29,680
my feeling is that there's so much

4380
02:32:28,478 --> 02:32:31,199
there's so much downside to the

4381
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:34,800
unscientific bits

4382
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:36,960
and it's so clear how we could

4383
02:32:34,799 --> 02:32:38,079
have a 21st century rational

4384
02:32:36,959 --> 02:32:40,799
conversation about

4385
02:32:38,079 --> 02:32:41,840
the good stuff that we really can

4386
02:32:40,799 --> 02:32:43,519
radically edit

4387
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:45,120
these traditions and we can take we can

4388
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:48,880
take jesus

4389
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:52,560
uh you know in in half his moods and

4390
02:32:48,879 --> 02:32:54,318
just find a great inspirational you know

4391
02:32:52,559 --> 02:32:55,600
you know thought iron age thought leader

4392
02:32:54,318 --> 02:32:56,639
you know who just happened to get

4393
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:58,079
crucified but

4394
02:32:56,639 --> 02:32:59,840
he could be somewhat like you know the

4395
02:32:58,079 --> 02:33:02,239
beatitudes and

4396
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:04,079
uh the golden rule which doesn't

4397
02:33:02,239 --> 02:33:08,559
originate originate with him but which

4398
02:33:04,079 --> 02:33:09,920
you know he put quite beautifully um

4399
02:33:08,559 --> 02:33:12,639
all of that's incredibly useful it's no

4400
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:14,239
less useful than it was 2000 years ago

4401
02:33:12,639 --> 02:33:16,079
but we don't have to believe he was born

4402
02:33:14,239 --> 02:33:17,359
of a virgin or coming back to

4403
02:33:16,079 --> 02:33:20,239
raise the debt or any of that other

4404
02:33:17,359 --> 02:33:22,000
stuff and we can be honest about

4405
02:33:20,239 --> 02:33:23,280
not believing those things and we can be

4406
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,478
honest about the reasons why we don't

4407
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:28,720
believe those things

4408
02:33:24,478 --> 02:33:31,599
because i i on those fronts i view

4409
02:33:28,719 --> 02:33:33,119
the downside to be so obvious and the

4410
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:34,720
these

4411
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:37,680
the fact that we have so many different

4412
02:33:34,719 --> 02:33:40,478
competing dogmatisms on offer to be so

4413
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:42,079
non-functional i mean it's so divisive

4414
02:33:40,478 --> 02:33:44,478
uh it's it just has

4415
02:33:42,079 --> 02:33:46,559
conflict built into it that i think we

4416
02:33:44,478 --> 02:33:47,920
can be

4417
02:33:46,559 --> 02:33:49,600
far more and should be far more

4418
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:52,398
iconoclastic than

4419
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:54,079
he wants to be right now none of this is

4420
02:33:52,398 --> 02:33:57,920
to deny

4421
02:33:54,079 --> 02:34:00,478
much of what he uh argues for that

4422
02:33:57,920 --> 02:34:00,960
that stories are very powerful i mean

4423
02:34:00,478 --> 02:34:02,879
clearly

4424
02:34:00,959 --> 02:34:04,639
stories are powerful and we want good

4425
02:34:02,879 --> 02:34:06,239
stories we want our lives

4426
02:34:04,639 --> 02:34:08,398
we want to have a conversation with

4427
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:12,000
ourselves and with one another

4428
02:34:08,398 --> 02:34:14,318
about our lives that facilitates

4429
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:15,120
the best possible lives and story is

4430
02:34:14,318 --> 02:34:17,680
part of that

4431
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:18,720
right and if you want some of those

4432
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:21,920
stories to

4433
02:34:18,719 --> 02:34:23,679
to s sound like myths that might be part

4434
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:26,079
of it right but

4435
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:26,720
my argument is that we never really need

4436
02:34:26,079 --> 02:34:29,680
to

4437
02:34:26,719 --> 02:34:30,318
deceive ourselves or our children about

4438
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:32,800
what we have

4439
02:34:30,318 --> 02:34:34,318
every reason to believe is true in order

4440
02:34:32,799 --> 02:34:36,318
to get at the good stuff in order to

4441
02:34:34,318 --> 02:34:37,760
organize our lives well you know i

4442
02:34:36,318 --> 02:34:39,039
certainly don't feel that i need to do

4443
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:41,040
it personally

4444
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:42,160
and if i don't need to do it personally

4445
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:44,319
why would i think that

4446
02:34:42,159 --> 02:34:46,318
billions of other people need to do it

4447
02:34:44,318 --> 02:34:48,159
personally right now

4448
02:34:46,318 --> 02:34:49,439
there's there is a cynical counter

4449
02:34:48,159 --> 02:34:51,680
argument which is

4450
02:34:49,439 --> 02:34:53,840
billions of other people don't have the

4451
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:55,439
advantages that i have had in my life

4452
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:57,920
you know the billions of other people

4453
02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:59,520
are not as well educated they haven't

4454
02:34:57,920 --> 02:34:59,840
had the same opportunities they have

4455
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:03,200
they

4456
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:04,719
they need to be told that

4457
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:06,560
jesus is going to solve all their

4458
02:35:04,719 --> 02:35:09,920
problems after they die say

4459
02:35:06,559 --> 02:35:10,639
or that uh you know everything happens

4460
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:13,040
for a reason

4461
02:35:10,639 --> 02:35:14,159
and you know just your if you just

4462
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:15,439
believe in the secret if you just

4463
02:35:14,159 --> 02:35:16,879
visualize what you want you're going to

4464
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:20,000
get it you know and and

4465
02:35:16,879 --> 02:35:22,079
it's like there's some some

4466
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:23,760
some measure of what i consider to be

4467
02:35:22,079 --> 02:35:26,559
odious pablum

4468
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:27,520
that really is food for the better part

4469
02:35:26,559 --> 02:35:29,199
of humanity and

4470
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:30,800
and there is no substitute for it or

4471
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:32,079
there's no substitute now

4472
02:35:30,799 --> 02:35:33,920
and i don't know if jordan would agree

4473
02:35:32,079 --> 02:35:34,639
with that but he much of what he says

4474
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:38,879
seems to

4475
02:35:34,639 --> 02:35:38,879
suggest that he would agree with it um

4476
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:42,319
and i guess that's an empirical question

4477
02:35:40,959 --> 02:35:46,159
i mean that's just that

4478
02:35:42,318 --> 02:35:47,680
we don't know whether given a different

4479
02:35:46,159 --> 02:35:49,600
set of norms and a different set of

4480
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:51,920
stories

4481
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:54,239
people would behave the way i would hope

4482
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:55,920
they would behave and and be aligned

4483
02:35:54,239 --> 02:35:58,639
you know more aligned than they are now

4484
02:35:55,920 --> 02:36:02,478
i think we know what happens

4485
02:35:58,639 --> 02:36:06,318
when you just let ancient

4486
02:36:02,478 --> 02:36:08,159
religious certainties go uncriticized

4487
02:36:06,318 --> 02:36:10,079
we know what that world's like we've lit

4488
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:11,039
we we've been struggling to get out of

4489
02:36:10,079 --> 02:36:13,840
that world for

4490
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:14,640
a couple hundred years but we know what

4491
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:18,799
you know

4492
02:36:14,639 --> 02:36:21,760
having europe uh

4493
02:36:18,799 --> 02:36:23,599
riven by religious wars looks like right

4494
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:26,639
and we know what happens when those

4495
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:28,318
religio when those religions become kind

4496
02:36:26,639 --> 02:36:30,079
of pseudo religions

4497
02:36:28,318 --> 02:36:31,359
and political religions right so this is

4498
02:36:30,079 --> 02:36:34,239
this is where i'm sure

4499
02:36:31,359 --> 02:36:35,280
jordan and i would debate he would say

4500
02:36:34,239 --> 02:36:37,039
that that you know

4501
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:38,640
stalin was a symptom of atheism and

4502
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:40,319
that's not at all i mean it's not my

4503
02:36:38,639 --> 02:36:44,000
kind of atheism right like

4504
02:36:40,318 --> 02:36:47,119
stalin the problem with with the gulag

4505
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:48,799
and and the experiment with communism or

4506
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:52,079
with stalinism

4507
02:36:48,799 --> 02:36:54,398
uh or with nazism was not that

4508
02:36:52,079 --> 02:36:56,719
there was so much scientific rigor and

4509
02:36:54,398 --> 02:36:59,840
self-criticism and honesty

4510
02:36:56,719 --> 02:37:03,039
and introspection and

4511
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:03,359
you know judicious use of psychedelics i

4512
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:05,600
mean

4513
02:37:03,359 --> 02:37:07,200
like that was not the problem in

4514
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:11,920
hitler's germany

4515
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:11,920
uh or in stalin's soviet union

4516
02:37:12,639 --> 02:37:19,920
the problem was you have other ideas

4517
02:37:16,799 --> 02:37:23,438
that capture a similar kind of

4518
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:26,639
mob based dogmatic energy

4519
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:29,120
and you know yes that's the

4520
02:37:26,639 --> 02:37:30,478
the results of all of that are are

4521
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:33,439
predictably murderous

4522
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:34,159
well the question is what is the source

4523
02:37:33,439 --> 02:37:37,680
of the

4524
02:37:34,159 --> 02:37:39,359
most viral and sticky stories

4525
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:41,920
that ultimately lead to a positive

4526
02:37:39,359 --> 02:37:43,840
outcome so communism was

4527
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:45,520
i mean having grown up in the soviet

4528
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:49,520
union

4529
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:52,720
even still you know having relatives

4530
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:53,840
uh in in russia there's a stickiness to

4531
02:37:52,719 --> 02:37:56,879
the nationalism

4532
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:58,559
and to the ideologies of communism that

4533
02:37:56,879 --> 02:38:00,239
religious or not

4534
02:37:58,559 --> 02:38:01,680
you could say it's religious for forever

4535
02:38:00,239 --> 02:38:04,318
i could just say it's

4536
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:06,239
it's uh viral it's great it's stories

4537
02:38:04,318 --> 02:38:08,159
that are viral and sticky

4538
02:38:06,239 --> 02:38:09,680
i don't know i'm using the the most

4539
02:38:08,159 --> 02:38:11,039
horrible words but the question is

4540
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:13,840
whether science

4541
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:15,760
and reason can generate viral sticky

4542
02:38:13,840 --> 02:38:16,880
stories that give meaning to people's

4543
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:20,639
lives

4544
02:38:16,879 --> 02:38:24,478
that's yeah it's in your senses it does

4545
02:38:20,639 --> 02:38:26,639
well whatever is true ultimately

4546
02:38:24,478 --> 02:38:28,079
should be captivating right it's like

4547
02:38:26,639 --> 02:38:31,039
what what's more

4548
02:38:28,079 --> 02:38:31,760
captivating than what is whatever is

4549
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:34,800
real

4550
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:38,159
right now it it's because

4551
02:38:34,799 --> 02:38:40,719
reality is again we're we're so

4552
02:38:38,159 --> 02:38:42,000
we're just climbing out of the darkness

4553
02:38:40,719 --> 02:38:43,519
you know in terms of our understanding

4554
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:46,239
of what the hell is going on and there

4555
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:48,239
and there's no telling

4556
02:38:46,239 --> 02:38:49,199
what spooky things may in fact be true i

4557
02:38:48,239 --> 02:38:50,318
mean i don't know if you've been on the

4558
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:53,280
receiving end of

4559
02:38:50,318 --> 02:38:55,199
you know recent rumors about uh our

4560
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:57,280
conversation about ufos

4561
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:58,800
very likely changing in the near term

4562
02:38:57,280 --> 02:39:00,800
right but like there was just a

4563
02:38:58,799 --> 02:39:02,079
washington post article and a new yorker

4564
02:39:00,799 --> 02:39:03,840
article and

4565
02:39:02,079 --> 02:39:05,920
you know i've received some private

4566
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:09,439
outreach and perhaps you have i

4567
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:11,920
know other people in our our orbit have

4568
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:13,680
people who are claiming that the

4569
02:39:11,920 --> 02:39:14,559
government has known much more about

4570
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:17,840
ufos

4571
02:39:14,559 --> 02:39:19,760
than they have let on until now and

4572
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:21,120
this conversation is actually is about

4573
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:24,478
to become more prominent

4574
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:26,880
you know and it's it's not going to be

4575
02:39:24,478 --> 02:39:28,478
whatever you know whoever's left

4576
02:39:26,879 --> 02:39:32,239
standing when the music stops

4577
02:39:28,478 --> 02:39:36,398
it's not going to be a comfortable

4578
02:39:32,239 --> 02:39:36,398
position to be in as a

4579
02:39:36,478 --> 02:39:40,559
super rigorous scientific skeptic saying

4580
02:39:39,280 --> 02:39:42,640
there's no there who's been saying

4581
02:39:40,559 --> 02:39:43,039
there's no there there for the last 75

4582
02:39:42,639 --> 02:39:46,239
years

4583
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:47,200
all right you know like like the short

4584
02:39:46,239 --> 02:39:50,318
version is it

4585
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:52,240
sounds like the office of naval

4586
02:39:50,318 --> 02:39:55,039
intelligence and the pentagon

4587
02:39:52,239 --> 02:39:56,639
are very likely to say to congress at

4588
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:57,840
some point in the not too distant future

4589
02:39:56,639 --> 02:39:59,358
that

4590
02:39:57,840 --> 02:40:00,880
we have evidence that there is

4591
02:39:59,359 --> 02:40:04,399
technology

4592
02:40:00,879 --> 02:40:06,799
flying around here that seems

4593
02:40:04,398 --> 02:40:07,760
like it can't possibly possibly be of

4594
02:40:06,799 --> 02:40:09,519
human origin

4595
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:11,040
all right now i don't know what i'm

4596
02:40:09,520 --> 02:40:12,000
gonna do with that kind of disclosure

4597
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:15,520
right maybe it's just

4598
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:17,200
it's gonna it's gonna be nothing no

4599
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:19,200
follow-on conversation to really have

4600
02:40:17,200 --> 02:40:22,479
but that is such a

4601
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:24,800
powerfully strange circumstance to be in

4602
02:40:22,478 --> 02:40:26,318
right i mean it's just what are we going

4603
02:40:24,799 --> 02:40:26,959
to do with that if in fact that's what

4604
02:40:26,318 --> 02:40:30,159
happens

4605
02:40:26,959 --> 02:40:32,799
right if in fact the the

4606
02:40:30,159 --> 02:40:34,959
considered opinion despite the the

4607
02:40:32,799 --> 02:40:37,519
embarrassment it causes them

4608
02:40:34,959 --> 02:40:38,398
of the u.s government of all of our

4609
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:40,399
intelligence

4610
02:40:38,398 --> 02:40:42,478
all the relevant intelligence services

4611
02:40:40,398 --> 02:40:45,119
is that

4612
02:40:42,478 --> 02:40:46,879
this isn't a hoax it's too there's too

4613
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:48,800
much data to suggest that it's a hoax

4614
02:40:46,879 --> 02:40:49,839
we've got too much radar imagery there's

4615
02:40:48,799 --> 02:40:51,759
too much

4616
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:53,520
too much satellite data whatever data

4617
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:56,239
whatever data they actually have

4618
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:56,720
there's too much of it all we can say

4619
02:40:56,239 --> 02:41:00,318
now

4620
02:40:56,719 --> 02:41:02,959
is something's going on and

4621
02:41:00,318 --> 02:41:04,559
there's no way it's the chinese or the

4622
02:41:02,959 --> 02:41:08,959
russians or

4623
02:41:04,559 --> 02:41:11,039
anyone else's technology that should

4624
02:41:08,959 --> 02:41:12,318
that should arrest our attention you

4625
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:14,640
know collectively

4626
02:41:12,318 --> 02:41:16,318
to to a degree that nothing in our

4627
02:41:14,639 --> 02:41:20,318
lifetime has and now

4628
02:41:16,318 --> 02:41:25,039
one worries that we're so

4629
02:41:20,318 --> 02:41:28,000
jaded and confused and distracted that

4630
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:28,880
it's gonna it'll get much less coverage

4631
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:32,159
than

4632
02:41:28,879 --> 02:41:35,438
than uh you know obama's tan suit did

4633
02:41:32,159 --> 02:41:38,239
you know a bunch of years ago it's just

4634
02:41:35,439 --> 02:41:38,800
it's uh who knows how we'll respond to

4635
02:41:38,239 --> 02:41:42,000
that but

4636
02:41:38,799 --> 02:41:42,000
uh it's just to say that

4637
02:41:42,318 --> 02:41:49,920
our the need for us to tell ourselves a

4638
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:52,079
a an honest story about what's going on

4639
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:53,600
and what's likely to happen next is

4640
02:41:52,079 --> 02:41:56,398
never going to go away

4641
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:57,200
right and and it's important it's just

4642
02:41:56,398 --> 02:41:58,959
the the

4643
02:41:57,200 --> 02:42:02,880
division between me and every person

4644
02:41:58,959 --> 02:42:02,879
who's defending traditional religion is

4645
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:07,520
where where is it that where is it that

4646
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:09,600
you want to lie to yourself

4647
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:11,279
or lie to your kids like where is

4648
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:14,960
honesty a liability

4649
02:42:11,279 --> 02:42:16,479
and i and for me it you know i i've yet

4650
02:42:14,959 --> 02:42:19,919
to find the place where

4651
02:42:16,478 --> 02:42:22,879
it is and it's so obviously

4652
02:42:19,920 --> 02:42:24,079
a strength in almost every other

4653
02:42:22,879 --> 02:42:27,039
circumstance

4654
02:42:24,079 --> 02:42:27,920
because it is the thing that allows you

4655
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:31,359
to course correct

4656
02:42:27,920 --> 02:42:33,760
it is the thing that allows you to

4657
02:42:31,359 --> 02:42:34,720
hope at least that your beliefs that

4658
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:37,600
your stories

4659
02:42:34,719 --> 02:42:38,719
are in some kind of calibration with

4660
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:41,200
what's actually

4661
02:42:38,719 --> 02:42:44,159
going on in the world yes it is a little

4662
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:47,200
bit sad to imagine that

4663
02:42:44,159 --> 02:42:48,799
if aliens on mass showed up to earth

4664
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:50,399
they would be too preoccupied with

4665
02:42:48,799 --> 02:42:53,278
political bickering

4666
02:42:50,398 --> 02:42:54,799
or to like these like fake news and all

4667
02:42:53,279 --> 02:42:57,680
that kind of stuff

4668
02:42:54,799 --> 02:42:59,438
to notice yeah the very basic uh

4669
02:42:57,680 --> 02:43:02,800
evidence of reality

4670
02:42:59,439 --> 02:43:04,479
i do have a glimmer of hope that

4671
02:43:02,799 --> 02:43:06,318
there seems to be more and more hunger

4672
02:43:04,478 --> 02:43:09,599
for authenticity

4673
02:43:06,318 --> 02:43:12,719
and i feel like that opens the door

4674
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:15,520
for a hunger for what is

4675
02:43:12,719 --> 02:43:17,119
real like that people don't want story

4676
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:17,600
they don't want like layers and layers

4677
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:20,800
of

4678
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:23,920
of uh like fakeness uh

4679
02:43:20,799 --> 02:43:25,039
and i'm hoping that means that will

4680
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:27,359
directly lead to

4681
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:28,160
a greater hunger for reality and reason

4682
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:31,359
and truth

4683
02:43:28,159 --> 02:43:34,559
you know truth isn't dogmatism

4684
02:43:31,359 --> 02:43:35,279
like truth isn't uh authority i have a

4685
02:43:34,559 --> 02:43:38,398
phd

4686
02:43:35,279 --> 02:43:41,520
and therefore i'm right uh

4687
02:43:38,398 --> 02:43:43,119
truth is almost the like

4688
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:44,319
the the reality is there's so many

4689
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:46,000
questions there's so many mysteries

4690
02:43:44,318 --> 02:43:46,959
there's so much uncertainty this is our

4691
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:49,680
best

4692
02:43:46,959 --> 02:43:51,438
available like a best guess and we have

4693
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:51,920
a lot of evidence that supports that

4694
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:53,920
guest

4695
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:56,318
but it could be so many other things and

4696
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:58,318
like just even conveying that

4697
02:43:56,318 --> 02:44:00,000
i think there's a hunger for that in the

4698
02:43:58,318 --> 02:44:03,359
world to hear that from scientists

4699
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:05,359
less dogmatism and more just like

4700
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:07,760
this is this is what we know we're doing

4701
02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:09,439
our best given the uncertainty given

4702
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:11,200
i mean this is true with the obviously

4703
02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:11,680
with the virology and all those kinds of

4704
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:13,279
things

4705
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:14,800
because everything is happening so fast

4706
02:44:13,279 --> 02:44:16,960
there's a lot of

4707
02:44:14,799 --> 02:44:18,000
and biology is super messy so it's very

4708
02:44:16,959 --> 02:44:20,719
hard to know stuff for

4709
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,600
sure so just being open and real about

4710
02:44:20,719 --> 02:44:25,039
that i think

4711
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:28,318
i'm hoping will change people's

4712
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:30,880
hunger and openness and trust of uh

4713
02:44:28,318 --> 02:44:32,159
what's real yeah well so much of this is

4714
02:44:30,879 --> 02:44:34,318
probabilistic it's

4715
02:44:32,159 --> 02:44:36,079
so much of what can seem dogmatic

4716
02:44:34,318 --> 02:44:40,159
scientifically it's just

4717
02:44:36,079 --> 02:44:43,760
you're just you're placing a bet on

4718
02:44:40,159 --> 02:44:46,000
whether it's worth reading that paper or

4719
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:48,159
rethinking your presuppositions on that

4720
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:50,000
point you know it's like it's not it's

4721
02:44:48,159 --> 02:44:50,639
not fundamental closure to data it's

4722
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,040
just that

4723
02:44:50,639 --> 02:44:53,680
there's so much data on one side or so

4724
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:55,920
or so much

4725
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:57,200
so much would have to change in terms of

4726
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:58,478
your understanding of

4727
02:44:57,200 --> 02:45:00,960
what you think you understand about the

4728
02:44:58,478 --> 02:45:02,239
nature of the world if this new fact

4729
02:45:00,959 --> 02:45:05,278
were so

4730
02:45:02,239 --> 02:45:07,199
that you can

4731
02:45:05,279 --> 02:45:08,479
pretty quickly say all right that's

4732
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:11,359
probably [ __ ] right

4733
02:45:08,478 --> 02:45:12,318
like and it can sound like a fundamental

4734
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:15,359
closure

4735
02:45:12,318 --> 02:45:18,398
to new conversations new evidence new

4736
02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:20,399
new data new argument but it's really

4737
02:45:18,398 --> 02:45:21,199
not it's just it really is just triaging

4738
02:45:20,398 --> 02:45:23,358
your attention

4739
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:25,279
it's just like like okay you're telling

4740
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:27,200
me that uh

4741
02:45:25,279 --> 02:45:29,040
your best friend can actually read minds

4742
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:31,760
okay well

4743
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:33,359
that's interesting let me know when that

4744
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:34,960
person has gone into a lab and actually

4745
02:45:33,359 --> 02:45:36,880
proven it right like i don't need

4746
02:45:34,959 --> 02:45:38,478
like this this is not the place where i

4747
02:45:36,879 --> 02:45:40,478
need to spend the rest of my day

4748
02:45:38,478 --> 02:45:42,478
figuring out if your buddy can can read

4749
02:45:40,478 --> 02:45:44,799
my mind right

4750
02:45:42,478 --> 02:45:46,799
but there's a way to communicate that i

4751
02:45:44,799 --> 02:45:48,239
think i think it does too often sound

4752
02:45:46,799 --> 02:45:48,799
like you're completely closed off to

4753
02:45:48,239 --> 02:45:51,439
ideas

4754
02:45:48,799 --> 02:45:52,559
as opposed to saying like this is you

4755
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:54,800
know

4756
02:45:52,559 --> 02:45:56,000
as opposed to saying that there's

4757
02:45:54,799 --> 02:45:59,278
there's a lot of evidence

4758
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:01,200
in support of this but you're still

4759
02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:02,560
open-minded to other ideas like there's

4760
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:04,560
a way to communicate that it's not

4761
02:46:02,559 --> 02:46:07,519
necessarily even with words

4762
02:46:04,559 --> 02:46:08,398
it's like it's even that joe rogan

4763
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:11,200
energy of

4764
02:46:08,398 --> 02:46:13,119
it's entirely possible just it's that

4765
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:14,159
energy of being open-minded and curious

4766
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:16,479
like kids are

4767
02:46:14,159 --> 02:46:17,359
like this is our best understanding but

4768
02:46:16,478 --> 02:46:20,559
you still

4769
02:46:17,359 --> 02:46:22,800
are curious i'm not saying allocate

4770
02:46:20,559 --> 02:46:24,000
time to exploring all those things but

4771
02:46:22,799 --> 02:46:25,920
still leaving the door

4772
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:27,600
open and there's a way to communicate

4773
02:46:25,920 --> 02:46:30,960
that i think that

4774
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:33,279
that that that people really hunger uh

4775
02:46:30,959 --> 02:46:35,119
for let me ask you this i've been

4776
02:46:33,279 --> 02:46:35,920
recently talking a lot with john donahue

4777
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:37,439
from brazil

4778
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:39,279
brazilian jiu-jitsu fame i don't know if

4779
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:40,559
you know what that is yeah

4780
02:46:39,279 --> 02:46:42,640
in fact i'm talking about somebody who's

4781
02:46:40,559 --> 02:46:44,559
good at what he does yeah

4782
02:46:42,639 --> 02:46:46,318
and he speaking of somebody who's

4783
02:46:44,559 --> 02:46:48,318
open-minded the reason

4784
02:46:46,318 --> 02:46:50,318
doing this ridiculous transition is for

4785
02:46:48,318 --> 02:46:51,840
the longest time and even still

4786
02:46:50,318 --> 02:46:53,920
a lot of people believed in the jiu

4787
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:56,559
jitsu world and grappling world that

4788
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:57,840
leglocks are not effective in jujitsu

4789
02:46:56,559 --> 02:47:00,239
and he was somebody

4790
02:46:57,840 --> 02:47:01,760
that uh inspired by the open mindedness

4791
02:47:00,239 --> 02:47:04,799
of dean lister

4792
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:06,800
famously to him said why do you only

4793
02:47:04,799 --> 02:47:08,639
consider half the human body

4794
02:47:06,799 --> 02:47:10,719
when you're trying to do the submissions

4795
02:47:08,639 --> 02:47:11,278
he developed an entire system on this

4796
02:47:10,719 --> 02:47:13,599
other

4797
02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:14,800
half of the human body anyway i do that

4798
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:17,840
absurd transition

4799
02:47:14,799 --> 02:47:20,000
uh to ask you because you're uh you're

4800
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:22,239
also a student in brazilian jiu jitsu

4801
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:24,079
is there something you could say how

4802
02:47:22,239 --> 02:47:25,039
that has affected your life what you've

4803
02:47:24,079 --> 02:47:27,760
learned

4804
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:28,160
from grappling from the martial arts

4805
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:30,000
well

4806
02:47:28,159 --> 02:47:31,829
it's actually a great transition because

4807
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:33,120
i think

4808
02:47:31,829 --> 02:47:34,719
[Music]

4809
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:37,359
one of the things that's so beautiful

4810
02:47:34,719 --> 02:47:39,679
about jiu jitsu is that it

4811
02:47:37,359 --> 02:47:41,200
it does what we wish we could do in

4812
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:43,279
every other area

4813
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:44,880
of life where we're talking about this

4814
02:47:43,279 --> 02:47:47,520
difference between

4815
02:47:44,879 --> 02:47:49,679
knowledge and ignorance right like like

4816
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:51,920
there's there's no

4817
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:53,840
room for [ __ ] right you don't get

4818
02:47:51,920 --> 02:47:56,639
any credit for [ __ ]

4819
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:58,960
there's uh the difference but the

4820
02:47:56,639 --> 02:48:02,398
amazing thing about jiu jitsu is that

4821
02:47:58,959 --> 02:48:04,318
the the difference between knowing

4822
02:48:02,398 --> 02:48:06,159
what's going on and what to do and not

4823
02:48:04,318 --> 02:48:08,478
knowing it is as

4824
02:48:06,159 --> 02:48:10,398
the gulf between those two states is as

4825
02:48:08,478 --> 02:48:14,239
wide as it is in any

4826
02:48:10,398 --> 02:48:14,239
thing in in human life

4827
02:48:14,398 --> 02:48:20,079
and the it's spanned it can be spanned

4828
02:48:18,159 --> 02:48:22,318
so quickly like you you like you you

4829
02:48:20,079 --> 02:48:23,840
didn't each increment of knowledge can

4830
02:48:22,318 --> 02:48:25,600
be doled out in

4831
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:27,359
five minutes it's like here's the thing

4832
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:29,840
that got you killed

4833
02:48:27,359 --> 02:48:31,439
and here's how to here's how to prevent

4834
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:32,000
it from happening to you and here's how

4835
02:48:31,439 --> 02:48:34,318
to do it

4836
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:35,600
to others and you just get this this

4837
02:48:34,318 --> 02:48:39,039
this

4838
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:40,079
amazing cadence of discovering your

4839
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:42,479
fatal ignorance

4840
02:48:40,079 --> 02:48:43,520
and then having it remedied with the

4841
02:48:42,478 --> 02:48:47,519
actual

4842
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:48,479
technique um and i mean just

4843
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:49,600
for people who don't know what we're

4844
02:48:48,478 --> 02:48:50,559
talking about it's just like this the

4845
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:52,079
simple

4846
02:48:50,559 --> 02:48:54,478
circumstance of like someone's got you

4847
02:48:52,079 --> 02:48:56,719
in a headlock how do you get out of that

4848
02:48:54,478 --> 02:48:58,079
right someone's sitting on your chest

4849
02:48:56,719 --> 02:48:58,959
and you know they're in the mount

4850
02:48:58,079 --> 02:49:00,799
position

4851
02:48:58,959 --> 02:49:02,799
and you're on the bottom and you want to

4852
02:49:00,799 --> 02:49:04,879
get away how do you get them off you

4853
02:49:02,799 --> 02:49:07,519
they're sitting on you

4854
02:49:04,879 --> 02:49:08,239
your intuitions about how to do this are

4855
02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:09,760
terrible

4856
02:49:08,239 --> 02:49:11,520
even if you've done some other martial

4857
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:14,559
art right and

4858
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:16,159
once you learn how to do it

4859
02:49:14,559 --> 02:49:17,760
the the difference is night and day it's

4860
02:49:16,159 --> 02:49:20,559
like you have access to a completely

4861
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:20,559
different physics

4862
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:26,960
but i think our

4863
02:49:24,398 --> 02:49:27,840
understanding of the world can be much

4864
02:49:26,959 --> 02:49:30,639
more like

4865
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:33,840
jiu-jitsu than it tends to be right and

4866
02:49:30,639 --> 02:49:37,599
i think we should all

4867
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:37,600
we should all have a much better sense

4868
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:42,639
of

4869
02:49:40,318 --> 02:49:44,239
when we should tap out and when we

4870
02:49:42,639 --> 02:49:47,358
should recognize that our

4871
02:49:44,239 --> 02:49:50,239
our you know our epistemological arm

4872
02:49:47,359 --> 02:49:51,120
is barred and now being broken right now

4873
02:49:50,239 --> 02:49:54,159
the problem with

4874
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:56,000
debating most other topics is that most

4875
02:49:54,159 --> 02:49:57,840
people

4876
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:59,359
it isn't jujitsu and most people don't

4877
02:49:57,840 --> 02:50:00,639
tap out right they don't

4878
02:49:59,359 --> 02:50:02,479
even if they're wrong even if it's

4879
02:50:00,639 --> 02:50:03,439
obvious to you they're wrong and it's

4880
02:50:02,478 --> 02:50:05,438
obvious to the

4881
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:07,760
intelligent audience that they're wrong

4882
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:09,120
people just double down and double down

4883
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:10,559
they're either lying or lying to

4884
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:11,600
themselves or they're just they're

4885
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:14,000
bluffing

4886
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:15,760
and so you have a lot of zombies walking

4887
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,398
around and zombie world views walking

4888
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:19,680
around which

4889
02:50:16,398 --> 02:50:20,000
have been disconfirmed as emphatically

4890
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:22,000
as

4891
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:24,398
someone gets armbard right or someone

4892
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:27,600
gets choked out in in jiu jitsu

4893
02:50:24,398 --> 02:50:29,680
but because it's not jiu-jitsu

4894
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:31,120
they're they can they can they can live

4895
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:31,760
to fight another day right or they can

4896
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:33,359
pretend

4897
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:35,279
that they didn't lose that particular

4898
02:50:33,359 --> 02:50:37,359
argument and

4899
02:50:35,279 --> 02:50:38,800
and science when it works is a lot like

4900
02:50:37,359 --> 02:50:41,439
jiu jitsu i mean science

4901
02:50:38,799 --> 02:50:42,639
when you falsify a thesis right when you

4902
02:50:41,439 --> 02:50:44,800
think

4903
02:50:42,639 --> 02:50:46,398
you know dna is one way and it proves to

4904
02:50:44,799 --> 02:50:47,759
be another way when you when you think

4905
02:50:46,398 --> 02:50:49,278
it's um

4906
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:51,600
you know triple stranded or whatever

4907
02:50:49,279 --> 02:50:51,920
it's it's like there there is a there

4908
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:55,279
there

4909
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:59,200
and you can get to a real consensus

4910
02:50:55,279 --> 02:51:02,720
um so jiu jitsu for me it was like

4911
02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:04,319
it was more than just of interest for

4912
02:51:02,719 --> 02:51:06,239
self-defense and

4913
02:51:04,318 --> 02:51:07,920
and uh you know the the sport of it it

4914
02:51:06,239 --> 02:51:10,478
was just there was something

4915
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:11,840
it's a language and an argument you're

4916
02:51:10,478 --> 02:51:15,519
having

4917
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:17,840
where um

4918
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:18,800
you can't fool yourself anymore like

4919
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:23,680
this there's a

4920
02:51:18,799 --> 02:51:26,159
first of all it cancels any role of luck

4921
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:27,680
in a way that most uh most other other

4922
02:51:26,159 --> 02:51:29,200
athletic feats don't it's like in

4923
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:30,318
basketball you know you can even if

4924
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:31,760
you're not good at basketball you can

4925
02:51:30,318 --> 02:51:35,199
take the basketball in your hand

4926
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:36,960
you can you can be 75 feet away and

4927
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:39,520
hurl it at the basket and you might make

4928
02:51:36,959 --> 02:51:40,879
it and you could convince yourself

4929
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:42,479
based on that demonstration that you

4930
02:51:40,879 --> 02:51:43,119
have some kind of talent for basketball

4931
02:51:42,478 --> 02:51:45,039
right

4932
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:47,760
enough you know 10 minutes on the mat

4933
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:50,880
with a with a you know a real jiu-jitsu

4934
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:52,559
practitioner when you're not one

4935
02:51:50,879 --> 02:51:54,639
proves to you that you just there is

4936
02:51:52,559 --> 02:51:56,239
it's not like there's no lucky punch

4937
02:51:54,639 --> 02:51:58,000
there's no you're not going to get a l

4938
02:51:56,239 --> 02:51:59,359
you're not there's no lucky rear naked

4939
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:01,120
choke you're going to perform on someone

4940
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:03,120
who beyond you know who's

4941
02:52:01,120 --> 02:52:05,120
you know marcelo garcia or somebody it's

4942
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:08,720
just it it's not going to happen

4943
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:11,279
and having that aspect of

4944
02:52:08,719 --> 02:52:11,278
of um

4945
02:52:12,879 --> 02:52:16,000
the usual range of uncertainty and

4946
02:52:14,959 --> 02:52:19,679
self-deception

4947
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:22,000
and and [ __ ] just stripped away was

4948
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:23,920
was really a kind of revelation it was

4949
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:25,120
real it was just an amazing experience

4950
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:26,960
yeah i think it's a really powerful

4951
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:28,079
thing that accompanies whatever other

4952
02:52:26,959 --> 02:52:29,679
pursuit you have in life

4953
02:52:28,079 --> 02:52:31,359
i'm not sure if there's anything like

4954
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:33,840
jiu jitsu

4955
02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:35,359
where you could just systematically go

4956
02:52:33,840 --> 02:52:38,880
go into a place

4957
02:52:35,359 --> 02:52:41,359
where you're that's honest

4958
02:52:38,879 --> 02:52:43,039
where your beliefs get challenged in a

4959
02:52:41,359 --> 02:52:44,800
way that's conclusive

4960
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:46,319
yeah i haven't found too many other

4961
02:52:44,799 --> 02:52:48,959
mechanisms which is why

4962
02:52:46,318 --> 02:52:50,398
it's uh we had this earlier question

4963
02:52:48,959 --> 02:52:54,159
about fame and

4964
02:52:50,398 --> 02:52:56,719
ego and so on i'm very much

4965
02:52:54,159 --> 02:52:58,079
rely on jiu jitsu my own life as a place

4966
02:52:56,719 --> 02:53:02,159
where i can always go to

4967
02:52:58,079 --> 02:53:05,200
to have my ego in check and that

4968
02:53:02,159 --> 02:53:07,439
that has uh effects on how i

4969
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:10,240
live every other aspect of my life

4970
02:53:07,439 --> 02:53:13,040
actually even just doing any kind of um

4971
02:53:10,239 --> 02:53:14,639
for me personally physical challenges

4972
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:15,920
like even running doing something that's

4973
02:53:14,639 --> 02:53:18,000
way too hard

4974
02:53:15,920 --> 02:53:19,120
for me and like pushing through that's

4975
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,559
somehow humbling

4976
02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:22,840
some people talk about nature being

4977
02:53:20,559 --> 02:53:26,478
humbling in that kind of sense

4978
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:29,040
where you kind of

4979
02:53:26,478 --> 02:53:29,599
see something really powerful like the

4980
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:31,840
ocean

4981
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:33,279
like if you go surfing and you realize

4982
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:35,359
there's something much more powerful

4983
02:53:33,279 --> 02:53:38,479
than you that's also honest

4984
02:53:35,359 --> 02:53:38,800
that there's no way to uh that you're

4985
02:53:38,478 --> 02:53:40,719
just

4986
02:53:38,799 --> 02:53:41,840
like the spec that kind of puts you in

4987
02:53:40,719 --> 02:53:45,438
the right

4988
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:47,600
uh scale of where you are in this world

4989
02:53:45,439 --> 02:53:50,000
and you just does that better than

4990
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:50,000
anything else

4991
02:53:50,079 --> 02:53:53,600
we should say it's only within its frame

4992
02:53:52,639 --> 02:53:56,398
is it

4993
02:53:53,600 --> 02:53:58,399
truly the the kind of the the final

4994
02:53:56,398 --> 02:53:59,278
right answer to all the problems it

4995
02:53:58,398 --> 02:54:01,439
solves because

4996
02:53:59,279 --> 02:54:02,800
if you just put jiu jitsu into an mma

4997
02:54:01,439 --> 02:54:05,279
frame or a real

4998
02:54:02,799 --> 02:54:06,079
like a total self-defense frame then

4999
02:54:05,279 --> 02:54:08,560
there's a lot

5000
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:09,279
to a lot of unpleasant surprises to

5001
02:54:08,559 --> 02:54:11,119
discover

5002
02:54:09,279 --> 02:54:12,479
there right like somebody who thinks all

5003
02:54:11,120 --> 02:54:15,040
you need is jiu jitsu to

5004
02:54:12,478 --> 02:54:16,559
you know win the ufc it gets punched in

5005
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:20,160
the face a lot

5006
02:54:16,559 --> 02:54:22,879
you know even from uh even on the ground

5007
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:23,840
so it's um and then you bring weapons in

5008
02:54:22,879 --> 02:54:26,239
you know it's like when you

5009
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:28,239
talk to jiu jitsu people about you know

5010
02:54:26,239 --> 02:54:28,719
knife defense and self-defense right

5011
02:54:28,239 --> 02:54:31,920
like that

5012
02:54:28,719 --> 02:54:34,079
that opens the door to certain kinds of

5013
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:36,398
delusions but the analogy of martial

5014
02:54:34,079 --> 02:54:39,439
arts is is

5015
02:54:36,398 --> 02:54:40,079
fascinating because on the other side we

5016
02:54:39,439 --> 02:54:42,479
have

5017
02:54:40,079 --> 02:54:43,600
you know endless testimony now of fake

5018
02:54:42,478 --> 02:54:45,840
martial arts

5019
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:46,880
that don't seem to know they're fake and

5020
02:54:45,840 --> 02:54:49,920
are as dilute i mean

5021
02:54:46,879 --> 02:54:51,679
they're impossibly delusional i mean

5022
02:54:49,920 --> 02:54:53,359
there's great video of joe rogan

5023
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:54,720
watching some of these videos because

5024
02:54:53,359 --> 02:54:56,720
people send them to

5025
02:54:54,719 --> 02:54:57,920
them all the time but like literally

5026
02:54:56,719 --> 02:54:59,519
they're people they're people who

5027
02:54:57,920 --> 02:55:01,359
clearly believe in magic where the the

5028
02:54:59,520 --> 02:55:03,040
master isn't even touching the students

5029
02:55:01,359 --> 02:55:03,920
and they're they're flopping over so

5030
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:06,000
this this

5031
02:55:03,920 --> 02:55:07,840
there's this kind of shared delusion

5032
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:10,000
which you would think

5033
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:11,760
maybe is just a performance and it's all

5034
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:13,200
a kind of elaborate fraud but there are

5035
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:15,520
cases where

5036
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:16,800
the people and there's one you know

5037
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:17,840
fairly famous case if you're a

5038
02:55:16,799 --> 02:55:21,119
connoisseur of this

5039
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:23,040
of this madness where this older martial

5040
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:25,760
artist who you saw flipping his

5041
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:26,640
students endlessly by magic without

5042
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:28,559
touching them

5043
02:55:26,639 --> 02:55:30,079
issued a challenge to the to the wide

5044
02:55:28,559 --> 02:55:31,920
world of martial artists

5045
02:55:30,079 --> 02:55:33,600
uh and someone showed up and just you

5046
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:36,960
know punched him

5047
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:37,520
in the face until it was over um clearly

5048
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:40,639
he

5049
02:55:37,520 --> 02:55:41,920
believed his own publicity at some point

5050
02:55:40,639 --> 02:55:45,599
right and so that like

5051
02:55:41,920 --> 02:55:46,239
it is it's this amazing metaphor it

5052
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:47,920
seems

5053
02:55:46,239 --> 02:55:49,600
again it should be impossible but if

5054
02:55:47,920 --> 02:55:51,279
that's possible

5055
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:53,439
nothing we see under the guise of

5056
02:55:51,279 --> 02:55:56,079
religion or

5057
02:55:53,439 --> 02:55:56,960
or political bias or even you know

5058
02:55:56,079 --> 02:56:00,000
scientific

5059
02:55:56,959 --> 02:56:03,278
bias should be surprising to us i mean

5060
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:05,279
it's so easy to see the work that that

5061
02:56:03,279 --> 02:56:07,040
you know cognitive bias is doing for

5062
02:56:05,279 --> 02:56:09,200
people when

5063
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:11,040
when you can get someone who is ready to

5064
02:56:09,200 --> 02:56:12,640
issue a challenge to the world

5065
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:14,960
you know who thinks he's got magic

5066
02:56:12,639 --> 02:56:17,920
powers yeah that's uh

5067
02:56:14,959 --> 02:56:19,039
human nature on clear display let me ask

5068
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:21,359
you about love

5069
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:22,960
mr sam harris you did an episode of

5070
02:56:21,359 --> 02:56:26,318
making sense with your wife

5071
02:56:22,959 --> 02:56:30,318
annika harris that was very entertaining

5072
02:56:26,318 --> 02:56:31,278
too um what does what role does love

5073
02:56:30,318 --> 02:56:36,478
play

5074
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:36,479
in uh your life or in a life well lived

5075
02:56:36,559 --> 02:56:40,799
again asking from an engineering

5076
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:40,799
perspective yeah yeah

5077
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:45,120
i mean it is something that we we should

5078
02:56:44,318 --> 02:56:49,840
want to build

5079
02:56:45,120 --> 02:56:49,840
into our powerful machines

5080
02:56:50,318 --> 02:56:54,959
love at bottom is i mean love people can

5081
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:57,920
mean many things by love

5082
02:56:54,959 --> 02:56:59,039
i think i think that what we should mean

5083
02:56:57,920 --> 02:57:03,840
by it most of the time

5084
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:05,840
is a a deep commitment to the well-being

5085
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:07,760
of those we love i mean your love your

5086
02:57:05,840 --> 02:57:09,600
love is synonymous with really wanting

5087
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:12,559
the other person to be happy

5088
02:57:09,600 --> 02:57:14,399
and even wanting to and being made happy

5089
02:57:12,559 --> 02:57:15,519
by their happiness and being made happy

5090
02:57:14,398 --> 02:57:16,159
in the you know in their presence so

5091
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:18,880
like

5092
02:57:16,159 --> 02:57:20,239
you're you're at bottom you're on the

5093
02:57:18,879 --> 02:57:22,879
same team

5094
02:57:20,239 --> 02:57:24,559
emotionally even when you're you might

5095
02:57:22,879 --> 02:57:25,920
be disagreeing more superficially about

5096
02:57:24,559 --> 02:57:26,799
something or trying to negotiate

5097
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:30,318
something

5098
02:57:26,799 --> 02:57:33,039
it's just you're you

5099
02:57:30,318 --> 02:57:33,519
it can't be zero-sum in any important

5100
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:36,479
sense

5101
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:37,359
for love to actually be manifest in that

5102
02:57:36,478 --> 02:57:38,959
moment

5103
02:57:37,359 --> 02:57:40,640
see i have a different just a side

5104
02:57:38,959 --> 02:57:42,398
interrupt yeah go for it i have a

5105
02:57:40,639 --> 02:57:44,559
sense i don't know if you've ever seen

5106
02:57:42,398 --> 02:57:46,959
much of the penguins

5107
02:57:44,559 --> 02:57:47,840
my view of love is like there's it's

5108
02:57:46,959 --> 02:57:50,318
like a cold

5109
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:50,960
wind it's blown like it's like this

5110
02:57:50,318 --> 02:57:53,039
terrible

5111
02:57:50,959 --> 02:57:54,879
suffering that's all around us right and

5112
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:56,399
love is like the huddling of the two

5113
02:57:54,879 --> 02:57:58,000
penguins for warmth

5114
02:57:56,398 --> 02:58:00,719
right it's not necessarily that you're

5115
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:04,000
like you're basically escaping

5116
02:58:00,719 --> 02:58:07,358
the cruelty of life by together for

5117
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:07,920
time living in an illusion of some kind

5118
02:58:07,359 --> 02:58:10,720
of

5119
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:11,920
the the magic of human connection that

5120
02:58:10,719 --> 02:58:14,079
social connection

5121
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:15,120
that we have that kind of grows with

5122
02:58:14,079 --> 02:58:18,398
time

5123
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:21,680
as we're surrounded by

5124
02:58:18,398 --> 02:58:24,239
basically the absurdity of life or

5125
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:25,920
is the suffering of life that's why

5126
02:58:24,239 --> 02:58:28,478
they're in england

5127
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:30,079
there is that too i mean there is the

5128
02:58:28,478 --> 02:58:32,159
warmth component right like

5129
02:58:30,079 --> 02:58:34,239
you're made happy by your connection

5130
02:58:32,159 --> 02:58:36,559
with the the person you love

5131
02:58:34,239 --> 02:58:37,840
yeah otherwise you you wouldn't it

5132
02:58:36,559 --> 02:58:40,879
wouldn't be

5133
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:42,239
compelling right so it's not that you're

5134
02:58:40,879 --> 02:58:43,920
you have two different modes you want

5135
02:58:42,239 --> 02:58:45,279
them to be happy

5136
02:58:43,920 --> 02:58:48,159
and then you want to be happy yourself

5137
02:58:45,279 --> 02:58:49,680
and those are not those are just like

5138
02:58:48,159 --> 02:58:51,680
two separate games you're playing no

5139
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:53,040
it's like you you're you found someone

5140
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:56,559
who

5141
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:59,600
uh you have a you have a positive

5142
02:58:56,559 --> 02:59:01,600
social feeling i mean again the

5143
02:58:59,600 --> 02:59:03,120
love love doesn't have to be as personal

5144
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:04,479
as it tends to be for us i mean like

5145
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:07,359
there's personal love there's

5146
02:59:04,478 --> 02:59:08,639
your actual spouse or your your family

5147
02:59:07,359 --> 02:59:11,279
or your friends

5148
02:59:08,639 --> 02:59:12,318
but potentially you could feel love for

5149
02:59:11,279 --> 02:59:15,359
strangers

5150
02:59:12,318 --> 02:59:17,039
insofar as that your wish that they're

5151
02:59:15,359 --> 02:59:19,359
that they not suffer and that their

5152
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:21,120
hopes and dreams be realized becomes

5153
02:59:19,359 --> 02:59:23,840
palpable to you i mean like you can

5154
02:59:21,120 --> 02:59:23,840
actually feel

5155
02:59:26,159 --> 02:59:30,239
just tr reflects of joy at the joy of

5156
02:59:28,879 --> 02:59:32,478
others when you see someone's

5157
02:59:30,239 --> 02:59:33,760
face a total stranger's face light up in

5158
02:59:32,478 --> 02:59:36,159
happiness

5159
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:37,520
that can become more and more contagious

5160
02:59:36,159 --> 02:59:39,200
to you and it can it can

5161
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:41,120
it can become so contagious to you that

5162
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:42,880
you really feel

5163
02:59:41,120 --> 02:59:44,960
permeated by it and it's just like so

5164
02:59:42,879 --> 02:59:46,719
that so it really is not zero sum when

5165
02:59:44,959 --> 02:59:49,039
you see someone else succeed

5166
02:59:46,719 --> 02:59:50,318
you know and and they're you know the

5167
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:52,880
the light bulb of joy

5168
02:59:50,318 --> 02:59:54,079
goes off over their head you feel the

5169
02:59:52,879 --> 02:59:56,478
analogous joy

5170
02:59:54,079 --> 02:59:57,840
for them and and it's not just and

5171
02:59:56,478 --> 02:59:59,679
you're no longer keeping score you're no

5172
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:01,760
longer feeling diminished by their

5173
02:59:59,680 --> 03:00:03,279
success it's just like that's

5174
03:00:01,760 --> 03:00:05,279
their success becomes your success

5175
03:00:03,279 --> 03:00:06,399
because you feel that same joy that they

5176
03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:06,880
because you actually want them to be

5177
03:00:06,398 --> 03:00:10,398
happy

5178
03:00:06,879 --> 03:00:12,559
right you you're not there's no miserly

5179
03:00:10,398 --> 03:00:13,760
attitude around happiness there's enough

5180
03:00:12,559 --> 03:00:17,760
to go around

5181
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:18,719
um so i think love ultimately is that

5182
03:00:17,760 --> 03:00:21,520
and then our then

5183
03:00:18,719 --> 03:00:22,398
our personal cases are the people we're

5184
03:00:21,520 --> 03:00:24,479
devoting

5185
03:00:22,398 --> 03:00:25,840
all of this time and attention to in our

5186
03:00:24,478 --> 03:00:28,639
lives

5187
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:29,279
it does have that sense of refuge from

5188
03:00:28,639 --> 03:00:30,719
the storm

5189
03:00:29,279 --> 03:00:33,600
you know it's like when someone gets

5190
03:00:30,719 --> 03:00:35,199
sick or when some bad thing happens

5191
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:37,279
they're these are the people who you're

5192
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:37,680
most in it together with you know when

5193
03:00:37,279 --> 03:00:38,960
once

5194
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:42,000
or when some real condition of

5195
03:00:38,959 --> 03:00:47,438
uncertainty presents itself

5196
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:50,879
but ultimately it can't even be about

5197
03:00:47,439 --> 03:00:50,880
successfully warding off

5198
03:00:51,279 --> 03:00:55,680
uh the grim punch line at the end of

5199
03:00:54,318 --> 03:00:56,398
life because we i mean we know we're

5200
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:58,479
going to lose

5201
03:00:56,398 --> 03:01:00,318
everyone we love we know or they're

5202
03:00:58,478 --> 03:01:01,039
going to lose us first right so this

5203
03:01:00,318 --> 03:01:05,119
like it's not

5204
03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:08,319
it isn't in the end it's not even

5205
03:01:05,120 --> 03:01:11,359
an antidote for that problem it's just

5206
03:01:08,318 --> 03:01:16,079
it is just the

5207
03:01:11,359 --> 03:01:16,800
uh and we get we get to have this

5208
03:01:16,079 --> 03:01:20,239
amazing

5209
03:01:16,799 --> 03:01:24,639
experience of being here together

5210
03:01:20,239 --> 03:01:27,520
and and love is the is the

5211
03:01:24,639 --> 03:01:29,199
mode in which we really appear to make

5212
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:32,079
the most of that right where it's not

5213
03:01:29,200 --> 03:01:34,479
just it no longer feels like a a

5214
03:01:32,079 --> 03:01:36,159
solitary infatuation

5215
03:01:34,478 --> 03:01:37,840
you know you're just you've got your

5216
03:01:36,159 --> 03:01:40,639
hobbies and your interests and your

5217
03:01:37,840 --> 03:01:42,960
your and you're captivated by all that

5218
03:01:40,639 --> 03:01:46,799
it's actually

5219
03:01:42,959 --> 03:01:49,358
there there are this is a domain

5220
03:01:46,799 --> 03:01:49,840
where somebody else's well-being

5221
03:01:49,359 --> 03:01:51,920
actually

5222
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:54,079
can supersede your own your your your

5223
03:01:51,920 --> 03:01:57,200
concern for someone else's well-being

5224
03:01:54,079 --> 03:01:59,840
supersedes your own and so there's this

5225
03:01:57,200 --> 03:02:01,600
mode of self-sacrifice that doesn't even

5226
03:01:59,840 --> 03:02:02,398
feel like self-sacrifice because of

5227
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:04,640
course

5228
03:02:02,398 --> 03:02:06,239
you care more about you know of course

5229
03:02:04,639 --> 03:02:07,760
you would take your child's pain if you

5230
03:02:06,239 --> 03:02:08,879
could right like that that's that's you

5231
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:13,120
don't even have to

5232
03:02:08,879 --> 03:02:16,159
do the math on that and that's um

5233
03:02:13,120 --> 03:02:18,160
that just opens it this is the

5234
03:02:16,159 --> 03:02:20,159
kind of experience that just it it

5235
03:02:18,159 --> 03:02:21,119
pushes at the apparent boundaries of

5236
03:02:20,159 --> 03:02:22,639
self

5237
03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:24,720
in ways that reveal that there's just

5238
03:02:22,639 --> 03:02:27,358
there's just way more space in the mind

5239
03:02:24,719 --> 03:02:28,879
than than you were experiencing when it

5240
03:02:27,359 --> 03:02:30,079
was just all about you and what could

5241
03:02:28,879 --> 03:02:32,318
you what kind of what can i get

5242
03:02:30,079 --> 03:02:33,760
next and do you think we'll ever build

5243
03:02:32,318 --> 03:02:37,039
robots that we can love

5244
03:02:33,760 --> 03:02:37,680
and they will love us back well i think

5245
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:40,720
we will

5246
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:41,520
certainly seem to because we'll we'll

5247
03:02:40,719 --> 03:02:43,039
build those

5248
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:44,560
you know i mean i think i think that

5249
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:48,160
turing test will be passed

5250
03:02:44,559 --> 03:02:51,199
whether what will actually be going on

5251
03:02:48,159 --> 03:02:52,079
on the robot side uh may remain a

5252
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:54,960
question

5253
03:02:52,079 --> 03:02:55,840
that that that will be interesting but i

5254
03:02:54,959 --> 03:02:59,919
think if we just

5255
03:02:55,840 --> 03:03:02,559
keep going we will build

5256
03:02:59,920 --> 03:03:03,680
very lovable you know irresistibly

5257
03:03:02,559 --> 03:03:06,959
lovable

5258
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:09,200
robots that seem to love us yes i do i

5259
03:03:06,959 --> 03:03:11,599
do think and you don't find that

5260
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:13,600
compelling that they will seem to love

5261
03:03:11,600 --> 03:03:15,600
us as opposed to actually love us

5262
03:03:13,600 --> 03:03:17,520
you think there is still nevertheless is

5263
03:03:15,600 --> 03:03:19,200
a i know we talked about consciousness

5264
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:22,640
there being a distinction

5265
03:03:19,200 --> 03:03:25,279
but with love is there a distinction too

5266
03:03:22,639 --> 03:03:26,079
isn't love an illusion yeah you saw you

5267
03:03:25,279 --> 03:03:28,479
saw

5268
03:03:26,079 --> 03:03:30,799
ex machina right yeah i mean she

5269
03:03:28,478 --> 03:03:32,639
certainly seemed to love him until

5270
03:03:30,799 --> 03:03:35,358
she got out of the box isn't that what

5271
03:03:32,639 --> 03:03:38,559
all relationships are like

5272
03:03:35,359 --> 03:03:39,840
maybe you wait long enough

5273
03:03:38,559 --> 03:03:42,398
depends which box you're talking about

5274
03:03:39,840 --> 03:03:43,760
okay um no i mean like

5275
03:03:42,398 --> 03:03:46,000
that's that's the problem that's that's

5276
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:49,600
where super intelligence you know

5277
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:50,799
uh becomes a little scary when you

5278
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:52,640
think of the prospect of being

5279
03:03:50,799 --> 03:03:55,840
manipulated by something that has

5280
03:03:52,639 --> 03:03:58,318
is intelligent enough to form a reason

5281
03:03:55,840 --> 03:03:58,880
and a plan to manipulate you you know

5282
03:03:58,318 --> 03:04:01,600
like a

5283
03:03:58,879 --> 03:04:02,478
and this there's no there's once we

5284
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:05,920
build

5285
03:04:02,478 --> 03:04:06,398
robots that are truly out of the uncanny

5286
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:10,639
valley

5287
03:04:06,398 --> 03:04:10,639
that you know look like people and

5288
03:04:10,799 --> 03:04:14,959
can express everything people can

5289
03:04:12,639 --> 03:04:17,920
express well then there's no re

5290
03:04:14,959 --> 03:04:18,559
then then then it that does seem to me

5291
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:21,680
to be like

5292
03:04:18,559 --> 03:04:22,079
chess where once they're better they're

5293
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:26,239
they're

5294
03:04:22,079 --> 03:04:27,920
so much better at deceiving

5295
03:04:26,239 --> 03:04:29,680
us than people would be i mean people

5296
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:30,960
are already good enough at deceiving us

5297
03:04:29,680 --> 03:04:32,000
it's very hard to tell when somebody's

5298
03:04:30,959 --> 03:04:33,759
lying

5299
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:35,359
but if you can imagine something that

5300
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:39,520
could give facial

5301
03:04:35,359 --> 03:04:43,200
a facial display of any emotion it wants

5302
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:44,800
at you know on cue uh

5303
03:04:43,200 --> 03:04:46,800
because if we've perfected the facial

5304
03:04:44,799 --> 03:04:51,039
display of emotion in robots in the year

5305
03:04:46,799 --> 03:04:54,799
you know 20 70 or whatever it is um

5306
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:56,560
then it is just it is like chess against

5307
03:04:54,799 --> 03:04:58,879
the thing that isn't going to lose to a

5308
03:04:56,559 --> 03:05:00,478
human ever again in chess

5309
03:04:58,879 --> 03:05:03,119
it's not like kasparov is going to get

5310
03:05:00,478 --> 03:05:06,079
lucky next week

5311
03:05:03,120 --> 03:05:07,920
against the best against you know alpha

5312
03:05:06,079 --> 03:05:10,239
0 or whatever the best

5313
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:12,398
algorithm is at the moment he's never

5314
03:05:10,239 --> 03:05:14,559
going to win again

5315
03:05:12,398 --> 03:05:15,840
i mean that that is that i believe

5316
03:05:14,559 --> 03:05:17,600
that's true in chess

5317
03:05:15,840 --> 03:05:18,880
and has been true for at least a few

5318
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:21,680
years

5319
03:05:18,879 --> 03:05:23,278
it's not going to be like you know four

5320
03:05:21,680 --> 03:05:26,318
games to seven

5321
03:05:23,279 --> 03:05:28,239
it's gonna it's gonna be

5322
03:05:26,318 --> 03:05:29,600
human zero until the end of the world

5323
03:05:28,239 --> 03:05:31,199
right see i don't know i don't know if

5324
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:32,880
love is like chess i think uh

5325
03:05:31,200 --> 03:05:34,720
the flaws no i'm talking about

5326
03:05:32,879 --> 03:05:38,000
manipulation manipulation

5327
03:05:34,719 --> 03:05:41,519
but i don't know if love and so

5328
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:41,520
the kind of love we're referring to

5329
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:45,279
if we have a if we have a robot that can

5330
03:05:43,359 --> 03:05:48,318
display credibly display

5331
03:05:45,279 --> 03:05:51,600
love and is

5332
03:05:48,318 --> 03:05:53,680
super intelligent and

5333
03:05:51,600 --> 03:05:54,880
we're not we're again we this stipulates

5334
03:05:53,680 --> 03:05:56,159
a few things but there are a few simple

5335
03:05:54,879 --> 03:05:58,398
things i mean we're out of the

5336
03:05:56,159 --> 03:05:59,520
uncanny valley right so it's like yes

5337
03:05:58,398 --> 03:06:01,199
you never have a moment where you're

5338
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:03,359
looking at his face and you think oh

5339
03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:04,319
that didn't quite look right right this

5340
03:06:03,359 --> 03:06:07,359
is just

5341
03:06:04,318 --> 03:06:11,199
problem solved and

5342
03:06:07,359 --> 03:06:13,359
it's it will be like

5343
03:06:11,200 --> 03:06:14,640
doing arithmetic on your phone it's not

5344
03:06:13,359 --> 03:06:16,399
going to be you're not

5345
03:06:14,639 --> 03:06:17,840
left thinking is it really going to get

5346
03:06:16,398 --> 03:06:21,119
it this time if i

5347
03:06:17,840 --> 03:06:23,200
divide by seven i mean it's

5348
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:24,399
it has solved arithmetic see i don't i

5349
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:26,319
don't know about that because if you

5350
03:06:24,398 --> 03:06:29,439
look at chess

5351
03:06:26,318 --> 03:06:32,239
most humans no longer play

5352
03:06:29,439 --> 03:06:33,600
uh alpha zero they don't there's no

5353
03:06:32,239 --> 03:06:35,199
they're not part of the competition they

5354
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:35,920
don't do it for fun except to study the

5355
03:06:35,200 --> 03:06:37,359
game of chess

5356
03:06:35,920 --> 03:06:39,680
you know the highest level chess players

5357
03:06:37,359 --> 03:06:42,720
do that we're still human on human

5358
03:06:39,680 --> 03:06:43,520
so in order for ai to get integrated to

5359
03:06:42,719 --> 03:06:45,438
where

5360
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:46,880
you would rather play chess against an

5361
03:06:45,439 --> 03:06:48,398
ai system well

5362
03:06:46,879 --> 03:06:49,920
you would rather that no no i'm not

5363
03:06:48,398 --> 03:06:52,159
saying i i don't know

5364
03:06:49,920 --> 03:06:53,600
manipulation on that i'm just saying

5365
03:06:52,159 --> 03:06:55,359
what is it going to be like to be in

5366
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:59,840
relationship to something

5367
03:06:55,359 --> 03:07:03,359
that can seem to be feeling

5368
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:06,398
anything that a human can seem to feel

5369
03:07:03,359 --> 03:07:08,399
and it can do that impeccably

5370
03:07:06,398 --> 03:07:10,239
right and has end is smarter than you

5371
03:07:08,398 --> 03:07:13,039
are right that's

5372
03:07:10,239 --> 03:07:14,639
that's a circumstance of you know

5373
03:07:13,040 --> 03:07:17,760
insofar as it's possible to be

5374
03:07:14,639 --> 03:07:18,559
manipulated that is the that is the the

5375
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:21,680
asymptote

5376
03:07:18,559 --> 03:07:24,000
of of that possibility let me ask you

5377
03:07:21,680 --> 03:07:26,239
the last question

5378
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:27,040
without any serving it up without any

5379
03:07:26,239 --> 03:07:30,239
explanation

5380
03:07:27,040 --> 03:07:30,240
what is the meaning of life

5381
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:37,120
i think it is either the wrong question

5382
03:07:34,318 --> 03:07:39,840
or that question is answered

5383
03:07:37,120 --> 03:07:39,840
by

5384
03:07:40,239 --> 03:07:43,920
paying sufficient attention to any

5385
03:07:42,719 --> 03:07:48,478
present moment

5386
03:07:43,920 --> 03:07:50,478
such that there's no there's no

5387
03:07:48,478 --> 03:07:52,079
basis upon which to to pose that

5388
03:07:50,478 --> 03:07:53,519
question it's not answered in the usual

5389
03:07:52,079 --> 03:07:54,799
way it's not it's not a matter of having

5390
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:58,079
more information

5391
03:07:54,799 --> 03:08:00,959
it's it's having more engagement

5392
03:07:58,079 --> 03:08:02,719
with reality as it is in the present

5393
03:08:00,959 --> 03:08:03,519
moment or consciousness as it is in the

5394
03:08:02,719 --> 03:08:07,278
present moment

5395
03:08:03,520 --> 03:08:10,399
you don't ask that question when you're

5396
03:08:07,279 --> 03:08:13,680
most captivated by the most important

5397
03:08:10,398 --> 03:08:15,840
thing you ever pay attention to it

5398
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:17,279
that's a that's a question only gets

5399
03:08:15,840 --> 03:08:20,239
asked

5400
03:08:17,279 --> 03:08:22,640
when you're abstracted away from that

5401
03:08:20,239 --> 03:08:26,159
experience that peak experience

5402
03:08:22,639 --> 03:08:28,799
and you're left wondering why are

5403
03:08:26,159 --> 03:08:30,639
so many of my other experiences mediocre

5404
03:08:28,799 --> 03:08:32,398
right like why am i repeating the same

5405
03:08:30,639 --> 03:08:36,079
pleasures every day why do

5406
03:08:32,398 --> 03:08:37,599
why is my netflix queue just like

5407
03:08:36,079 --> 03:08:39,359
when's this going to run out like i've

5408
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:40,640
seen so many shows like this am i really

5409
03:08:39,359 --> 03:08:43,680
going to watch another one like

5410
03:08:40,639 --> 03:08:45,358
you're all of that that's a moment where

5411
03:08:43,680 --> 03:08:49,520
you're

5412
03:08:45,359 --> 03:08:51,680
not actually having the beatific vision

5413
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:53,439
right you're not you're you're not sunk

5414
03:08:51,680 --> 03:08:54,960
into the present moment and

5415
03:08:53,439 --> 03:08:56,880
you're not truly in love like you're in

5416
03:08:54,959 --> 03:08:57,759
a relationship with somebody who you

5417
03:08:56,879 --> 03:09:00,159
know

5418
03:08:57,760 --> 03:09:01,439
you know conceptually you love right

5419
03:09:00,159 --> 03:09:03,359
this is the person you're

5420
03:09:01,439 --> 03:09:04,800
living your life with but you don't

5421
03:09:03,359 --> 03:09:07,600
actually feel good together

5422
03:09:04,799 --> 03:09:08,239
right like if you if you so like it's

5423
03:09:07,600 --> 03:09:12,960
it's in

5424
03:09:08,239 --> 03:09:15,279
in those moments of where attention

5425
03:09:12,959 --> 03:09:16,719
hasn't found a good enough reason to

5426
03:09:15,279 --> 03:09:20,079
truly sink

5427
03:09:16,719 --> 03:09:23,358
into the present so as to obviate any

5428
03:09:20,079 --> 03:09:25,200
any concern like that right and

5429
03:09:23,359 --> 03:09:28,479
that's what that's why meditation is

5430
03:09:25,200 --> 03:09:32,239
this kind of superpower because

5431
03:09:28,478 --> 03:09:34,799
until you learn to meditate you think

5432
03:09:32,238 --> 03:09:36,238
you're like the outside world or the

5433
03:09:34,799 --> 03:09:39,519
circumstances of your life

5434
03:09:36,238 --> 03:09:41,520
always have to get arranged so that

5435
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:44,238
the present moment can become good

5436
03:09:41,520 --> 03:09:47,040
enough to to demand your attention

5437
03:09:44,238 --> 03:09:49,520
in a in a a way that makes that seems

5438
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:52,080
fulfilling that that makes you happy

5439
03:09:49,520 --> 03:09:53,760
and so if you're if it's jiu-jitsu you

5440
03:09:52,079 --> 03:09:54,159
think okay i gotta get back on the mat

5441
03:09:53,760 --> 03:09:56,000
it's been

5442
03:09:54,159 --> 03:09:57,600
it's been months since i've trained you

5443
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:58,879
know it's been over a year since i've

5444
03:09:57,600 --> 03:10:00,640
trained it's coveted

5445
03:09:58,879 --> 03:10:03,199
when am i going to be able to to train

5446
03:10:00,639 --> 03:10:06,238
again that's the only place i feel

5447
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:07,120
great right or you know i've got a ton

5448
03:10:06,238 --> 03:10:08,398
of work to do

5449
03:10:07,120 --> 03:10:09,840
i'm not going to be able to feel good

5450
03:10:08,398 --> 03:10:10,719
until i get all this work done right so

5451
03:10:09,840 --> 03:10:13,760
i've got some

5452
03:10:10,719 --> 03:10:16,318
deadline that's coming you always think

5453
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:18,079
that your life has to change the world

5454
03:10:16,318 --> 03:10:20,719
has to change

5455
03:10:18,079 --> 03:10:22,079
so that you can finally have a good

5456
03:10:20,719 --> 03:10:25,278
enough excuse

5457
03:10:22,079 --> 03:10:27,359
to truly to to just be

5458
03:10:25,279 --> 03:10:29,359
here and hear is enough you know that

5459
03:10:27,359 --> 03:10:31,920
where the present moment becomes

5460
03:10:29,359 --> 03:10:32,399
totally captivating meditation is the

5461
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:35,120
only

5462
03:10:32,398 --> 03:10:36,879
i mean meditation is another name for

5463
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:38,160
the discovery

5464
03:10:36,879 --> 03:10:40,000
that you can actually just train

5465
03:10:38,159 --> 03:10:41,840
yourself to do that on demand

5466
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:43,920
so that like i mean just looking at a

5467
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:47,200
cup can be good enough

5468
03:10:43,920 --> 03:10:50,478
in precisely that way and any

5469
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:50,479
sense that it might not be

5470
03:10:50,639 --> 03:10:56,318
is recognized to be a thought that

5471
03:10:54,079 --> 03:10:58,159
is mysteriously unravels the moment you

5472
03:10:56,318 --> 03:11:01,119
notice it and then and you fall

5473
03:10:58,159 --> 03:11:02,238
and that the moment expands and becomes

5474
03:11:01,120 --> 03:11:05,120
more diaphanous

5475
03:11:02,238 --> 03:11:06,079
and then there's no then there's no

5476
03:11:05,120 --> 03:11:07,520
evidence

5477
03:11:06,079 --> 03:11:08,959
that this isn't the best moment of your

5478
03:11:07,520 --> 03:11:10,960
life right like this it doesn't and

5479
03:11:08,959 --> 03:11:12,079
again it doesn't have to be

5480
03:11:10,959 --> 03:11:13,919
it doesn't have to be pulling all the

5481
03:11:12,079 --> 03:11:14,799
reins and levers of pleasure it's not

5482
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:16,960
like

5483
03:11:14,799 --> 03:11:18,238
oh my this tastes like chocolate you

5484
03:11:16,959 --> 03:11:20,238
know this is the most chocolatey moment

5485
03:11:18,238 --> 03:11:22,799
of my life no it's just

5486
03:11:20,238 --> 03:11:23,279
the the sense data don't have to change

5487
03:11:22,799 --> 03:11:26,398
but

5488
03:11:23,279 --> 03:11:29,840
the sense that there is some kind of

5489
03:11:26,398 --> 03:11:30,639
basis for doubt about the rightness of

5490
03:11:29,840 --> 03:11:33,760
being

5491
03:11:30,639 --> 03:11:34,639
in the world in this moment that can

5492
03:11:33,760 --> 03:11:37,840
evaporate

5493
03:11:34,639 --> 03:11:40,159
when you pay attention and

5494
03:11:37,840 --> 03:11:41,680
that is the meaning of the kind of the

5495
03:11:40,159 --> 03:11:44,719
meta answer to that question

5496
03:11:41,680 --> 03:11:48,238
the meaning of life for me is to

5497
03:11:44,719 --> 03:11:50,959
live in that mode more and more and to

5498
03:11:48,238 --> 03:11:51,359
whenever i notice i'm not in that mode

5499
03:11:50,959 --> 03:11:53,759
to

5500
03:11:51,359 --> 03:11:54,399
recognize it and return and and to not

5501
03:11:53,760 --> 03:11:57,600
be

5502
03:11:54,398 --> 03:12:01,599
to to to cease

5503
03:11:57,600 --> 03:12:04,800
more and more to take the reasons why

5504
03:12:01,600 --> 03:12:05,359
reasons why not uh at face value because

5505
03:12:04,799 --> 03:12:08,159
we all have

5506
03:12:05,359 --> 03:12:08,960
reasons why we can't be fulfilled in

5507
03:12:08,159 --> 03:12:10,559
this moment

5508
03:12:08,959 --> 03:12:11,919
it's like this i've got all these

5509
03:12:10,559 --> 03:12:12,318
outstanding things that i'm worried

5510
03:12:11,920 --> 03:12:14,398
about

5511
03:12:12,318 --> 03:12:15,760
right it's like it's you know there's

5512
03:12:14,398 --> 03:12:17,278
there's that

5513
03:12:15,760 --> 03:12:19,600
thing that's happening later today that

5514
03:12:17,279 --> 03:12:20,880
i you know i'm anxious about whatever it

5515
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:24,159
is

5516
03:12:20,879 --> 03:12:27,278
we're constantly deferring our sense of

5517
03:12:24,159 --> 03:12:30,318
this is this is it you know this is not

5518
03:12:27,279 --> 03:12:33,359
a dress rehearsal this is the show

5519
03:12:30,318 --> 03:12:34,879
we keep deferring it and we just have

5520
03:12:33,359 --> 03:12:36,238
these moments on the calendar where we

5521
03:12:34,879 --> 03:12:38,238
think okay this is this is where it's

5522
03:12:36,238 --> 03:12:40,799
all going to land it's that vacation i

5523
03:12:38,238 --> 03:12:42,478
planned with my five best friends you

5524
03:12:40,799 --> 03:12:43,438
know we do this once every three years

5525
03:12:42,478 --> 03:12:47,840
and now we're going

5526
03:12:43,439 --> 03:12:47,840
and here we are on the beach together

5527
03:12:47,920 --> 03:12:51,520
unless you have a mind that can really

5528
03:12:50,559 --> 03:12:54,079
pay attention

5529
03:12:51,520 --> 03:12:55,760
really cut through the chatter really

5530
03:12:54,079 --> 03:12:58,398
sink into the present moment

5531
03:12:55,760 --> 03:13:00,000
you can't even enjoy those moments the

5532
03:12:58,398 --> 03:13:01,920
way they should be enjoyed the way you

5533
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:05,520
dreamed you would enjoy them

5534
03:13:01,920 --> 03:13:07,040
when they arrive so it's i mean so it's

5535
03:13:05,520 --> 03:13:08,238
a meditation in the sense it's the great

5536
03:13:07,040 --> 03:13:10,080
equalizer it's like

5537
03:13:08,238 --> 03:13:12,478
it's you don't have to you don't have to

5538
03:13:10,079 --> 03:13:15,200
live with the illusion anymore

5539
03:13:12,478 --> 03:13:16,559
that you need a good enough reason and

5540
03:13:15,200 --> 03:13:18,319
things are going to get better when you

5541
03:13:16,559 --> 03:13:20,879
do have those good reasons it's like

5542
03:13:18,318 --> 03:13:22,719
there's just a mirage-like quality to

5543
03:13:20,879 --> 03:13:25,278
every future attainment

5544
03:13:22,719 --> 03:13:27,199
and every future breakthrough and every

5545
03:13:25,279 --> 03:13:31,520
future peak experience

5546
03:13:27,200 --> 03:13:34,479
that eventually you get the lesson that

5547
03:13:31,520 --> 03:13:36,399
you never quite arrive right like you

5548
03:13:34,478 --> 03:13:38,639
you won't you don't you don't

5549
03:13:36,398 --> 03:13:40,478
arrive until you cease to step over the

5550
03:13:38,639 --> 03:13:44,000
present moment in search of

5551
03:13:40,478 --> 03:13:47,119
the next thing i mean we're constantly

5552
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:48,238
we're stepping over the thing that we

5553
03:13:47,120 --> 03:13:51,439
think we're

5554
03:13:48,238 --> 03:13:53,039
seeking in the act of seeking it and so

5555
03:13:51,439 --> 03:13:56,000
it is kind of a paradox

5556
03:13:53,040 --> 03:13:56,479
i mean there is a there's this paradox

5557
03:13:56,000 --> 03:14:00,238
that

5558
03:13:56,478 --> 03:14:01,358
which i mean it sounds trite but it's

5559
03:14:00,238 --> 03:14:04,398
like you you can't

5560
03:14:01,359 --> 03:14:07,439
actually become happy

5561
03:14:04,398 --> 03:14:09,358
you can only be happy and and and it's

5562
03:14:07,439 --> 03:14:10,800
that it's the illusion that because

5563
03:14:09,359 --> 03:14:14,559
it's the loot it's the illusion that

5564
03:14:10,799 --> 03:14:16,799
your future being happy

5565
03:14:14,559 --> 03:14:18,079
can be predicated on this act of

5566
03:14:16,799 --> 03:14:20,238
becoming

5567
03:14:18,079 --> 03:14:21,760
in any domain you know and becoming

5568
03:14:20,238 --> 03:14:23,520
includes this sort of

5569
03:14:21,760 --> 03:14:24,880
you know further under further

5570
03:14:23,520 --> 03:14:26,000
scientific understanding on the

5571
03:14:24,879 --> 03:14:29,039
questions that interest you

5572
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:31,040
or you know um getting

5573
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:33,120
in better shape or whatever the thing is

5574
03:14:31,040 --> 03:14:33,840
whatever the whatever the contingency of

5575
03:14:33,120 --> 03:14:35,840
your

5576
03:14:33,840 --> 03:14:38,159
dissatisfaction seems to be in any

5577
03:14:35,840 --> 03:14:41,840
present moment

5578
03:14:38,159 --> 03:14:45,520
real attention solves the koan

5579
03:14:41,840 --> 03:14:47,520
you know in in a way that

5580
03:14:45,520 --> 03:14:48,560
becomes a very different place from

5581
03:14:47,520 --> 03:14:51,520
which to then make

5582
03:14:48,559 --> 03:14:53,199
any further change it's not that you

5583
03:14:51,520 --> 03:14:54,800
just have to dissolve into a puddle of

5584
03:14:53,200 --> 03:14:56,239
goo i mean you can still get in shape

5585
03:14:54,799 --> 03:14:57,920
and you can still do all the things that

5586
03:14:56,238 --> 03:15:00,959
you know the superficial things that

5587
03:14:57,920 --> 03:15:02,478
are obviously good to do but the sense

5588
03:15:00,959 --> 03:15:06,879
that

5589
03:15:02,478 --> 03:15:10,959
your well-being is over there is um

5590
03:15:06,879 --> 03:15:12,559
really does diminish and eventually

5591
03:15:10,959 --> 03:15:14,000
just becomes a it becomes a kind of

5592
03:15:12,559 --> 03:15:17,119
non-sequitur

5593
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:20,398
so well there's a sense in which

5594
03:15:17,120 --> 03:15:21,840
in this conversation actually

5595
03:15:20,398 --> 03:15:24,079
experienced many of those things

5596
03:15:21,840 --> 03:15:25,520
the sense that i've arrived so i

5597
03:15:24,079 --> 03:15:27,359
mentioned to you offline

5598
03:15:25,520 --> 03:15:29,359
it's very true that i start i've been a

5599
03:15:27,359 --> 03:15:32,960
fan of yours for many years

5600
03:15:29,359 --> 03:15:35,200
and the reason i started this podcast

5601
03:15:32,959 --> 03:15:36,799
speaking of ai systems is to manipulate

5602
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:37,920
you sam harrison to doing this

5603
03:15:36,799 --> 03:15:40,238
conversation

5604
03:15:37,920 --> 03:15:41,840
so like on the calendar literally you

5605
03:15:40,238 --> 03:15:42,398
know i've always had the sense people

5606
03:15:41,840 --> 03:15:44,478
ask me

5607
03:15:42,398 --> 03:15:46,559
when are you going to talk to sam harris

5608
03:15:44,478 --> 03:15:49,438
and i always answered eventually

5609
03:15:46,559 --> 03:15:51,039
right because i always felt again tying

5610
03:15:49,439 --> 03:15:52,079
our free will thing that somehow that's

5611
03:15:51,040 --> 03:15:54,239
going to happen

5612
03:15:52,079 --> 03:15:56,159
i and it's one of those manifestation

5613
03:15:54,238 --> 03:15:58,000
things or something i don't know if it's

5614
03:15:56,159 --> 03:16:00,159
maybe i am a robot i'm just not

5615
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:01,680
cognizant of it and i manipulated you

5616
03:16:00,159 --> 03:16:02,959
into having this conversation so it was

5617
03:16:01,680 --> 03:16:04,639
a

5618
03:16:02,959 --> 03:16:06,159
i mean i don't know what the purpose of

5619
03:16:04,639 --> 03:16:08,398
my life past this point is

5620
03:16:06,159 --> 03:16:10,478
so if i've arrived so in that sense i

5621
03:16:08,398 --> 03:16:13,039
mean all that to say

5622
03:16:10,478 --> 03:16:13,679
uh i'm only partially joking on that uh

5623
03:16:13,040 --> 03:16:15,920
is

5624
03:16:13,680 --> 03:16:17,520
it really uh is a huge honor that you

5625
03:16:15,920 --> 03:16:19,120
would waste this time with me yeah

5626
03:16:17,520 --> 03:16:21,279
well it really means a lot listen it's

5627
03:16:19,120 --> 03:16:23,040

in this world on on your podcast and

5634
03:16:34,238 --> 03:16:38,639
you're doing it differently than

5635
03:16:36,079 --> 03:16:39,120
than rogan's doing it or that i'm doing
