00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,839
the following is a conversation with

00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,919
neil stephenson a legendary science

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,320
fiction writer exploring ideas in

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,800
mathematics science cryptography money

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,679
linguistics philosophy and virtual

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,960
reality from his early book snow crash

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,519
to his new one called termination shock

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,839
he doesn't just write novels he worked

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,000
at the space company blue origin for

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,079
many years including

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,960
technically being blue origin's first

12
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,598
employee he also was the chief futurist

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
at the virtual reality company magic

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,119

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,120

00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,519
in the description

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,359
and now here's my conversation with neil

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,000
stevenson

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,679
you write both historical fiction like

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,640
world war ii in

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,479
kryptonomicon and science fiction

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
looking both into the past and the

24
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,959
future so let me ask

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,640
does history repeat itself in which way

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,600
does it repeat itself in which way does

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,878
it not

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,439
i'm afraid it repeats itself a lot um so

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,359
i i think human nature kind of is what

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,079
it is and so

31
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,599
we tend to see similar behavior patterns

32
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,640
emerging again and again and so

33
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,478
it's it's kind of the uh exception

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840
rather than the rule when something new

35
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,159
happens

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,840
what role does technology play in the

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,880
suppression or in revealing human nature

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,920
well the standards of living life

39
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,959
expectancy all that have gotten

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,799
incredibly better within the last

41
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,039
particularly the last hundred years i

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,720
mean just antibiotics

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,880
modern vaccines

44
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,280
electrification

45
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,280
the internet these are all

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,960
improvements in most people's standard

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
of living and health

48
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,000
and longevity that

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,280
that exceed anything that was seen

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
before in in human history

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,399
so so people are living longer they're

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,799
generally healthier and so on but again

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,959
we still see a lot of the same behavior

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
patterns some of which are

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,400
not very attractive

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,559
so some of it has to do with the

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,239
constraints on resources presumably with

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,560
technology you have less and less

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,800
constraints on resources so

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
we get to maybe emphasize the better

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,120
angels of our nature

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,480
and in in so doing does that not

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
potentially

64
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,679
fundamentally alter the sort of

65
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,399
the experience that we have of life on

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,920
earth you know until the last 10 or so

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,959
years i would have

68
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,479
taken that view i think but um

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,319
you know

70
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:47,039
people who will find ways to be

71
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,839
to be divisive and angry

72
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,318
if it scratches a kind of psychological

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,519
itch that they have got and

74
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:57,518
we used to look at the weimar republic

75
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,800
what happened in the economic collapse

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,800
of germany prior to

77
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,199
the the rise of hitler

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
world war ii

79
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,199
[Music]

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
and kind of

81
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,679
explain

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,400
hitler at least partially by

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,879
just the the misery that people were

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,959
living in at that time

85
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,479
the economic collapse yeah

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,519
hyperinflation

87
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,518
and unemployment and um the

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
the decline in standard of living and

89
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,560
that sounds like a plausible

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,120
uh explanation but there are economic

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,080
troubles now for sure we had the bank

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,920
collapse in 2008

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,840
and there's stagnation

94
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,000
in some people's standards of living but

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,759
it's hard to explain what we've seen in

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,959
this country in the last few years just

97
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,280
strictly on the basis of people are poor

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,000
and angry and sad

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,120
i think they want to be angry

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,840
so

101
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,120
without being political in a divisive

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,039
kind of way

103
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,599
can we talk about the lessons you can

104
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,679
draw from world war ii

105
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,000
sure this singular event in human

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
history it seems like yeah and yet as

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,959
you say

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,640
history rhymes

109
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,920
at the very least yeah

110
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,679
being who i am i tend to focus on the

111
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,959
curious technological things that

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,918
happened in in conjunction with that war

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,519
um

114
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,439
which may not be where you want to go

115
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,240
but uh well there's several things

116
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,399
inside to interrupt so one in crypto

117
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,439
nomicon is more like the alan turing

118
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,439
side of things right right and then

119
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,879
and then there's the

120
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,319
outside of technology

121
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,319
first of all there's the tools of war

122
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,159
which is the kind of technology but then

123
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,879
there's just like the human nature the

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,360
nature of good and evil yeah well so one

125
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,759
of the things that emerges from

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,840
uh from the war and from the um the

127
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,720
extermination camps is that we we're

128
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,039
never allowed to have illusions anymore

129
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,639
about human nature

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,520
so you you have to to learn that lesson

131
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,519
to be

132
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,719
an educated person and you have to know

133
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,120
that

134
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
that even in a supposedly you know

135
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,879
enlightened civilized society people can

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,400
become monsters

137
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,439
quite easily

138
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:17,439
so that is for sure the big takeaway so

139
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,680
do you agree with solzhenitsyn about the

140
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,680
what is it uh

141
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,478
the line between good and evil runs

142
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,079
through the heart of every man yeah that

143
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,839
all of us are capable great line yeah

144
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,000
i read

145
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,879
a good chunk of the gulag archipelago

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,800
when i was a teenager um because my my

147
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,800
grandfather had it in his house because

148
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,038
he was one of these

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,520
americans who was obsessed with the

150
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,199
soviet union and the soviet threat

151
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,079
and and wanted

152
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,960
people to to be aware of some of what

153
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,519
what had happened um and so

154
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,279
so he had those books lying around and

155
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,599
and uh you know i would i would read

156
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,239
them and it's a similar

157
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,400
kind of parallel story to the

158
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,560
to what happened in in in germany during

159
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,478
the war you know this creation of this

160
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,959
system of camps and and oppression and

161
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,360
and uh lots of um

162
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:16,239
troubling behavior

163
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,800
to me it's a story of um

164
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,360
how fear and desperation

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
combined with a charismatic leader can

166
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,000
lead

167
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:28,799
to uh to evil but it's also a story of

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,199
of bravery of of love of brother

169
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,600
brotherhood and sisterhood and

170
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,919
basically survival you have like a man

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,639
search for meaning which is the stories

172
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,399
of uh the story of a man

173
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,400
in a concentration camp

174
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,679
basically finding beauty in life even

175
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,478
under

176
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,800
uh most extreme conditions so to me

177
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,478
world war ii is not necessarily

178
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,280
um

179
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:56,079
a bleak view of human nature

180
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,879
it's it's a little

181
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:00,399
moment of evil that revealed a much

182
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,399
bigger

183
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:05,038
good mm-hmm in humanity

184
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,120
so i'm not i'm not so sure that it leads

185
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,879
me to a pessimistic view of the world

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,439
the fact that uh somebody like hitler

187
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,759
could happen the fact that uh

188
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,360
a lot of people could follow hitler and

189
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,000
get excited and maybe even love the hate

190
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
of the other yeah for some moment of

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,478
time

192
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,038
i think that's

193
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:28,000
all of us are capable of that but i

194
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,879
think all of us also have a capacity for

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,879
good

196
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,519
and i think i don't know what you what

197
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,319
you think but i think we

198
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,279
have a greater desire for good

199
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,840
than evil and that it seems like that's

200
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,279
where technology is very useful as a

201
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,918
guide

202
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,399
has a helping hand okay okay can you

203
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,560
give me an example maybe

204
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,799
so i give you examples of futuristic

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,160
technologies and i can give you examples

206
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,840
of current technologies current

207
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,840
technologies

208
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,560
uh

209
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,239
knowledge

210
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
uh in the form of

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,240
very basic knowledge which is like

212
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,199
wikipedia

213
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,160
and

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,319
search the original dream of google yeah

215
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,360
that i think is very much a success

216
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,879
which is

217
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,960
making the world's information

218
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,639
accessible at your fingertips

219
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,159
that kind of

220
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,478
technology

221
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,240
enables the natural

222
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,560
if if this

223
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,439
axiom this assumption that people want

224
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,360
to do good is is true yeah then

225
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,598
letting them discover all of the

226
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,759
information out there false information

227
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,319
and true information all of it

228
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,838
and let them explore that's going to

229
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,560
lead to a better world to better people

230
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,399
uh futuristic technologies is

231
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,639
uh i personally

232
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,360
i mentioned you offline sort of love

233
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:52,559
artificial intelligence and so

234
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,120
ai that's an assistant that's a guide

235
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,719
like a mentor to you yeah that you can

236
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,799
in the way that

237
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,680
google searches but smarter where you

238
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,519
can help send it out and say

239
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,159
this is the direction in which i want to

240
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,240
grow not

241
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,719
authoritarian lecturing down from the

242
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,278
algorithm of telling you this is what

243
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,639
this is how you should grow but almost

244
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,759
uh the the opposite where you use it as

245
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,278
um

246
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,399
an assistant a a servant in your journey

247
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,480
towards knowledge

248
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,159
yeah that that sounds like an easy thing

249
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,159
but it's actually from an absolutely

250
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,639
very difficult i mean

251
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,399
this is the theme of a book i wrote

252
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,480
called the diamond age which you know

253
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,440
talks about a book that essentially does

254
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,639
that

255
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,560
and i've been sort of watching people

256
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,799
try to come at the the problem of

257
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,639
building that thing uh from different

258
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,199
directions for

259
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,120
ever since the book came out basically

260
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
um and so

261
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,480
uh the uh

262
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,479
and so i i kind of have a although i

263
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,200
haven't worked on it myself i do get a

264
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,120
sense of the the level of difficulty

265
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,959
in in realizing that

266
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,959
that that goal

267
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,000
um so that book is in the 90s so as

268
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,838
google

269
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,039
is coming to be

270
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,120
essentially

271
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,278
uh not google but the search engine the

272
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,039
initial search engines event which gave

273
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,559
birth to google essentially in in

274
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,559
contrast

275
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:21,199
right yeah yeah that was still in the

276
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,919
era of alta vista and ask jeeves and

277
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,839
multiple different uh search

278
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,078
engines and yeah i'm pretty sure i had

279
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,800
not heard of google at that point that

280
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,120
would have been 95 96 i think the book

281
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,799
came out in 94.

282
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,278
and then of course the social networks

283
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,559
followed which is another form

284
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,000
of um

285
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:41,838
guidance through the space of

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,078
information yeah

287
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,000
well what happens is that these things

288
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,919
come along and then people find ways to

289
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,480
game them

290
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:53,120
and so i saw an interesting thread the

291
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,159
other day pointing out that

292
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,480
you know

293
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,480
20 years ago if you had googled

294
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,759
pythagorean theorem

295
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,599
uh

296
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,240
chances are you would have been taken

297
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,720
directly to the page explaining the

298
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,480
pythagorean theorem if you do it now

299
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,079
you're probably going to

300
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,159
the top hits are going to be from

301
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,838
somebody who's who's got an angle who's

302
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,078
got a scheme right they're like trying

303
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,720
to sell you math tutoring

304
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,958
or you know they're

305
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,800
they're working some kind of marketing

306
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,919
plan on you

307
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,799
so

308
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,278
the the traditional engines become

309
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,759
actually less useful over time for their

310
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,879
original educational

311
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,720
purpose

312
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,799
that doesn't mean that they can't

313
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,879
it shouldn't be replaced by newer and

314
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,799
better ones

315
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,639
first of all to defend the people with

316
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,439
the angle

317
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,199
right

318
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,399
they're trying to find business models

319
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,639
yeah fund

320
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,519
oftentimes which is funny you went with

321
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,240
i think

322
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,039
like you went at math

323
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,720
those greedy bastards

324
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:02,000
but it's great it's great how can we

325
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,800
monetize the pythagorean theorem yeah

326
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,360
well

327
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,639
i mean education right yes to figure out

328
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,240
like

329
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,600
people who love math education for

330
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,959
example

331
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,560
love it purely not purely but very often

332
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,599
love it

333
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,838
for itself for just teaching math yeah

334
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
but then they start

335
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,360
you know when coming face to face with

336
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,200
for example like the youtube algorithm

337
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,919
they start to try to figure out okay how

338
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,000
can i make money off of this the the

339
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,958
primary goal is still

340
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,919
that love of education but they also

341
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,719
want to to make that love of education

342
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,039
of their full-time job but

343
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,480
i see that sort of that dance of

344
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,799
humanity with the algorithms as uh it

345
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,440
finds this kind of local pocket of

346
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,000
optimality that's or sub-optimality

347
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,639
whatever yeah it gets stuck in it anyway

348
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
it's a pocket of some sort and but i see

349
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,278
that pocket is way better than what we

350
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,078
had before

351
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,639
in the 80s right 90s before the internet

352
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,120
but like and now we're now this is this

353
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,000
is also human nature we start uh writing

354
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,078
very eloquent articles about how

355
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,399
this pocket is clearly pocket it's not

356
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:15,359
very good and we can imagine much better

357
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,039
lands far beyond and but the reality is

358
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,560
it's better than before yeah and now

359
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,199
we're waiting for

360
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,838
we have to escape yeah minimum and you

361
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,680
have to wait either for lone geniuses or

362
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,320
for some kind of momentum of a group of

363
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,719
geniuses that just say enough is enough

364
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,320
i have an idea yeah this is how we get

365
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,720
out and it's too easy to be sort of i

366
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,639
think uh partially because you can get a

367
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,399
lot of clicks in your articles being

368
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,039
cynical about being in this pocket and

369
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,679
we were forever stuck in this pocket and

370
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,559
then like coming up with this grandiose

371
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,239
theory that humanity has finally

372
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,159
like is collapsing

373
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
stuck forever like a prison in this

374
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,639
pocket but reality they're just it's

375
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,959
like it's just clickbait articles and

376
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,278
and books until we

377
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:03,359
one curious aunt comes up with the next

378
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:06,000
pocket yeah tunnels through the barrier

379
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,240
or gets enough energy to jump over the

380
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,240
barrier and eventually we'll be

381
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,360
as you've talked about i mean we'll be

382
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,919
we'll colonize the solar system and then

383
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,839
uh we'll be stuck in the solar system

384
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,159
and then people will say well we're

385
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,240
screwed when because when the sun energy

386
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,958
runs out there's no way to get to the

387
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,639
the next solar system and then and so on

388
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,518
it goes on until we colonize the

389
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,278
entirety of the observable universe yeah

390
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,440
i think i think getting out of the solar

391
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,958
system is going to be a hard one but so

392
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,560
can you you mention this can you

393
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,958
elaborate

394
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,638
why you think

395
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,638
back to sort of a serious question why

396
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,079
do you think it's hard to get outside of

397
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,360
our solar system it's just an energy

398
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,278
calcul i mean

399
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,079
you can do it slowly

400
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:55,439
uh whenever you want um

401
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:58,958
but uh the idea of getting there in you

402
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,079
know one lifetime or multiple

403
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,599
a few lifetimes is requires huge amounts

404
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,638
of energy to

405
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,560
to accelerate um and then you've as soon

406
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,480
as you get halfway there you need to

407
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:14,719
expend an equal amount of energy to

408
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,560
decelerate or you'll just go shooting by

409
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,240
and so um

410
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,679
that means carrying a lot of energy and

411
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,079
there's there's

412
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,799
ideas like yuri milner

413
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:28,159
i think is still funding the the idea to

414
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:31,120
use laser propulsion to send something

415
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,078
uh to another star system a small object

416
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,480
um

417
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,239
but it'll have no way to slow down

418
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,920
as far as i know they never talk about

419
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,839
that part yeah like how do i slow down

420
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,159
yeah

421
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,680
um so it's a quick flyby you take a good

422
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,240
picture i guess yeah you better take

423
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,758
some good pictures on your way by so and

424
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,120
that's great if it happens i'm not

425
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,000
knocking it

426
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,720
but

427
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,559
the amount of energy is is that's needed

428
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,800
is just staggering and there's there's

429
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,919
other issues like just how do you

430
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,278
maintain

431
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,240
uh

432
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:04,000
an ecosystem for that long in isolation

433
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,879
uh how do you prevent people from going

434
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,559
crazy what happens if you hit something

435
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,559
while traveling at a significant

436
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,919
fraction of the speed of light what

437
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,599
about it sort of

438
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,078
some combination of expanding human

439
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,320
lifespan but also just

440
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,919
good old-fashioned

441
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,040
stable society on a spaceship yeah yeah

442
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,639
the generation ship yeah yeah yeah no i

443
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:30,480
think that's the only way it would it

444
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,519
would have to keep going for a long time

445
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,800
um

446
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,120
and they might get to where they're

447
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:38,639
going and find

448
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,159
a shitty um solar system like we can try

449
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,399
to

450
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,120
we can try to do some advanced survey

451
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,120
but

452
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,360
i mean if you get there

453
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,919
and all the planets in that solar system

454
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,519
are just garbage planets then it's kind

455
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,078
of a big letdown

456
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,039
for for this like thousand-year voyage

457
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:59,120
that you've just uh you've just been on

458
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,879
right so i mean we have a pretty narrow

459
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,318
range of

460
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:07,359
of parameters that we need to stay

461
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:10,000
between in order to survive um in terms

462
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,399
of the the gravitational uh field that

463
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,720
we can deal with um

464
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,559
so that such a sets of bound on the size

465
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,880
of the the planet

466
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,519
and um what we need in the way of

467
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,400
temperature and atmosphere and so on

468
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,879
so

469
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,959
when you look at all those complications

470
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,039
then basically

471
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,480
building uh

472
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,558
uh sort of

473
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,880
exactly the environment we want out of

474
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:38,879
available materials in this solar system

475
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,880
starts to look a hell of a lot better

476
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,798
it's hard to make

477
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,798
an economic argument let's say for for

478
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,798
for making that journey

479
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,879
uh one of the things i like about the

480
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,679
expanse is the fact that the people who

481
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,360
are trying to build the starship to go

482
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,280
to the other solar system are doing it

483
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,599
for religious reasons

484
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,240
i think that's the only reason that you

485
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,240
would do it

486
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,679
because economically it just makes more

487
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,640
sense to build

488
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,400
rotating cylindrical space habitats and

489
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,160
make them perfect

490
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,240
well is isn't everything done for

491
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,798
religious reasons like why do we

492
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,480
exploration yeah like what why why do we

493
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,720
go to the moon again

494
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,720
and do the other things uh what does jfk

495
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,400
said is because not because they're easy

496
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,919
but because they're hard it's not kind

497
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,720
of a religious reason

498
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,480
i knew a veteran of the apollo program

499
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,319
who once said that the apollo moon

500
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
landings were communism's greatest

501
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
achievement

502
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,840
yeah so the conflict between nations is

503
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,119
a kind of

504
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:44,000
um not exactly a religion but it's what

505
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,719
you're talking about well it's a

506
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,279
struggle for meaning yeah i mean uh and

507
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,798
that meaning isn't found in some kind of

508
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,798
it's it's hard to find meaning in

509
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,679
mathematics yeah it's it's found in some

510
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,160
kind of

511
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,519
in music and religion whatever art i

512
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,798
mean some people do

513
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,679
but those are

514
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,918
probably not enough of them to

515
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,320
well they uh people that find beauty uh

516
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,320
meaning in mathematics they usually find

517
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,879
meaning between the lines nevertheless

518
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,678
not in the actual uh

519
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,120
for like the proving

520
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,120
proving some kind of thing fair enough

521
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,678
yeah so

522
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,000
from a cost perspective do you actually

523
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,919
see a possible future where we're b

524
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,960
building these kind of generation ships

525
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,480
and just

526
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,519
why not launch them one a year

527
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,640
out

528
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,319
like uh like wandering ants i'll come to

529
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,320
the

530
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,879
into the galaxy

531
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,599
i have nothing against it uh it's just

532
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,480
like i said it's got a

533
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,199
the motivation to do it has to come from

534
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,599
um some kind of spiritual or

535
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,319
or kind of non-tangible

536
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,678
uh calculus from a business model

537
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,240
perspective you don't think there's a

538
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,600
business model there no no way

539
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,359
one of the many fascinating things

540
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:00,319
you've done in your life

541
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,599
you were

542
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,000
at the very beginning you were the

543
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:07,199
person that can feel convinced basis to

544
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,319
start a spaceship company a space

545
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,279
company

546
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,359
you were there at blue origin

547
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,440
for a few years in the beginning

548
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,119
working on alternate

549
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,240
propulsion systems

550
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,558
and at least according to wikipedia uh

551
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,400
alternate business models

552
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,678
yeah i mean to go back to the first

553
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,400
thing you said uh jeff bezos is not a

554
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,240
guy who required a lot of convincing

555
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,880
um he'd been thinking about it since he

556
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,798
was five years old and it was an

557
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,159
inevitability but

558
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,240
um the

559
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,760
the idea um

560
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,519
that that kind of got hatched in 1999

561
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,640
was to um

562
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,599
just do some uh advanced scouting work

563
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,799
you know

564
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,038
explore the corners of the the space of

565
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,200
possibilities

566
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,759
and so that's what uh

567
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,038
that was blue operations llc which was

568
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,400
the precursor to blue origin

569
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,720
and um

570
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,038
so it was a small staff of people that

571
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,558
that did that for a few years and i

572
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:16,000
think it was about 2003 2004 that

573
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:18,079
uh it swung decisively towards the

574
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,640
direction it's it's been following ever

575
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:23,678
since which is you know using

576
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,400
basically existing aerospace

577
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,960
technologies and models to make chemical

578
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,880
fueled rockets

579
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,120
for for space tourism

580
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,200
uh i believe and i continue to believe

581
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,399
that the the fact that we use chemical

582
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,640
rockets is just an accident of history

583
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,320
that comes out of world war ii

584
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,080
so until world war ii rockets are being

585
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,480
built on a small scale by people like

586
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,079
robert goddard

587
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,120
but then

588
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,000
hitler

589
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,519
desperately wants to bomb london

590
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,400
but he can't quite reach it and the

591
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,200
liftwaffe has been kind of neutralized

592
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,840
so

593
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,720
he he decides he's going to lob warheads

594
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,639
into it with with rockets

595
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,558
which is a terrible

596
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,640
misallocation of resources it's a

597
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,558
terrible idea but

598
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,960
so it only could have happened in a

599
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,519
dictatorship controlled by

600
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,519
a lunatic um

601
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,918
but that's that's the situation that

602
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,639
existed so they built these rockets they

603
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,038
you know that's the v2

604
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,880
um and then it's just a complete

605
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:33,038
coincidence that that war ends with um

606
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,880
atomic bombs being developed in a

607
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,879
completely separate

608
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,440
super weapon program

609
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,559
and so suddenly the the existence of the

610
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,600
bombs

611
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,200
creates a demand for rockets that didn't

612
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,798
exist before

613
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,440
because if you've got

614
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:53,119
atomic bombs you need a way to deliver

615
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,919
them you can do with bombers but

616
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,439
it's a lot better to just hurl them

617
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,280
to the other side of the world on the

618
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,279
top of a rocket

619
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,678
so um so suddenly

620
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,918
rockets which had gotten a boost

621
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,519
because of hitler's v2 program got a

622
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,720
much bigger boost

623
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,480
during the

624
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,798
50s and 60s

625
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,880
and it is a complete you're right for

626
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,119
some reason never thought of this it is

627
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,320
an accident of history that nuclear

628
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:23,119
weapons are developed at a similar time

629
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:24,798
first of all nuclear weapons didn't have

630
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,959
to be developed at the same time as

631
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,200
world war ii right that's an accident in

632
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
history yeah and the fact

633
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,759
that okay so then hitler started using

634
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:37,119
rockets that's an accident okay

635
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:39,599
that's fascinating it's a fascinating uh

636
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,158
set of coincidences yeah and which is

637
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,480
true of a lot of technologies by the way

638
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,159
but by the time these rockets are kind

639
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,960
of working um we've got hydrogen bombs

640
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,159
that

641
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,640
are so big and so devastating that

642
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,880
nobody really wants to use them but it

643
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,559
turns out you can fit a capsule with a

644
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,159
couple of people in it

645
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:05,038
into the the socket on the end of a of a

646
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,320
missile that was made to hold a hydrogen

647
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:07,919
bomb

648
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,639
so um

649
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,080
so we start doing that instead

650
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,080
as a proxy

651
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,038
for for having a war

652
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,278
um

653
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,879
and um i'd love to be in the meeting

654
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,440
where the first guy brought that up as

655
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
an idea

656
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,640
it's probably a russian why don't we

657
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,480
strap a person to the rocket yeah

658
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,559
yeah well it probably was because they

659
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,400
did it first right uh the russians did

660
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,960
it and they had perhaps less respect for

661
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,440
sort of safety protocols could be

662
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,519
they're a little bit more uh willing to

663
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,840
sacrifice the life of an astronaut or to

664
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,158
risk the life of an astronaut

665
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,439
yeah yeah this is basically the story of

666
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,960
how

667
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,880
through all of this competition and

668
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,159
because of these historical accidents

669
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,200
you know trillions of r d dollars and

670
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,880
rubles were put into

671
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,200
development of chemical rocket

672
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,840
technology which is you know now

673
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,759
advanced to an incredibly high degree

674
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,519
but there's other ways to make things go

675
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,919
really fast

676
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,079
which is like all that rockets do

677
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,240
that's all orbit is it's just going

678
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,759
really fast

679
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,759
and

680
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,519
because so many nerds are obsessed with

681
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,720
space people have been

682
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,319
uh thinking about alternate schemes for

683
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
as long as they've been thinking about

684
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,519
rockets

685
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,599
um and so one of the first things that

686
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:30,079
you that i learned

687
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,759
kind of trying to explore new

688
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,639
possibilities

689
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,158
uh

690
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,759
was that

691
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,840
i could

692
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,960
put all of my brain power to work and

693
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:44,720
and be creative as i could and and

694
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,798
invent some idea that i thought was new

695
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,278
for making things go fast and i would

696
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,759
always find out that some guy in russia

697
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,240
or somewhere had had thought the same

698
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,640
idea up 50 years ago

699
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,640
and figured out all the math yeah you

700
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,520
know and so

701
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,759
so at a certain point you give up on

702
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,038
trying to invent completely new ideas

703
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,839
and just go

704
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:12,319
poking around trying to find those guys

705
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,720
um so there's a number of uh

706
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:17,200
of ideas that we looked at

707
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,319
you know some are crazier some are less

708
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,038
crazy but um the direction that that

709
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:24,399
company eventually took was was chemical

710
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,798
rockets is there something you can

711
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,278
comment on possible ideas like so first

712
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,639
of all like

713
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,119
i mean uh

714
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,799
uh like you could use nuclear so nuclear

715
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,038
pulse propulsion

716
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,679
yeah so that's i mean you've probably

717
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,640
heard of project orion which um

718
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,880
was the

719
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,919
freeman dyson and

720
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,159
some of his collaborators

721
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,320
had a scheme to um

722
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,360
to power a large space vehicle by

723
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,439
detonating atomic bombs behind it

724
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,678
and so one of the other people who was

725
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,038
working at blue operations during this

726
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,880
time was george dyson the son of freeman

727
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,558
and so we knew all about

728
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,799
project orion

729
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,960
and he found an old

730
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,440
film that they'd shot on a beach in la

731
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,798
jolla of a prototype of this that was

732
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,759
powered by

733
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,158
uh like

734
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,079
uh lumps of c4

735
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,039
so that was an idea but for private

736
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,599
company

737
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:24,398
obtaining a large number of atomic bombs

738
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,719
was probably out of scope so

739
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:29,519
there's more of a theoretical

740
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,519
thing there's a

741
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,960
conceptually similar

742
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:37,839
approach using lasers that

743
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,919
uh that freeman worked on

744
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,879
with arthur kantrowitz and some others

745
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,960
where you take a pulse blazer

746
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,120
and you fire it at a vehicle that has a

747
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,440
block of ice on the back

748
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,199
and the pulse hits the

749
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,600
ice and

750
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,200
flashes off a layer of steam that

751
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,158
becomes plasma

752
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,960
and plasma is opaque because it conducts

753
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,080
and so being opaque it then absorbs all

754
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,798
of the energy from the laser pulse and

755
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:09,839
gets really hot and just pushes

756
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:11,599
on the back of the the block of ice

757
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,918
and then you wait a moment for that to

758
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:17,199
dissipate and then you do it again

759
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,880
so it would just kind of uh vibrate its

760
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,720
way

761
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,480
like it sounds really violent but

762
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,278
freeman said that if you were wearing

763
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,360
like rubber soled tennis shoes standing

764
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,839
in this vehicle you would just feel a

765
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,798
mild

766
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,720
vibration

767
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,079
so there your source of energy is on the

768
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,159
ground and you're getting higher

769
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,278
specific impulse than you could get by

770
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,278
burning chemicals

771
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:47,038
jordan care and others worked on another

772
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:47,038
laser system the late dr jordan care

773
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,719
that just would heat up a heat exchanger

774
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,440
by

775
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,200
converging many converging solid-state

776
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,840
lasers from the ground

777
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,319
and kevin parkin

778
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:02,959
um works on a similar scheme that just

779
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,960
uses uh microwaves

780
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,240
to do that

781
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,919
we looked at

782
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,079
tall towers

783
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,278
i spent a while looking kind of semi

784
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,199
seriously a giant bull whips

785
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:17,519
um with a bull lip

786
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,000
just a whip just uh

787
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,759
you have them here in texas right

788
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,880
yeah i understand

789
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,119
but how does that have to do with

790
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,640
propulsion if you think about it a whip

791
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:31,678
is an incredibly simple primitive object

792
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,880
that can break the speed of sound

793
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,720
so it's unbelievable in a way that for

794
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,440
thousands of years

795
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,960
people with no technology

796
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,440
have been able to

797
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,720
to accelerate objects through the speed

798
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,440
of sound

799
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,319
just through an architectural trick

800
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:55,200
just just you know just the physics of a

801
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:57,509
moving bend of material in a medium

802
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,720
can do this so

803
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:00,879
[Music]

804
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,038
so that's the thing i still think about

805
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,320
from time to time you can use the same

806
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,519
physics to make freestanding loops of

807
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,398
chain or

808
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,720
or other

809
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,959
flexible materials

810
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,160
that just kind of stand up under their

811
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,319
own

812
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,798
[Music]

813
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,038
physics

814
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,278
i mean it's kind of awesome

815
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:23,759
to imagine so imagine using the same

816
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,119
kind of physics of a whip

817
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,879
but have

818
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,959
at the end of it

819
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,720
a spaceship yeah

820
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,880
that would detach

821
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,200
at the moment of maximum

822
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,640
velocity why

823
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,880
why not

824
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,200
why wouldn't that so part of

825
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,360
my motivation in studying that was to

826
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,278
ask that that question it was it was

827
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,079
more uh almost a

828
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,599
symbolic way of saying

829
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,398
look

830
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,558
there's

831
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:57,599
all kinds of physics we haven't

832
00:30:52,558 --> 00:31:00,240
explored yet um that it's no more crazy

833
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,278
than the idea of chemical rockets

834
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,399
um

835
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:07,200
it's just that uh more money's gone into

836
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:09,759
chemical rockets right

837
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,759
but can i ask you uh

838
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,440
a question on propulsion that's a little

839
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,960
bit more

840
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,399
out there so

841
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,360
i don't know if you've

842
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:18,398
seen

843
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:20,959
quite a

844
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,719
a lot of recent articles and reports and

845
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,038
so on about

846
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:29,038
uh ufos like the tic tac aircraft i keep

847
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,200
seeing a lot of

848
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,480
chatter about it but i haven't gone

849
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,159
deep into it

850
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,720
so the dod released footage

851
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,159
filmed by

852
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,919
pilots

853
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,320
and there's a lot of reports about

854
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,960
objects that moved in ways they haven't

855
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,278
seen before that seem to defy the laws

856
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,278
of physics

857
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,319
if we consider the aircraft that we have

858
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,398
today

859
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,278
and so the reason i asked you

860
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,439
that is because it kind of um

861
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:02,159
to me

862
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,000
whatever the heck it is

863
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,320
it's inspiring

864
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,839
for the possibilities of ideas for

865
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,079
propulsion

866
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:13,119
if it's like um

867
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,119
secret projects from foreign nations

868
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,959
or it's physical phenomena that we don't

869
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,398
yet understand like ball lightning all

870
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,440
those kinds of things or if it is aliens

871
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,918
or

872
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,759
objects from an alien civilization i

873
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,360
most likely believe it's if it's an

874
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,879
object from an alien civilization it's

875
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,519
got to be like

876
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,919
a really dumb drone they just like got

877
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,679
lost it's definitely not

878
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,320
like the pinnacle

879
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,759
of intelligence it's like some like

880
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:43,918
teenagers like uh science fair

881
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,480
experiment yeah he just flew for for a

882
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,159
few centuries out and just landed and

883
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,319
then we humans are all like really

884
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,640
excited about this

885
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,558
yes this wild thing i mean what what do

886
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,919
you think about those um

887
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:57,599
first of all like the millions of

888
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,240
reports of ufos right there's some

889
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:03,439
psychology there that's deeply cultural

890
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,519
uh but also the possibility of aliens

891
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,679
having visited earth

892
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,200
yeah i mean i'd like to see some better

893
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,798
pictures

894
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,200
for the reason i mentioned earlier

895
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,679
having to do with the difficulty of

896
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,278
traveling between star systems

897
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,360
it's really hard for me to believe it's

898
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,398
aliens

899
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,798
i just can't understand why you would

900
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,959
go to all that trouble to transport

901
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,398
something across light years

902
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,480
and then

903
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,158
do what these ufos

904
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,159
are allegedly doing

905
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,600
like how is that interesting how does

906
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,880
that justify

907
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,319
the trip so if you travel

908
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,720
across

909
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:45,200
you know those kinds of distances you'd

910
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,839
make a bigger splash

911
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,240
first of all i would expect that the

912
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,839
the arrival of these things would be

913
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,558
something we'd notice it's gotta you

914
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,599
know decelerate into into our solar

915
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:56,558
system

916
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,319
by

917
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,879
unless it got here really really really

918
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,119
slowly so i guess that's

919
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,440
that's a possibility and just kind of

920
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,199
snuck in so at the end we would detect

921
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,079
some kind of footprint in terms of

922
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,159
energy you would think so i actually

923
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,560
think your idea of a science fair

924
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,200
project gone gone bad

925
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:20,639
you know it makes more sense

926
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,719
in in that it would explain why these if

927
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,639
these things are alien technologies

928
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,638
they're just kind of

929
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,280
hanging around our aircraft carriers for

930
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,679
no particular reason like doing doing

931
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,399
not trying to communicate yeah you know

932
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,599
is it can you imagine a scenario

933
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,159
where

934
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,559
aliens have visited earth or are

935
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,800
visiting earth and we wouldn't notice it

936
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,480
at all oh sure i mean if they've got

937
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,320
technology to

938
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,199
to get here they've probably got

939
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,960
technology to conceal the fact oh

940
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,638
they're trying to conceal themselves i

941
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,878
meant more like they're not trying to

942
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,280
conceal themselves but we're just our

943
00:34:54,878 --> 00:35:00,000
cognitive capabilities are

944
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,920
like too limited and we are not thinking

945
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,400
big enough we're looking for a little

946
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,159
green men yeah we're looking for things

947
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,519
that operate at a time scale that's

948
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:10,159
human-like

949
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,480
uh you know it's

950
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,639
yeah no i i love thinking about ideas

951
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,280
like that that's great science fiction

952
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:20,078
novel father you know that the aliens

953
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,000
are are so different uh that we simply

954
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,400
don't don't see them

955
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,320
i mean is there um you know in terms of

956
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,480
language do you think

957
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,800
it would be difficult

958
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,599
not aliens visiting us but traveling to

959
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,160
other places to find a common language

960
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,920
you you've written about the importance

961
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:41,519
of language in intelligent civilizations

962
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,440
um

963
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,400
how difficult is the problem to bridge

964
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,880
the gap between aliens and humans

965
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,039
yeah in terms of language so we're not

966
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,200
lost in translation yeah i mean there's

967
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,279
different takes on that depending on how

968
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,279
biologically similar they are

969
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,720
to us you know i mean there's a school

970
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,000
of thought that says

971
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,239
basically

972
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,239
uh

973
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,759
advanced life has to be carbon based

974
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,880
for just reasons of chemistry so right

975
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,760
away if you impose that limitation then

976
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,280
you're you're kind of assuming a uh

977
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,440
something that's starting to be

978
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,400
biologically similar to us

979
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,880
so if they're about as big as we are and

980
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,200
uh you know they um they they kind of

981
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,680
move around in in space you know a

982
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,759
physical body the way we do then then

983
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:32,239
there's probably a way to to solve that

984
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,119
communication problem

985
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:37,519
uh if they're you know like beings of

986
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,880
pure energy from star trek or something

987
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:41,039
like that then

988
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,480
it's a different story well i love

989
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,519
thinking about that kind of stuff too i

990
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,559
mean this

991
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,599
you know

992
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,679
consciousness itself may be maybe

993
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,880
i mean it could be

994
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:57,279
like you said beings of pure energy

995
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,760
um i i think i think of life

996
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,480
as just complex systems and the kind of

997
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,320
forms those complex systems can take

998
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,079
seems to be much larger than the

999
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,838
particular biological systems we see

1000
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,119
here on

1001
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,078
earth um i have to ask a twitter

1002
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,760
question okay about aliens yeah you're

1003
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,160
ready this is for twitter i'm ready what

1004
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,200
would you expect from twitter can humans

1005
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:21,838
have sex with aliens

1006
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:24,399
and yes

1007
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:25,920
you can pass

1008
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,480
i asked the language question can the

1009
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,639
community communicate yeah

1010
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,358
can they fall in love before before sex

1011
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:35,440
that's how it works

1012
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,679
so which question are am i answering the

1013
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,119
sex or the the love

1014
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,039
um i mean

1015
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,200
it depends what is more fundamental to

1016
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,519
relations across

1017
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,799
yeah across intelligent species yeah i

1018
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,679
mean um

1019
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,039
you know sex can mean a lot of things um

1020
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,838
so i mean

1021
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:55,759
uh if your production right you know the

1022
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:58,159
the

1023
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,280
when in star trek in classic star trek

1024
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:00,399
you had to

1025
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,200
to really

1026
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,400
suspend your disbelief to to think that

1027
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,358
um

1028
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,920
spock was half vulcan and half human

1029
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:14,159
right because that's just

1030
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,680
not gonna not gonna work dna wise um

1031
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,279
so um

1032
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:20,719
so if by sex you mean reproductive sex

1033
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,599
then um

1034
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:26,480
uh i would say no unless

1035
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,880
you unless you go to a panspermia

1036
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,679
kind of theory which is that

1037
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,838
uh you know humans were seeded onto the

1038
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,960
planet as part of a galactic uh you know

1039
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,838
uh

1040
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,679
program of some of some sort

1041
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,199
and then we're just returning home yeah

1042
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,598
and hanging out with our

1043
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,279
old relatives assistant cousins yeah

1044
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,440
yeah

1045
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,040
but that that doesn't seem

1046
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,440
you know it doesn't seem

1047
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,920
seem plausible we know that we know that

1048
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,039
humans had sex with neanderthals with

1049
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,760
denisovans denisovans

1050
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,679
so you could think of them as aliens

1051
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,720
that that came from our

1052
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,759
planet

1053
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,799
um

1054
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,040
so um so that's a kind of data point i

1055
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,039
guess

1056
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,159
but

1057
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,480
you know if you broaden your definition

1058
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:19,679
of sex to mean any kind of

1059
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,440
uh gratifying physical

1060
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,199
interaction then sure

1061
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,760
right

1062
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:26,639
dancing and that's that's how we get to

1063
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,560
love

1064
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,559
okay and love can take many forms love

1065
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:34,000
can certainly take many forms i have to

1066
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,759
ask you um in terms of space

1067
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,519
just looking at where blue origin is

1068
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,520
looking at where spacex is today

1069
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,960
and maybe looking out 10 20 years out

1070
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,960
from now

1071
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,519
are you impressed of what's happening we

1072
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,760
just saw william shatner go up to space

1073
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,480
yeah i was i was just watching his video

1074
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,000
this morning before i came here yeah

1075
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,760
are you impressed to where things stand

1076
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,358
today yeah i mean

1077
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,599
i mean spacex

1078
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:02,319
in particular is has

1079
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,280
done things that are just unbelievable

1080
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,880
um

1081
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,800
and um

1082
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,240
yeah i don't think anyone was

1083
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,119
anticipating

1084
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:14,159
um 20 years ago let's say when this all

1085
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,720
started just the uh the speed with which

1086
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,838
they'd be able to um rack up these

1087
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,039
incredible

1088
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:20,719
achievements

1089
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,119
if you've kind of uh

1090
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:25,919
even seen a little bit of how the

1091
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,720
sausage is made and and so the the the

1092
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,760
difficulty of of doing any kind of space

1093
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,559
travel

1094
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,280
um

1095
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,039
what they've achieved is uh

1096
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,319
is just uh

1097
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,318
is is unbelievable what about the maybe

1098
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,358
a question about elon musk

1099
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,199
um even more than jeff bezos

1100
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:47,039
he has a very kind of

1101
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:49,279
ambitious vision

1102
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,759
of um this

1103
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,640
project that we're on as a species yeah

1104
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,280
of becoming a multiplanatarian species

1105
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:59,598
and becoming that quickly

1106
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,599
yeah as soon as possible landing on mars

1107
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,800
colonizing mars what do you think of

1108
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,480
that project

1109
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,640
there's two questions to ask first the

1110
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,800
question is what what do you think about

1111
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:11,118
the project of colonizing mars

1112
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,640
and second

1113
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,800
what do you think

1114
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,279
about a human being

1115
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,200
who is so

1116
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,599
unapologetically ambitious

1117
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:23,439
at achieving the impossible at what a

1118
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,760
lot of people would say is impossible i

1119
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,960
think that colonizing mars is the kind

1120
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,920
of

1121
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,440
of gold that's uh it's easily

1122
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,400
stated uh

1123
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,920
it's um it's catchy it's it's it's the

1124
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,960
kind of thing that

1125
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,280
that can inspire people to get involved

1126
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,159
in a way that some other programs might

1127
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,400
not

1128
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,598
um so i think it's well chosen in that

1129
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,000
way

1130
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,760
i have technical questions about um

1131
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,880
you know there's there's a problem of

1132
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,800
perchlorates uh on the surface of mars

1133
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,599
that's going to be big trouble

1134
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,318
um

1135
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,119
and there's there's radiation so and

1136
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,920
this is known i'm uh

1137
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,519
but um what about business questions

1138
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,119
do you think cause you mentioned sort of

1139
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,599
uh

1140
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,800
going outside of the solar system would

1141
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,519
would best be done for religious reasons

1142
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,119
um what about colonizing mars

1143
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,759
can you spin it into a business

1144
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,119
proposition it's hard to

1145
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,599
think of a resource that's on mars that

1146
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,680
could be brought back here cheaply

1147
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,400
enough to compete

1148
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,919
with um

1149
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,800
with stuff we could just dig out of the

1150
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,039
ground here or grow here

1151
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,079
so i don't know if there is a business

1152
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:43,679
plan for that or if it's just strictly

1153
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,160
we're going to go there

1154
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,799
and and see what happens

1155
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:51,519
um you know

1156
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,280
maybe again we need communism to kind of

1157
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,880
yeah to get us going

1158
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,560
to give us a reason a little bit of the

1159
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,519
competition well there's plenty of

1160
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:02,159
people who are sufficiently excited by

1161
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:05,358
the colonized mars vision that they're

1162
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:07,920
willing to to just go all in on it

1163
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,838
even if there's not a business

1164
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,599
plan behind it

1165
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,639
so so i think it's well chosen it's just

1166
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,010
uh

1167
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,039
um

1168
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:19,920
[Music]

1169
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,679
i i think it's probably the only um

1170
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,039
the only approach to take

1171
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,039
um

1172
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:28,000
you know a lot of the when when white

1173
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,759
people came to this continent and and

1174
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,639
started colonizing it

1175
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,079
you know

1176
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:34,879
uh

1177
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,200
there was not a lot of coherent planning

1178
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,240
like what what plans they did have

1179
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,078
turned out to be terrible plans um you

1180
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:45,759
know trying to come up with plans that

1181
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:49,039
extend decades into the future is

1182
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,560
uh is a waste of time to do it for the

1183
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:53,199
kind of

1184
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,559
like unexplainable love of the unknown

1185
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:58,078
like like

1186
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,559
the the uh the journey towards

1187
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,800
exploring the unknown yeah and just kind

1188
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:05,440
of keep going yeah

1189
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,000
well you saw it with shatner and his

1190
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,200
uh reaction to the the flight uh

1191
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,159
yesterday

1192
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:11,838
um

1193
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,920
he uh

1194
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,920
um

1195
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,760
for him that trip was

1196
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,760
more than worth it just for these

1197
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,359
intangible reasons

1198
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,680
what did he say i haven't watched the

1199
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,159
video yet he was trying to express the

1200
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,318
the talking a lot about the moment where

1201
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,598
suddenly you kind of

1202
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:32,559
rise above the the thin blue blanket of

1203
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,280
uh

1204
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:38,078
of the atmosphere and and you're up into

1205
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,920
the the blackness um and uh

1206
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,640
that had a huge

1207
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,400
impact on him so he was kind of uh i

1208
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,400
wouldn't say groping for words because

1209
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,240
he was pretty eloquent but

1210
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,480
he was trying to express his feelings

1211
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,959
about that

1212
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,519
in a way that is pretty pretty gripping

1213
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,519
to watch

1214
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,880
so

1215
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,960
you've worked on this kind of stuff we

1216
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,480
can go back to 10 years ago you wrote an

1217
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,159
essay

1218
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,480
called innovation starvation you worked

1219
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,480
on this kind of idea uh since then

1220
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,640
kind of looking at

1221
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:17,199
uh maybe a little bit cynically about

1222
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:19,679
our age today and our unwillingness to

1223
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:21,598
take on big risky projects

1224
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,759
so in the face of that what do you think

1225
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,800
of people like elon musk

1226
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,440
because to me people like that

1227
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,640
are inspiring and gives you hope in the

1228
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,119
face of

1229
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,118
a more kind of um

1230
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,960
pessimistic perspective

1231
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,599
of our age

1232
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,949
yeah well he's clearly willing to tackle

1233
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,119
um

1234
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:44,078
[Music]

1235
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,599
big ambitious uh projects uh without a

1236
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,400
lot of

1237
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,640
kind of

1238
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:52,559
soul searching or uh or were

1239
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,759
trying to make up his mind right it's

1240
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:54,639
just like

1241
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,640
um

1242
00:45:54,639 --> 00:46:00,400
just go and do it let's dig tunnels

1243
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,400
under cities go you know let's uh um

1244
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,200
step one make a joke about on twitter

1245
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,160
step two actually do it yeah yeah

1246
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,039
yeah

1247
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:11,920
and uh i mean things have slowed down uh

1248
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:15,199
quite our ability to um

1249
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,159
to build things uh uh

1250
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,919
at pace um is is a lot less than it was

1251
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:21,598
and there's there's reasons for that you

1252
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,318
know we're more concerned with safety

1253
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,318
and

1254
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,159
environmental impacts than um than

1255
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,318
people were when they were building

1256
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,078
uh some of the great publix works

1257
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,239
projects of the mid

1258
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,160
20th century

1259
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,919
but even we're at the point now where

1260
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,159
even just maintaining the stuff that

1261
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,760
we've got is such a huge

1262
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,000
project

1263
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,800
that we need to put big resources into

1264
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,639
it and and good minds into it

1265
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,720
or else we're going to be we're going to

1266
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:50,400
be losing

1267
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,159
things that we

1268
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,760
take for granted

1269
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,960
do you think that there's a lot to be

1270
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,200
done in the digital space that's uh we

1271
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,318
mentioned sort of wikipedia and

1272
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,679
knowledge

1273
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,000
don't you think there could be a lot of

1274
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,239
flourishing in the space of innovation

1275
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,119
in terms of innovation in in the digital

1276
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,199
space

1277
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,119
yeah i mean i'd like to see that i think

1278
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,519
it's where

1279
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,400
a lot of the brain power went during the

1280
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:19,119
last couple of generations

1281
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,680
because people who who might previously

1282
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,519
have been building rockets or

1283
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,039
or other kinds of sort of hard

1284
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,599
technologies

1285
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:29,358
ended up instead going into programming

1286
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,359
computer science

1287
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:35,598
which is understandable and great

1288
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,078
we've got structural problems right now

1289
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,640
in the way social media works that are

1290
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,079
pretty severe and so

1291
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,078
i

1292
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,000
certainly hope that we're not

1293
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,440
10 years from now that we're not exactly

1294
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,838
where we are today

1295
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,599
when it comes to to that stuff we need

1296
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:53,279
to move on

1297
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,079
the beautiful thing

1298
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,200
about problems is they show you how not

1299
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,359
to do things yeah and they give you give

1300
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:04,159
opportunity to

1301
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:06,318
new ideas to flourish

1302
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,440
and to beat out the ideas of the old

1303
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:10,159
which is uh

1304
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,679
a dream for me in in

1305
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:14,879
to see um

1306
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:17,919
new social media yeah that beats out the

1307
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,400
ways to go so i i tend to you perhaps

1308
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,480
agree that it's not that it's impossible

1309
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,720
to do social media well well not at all

1310
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,960
i mean i i listened to your uh interview

1311
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:29,199
with jaren a couple weeks ago and i

1312
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,039
i know jaren and we've

1313
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,358
you know we've talked about this and he

1314
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,838
went he went hard on me he basically

1315
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:39,920
said like it is very impossible he's

1316
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:41,759
very nice well the last time i kind of

1317
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,880
paid attention to jaron's thoughts on

1318
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,200
and he was thinking in terms of

1319
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,240
that basically there should be you know

1320
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,598
payments

1321
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:54,000
uh such that if i by clicking the like

1322
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,200
button on something i'm essentially

1323
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,280
giving

1324
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,679
um

1325
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,960
valuable intellectual property

1326
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:05,759
to facebook or twitter or whatever

1327
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,280
it's not a very large amount of ip but

1328
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,200
it's definitely a transfer of

1329
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:13,040
information that that when they

1330
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:16,639
aggregate it is beneficial to them so

1331
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:18,719
and now i now i do remember that he uh

1332
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:19,519
on on his interview with you was talking

1333
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:21,679
about

1334
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,519
what data unions or

1335
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:24,960
yeah those are a lot of interesting

1336
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,000
ideas but for me

1337
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,639
the biggest disagreement

1338
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,920
was in the level of cynicism

1339
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:36,078
he has a distrust and cynicism towards

1340
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,838
people in silicon valley being able to

1341
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,119
do these kinds of things

1342
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:42,799
and i'm really

1343
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,240
okay when you have a large crowd of

1344
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,519
people that are doing things the wrong

1345
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:47,358
way

1346
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:49,280
you should nevertheless maintain

1347
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:51,119
optimism because

1348
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,640
what's important is to find the one

1349
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,400
person in that room that's going to do

1350
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:57,519
things the right way cynicism is going

1351
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,838
to completely silence out the whole room

1352
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:02,880
so he was saying i've i've been here a

1353
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:05,920
long time oh yeah i i've known you know

1354
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,440
i i underst like how these folks work

1355
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,119
they think

1356
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,440
they're gods

1357
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,119
and they know the right way to do things

1358
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,519
and they will

1359
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,760
tell you how to do those things and that

1360
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,119
kind of hubris is going to always lead

1361
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,960
you astray

1362
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,480
when you are the one who's engineering

1363
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,960
the algorithms

1364
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,199
and there's a lot of deep truth to that

1365
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,199
because algorithms are powerful

1366
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:34,078
and uh many people when given power

1367
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:36,960
do not do the best of things i mean most

1368
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,400
what is it uh the old lincoln line if

1369
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,639
you want to test the man's character

1370
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,880
give him power yeah

1371
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:45,358
yes but that doesn't mean that some

1372
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,880
people are not able to handle the power

1373
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:48,799
that some people are not able to come up

1374
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,039
with good uh

1375
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,359
ideas that create better social media

1376
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:56,800
yeah i didn't interpret jaron's

1377
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:59,119
statements as being entirely cynical and

1378
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,400
hopeless i mean he's definitely

1379
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,280
raising

1380
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:05,119
you know issues of concern

1381
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,960
but he wouldn't be out you know writing

1382
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,240
the books that he's written and talking

1383
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,920
about this stuff if you didn't think

1384
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,318
there was a way if if you didn't think

1385
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,079
there was hope yeah and part of it as

1386
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,639
you probably know with jiren he just

1387
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,079
loves a good argument yeah

1388
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:19,519
he's just loves to have a little bit of

1389
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:22,079
fun

1390
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,759
well i have to ask you about uh i mean

1391
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,039
we talked about

1392
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,839
taking all

1393
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:29,039
big

1394
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:30,960
bold risky ideas so in your new book

1395
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,800
termination shock

1396
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,599
it's set here in texas

1397
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,920
part of it is yeah yeah most of it yeah

1398
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,079
it's a great place to set it so in it

1399
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,559
the main character tr

1400
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,640
mccool again a texas billionaire oil man

1401
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,640
and truck stop magnate

1402
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:49,598
decides to solve climate change to take

1403
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:52,400
on climate change by himself so this is

1404
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,920
an interesting philosophical exploration

1405
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,519
of how to solve climate change from a

1406
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,358
perspective that's perhaps different

1407
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:59,280
than we've been thinking about i

1408
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:00,960
wouldn't i wouldn't use the word solve

1409
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,240
but let's say

1410
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:07,280
ameliorate ameliorate the temporary

1411
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:09,039
effects but please take on yeah take on

1412
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,280
the challenge so it's it's very

1413
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:14,880
interesting but as

1414
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,079
there's a gradual nature to this process

1415
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:21,039
and

1416
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:21,039
i mean just like in in your book

1417
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,679
um

1418
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,920
the power of innovation

1419
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,639
is something that has uh

1420
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,200
saved us quite a few times in history

1421
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:37,118
so what role does that play as in this

1422
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:39,519
gradual process right so ultimately

1423
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,400
we don't solve the problem until we get

1424
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:42,800
the

1425
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,720
co2 out of the atmosphere

1426
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,640
um but that is going to take a while um

1427
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,879
we're still adding more

1428
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:53,519
uh we haven't even started to

1429
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:56,079
to reduce the amount so

1430
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,239
um so there's two possibilities inside

1431
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,039
to interrupt reduce the amount that

1432
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:02,959
we're putting in the atmosphere and two

1433
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:05,440
is removing what we got in the

1434
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,400
atmosphere we have to do both right and

1435
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,720
those are two different kind of uh

1436
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,200
efforts in terms of like what's involved

1437
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:15,358
because it stays up there so

1438
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,199
i think just last week china

1439
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,639
announced that they're going to try to

1440
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,799
level off

1441
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:23,118
their co2 emissions

1442
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:27,200
in like 2030

1443
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:30,160
so 2031 they'll only put as much co2

1444
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:31,358
into the atmosphere as they did in 2030

1445
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:33,199
which is still

1446
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:36,558
a lot of co2

1447
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:38,480
in 2060 they're saying will be net zero

1448
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,000
so if everyone in the world does that

1449
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,199
and the ppm

1450
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:47,440
of co2 in the atmosphere by then is say

1451
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:49,118
450 parts per million it'll stay at 450

1452
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,599
parts per million

1453
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,200
until we take it out

1454
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,559
and taking it out

1455
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:59,039
um is hard it's a you know it's a big

1456
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,119
we took us a long time we had to empty

1457
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:03,679
out huge coal mines

1458
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,838
and oil reservoirs and burn all that

1459
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:08,159
stuff we had to chop down forests and

1460
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:11,358
dig up peat bogs

1461
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:14,558
in order to create all of that co2 and

1462
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:17,679
so we have to reverse all of those

1463
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:21,119
processes uh somehow in order to

1464
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:23,358
remove the co2 and get it back down

1465
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,160
hopefully into the 200 and some parts

1466
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:28,719
per million range where it used to be

1467
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,078
so how about you get a a single texas

1468
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:31,838
billionaire

1469
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,000
to have a massive gun that blasts huge

1470
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:37,358
quantities of sulfur into the upper

1471
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,159
atmosphere so that's idea number one

1472
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:41,598
that's uh this is called solar

1473
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:44,159
geoengineering and it's uh

1474
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,480
we know that it's a possibility on a

1475
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,318
technical level because volcanoes have

1476
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,440
been doing it forever

1477
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:54,079
um so many times in human history we've

1478
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,079
seen a volcanic eruption

1479
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,720
that was followed by a global cooling

1480
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,960
trend that lasted for a couple of years

1481
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:05,358
and one of these things happened i think

1482
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:08,079
in the 60s or 70s in indonesia and

1483
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:09,679
and the australians sent a a plane up

1484
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,440
into the stratosphere to take some

1485
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,279
samples of the plume

1486
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,280
and when it came back down the

1487
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,640
windscreen of the plane had sort of a

1488
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,640
deposit

1489
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,480
on it so one of the australian

1490
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:22,318
scientists

1491
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:26,000
licked it

1492
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:28,880
and reported that it was painfully acid

1493
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,880
so that was our first kind of clue that

1494
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:35,200
what was being injected into the

1495
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,559
stratosphere was sulfur dioxide

1496
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:38,480
so um

1497
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,480
and and so we know

1498
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,960
then well pinot tubo came along in the

1499
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,318
90s and and did this experiment for us

1500
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,039
so we know that

1501
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:50,000
sulfur in the in the stratosphere it

1502
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:52,000
forms little uh spherical droplets of

1503
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,519
sulfuric acid after it combines with

1504
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,559
water and

1505
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:57,679
those bounce back some of the sun's rays

1506
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,079
and

1507
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:01,199
reduce the amount of solar energy

1508
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:04,079
entering

1509
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,679
the troposphere which is where we live

1510
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,280
so um

1511
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,919
so we know that it works and we've we

1512
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,160
also know that this stuff goes away

1513
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:15,039
after a couple of years

1514
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:17,039
so it gradually washes out and so it's

1515
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,679
not a permanent thing you have to the

1516
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:20,798
it's the good news bad news is

1517
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,639
um

1518
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:24,318
good news is it's not permanent so if

1519
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,318
you don't like

1520
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,920
what's happening you can just stop and

1521
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:30,480
wait a couple years

1522
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,639
and you'll get back to where you started

1523
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,240
and the the bad news if if you're in

1524
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,838
favor of this kind of thing is that you

1525
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:37,039
have to keep doing it

1526
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:39,119
forever

1527
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:42,159
or um

1528
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:44,798
so so this guy is one of those

1529
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:46,960
he's read these papers he under the tr

1530
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:47,759
the character in the book he knows all

1531
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,838
this

1532
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,559
and all all people who

1533
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:55,039
are familiar with climate science are

1534
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,880
kind of know this it's a pretty well

1535
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,798
established fact

1536
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,798
and so um

1537
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:04,559
he just decides he's going to take

1538
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:05,519
action unilaterally and and do this

1539
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,720
um

1540
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:08,719
and so

1541
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,639
there's different ways to get the sulfur

1542
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:13,199
up there but because it's texas he

1543
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:15,118
builds the biggest gun in the world

1544
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:17,519
he's just six barrels pointed straight

1545
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,798
up and he begins firing shells loaded

1546
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:21,199
with sulfur

1547
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:23,679
into the stratosphere and so the book is

1548
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:26,399
about not so much that as

1549
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:29,358
how people react to his doing that

1550
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,880
what the political ramifications are

1551
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,558
around the world because

1552
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,000
you know this is a extremely

1553
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,960
controversial

1554
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,358
idea

1555
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,679
and not everyone's on board with it

1556
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:42,000
and even if you

1557
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:44,558
are willing to consider

1558
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,400
using a technological intervention the

1559
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,720
the fact is that it's going to have

1560
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,559
different effects on different parts of

1561
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:55,039
the world so some areas may suffer

1562
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,400
negative uh you know more negatives than

1563
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:58,798
positives

1564
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,838
uh and they're not going to be happy

1565
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:06,400
so what do you think uh so in in his

1566
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:06,400
case in tr's case he can get around

1567
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,559
you know getting permission from

1568
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,559
governments

1569
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:16,159
if we were to look at our

1570
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,480
us facing um

1571
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,000
outside of the store us facing climate

1572
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,358
change where do you think the solution

1573
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,639
will come from governments working

1574
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:26,480
together or from

1575
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:28,879
bold

1576
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,719
billionaire texans

1577
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,519
i'm pretty sure that this kind of

1578
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,318
intervention is never going to emerge

1579
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:35,759
from

1580
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:37,358
western

1581
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,520
democracies

1582
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:42,558
um this kind of sorry government

1583
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:44,400
coordinated uh uh which which option one

1584
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,160
solar geo engineering soldier

1585
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,798
engineering yeah from a government from

1586
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:51,358
our offer like those are i i want to

1587
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:53,119
sort of the distinction

1588
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,440
one is the idea the technological idea

1589
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,160
you're talking about but two uh two is

1590
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,480
like

1591
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:01,279
who comes up with the idea and agrees on

1592
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,280
it governments or individuals yeah if

1593
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,000
this were to happen i think it would be

1594
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,960
either an individual or more likely just

1595
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,559
a

1596
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,280
some government somewhere that just

1597
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:15,280
decides it's in their interests to

1598
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:17,440
to unilaterally do this

1599
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,839
and you know that's not me advocating it

1600
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,838
it's just

1601
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,399
it's so

1602
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,639
it would be comparatively so cheap and

1603
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,880
easy to implement the solar

1604
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:30,400
geoengineering scheme

1605
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,480
that

1606
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,119
someone is probably going to do it once

1607
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,960
things get get bad enough but i don't

1608
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,760
think that the government will i think

1609
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,920
or western governments just because

1610
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,760
they're not um

1611
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,760
well we've seen what happened with with

1612
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:49,680
vaccines right so

1613
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,760
you know getting

1614
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:53,919
getting people to to take vaccinations

1615
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,960
or wear masks you know has turned out to

1616
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,798
be

1617
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,240
incredibly hard even though it might it

1618
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:01,759
might save those people's lives

1619
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,558
see i blame

1620
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:07,200
that's not western that's i blame

1621
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,160
failure of leadership there of leaders

1622
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,480
being

1623
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:12,719
not coming off as authentic not being

1624
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,639
inspiring uniting all those kinds of

1625
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,719
things i think that's possible i think

1626
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:18,798
it's it's just that we've gotten the

1627
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,159
leaders we have right now aren't the

1628
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:22,239
right people aren't the right people

1629
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,159
because we've lived through kind of a

1630
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:25,039
long stretch of relatively comfortable

1631
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:26,960
times

1632
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:29,440
and if it feels like

1633
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:32,318
unfortunate if you just look at history

1634
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,240
that hard times make great leaders and

1635
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:37,279
easy times make

1636
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:39,598
like bureaucrats that are

1637
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,839
egotistical and greedy and

1638
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:44,079
not very interesting and not very bold

1639
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:45,440
yeah no i think that's fair so you know

1640
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,160
we may be entering one of those

1641
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,720
interesting times you know of hardship

1642
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:52,399
in the chinese curse sense yeah

1643
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:54,959
so um

1644
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,200
um so i could be wrong but i mean there

1645
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,480
have been some efforts to uh

1646
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:01,759
explore

1647
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,639
solar geoengineering uh there was a

1648
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,640
uh

1649
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,159
a plan to send up some balloons high

1650
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:07,440
altitude balloons to take some

1651
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:08,558
measurements

1652
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,920
uh

1653
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:14,240
in scandinavia that got um squashed by

1654
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,039
uh objections from people who lived up

1655
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:19,118
there uh uh who

1656
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,679
who were just opposed to

1657
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:24,559
the whole program on on principle

1658
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:27,118
um so we'll see a lot more of that

1659
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:30,319
and it's going to be a hard program to

1660
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:33,519
advocate for just because i think people

1661
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:36,159
don't quite understand how much carbon

1662
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:39,519
dioxide is in the atmosphere

1663
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:41,679
and how far we are from from even

1664
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:44,159
slowing down

1665
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:45,679
the rate that we're adding more to say

1666
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,920
nothing of

1667
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:50,399
bringing that number down

1668
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,559
we're a long way out from from that

1669
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,880
do you see in terms of portfolio of

1670
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,640
solutions us becoming a multi-planetary

1671
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,240
species as part of that

1672
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:03,358
as a as this also being a motivator for

1673
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:06,318
investing some percent

1674
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:08,558
of gdp into becoming a multi-planetary

1675
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:10,960
species and what percent should that be

1676
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:13,039
you think you know in an indirect way

1677
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:16,159
maybe i mean you know what people will

1678
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,839
say which is this the same argument that

1679
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:19,920
has been leveled against

1680
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:22,000
space exploration since the apollo

1681
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:25,519
program which is why we solve

1682
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,838
our problems here on earth before we uh

1683
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:30,480
spend money going into space so i've

1684
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:32,159
never been a believer in that that

1685
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,199
argument

1686
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:34,480
i think

1687
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:37,358
um

1688
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,599
there could be uh a sense in which the

1689
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:41,598
new perspective that

1690
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,640
could be obtained by

1691
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,079
uh

1692
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:45,118
thinking about

1693
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,480
like if we're thinking about

1694
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,519
terraforming

1695
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,920
mars

1696
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:53,358
changing its atmosphere making it more

1697
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,880
amenable to to life and survival

1698
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,318
um

1699
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,480
you could see that maybe changing

1700
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:59,679
people's opinions about terraforming the

1701
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,719
earth

1702
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,558
yeah

1703
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:04,078
there are some dangerous consequences to

1704
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,599
this particular

1705
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:09,119
uh idea

1706
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:11,440
of blasting sulfur uh of geoengineering

1707
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,440
um

1708
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:17,118
what do you make of sort of

1709
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,039
big bold ideas that have uh

1710
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:22,079
that are a double-edged sword are all

1711
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,680
ideas like this all big ideas like this

1712
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,920
they have uh

1713
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:28,399
they have the potential

1714
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,400
to have

1715
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:32,798
highly beneficial consequences and a

1716
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:34,078
potential to have highly destructive

1717
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:36,000
consequences

1718
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,599
i wouldn't say all i think you know

1719
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,760
going back to the

1720
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,079
what we were talking about earlier you

1721
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,880
know how technology developed in the 50s

1722
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,640
and 60s there was a period of time there

1723
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,880
when

1724
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:51,759
people maybe had unrealistic ideas about

1725
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,200
new technology and weren't sufficiently

1726
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,359
attentive to

1727
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:57,199
the possible downsides

1728
01:03:55,358 --> 01:03:59,038
so

1729
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:01,358
so we got um

1730
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,160
and and there's a reason why i mean uh

1731
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:03,598
the

1732
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:06,399
the there's

1733
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:08,960
you know in in the mid 20th century we

1734
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:12,400
saw you know antibiotics we saw the

1735
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,400
polio vaccine we saw

1736
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,680
just simple things like refrigerators in

1737
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:20,159
the home you know

1738
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:22,960
my my grandmother to her dying day

1739
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:25,199
called the refrigerator the ice box

1740
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,720
because when she grew up it was a box

1741
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:29,279
with ice in it

1742
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:31,519
so you see all that change and it's

1743
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,920
largely for the benefit of people and so

1744
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:35,119
if somebody comes along

1745
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:39,280
and says hey we're going to build

1746
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:41,039
nuclear reactors to to make energy or

1747
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:45,039
here's a new

1748
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:47,839
chemical called ddt that's going to kill

1749
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,599
mosquitoes then

1750
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:52,558
it's easy to

1751
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:55,200
to just buy into that and not be alert

1752
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:58,559
to the possible downsides

1753
01:04:55,199 --> 01:05:00,960
and of course we know that um

1754
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,640
the the way that those early reactors

1755
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,440
were built and the way that the the

1756
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:08,798
supply chain uh was built

1757
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:11,039
to to create the fuel um

1758
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:12,880
and deal with the the waste

1759
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,799
was was poorly

1760
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,039
thought out and uh

1761
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:18,239
and and we're still dealing with

1762
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:20,240
the uh

1763
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:23,118
the resulting problems that places like

1764
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:25,038
hanford in in the state of washington

1765
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,798
and we know that

1766
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,559
ddt although it did kill a lot of

1767
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,880
insects

1768
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:32,798
also had terrible effects on bird

1769
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,960
populations

1770
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:37,599
so the the kind of backlash that

1771
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:40,159
happened in the 70s that's is still kind

1772
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:42,559
of going on is is to

1773
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:45,038
sort of assume that

1774
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,839
everything is a double-edged sword and

1775
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,920
always to look for

1776
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:53,519
to you know we have to absolutely

1777
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:56,400
convince ourselves that the the downside

1778
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:59,119
uh isn't going to come back and and bite

1779
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,079
us uh before we can adopt any new

1780
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:04,640
technology and

1781
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:06,000
i i think the the

1782
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:07,679
people um

1783
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,838
people are overly

1784
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:11,679
sensitized to that now

1785
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:14,798
yeah it's funny depending on the

1786
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:17,199
technology people are a little bit

1787
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:20,239
too terrified of certain technologies

1788
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:23,038
like artificial intelligence is one

1789
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:23,038
my sense is

1790
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,519
that the things that they're afraid of

1791
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:30,078
aren't the things that are likely going

1792
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,679
to happen in terms of negative things

1793
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,318
it's probably impossible to predict

1794
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:35,838
exactly the unintended negative

1795
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,719
consequences

1796
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:40,558
but what's also interesting is for ai as

1797
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:42,480
an example

1798
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,160
not people don't think enough about the

1799
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:47,039
positive things i mean the same is true

1800
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:49,038
with social media it's very popular now

1801
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,200
for some reason to talk about all the

1802
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:54,319
negative effects of social media we've

1803
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:55,118
immediately forgotten

1804
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:57,119
how

1805
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,920
incredible it is to connect

1806
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:02,318
across the world how there's a there's a

1807
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,480
deep loneliness within all of us we long

1808
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,599
to connect and social media at least in

1809
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,559
part

1810
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,480
enables that even in its current state

1811
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:12,400
and the all the negative things we see

1812
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,559
with social media

1813
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,639
currently are also in part just

1814
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:18,319
revealing the basics of human nature it

1815
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:20,558
didn't make us worse it's just rev is

1816
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:22,079
bringing it to the surface and step one

1817
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,480
of solving a problem is bringing it to

1818
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,920
the surface the fact that we are divisi

1819
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,719
there's a division

1820
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:32,159
the fact that there were easily angered

1821
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:34,318
and upset and all all of that the witch

1822
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:36,639
hunts all those kinds of things that's

1823
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:38,960
human nature and it just reveals that

1824
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:40,639
allowing us to now work on it it's

1825
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,639
therapy

1826
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:44,719
and so that's another example of a

1827
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:47,440
technology that's just

1828
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:49,279
where we're not considering this the

1829
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,200
positive effects now and in the future

1830
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,519
enough of

1831
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:54,879
i have to ask about um

1832
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:57,038
there's a million things i can ask you

1833
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,440
about but virtual reality i got got to

1834
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,440
ask you

1835
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:02,798
you've thought about virtual reality

1836
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,640
mixed reality

1837
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:07,038
uh

1838
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:09,279
quite a bit what are the

1839
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,520
interesting trajectories you see for the

1840
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:15,280
proliferation of virtual reality or

1841
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:16,960
mixed reality yeah so i was

1842
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,838
i was in magic leap for

1843
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,480
what

1844
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:21,838
five years um with the best title of all

1845
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:25,198
time oh

1846
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:26,479
thanks chief chief futurist yeah yeah

1847
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:29,919
and so i

1848
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:31,439
sort of had a little squad of people in

1849
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,000
seattle doing

1850
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,158
what you might call content r d so we're

1851
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,039
trying to make content for ar

1852
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:41,759
but um

1853
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:44,479
because it's such a new medium uh we

1854
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:47,838
there's it's more of an engineering r d

1855
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:49,198
project almost than a than a creative

1856
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:52,559
project so

1857
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:54,719
it was fascinating to see

1858
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,159
everything that goes into

1859
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,279
making

1860
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:58,639
an ar

1861
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:00,480
system

1862
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,400
that runs

1863
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:05,838
so ar

1864
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:07,519
an ar device if it's really going to do

1865
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:09,600
needs to be running

1866
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,239
slam in real time

1867
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,079
and that alone is a big as so for people

1868
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,919
who don't know first of all virtual

1869
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:16,880
reality

1870
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,279
is

1871
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,119
creating a almost fully artificial world

1872
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:23,279
and putting you inside it augmented

1873
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,278
reality ar

1874
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,120
is taking the real world

1875
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,520
and putting top on top

1876
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:31,679
putting stuff on top of that real world

1877
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,400
and when you say slam that means in real

1878
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,920
time the device needs to be able to

1879
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:38,000
sense

1880
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,759
accurately detect everything about that

1881
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,679
world sufficiently

1882
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:44,000
to be able to reconstruct

1883
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:46,000
the the 3d

1884
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,520
uh structure of it so you can put stuff

1885
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,600
on top of it and doing that in real time

1886
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,560
presumably not just real time but in a

1887
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,880
way that's creates a pleasant experience

1888
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,159
for the human perception system

1889
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,000
is uh

1890
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:01,599
yeah that's a that's an engineering

1891
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,920
project

1892
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,840
right yeah will said and it's just one

1893
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,399
of the things that

1894
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,520
the system has to do it's also tracking

1895
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:11,599
your eyes

1896
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,040
so it knows what you're looking at uh

1897
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,600
how far away

1898
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:17,198
what you're looking at is

1899
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,480
it's uh

1900
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:21,119
um

1901
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:23,198
it's performing all those functions um

1902
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:25,519
and it's gotta uh

1903
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:26,799
keep doing that without you know

1904
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,400
burning up the

1905
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,199
the cpu or

1906
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:34,719
or uh depleting the battery uh

1907
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:36,639
unreasonably fast and that's that's just

1908
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:39,039
table stakes it's just the basic

1909
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:41,360
functions of the the operating system

1910
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:44,000
and then any content that you want to

1911
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:47,039
add has to sit on top of that it's got

1912
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,079
to be rendered by the optics

1913
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:52,479
at a sufficiently low latency that

1914
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,559
it looks real and you don't get sick so

1915
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:58,158
it's an amazing thing and

1916
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:02,239
you know magically shipped a device that

1917
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:05,759
can do that in 2019

1918
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:07,359
and they're about to ship the ml2

1919
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,679
but i don't know any more about that

1920
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:10,880
than anyone else because i don't work

1921
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:14,560
there anymore

1922
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,679
um does it still ins to some degree boil

1923
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,760
down to

1924
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:20,000
a killer app

1925
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,000
a content question like you said it's

1926
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,198
kind of a wide open space nobody knows

1927
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,119
exactly what's going to be the

1928
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:28,799
compelling thing yeah

1929
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:30,640
so doesn't a super compelling experience

1930
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,719
of some sort

1931
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:36,000
alleviate some of the

1932
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:38,399
need for engineering perfection

1933
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,439
well there's a base layer of engineering

1934
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:43,920
that you have to have no matter what

1935
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:46,000
but you're certainly right that people

1936
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,359
like in the early days of video games

1937
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,920
put up with

1938
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:52,559
kind of low frame rate and what we would

1939
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,960
now call crappy graphics because they

1940
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:59,440
were having so much fun playing doom or

1941
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:02,560
whatever even tetris yeah yeah so um

1942
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:03,678
so for sure that's true and so

1943
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,960
um

1944
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:05,920
you know

1945
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,800
i was

1946
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:11,039
uh

1947
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,800
working on consumer-facing content um

1948
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:14,880
there was a great team in

1949
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:18,079
wellington new zealand that that made a

1950
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,679
game uh called uh dr groybrot's uh

1951
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:21,039
invaders that

1952
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,679
um

1953
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:26,880
that uh

1954
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:28,319
realized the the potential of ar gaming

1955
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,840
in a way that i don't think anything

1956
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:33,039
else has

1957
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,319
uh before or since um

1958
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:37,760
and um

1959
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:39,119
so that was definitely the strategy um

1960
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,520
until uh

1961
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:44,158
what april

1962
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:45,360
2020 which is when the company decided

1963
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:48,158
to

1964
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:51,119
pivot to commercial industrial

1965
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:52,960
applications instead um

1966
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:54,640
so um

1967
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,520
and

1968
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,679
you know i

1969
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,440
i haven't seen their their

1970
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,520
their financial projections but i

1971
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:02,839
assumed they had good reasons for

1972
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,679
for making that

1973
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:08,000
strategic decision um

1974
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:11,039
it just means that it's no longer

1975
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,119
uh necessarily targeted at

1976
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:16,079
at just end users who want to play a

1977
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:18,800
game or or be entertained but it's

1978
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:21,198
you know that to me from a sort of a

1979
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,440
dreamer futurist perspective is

1980
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:25,119
heartbreaking because i i i don't know

1981
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:27,599
necessarily from

1982
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:28,559
in the vr space but i see this kind of

1983
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,440
thing

1984
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,400
with uh with robotics

1985
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:33,359
where

1986
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:35,839
to me

1987
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:37,599
the future of robotics is consumer

1988
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,800
facing

1989
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,400
and a lot of great roboticists boston

1990
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,039
dynamics and

1991
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:47,920
companies like that are focused on

1992
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:50,238
sort of industrial applications yeah

1993
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:52,640
because for financial business reasons

1994
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:53,519
yeah now i i can see the parallels for

1995
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,239
sure

1996
01:13:53,520 --> 01:14:00,320
you know we'll see it was a fun uh

1997
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:01,919
project you know we uh

1998
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,920
we worked on um

1999
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,399
an app for example called baby goats

2000
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,158
which just populated your room with

2001
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:10,079
with baby goats that seemed like a

2002
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:12,399
killer app right there well

2003
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:14,399
we we thought highly of the of the idea

2004
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:16,639
for sure yes um so

2005
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:18,000
but because of the slam

2006
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,280
uh the

2007
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,439
the um

2008
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:24,079
the system knew for example here's a

2009
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:25,759
table here's a little end table

2010
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:28,559
we know the heights

2011
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,000
uh we know how high our animated baby

2012
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,880
goat can jump

2013
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,800
um

2014
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,800
and so um

2015
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,039
so our engineers had to to build a

2016
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,039
system for converting the slam

2017
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:43,039
primitives into um

2018
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:43,840
game engine objects um that that the uh

2019
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:46,000
the

2020
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:48,880
game uh the ai's in the game could

2021
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,039
navigate around um

2022
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:54,239
so um and that ended up shipping as more

2023
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:57,359
of a dev kit or a sort of how-to a

2024
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:58,559
sample app than as a

2025
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,079
a finished

2026
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,400
consumer facing

2027
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,679
you mean the baby goat ai

2028
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:06,479
yeah yeah

2029
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:09,359
i that seems to me like a world

2030
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:12,319
i couldn't entertain myself for hours

2031
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:15,279
just every day coming home to to to to

2032
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:16,319
see if baby goes yeah i mean it was an

2033
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:18,238
ambient

2034
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:20,719
kind of it's not it's not a thing that

2035
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:23,519
you would sit there and play like a a

2036
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:25,840
video just life yeah yeah but now this

2037
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,840
baby goes you i mean what's the purpose

2038
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:30,640
of having dogs and cats right in your

2039
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,079
life exactly it's kind of ambient yeah

2040
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,480
they're not really helping you do

2041
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:35,920
anything but it's enriching your life

2042
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:37,439
and you can go and play fetch or

2043
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:40,239
something for a while if you want but

2044
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:42,238
you don't have to right yeah

2045
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:44,639
so uh

2046
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:46,799
so we worked on that in a bigger

2047
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:49,440
project that was more of a

2048
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,560
storytelling in a fictional

2049
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:52,479
universe

2050
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:55,280
the hardware is worth a look there's

2051
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:57,279
still a belief i just saw it this

2052
01:15:55,279 --> 01:16:00,399
morning looking at twitter that the

2053
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:02,079
magic leap never shipped anything

2054
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:04,960
but they've been

2055
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:07,279
since 2019 you can

2056
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,520
go to their website and buy one of these

2057
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:12,000
devices anytime you

2058
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,719
want to spend the money yeah and the new

2059
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,520
one is coming out i think in 2022 so in

2060
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:19,119
in in a few months

2061
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,520
what do you think

2062
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:23,920
looking out 50 years from now

2063
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,040
what wins

2064
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:30,399
virtual reality augmented reality

2065
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,920
or physical reality

2066
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:34,719
what wins

2067
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,239
meaning like what's uh yeah what do

2068
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:40,158
people

2069
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:43,119
of that have financial resources

2070
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:44,559
enjoy spending most of their time in

2071
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:47,439
i've always

2072
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:49,440
been a fan of of of ar and it's kind of

2073
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:52,158
an easy answer because if you if you're

2074
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:55,039
wearing an ar device you put a bag over

2075
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:56,238
your head it becomes a vr device you

2076
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:58,319
know it just

2077
01:16:56,238 --> 01:17:00,319
it if you block out the

2078
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:03,519
what's really there then all you're

2079
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:07,039
seeing is is is a vr

2080
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:10,239
but you are with ar constrained

2081
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,679
to to kind of operate in

2082
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:14,079
something that's similar to physical

2083
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:17,679
reality yeah with vr you can go into

2084
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:20,640
fantastical worlds true true so

2085
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:23,920
there are still issues in in those

2086
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:26,560
fantastical worlds with um

2087
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:28,480
with motion sickness

2088
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,480
right so um

2089
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:32,639
if if your uh

2090
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:35,039
body is experiencing

2091
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:38,079
acceleration your inner ear

2092
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:41,039
um that this differs from what your eye

2093
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:43,600
thinks it's seeing then you'll get sick

2094
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:46,238
unless you're a very unusual person so

2095
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:49,199
it doesn't mean you can't do it it just

2096
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:51,599
it's a constraint that vr

2097
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:52,879
designers have to uh to learn to work

2098
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,560
with

2099
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,880
so do you think it's possible that in

2100
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,199
the future

2101
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,640
we're living mostly in a virtual reality

2102
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:02,319
world like

2103
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,320
we become more and more detached from

2104
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:07,119
physical reality

2105
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:11,279
for entertainment maybe for certain

2106
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:12,960
applications um i'm personally more

2107
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:15,039
i mean we have to make a distinction

2108
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,039
between what i would personally find

2109
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:19,279
interesting and you know what might

2110
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:21,119
win in the market so

2111
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:22,960
maybe some people

2112
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:24,719
maybe lots of people would like to spend

2113
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,640
a huge amount of time in

2114
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,840
in vr um

2115
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,400
i'm

2116
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,960
personally more interested in

2117
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:34,879
enhancing the experience that i have of

2118
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,319
the physical world because the physical

2119
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,880
world's pretty cool

2120
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:41,759
right and there's a lot a lot to be said

2121
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,600
for uh for moving around in the real

2122
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,960
world and can i ask you for you

2123
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,360
personally yeah to try to play devil's

2124
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,560
advocate or to try to construct to

2125
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:52,158
imagine

2126
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,360
a vr

2127
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:55,198
world

2128
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:56,719
where you and neil stevens wouldn't want

2129
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:59,119
to

2130
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,119
stay

2131
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:04,238
not because the physical world all of a

2132
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:06,719
sudden became really bad for some reason

2133
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:08,399
like you're trying to escape it yeah but

2134
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,520
like literally

2135
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:13,920
it's just more enriching in the same way

2136
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,960
like there's a glimmer in your eye when

2137
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:19,279
you said you enjoy the physical world

2138
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,079
like uh double up on that glimmer for

2139
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:21,840
the

2140
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:25,198
for the virtual reality can you imagine

2141
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:27,279
such a world well like i'll give maybe

2142
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:30,719
an example that's a bridge which is that

2143
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:33,439
i've been um i like making things um

2144
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:36,560
so i like working in a machine shop and

2145
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:38,399
and making objects with 3d printers or

2146
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:41,600
machines or whatever and

2147
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:44,399
so i've had to learn how to get good at

2148
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,800
using a cad program

2149
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:50,799
you know there's many to choose from

2150
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:52,400
i use one called fusion 360.

2151
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,119
and

2152
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:57,279
i can spend hours

2153
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:58,800
in that

2154
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,719
trying to create

2155
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,960
imagine and create the things i want to

2156
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:05,520
create and it's a

2157
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,679
it's not virtual reality exactly but

2158
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,960
that whole time

2159
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:12,960
i'm you know my whole field of view

2160
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,920
is occupied by

2161
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,920
uh by this monitor that's showing me a

2162
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:20,319
window into a three-dimensional space

2163
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,760
i'm rotating things around i'm

2164
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:23,599
i'm

2165
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,400
i'm imagining things i'm making things

2166
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,440
and so that is um you know pretty close

2167
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:28,719
to

2168
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:31,519
um

2169
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:33,119
to to being in virtual reality does that

2170
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,600
thing have to exist for you to

2171
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:37,198
experience true joy can you stay in

2172
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,679
fusion 360

2173
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:40,479
the whole time do you have to 3d print

2174
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:43,520
it

2175
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:46,158
and touch it yeah i mean uh that's my

2176
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,320
game that's that's what i'm up to but

2177
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:49,839
you know it happens that um

2178
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:53,198
if you're building

2179
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:55,279
a virtual environment if you're uh

2180
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:58,638
making a game level or creating a

2181
01:20:55,279 --> 01:21:00,319
virtual set for a film or tv production

2182
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:03,440
the thing that you're designing in the

2183
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:04,238
program may never physically exist

2184
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:06,158
uh

2185
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:09,039
and in fact it's preferable that it

2186
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,879
doesn't because the whole point of that

2187
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:14,560
is to um

2188
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,840
is to to make imaginary things that

2189
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,679
you couldn't

2190
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,840
couldn't build otherwise

2191
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:21,279
so i think lots of people spend a good

2192
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,600
chunk of their working

2193
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:24,319
hours in something that's pretty close

2194
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,600
to

2195
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:27,039
to vr

2196
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,880
it's just that currently the output

2197
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:29,920
device happens to be a rectangular

2198
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,679
object

2199
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:35,440
in front of them

2200
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:38,719
you could replace that with a vr headset

2201
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:40,158
and they'd be doing the same stuff

2202
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:42,079
there's all kinds of interfaces for

2203
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:43,439
example i enjoy listening to podcasts or

2204
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:44,800
audiobooks but let's say actually

2205
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:46,479
podcast

2206
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,880
because there's a intimate human

2207
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:50,238
connection in a podcast

2208
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,600
it's one way

2209
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,039
but you get to learn about the person

2210
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,560
you're listening to

2211
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:56,639
and that's a real connection and that's

2212
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:59,679
just audio for a lot of people that's

2213
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,480
just audio true i think for me

2214
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:03,760
that

2215
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:05,359
that's just audio as a fan of people

2216
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,440
and you're kind of a little bit are

2217
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:08,880
friends with those people

2218
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:10,638
yeah you know they're in your life

2219
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,600
you're listening to them yeah

2220
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,199
and

2221
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,360
i mean

2222
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:18,319
they're not they're as far away from

2223
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:20,960
real as it gets there's not even a yeah

2224
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:23,439
there's not even a visual component it's

2225
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:26,079
just audio but they're as real

2226
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:28,719
like if i was on a desert island

2227
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:30,719
like my imagination

2228
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:32,480
like this thing works pretty good

2229
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:35,439
in terms of imagination

2230
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:38,879
like that it creates a very

2231
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:42,719
beautiful world with a with just audio

2232
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:45,279
so i i mean or even just reading books

2233
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:47,760
yeah exactly you're reading books yeah

2234
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:49,840
even more so with reading books because

2235
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:53,360
uh there are certain mediums which

2236
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:55,520
stimulate the imagination more the yeah

2237
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:57,920
the when when you present less the

2238
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:00,080
imagination works more and that can

2239
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,920
create really enriching experiences so i

2240
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:03,039
mean

2241
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:05,840
to me

2242
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:07,198
the question is can you do some of the

2243
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,520
amazing

2244
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:12,079
things that make life amazing

2245
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:15,280
in virtual worlds it seems to me the

2246
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:16,960
answer there is obviously yes even if i

2247
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:18,559
like you i'm attached to a lot of stuff

2248
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:23,439
in the physical world

2249
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:25,760
i think i can very readily imagine

2250
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:28,079
coming up with some of the same magical

2251
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:30,000
experiences in the virtual world where

2252
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:32,158
you make friends

2253
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,119
and you can fall in love

2254
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:36,399
where

2255
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:37,679
the source of love in your life

2256
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:40,399
is

2257
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:42,399
uh to a much greater degree inside of a

2258
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:45,039
virtual world

2259
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:46,479
and like and then love means fulfillment

2260
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:48,319
that means happiness that's the thing

2261
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:51,759
you look forward to and not some kind of

2262
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:54,639
dopamine rush type of love but like long

2263
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:58,239
long lasting yeah yeah friendship deal

2264
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:59,840
yeah yeah it just depends on

2265
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:02,238
what is there in the way of of

2266
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,440
applications the content and can it feed

2267
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:05,198
you

2268
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:07,439
those things can it give you

2269
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:09,359
like in my example of of using the cad

2270
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:11,678
program

2271
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:13,439
it gives me the ability to do something

2272
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,800
i enjoy

2273
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:17,039
which is making

2274
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,119
imagining things and making things in a

2275
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:21,279
particular way but can we psychoanalyze

2276
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:24,079
you for a second sure

2277
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:25,359
what exactly do you enjoy is there some

2278
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:27,439
component

2279
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:29,599
of you building the thing

2280
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:32,079
where you get to at least a little bit

2281
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,920
share with others

2282
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:37,198
like is there a human in the loop

2283
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:39,840
outside of you in that picture

2284
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:40,638
will anyone ever see it

2285
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,639
right

2286
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:45,119
yeah there's a source of your enjoyment

2287
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:46,480
because i would argue that

2288
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:48,719
perhaps

2289
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:50,479
when like the the turtles all the way

2290
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,719
down when you get to the bottom turtle

2291
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:54,559
it has to do with other sharing with

2292
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:56,158
other humans yeah and if you can then

2293
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,560
put those humans

2294
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:00,719
inside the vr world

2295
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,039
then then you start to

2296
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:05,198
then then you can okay for example you

2297
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:08,560
could do it in the physical world

2298
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:10,399
the the 3d printing but you share it in

2299
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,199
in in the virtual world and that's where

2300
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:15,920
the source of happiness is i think

2301
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:18,479
at least speaking for myself i'm always

2302
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,800
thinking in terms of an audience and

2303
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:23,678
at some level i feel like i'm i'm doing

2304
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:25,360
this for someone or communicating

2305
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:27,840
to someone even if there's not a

2306
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:30,719
specific someone in mind

2307
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,920
it could just be an abstract theoretical

2308
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:33,119
someone

2309
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,199
um

2310
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:38,319
and it's like another app i spend a lot

2311
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:39,519
of time in is mathematica okay and when

2312
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:42,079
i do particular

2313
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,360
yeah yeah and when i do a mathematica

2314
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:44,960
notebook if i'm trying to figure

2315
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:46,000
something out i spend a lot of time

2316
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,439
typing

2317
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
just

2318
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:53,119
my stuff is just a huge blocks of of

2319
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,800
text just me thinking out loud and then

2320
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:59,119
some graphs and calculations and stuff

2321
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:01,920
because to me

2322
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:05,039
that act of of explaining

2323
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:07,279
things and commenting

2324
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:09,760
helps me understand what i'm doing and

2325
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:12,399
there's kind of an audience uh an

2326
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,480
amorphous audience in your mind yeah

2327
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:16,559
like i mean most of this stuff nobody

2328
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:18,959
will ever see and yet

2329
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:21,760
i'm creating it as if there were an

2330
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,600
audience that might read this stuff

2331
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:27,119
because that i have to that's a

2332
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:29,600
necessary constraint that helps me

2333
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:31,279
um do a better job

2334
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:33,280
what's the uh

2335
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:35,679
this might be tricky question to answer

2336
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:37,359
what's uh comes to mind as a

2337
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,639
particularly beautiful thing that you're

2338
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:40,039
proud of that you create inside

2339
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,079
mathematica

2340
01:26:40,039 --> 01:26:44,158
visualization-wise or

2341
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:47,119
uh something that just comes to memory

2342
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:48,158
if it's possible to retrieve

2343
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:50,960
so

2344
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:52,719
the the thing i've spent the most

2345
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,760
amount of time on

2346
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:57,840
is i got obsessed um

2347
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,679
a long time ago

2348
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,560
was trying to tile

2349
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:05,679
the globe with hexagons yes

2350
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:08,000
and um or actual globe

2351
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:10,158
well any spherical and

2352
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,920
object yeah but but with an eye towards

2353
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:16,000
uh putting it on the earth and so uh and

2354
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,719
have it be recursive so

2355
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,198
you can have hexagons within hexagons

2356
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:23,359
which is hard because and probably a bad

2357
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:24,799
idea because you can't

2358
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:28,158
tile

2359
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:30,560
a hexagon with smaller hexagons

2360
01:27:28,158 --> 01:27:33,679
they don't they stick out

2361
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,560
got it so they're oh they stick out so

2362
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,039
there's a

2363
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:40,719
can you do some kind of fractal hexagon

2364
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:45,198
situation yeah yeah so so it's that and

2365
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:47,119
people who who know me um are always uh

2366
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:50,079
now now make fun of me for this so

2367
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:51,840
they'll send me if they if they see

2368
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:54,479
a picture with hexagons in it they'll

2369
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,920
like send me a link you know to to

2370
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:58,399
to make fun of me

2371
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:01,279
um so as some one of those people roger

2372
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:05,119
penrose or i i think

2373
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:07,519
roger's a little above my my level um

2374
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:11,279
he's into hexagons as well yeah and

2375
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:12,960
tiling yeah yeah so um so i did a lot of

2376
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:16,079
that and i thought you know it was

2377
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:18,158
pretty cool but um if there's some like

2378
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:21,760
surprisingly intractable

2379
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:24,799
problems that keep coming up like

2380
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,639
you you've always got to have

2381
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,960
some pentagons like if you start with a

2382
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:31,840
icosahedron which is

2383
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:34,239
equilateral triangles which is a logical

2384
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:36,400
place to start

2385
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:37,599
you can cover those with hexagons but

2386
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:39,759
every

2387
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,120
vertex where

2388
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,360
where the

2389
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:46,238
the triangles come together

2390
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:47,839
is a pentagon has to be a pentagon

2391
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,119
oh interesting so there's all hexagons

2392
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,440
and then there's a pentagon at the

2393
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:53,279
intersections yeah yeah cool how do you

2394
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:55,039
figure that out is that a known fact

2395
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:56,880
well it's just if you look at uh yeah

2396
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:58,479
like just by incidentally this thing got

2397
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,119
it yeah yeah so

2398
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:02,079
so you can't make that go away

2399
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:04,158
so

2400
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:05,920
any system that you come up with to do

2401
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:07,359
this has got to have

2402
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:10,000
this

2403
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:11,439
exceptions built into it for for those

2404
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
12 you could have

2405
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:16,960
quintillions of hexagons

2406
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,319
but you've still got to have 12

2407
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:22,480
pentagons somewhere

2408
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:25,198
so um

2409
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:28,000
so i've blown a hell of a lot of time on

2410
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:30,559
on that over the years by the way

2411
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,639
a lot of those kind of uh problems are

2412
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,520
very difficult to prove something about

2413
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,800
yeah

2414
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,760
yeah

2415
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,119
yeah

2416
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:42,000
and i think uber did it because someone

2417
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:43,920
one of my friends who uh

2418
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,399
who knows of my

2419
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,880
my interest in this and who likes to

2420
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:50,799
to give me a hard time

2421
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,400
sent me a link this is a couple years

2422
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,760
ago to

2423
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:56,559
some

2424
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:58,960
code base that i think came out of uber

2425
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,560
where they had done this

2426
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,639
you know you break break down the whole

2427
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,320
surface of the earth into into little

2428
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:07,119
hexagons

2429
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:08,158
so um that was a real knife through the

2430
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:08,960
heart

2431
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:09,920
um

2432
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,000
but

2433
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,000
i'll probably come back to it

2434
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,520
someday

2435
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,920
is there something special about

2436
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,120
hexagons are you interested in all kinds

2437
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,480
of tiling

2438
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:22,319
uh well

2439
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:24,399
i'm interested in all kinds of tiling

2440
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:27,119
but i'm not

2441
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:28,960
i know my limitations like as a as a

2442
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,760
math guy um

2443
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,560
so

2444
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:35,520
hexagons are about my speed

2445
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:37,280
um you know just a sufficient amount of

2446
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,239
complexity yeah

2447
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:41,198
yeah

2448
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:44,000
so but no tiling is a really interesting

2449
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:46,879
problem both two and three dimensional

2450
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,560
tiling problems are fascinating and

2451
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,960
they're one of those ancient puzzles

2452
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,960
that has

2453
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,279
attracted

2454
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:57,279
brainiacs for for centuries

2455
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,880
let me ask you a little bit about ai

2456
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:03,460
okay

2457
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,880
what are some

2458
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:06,079
[Music]

2459
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,239
likely

2460
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,719
interesting trajectories for the

2461
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:12,638
proliferation of ai in society over the

2462
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:15,198
next couple of decades do you think

2463
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:17,359
about this kind of stuff i

2464
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:19,198
do not think about it a lot because it's

2465
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:21,920
a deep topic and i'm not i don't

2466
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:25,119
consider myself super well informed

2467
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:27,600
about it and ai seems to be a term that

2468
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:28,719
has applied to a lot of different

2469
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,960
things

2470
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:33,439
so i've messed around just a tiny little

2471
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,560
bit with with neural nets

2472
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:37,279
with uh

2473
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:39,840
what's it called pca principle component

2474
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:43,519
analysis so i guess i tend to think in

2475
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:45,600
terms of sort of granular bottom-up

2476
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:48,480
um

2477
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:50,560
ideas rather than big picture

2478
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:52,399
top down you know oh god so like very

2479
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,400
specific algorithms like how are they

2480
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:56,238
going to

2481
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:58,559
what problem are they going to solve in

2482
01:31:56,238 --> 01:32:01,039
society such that that has like a lot of

2483
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,400
big ripple effects so yeah

2484
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:05,198
i mean

2485
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:06,638
we could talk a particular successful ai

2486
01:32:05,198 --> 01:32:08,960
systems

2487
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:10,560
and success defining different ways of

2488
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:14,880
recent years so

2489
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:17,120
one is language models with gpt-3

2490
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,880
most importantly they're self-supervised

2491
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:22,079
meaning they don't require much

2492
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:24,000
supervision from humans which means

2493
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:26,639
they can learn by just reading a huge

2494
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,399
amount of content created by humans so

2495
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:30,159
read the internet and from that be able

2496
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:31,599
to generate text and do all kinds of

2497
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:33,198
things like that

2498
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,079
it's possible to have a big enough

2499
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:38,238
neural network it's going to be able to

2500
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:41,439
have conversations with humans

2501
01:32:38,238 --> 01:32:43,439
based on just reading human language

2502
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:45,279
that's an interesting idea to me the

2503
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:47,599
very interesting idea

2504
01:32:45,279 --> 01:32:50,238
that people don't think about it

2505
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:52,159
as ai because it's they're kind of dumb

2506
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:54,799
currently is actual

2507
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:56,719
embodied robots so robotics like boston

2508
01:32:54,800 --> 01:33:00,079
dynamics i have

2509
01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:01,679
downstairs and upstairs uh legged robots

2510
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:02,559
uh

2511
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:05,199
you know

2512
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,159
the currently boston dynamics robots and

2513
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:08,799
most

2514
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:10,559
legged robots most robots period are

2515
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,719
pretty dumb

2516
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,239
this is most of the challenges have to

2517
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:15,920
do with the actual

2518
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:17,119
first of all the engineering of making

2519
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,119
the thing work

2520
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:20,399
getting a sensor suite that allows you

2521
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:22,960
to do it's the same thing as with

2522
01:33:20,399 --> 01:33:25,439
magically that base layer of like where

2523
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:26,880
is that stuff where am i yeah

2524
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:28,879
and uh

2525
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:31,840
what what am i looking at

2526
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:35,679
yeah i don't need to deeply understand

2527
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:37,119
uh my surroundings at a level of like

2528
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:39,679
like uh

2529
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:42,158
at a level beyond of what will hurt if i

2530
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:44,880
run into it yeah yeah yeah but even that

2531
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:46,559
is hard that's that's hard but the thing

2532
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,159
that i think

2533
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:51,520
people don't

2534
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:54,319
uh in the space explorer enough is the

2535
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,920
human robot interaction

2536
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:58,479
part of the

2537
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:01,520
of the picture which is how it makes

2538
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:02,959
humans feel how robots make humans feel

2539
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,800
and i think that's going to have a very

2540
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,560
significant impact

2541
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,199
in uh

2542
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:11,679
in the near future in society which is

2543
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:14,479
the more you integrate ai systems of

2544
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:15,600
whatever form into society where humans

2545
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:16,638
are

2546
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,360
uh

2547
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:21,520
in contact with them regularly

2548
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:23,679
so they could be embodied robotics or

2549
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,760
that could be social media algorithms i

2550
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,639
think that has a very significant impact

2551
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,039
and

2552
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,600
people often think like ai needs to be

2553
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:33,279
super smart to have an impact i think it

2554
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,679
needs to be super

2555
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:37,439
integrated with society to have an

2556
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:38,800
impact and more and more that's

2557
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:40,399
happening

2558
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:43,840
even if they're dumb

2559
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:45,118
yeah yeah no the um i mean a lot of my

2560
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:49,600
exposure

2561
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:51,359
to robots is is that i'm

2562
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,960
associated with a

2563
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:55,039
combat robotics

2564
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,439
team and i've been to a few battlebots

2565
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:59,039
competitions and that's not like in a

2566
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:00,559
lot of ways

2567
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:02,960
that's pretty far from the kind of

2568
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:05,760
robotics you're talking about um because

2569
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:08,319
the these robots are remote controlled

2570
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,679
they're they're not autonomous um

2571
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:12,238
and so

2572
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:15,199
um they're pretty simple but

2573
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:18,718
um it's interesting to watch people's

2574
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:20,879
emotional reactions to different robots

2575
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:23,359
so there was one that was in the last

2576
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:25,279
year's season the 2020

2577
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:26,639
season called rusty

2578
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:28,880
that uh

2579
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:32,159
was just uh like put together out of

2580
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:34,719
spare parts and it looked kind of cute

2581
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:36,238
and it became this huge crowd favorite

2582
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,960
because you could see it was made of

2583
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:40,799
like salad bowls and you know random

2584
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:43,118
pieces of hardware that this guy had

2585
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:45,440
like scavenged from his farm

2586
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:47,359
and so immediately

2587
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:49,279
people kind of fell in love with this

2588
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:50,639
one particular robot

2589
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:52,880
whereas they might

2590
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,840
other robots might be like the bad guy

2591
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,118
in a

2592
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,560
yeah you know if you think of

2593
01:35:55,118 --> 01:36:00,719
professional wrestling you know the heel

2594
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,119
and the baby face

2595
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:06,000
so people do for reasons that are hard

2596
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:08,000
to understand form these emotional

2597
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,920
reactions we form narratives in the same

2598
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,840
way we do when we meet human beings we

2599
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:13,520
tell stories about these objects and

2600
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,840
they can be intelligent and they can be

2601
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:18,320
biological or they can be

2602
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:20,400
in almost almost close to inanimate

2603
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:23,198
objects yeah and that to me is kind of

2604
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:24,960
fascinating and

2605
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:27,279
if robots

2606
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:29,520
choose to lean into that

2607
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:32,238
it creates an interesting world

2608
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,480
if they start uh using feedback loops to

2609
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:36,079
make themselves cuter

2610
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:38,399
not just cuter but everything that

2611
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:41,198
humans do let's not let's let's let's

2612
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:43,279
let's not speak harshly robots humans do

2613
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:44,319
the same no i didn't was wasn't meaning

2614
01:36:43,279 --> 01:36:46,079
it

2615
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:47,679
but right humans

2616
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:49,519
based on feedback

2617
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:51,600
will change their appearance yes they're

2618
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:53,040
just on instagram all the time how do i

2619
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,039
look cuter that's the fundamental

2620
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:57,519
question i ask myself yeah so why

2621
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:59,198
wouldn't why wouldn't a robot wanna it's

2622
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,880
like oh wow people

2623
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:02,079
people really don't like the you know

2624
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:05,039
quad mount

2625
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:07,198
machine gun you know on top of my turret

2626
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:08,880
maybe i should get rid of that and that

2627
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:09,839
would you know people would feel more at

2628
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,480
ease

2629
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:15,920
uh or or lean into it yeah proud of it

2630
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:17,678
yeah uh like uh you won't take my gun

2631
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:20,560
whatever the saying is

2632
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:21,679
from my dead cold hands

2633
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,440
um

2634
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:25,039
i mean their their personality adding

2635
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:27,759
personalities such that you can start to

2636
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:29,920
heal you can start to weave narratives

2637
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:33,880
i think that's a

2638
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,880
fascinating place where

2639
01:37:34,079 --> 01:37:38,719
there's this feedback loop like you said

2640
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:40,559
where

2641
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:42,719
ai

2642
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:45,679
when it's especially when it's embodied

2643
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:48,079
puts a mirror to ourselves

2644
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:49,199
just like other humans are our close

2645
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:52,639
friends

2646
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:54,879
they kind of teach us about ourselves

2647
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:57,039
we teach each other and through that

2648
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:02,079
process grow close

2649
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:04,158
and it to me it's so fascinating to um

2650
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:06,079
to expand the space

2651
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:08,238
of deep meaningful interactions beyond

2652
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:10,158
just humans

2653
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:12,399
that um

2654
01:38:10,158 --> 01:38:15,279
that's the opportunity i see

2655
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:17,839
with with robots and with ai systems

2656
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:19,599
and that's why i don't like

2657
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,800
my biggest problem social media

2658
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,960
algorithms

2659
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,920
is the lack of transparency it's not the

2660
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:28,079
existence of the algorithms it's

2661
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,679
uh well there's many things one is the

2662
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:32,238
data data should be controlled by the

2663
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:34,480
individual by people yeah themselves

2664
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:36,559
so uh but also the lack of transparency

2665
01:38:34,479 --> 01:38:38,638
and how the algorithms work and change

2666
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:41,440
your perception of what's real

2667
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:43,760
yeah yeah in hidden ways yeah

2668
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:45,279
in hidden ways yeah like you should be

2669
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:47,440
aware just like when you take i don't

2670
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:49,039
know if you take psychedelics

2671
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:51,279
you should be aware that you took the

2672
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,600
second hour it shouldn't be a surprise

2673
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:54,639
yeah and second you should

2674
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,920
i mean

2675
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:59,440
uh become a student and a scholar and

2676
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,840
there should be research done there

2677
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:04,000
should be open conversation about how

2678
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,440
your perception is changed and you

2679
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,198
and then you are

2680
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:11,599
become your own guide in this world of

2681
01:39:09,198 --> 01:39:13,118
altered perception because arguably none

2682
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:16,560
of it is real

2683
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:17,599
you get to choose the flavor of real

2684
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,880
um

2685
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,600
i mean

2686
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:24,239
this is something you explore

2687
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,840
quite a bit do you um

2688
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:28,079
yourself

2689
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:30,880
think that there is

2690
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:33,039
a bottom to it where there is reality

2691
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,319
there's a base layer of reality

2692
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:35,039
that physics

2693
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:37,840
can

2694
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:40,399
explore and our human perception sort of

2695
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,520
layer stuff is there's is there let's go

2696
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:44,799
to plato

2697
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:47,600
is there such a thing as truth

2698
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:50,320
i lean towards the platonic view of

2699
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:52,320
things so i believe that mathematical

2700
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:54,399
objects haven't

2701
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:57,519
a reality that

2702
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:58,799
it's not all made up by by human minds

2703
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,320
um

2704
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,239
and i don't know

2705
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:04,880
where that reality

2706
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:07,439
comes from i can't explain it but but i

2707
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:11,840
do think that mathematical objects are

2708
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:11,839
discovered and not uh invented

2709
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:15,039
the

2710
01:40:13,039 --> 01:40:17,359
um

2711
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:19,519
i i did a lot of

2712
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:22,079
not a lot but i did some

2713
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:24,159
some reading of husserole when i was

2714
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:25,439
writing anathem

2715
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:27,439
um

2716
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:30,399
and he's a

2717
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:33,678
you know 20th century phenomenologist

2718
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:35,279
and he's writing in the he's writing at

2719
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:37,440
the same time as

2720
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:38,719
as scientists are starting to understand

2721
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:42,158
atoms

2722
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:44,719
and and becoming aware that

2723
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:46,238
that when we look at this table

2724
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:50,000
it's really just a

2725
01:40:46,238 --> 01:40:52,799
slab of almost entirely vacuum and

2726
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,840
there's a very sparse

2727
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:59,119
uh arrangement of tiny tiny little

2728
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:00,960
particles there um occupying that space

2729
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:02,479
that interact with each other in such a

2730
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:06,880
way that

2731
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:08,000
our brains perceive this object

2732
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,440
so

2733
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,238
that's kind of kind of the beginnings of

2734
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:13,519
phenomenology

2735
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:16,479
um

2736
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:18,159
and um and his stuff is pretty hard to

2737
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:19,839
um

2738
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:21,839
hard to read

2739
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:24,960
it you really have to

2740
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:27,920
take it in small bites

2741
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:30,158
and go a little bit at a time but he's

2742
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,560
trying to come to grips with these

2743
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:35,359
with these kinds of of questions

2744
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:38,320
how did you come to grips with it

2745
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:40,799
like why why is this table feel solid

2746
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:43,840
well i mean we're an evolved system that

2747
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,039
there's we have biological advantages in

2748
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,199
in knowing

2749
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:50,719
where solid objects are so we've got

2750
01:41:47,198 --> 01:41:50,719
this system in our head that

2751
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,000
that integrates our perceptions into

2752
01:41:53,118 --> 01:41:57,198
this

2753
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,800
coherent view of things

2754
01:41:57,198 --> 01:42:00,479
that

2755
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:03,199
one of the

2756
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:04,919
take-homes that i i like

2757
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:07,359
from whosoereal is the idea of

2758
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:09,760
inter-subjectivity and the idea that

2759
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:13,198
a fundamental

2760
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:15,840
requirement for us to stay sane is

2761
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:18,319
for us to share our perceptions

2762
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:20,319
and have them ratified by other

2763
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:21,118
and they don't even have to be people

2764
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:22,000
but

2765
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:24,559
um

2766
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,319
that you know a prisoner in solitary

2767
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:29,600
confinement might

2768
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:31,118
domesticate a mouse or even insects

2769
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:33,520
uh because

2770
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:35,920
they perceive the same things that the

2771
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:38,560
prisoner perceives um

2772
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:40,079
and uh and so convince

2773
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,960
convince him that he's not just

2774
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:45,039
hallucinating yeah there's a

2775
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:46,000
establish a consensus

2776
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:48,158
yeah

2777
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,118
but see that doesn't mean it's any of it

2778
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:51,920
is real

2779
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:54,639
you just establish a consensus

2780
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:58,880
it uh it could be very um yeah

2781
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:58,880
very distant from something that um

2782
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:04,879
something that's real in in um

2783
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:07,118
engineering sense of real

2784
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:08,159
like that you could build it using

2785
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:10,559
physics

2786
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:13,359
but i think that uh you know valuable

2787
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:14,320
application for an ai robot would be

2788
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:17,519
just

2789
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:18,479
to do nothing except that it just um

2790
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:21,760
so

2791
01:43:18,479 --> 01:43:24,399
um consensus it just sits there yeah and

2792
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:26,000
if if you hear a door slam

2793
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:28,158
you might turn to

2794
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,238
to see what it is if the robot

2795
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:32,319
at the same time turns

2796
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:35,279
to to look at the door slam it's

2797
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:37,359
ratifying your perception but isn't that

2798
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:41,439
the basis of love

2799
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:44,479
is when the door slams you both look

2800
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:47,759
but for deeper things

2801
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:47,759
you both hear the same music

2802
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:52,000
and others don't i mean isn't that

2803
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:54,559
what that

2804
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,439
that's by by love i mean depth of human

2805
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,560
connection yeah like it that that's

2806
01:43:57,439 --> 01:44:00,399
or not

2807
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:03,119
you arrive at similar

2808
01:44:00,399 --> 01:44:06,079
reactions uh without having to

2809
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:09,039
to explicitly communicate it yeah yeah

2810
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:11,600
but we could start with a a robot that

2811
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:15,279
listens explicitly for the

2812
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:18,079
slam doors yeah but no i've scary sounds

2813
01:44:15,279 --> 01:44:20,639
i i can think of so an example of this

2814
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:20,639
is you know

2815
01:44:21,439 --> 01:44:26,238
when i when i went to college you know

2816
01:44:23,359 --> 01:44:28,238
we'd be sitting at the cafeteria a you

2817
01:44:26,238 --> 01:44:30,879
know a bunch of people

2818
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:33,839
you know eating our dinner together that

2819
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:35,520
we had just met let's say yeah

2820
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:37,600
so um

2821
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,639
a bunch of new people in your life and

2822
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:41,199
um

2823
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:44,239
and someone might make a funny remark or

2824
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:45,519
a not so funny remark or um something

2825
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:46,319
would happen

2826
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,320
and

2827
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:51,840
you might then at that moment make eye

2828
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:54,079
contact with someone you didn't know

2829
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,360
at the other end of the table and in

2830
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:57,198
that moment

2831
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:59,920
you would realize

2832
01:44:57,198 --> 01:45:01,519
this person is reacting this person

2833
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,960
heard what i heard

2834
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:05,679
they're reacting

2835
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:07,920
the way i reacted yeah nobody else

2836
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:10,158
appears to get the joke or

2837
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:12,560
to understand what just happened but

2838
01:45:10,158 --> 01:45:14,960
random stranger down there and i we have

2839
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:16,400
this connection yeah and then you build

2840
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,760
on that so then

2841
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:20,158
the next time

2842
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:22,560
something happens you automatically

2843
01:45:20,158 --> 01:45:24,719
look at your new friend and they look

2844
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,000
back at you and and before you know it

2845
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:28,079
you know you're

2846
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
you're hanging out together yeah because

2847
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:32,319
you you know you've already established

2848
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,960
without even talking to each other

2849
01:45:32,319 --> 01:45:36,000
that uh you're on the same wavelength

2850
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:38,399
yeah

2851
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,479
it's seemingly so simple

2852
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:42,158
what's so powerful that's establishing

2853
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:44,399
that you're on the same wavelength yeah

2854
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:46,079
at some level yeah

2855
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,000
there's no reason why you and a toaster

2856
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:50,639
can't have that

2857
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,979
i'm just saying

2858
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:54,000
this smell burned to you

2859
01:45:51,979 --> 01:45:55,439
[Laughter]

2860
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,840
exactly i think it's

2861
01:45:55,439 --> 01:45:58,638
if a toaster could just say that to you

2862
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,560
yeah

2863
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:03,359
yeah

2864
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:06,000
cryptonomicon published in 1999

2865
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:09,359
set in the late 90s and involves hackers

2866
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:13,840
who build essentially cryptocurrency

2867
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:13,839
bitcoin white paper came out in 2008

2868
01:46:14,479 --> 01:46:21,519
so i i have to kind of ask uh

2869
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:23,279
from you looking at this

2870
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:25,119
layout of what's been happening in

2871
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:27,599
cryptocurrency

2872
01:46:25,118 --> 01:46:28,880
the evolution of this technology

2873
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:30,880
how has it

2874
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:33,199
rolled out

2875
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:35,920
differently than you could have imagined

2876
01:46:33,198 --> 01:46:37,519
in two ways one the technology itself

2877
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,679
into

2878
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:42,320
the human side of things the human

2879
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:43,359
stories of the hackers

2880
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:45,759
and

2881
01:46:43,359 --> 01:46:47,118
the financial folks and the powerful and

2882
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:49,920
the powerless

2883
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:52,158
the human side of things yeah well

2884
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:54,239
cryptonomicon is pre

2885
01:46:52,158 --> 01:46:56,559
bitcoin it's pre pre-satoshi it's

2886
01:46:54,238 --> 01:46:57,839
pre-blockchain as you point out

2887
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,719
so

2888
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:01,360
um

2889
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:04,319
at that point uh i was kind of reacting

2890
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:06,719
to what i was seeing among

2891
01:47:04,319 --> 01:47:08,799
people like the bay area cypherpunks in

2892
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:12,560
berkeley there was some sun there was a

2893
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:15,199
branch here in austin as well

2894
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:16,880
and a lot of their

2895
01:47:15,198 --> 01:47:18,960
thinking was

2896
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:20,400
so based on the idea that you would have

2897
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:24,639
to have

2898
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:27,118
a physical uh region of the earth that

2899
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:28,560
was free of government

2900
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:31,039
interference

2901
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:33,119
you couldn't achieve that freedom

2902
01:47:31,039 --> 01:47:35,279
by purely mathematical

2903
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:38,158
means on the network you actually had to

2904
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:40,238
have you know a room somewhere with

2905
01:47:38,158 --> 01:47:41,679
servers in it um

2906
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:43,519
that that

2907
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:44,639
a government couldn't come and and

2908
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:47,280
meddle with

2909
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:49,600
and so a lot of ideation happened around

2910
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:51,039
that view of things that

2911
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:53,119
there were efforts to figure out

2912
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:55,359
jurisdictions where this might work

2913
01:47:53,118 --> 01:47:58,319
there was a lot of interest for a while

2914
01:47:55,359 --> 01:48:01,359
in anguilla which is a caribbean island

2915
01:47:58,319 --> 01:48:02,799
that had some unusual jurisdictional

2916
01:48:01,359 --> 01:48:06,079
properties

2917
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:08,239
there was sea land sea land which is a

2918
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:09,198
platform in the north sea

2919
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:10,879
um

2920
01:48:09,198 --> 01:48:12,638
and so there was a lot of effort that

2921
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:15,760
went into finding these physical

2922
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:17,118
locations that that were deemed kind of

2923
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,800
safe

2924
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:20,238
and that all

2925
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,039
goes away

2926
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:22,238
with

2927
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:25,519
blockchain

2928
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:27,118
it's no longer necessary

2929
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:28,770
and so that really changes the picture

2930
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:29,920
in a lot of ways because

2931
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:31,679
[Music]

2932
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:34,158
you no longer have

2933
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:37,039
i mean from a novelist point of view the

2934
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:39,279
old system was a lot more fun to work

2935
01:48:37,039 --> 01:48:40,560
with because it gives you a situation

2936
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:42,639
where hackers

2937
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,960
are wandering around in strange parts of

2938
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:46,880
the world you know trying to set up

2939
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:48,800
server rooms so that's a great

2940
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,000
storytelling

2941
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,520
thing

2942
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,920
there's still a little bit of that right

2943
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:55,840
in the modern world but it's just

2944
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:58,480
there's several server rooms as opposed

2945
01:48:55,840 --> 01:49:00,960
to one centralized one yeah yeah and

2946
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:03,519
there's the like the new wrinkle is the

2947
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,880
need to do a lot of computation

2948
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,000
and to keep your

2949
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:09,279
your uh

2950
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:12,079
your your gpus from melting down so

2951
01:49:09,279 --> 01:49:13,759
people building things in iceland or or

2952
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:15,760
in shipping containers on the bottom of

2953
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:16,719
the ocean or whatever

2954
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,880
um

2955
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:20,319
so um but there's still governments

2956
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,920
involved and there's they're still from

2957
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:23,439
a novelist perspective interesting

2958
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:26,319
dynamics

2959
01:49:23,439 --> 01:49:28,559
what is big governments like china and

2960
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:30,319
and more sort of renegade governments

2961
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,159
from all over the world trying to

2962
01:49:30,319 --> 01:49:35,198
contend with this idea

2963
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:37,839
of what to do uh in terms of control and

2964
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:40,399
power over these kinds of

2965
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:42,960
centers that do the mining of the yeah

2966
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:45,279
of the cryptocurrency yeah so we're in a

2967
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:46,239
stage now that kind of goes beyond the

2968
01:49:45,279 --> 01:49:47,599
initial

2969
01:49:46,238 --> 01:49:50,718
like there's

2970
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:53,679
the stuff i was describing in

2971
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:56,560
kryptonomicon had a little bit of error

2972
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:58,158
about it of the underpants gnomes uh in

2973
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:59,760
that you know we're gonna we're gonna

2974
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:01,039
build this system

2975
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:03,760
and then

2976
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:06,639
we'll make money somehow uh but the the

2977
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:08,400
intermediate step was was left out

2978
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:10,880
um

2979
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:13,439
and that is uh

2980
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,480
uh i i think we're now

2981
01:50:13,439 --> 01:50:16,960
so

2982
01:50:14,479 --> 01:50:18,238
into that phase of the thing where the

2983
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,079
where bitcoin

2984
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:21,359
you know blockchain exists people know

2985
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:24,158
how it works

2986
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:26,479
uh bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

2987
01:50:24,158 --> 01:50:28,399
exist people are using them and it's

2988
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:30,399
sort of like okay what now you know

2989
01:50:28,399 --> 01:50:31,679
where does this all lead

2990
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:34,079
um

2991
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:36,719
so um do you have a sense of where it

2992
01:50:34,079 --> 01:50:39,439
all leads like is it is it possible that

2993
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:42,560
the set of technology kind of

2994
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:42,559
continues to have

2995
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:47,359
transformational effects on

2996
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:49,520
not just sort of

2997
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:52,559
finance but

2998
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:55,199
who gets to have power in this world

2999
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:58,080
so the decentralization of power

3000
01:50:55,198 --> 01:51:01,359
you know big questions right so i guess

3001
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:02,479
there's a little bit of the cynic in me

3002
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:04,880
thinking that

3003
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:07,598
as soon as it becomes important enough

3004
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:10,480
the existing banks and people in power

3005
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:13,119
are gonna sort of control it i guess an

3006
01:51:10,479 --> 01:51:16,479
easy answer is that maybe it won't be a

3007
01:51:13,118 --> 01:51:20,479
big change in the end um

3008
01:51:16,479 --> 01:51:22,959
there's a utopian strain sometimes in in

3009
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:25,198
the way people think about this that

3010
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:27,599
i'm not so sure about

3011
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:29,359
there there's a there is a technological

3012
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:32,400
aspect to

3013
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:34,960
bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

3014
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:39,279
that make it a little easier

3015
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:41,279
to uh pull along the utopian thread yeah

3016
01:51:39,279 --> 01:51:42,559
because it's harder for governments to

3017
01:51:41,279 --> 01:51:45,359
control

3018
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:47,119
bitcoin yeah i mean they they have much

3019
01:51:45,359 --> 01:51:49,359
fewer options

3020
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:50,719
the they can ban they can make it

3021
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:52,960
illegal

3022
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:54,960
it's more difficult yeah so technology

3023
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:58,000
here is on the side of the powerless the

3024
01:51:54,960 --> 01:52:00,000
voiceless which is a very interesting

3025
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,439
idea of course yes it does have a

3026
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,520
utopian

3027
01:52:01,439 --> 01:52:05,598
feel to it but we have been making

3028
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:07,199
progress throughout human history yeah

3029
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:08,319
maybe this is what progress looks like

3030
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:10,638
there will be

3031
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:12,479
the powerful and the greedy

3032
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:15,599
and the bureaucrats that take advantage

3033
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:17,759
of it skim off the top kind of thing

3034
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:19,360
but maybe this does give um

3035
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:20,719
more power to people that haven't had

3036
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:24,158
power before

3037
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:28,319
in a good way like distributing power

3038
01:52:24,158 --> 01:52:30,079
and enabling sort of more um

3039
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:32,639
greater resistance to sort of uh

3040
01:52:30,079 --> 01:52:34,158
dictatorships and authoritarian regimes

3041
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:34,960
that kind of thing

3042
01:52:34,158 --> 01:52:38,158
um

3043
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:40,079
and also enabling all kinds of

3044
01:52:38,158 --> 01:52:41,759
technologies built built on top of it

3045
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:45,439
ultimately when you

3046
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:47,599
digitize money uh you know money is a

3047
01:52:45,439 --> 01:52:48,638
kind of speech or is it's kind of like

3048
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:51,440
um

3049
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:53,199
mechanism of

3050
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:54,799
how humans interact

3051
01:52:53,198 --> 01:52:56,879
and if you make that digital more and

3052
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:59,760
more of the world moves to the digital

3053
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:01,199
space and then you could have

3054
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:02,800
the

3055
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:04,879
then you can finally fully live in that

3056
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:05,760
virtual reality with the toaster and

3057
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,560
then

3058
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:08,719
yeah

3059
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:10,960
yeah in a lot of ways i think in that

3060
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:13,198
realm of technology that the money per

3061
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:15,118
se is one of the less interesting things

3062
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:17,359
you can do with it so i think you know

3063
01:53:15,118 --> 01:53:20,799
cryptographically enforceable contracts

3064
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:23,519
and um and organizations built on those

3065
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:26,880
that seems to me like it's got more

3066
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:28,480
potential for change just because we do

3067
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,000
already have

3068
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:32,559
money

3069
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:35,439
and although it's an old system

3070
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:36,400
um it's been digitized to a large extent

3071
01:53:35,439 --> 01:53:38,399
by

3072
01:53:36,399 --> 01:53:41,759
you know the the stripes and the credit

3073
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:44,319
card companies of the world

3074
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:46,960
and i also love the idea of like uh

3075
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:48,880
connecting so to connect to smart

3076
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,560
contracts connecting data

3077
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:52,400
sort of uh

3078
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:55,360
making it more formal it's like

3079
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:59,039
mathematica more structured the

3080
01:53:55,359 --> 01:54:00,399
integration of data of weather data

3081
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:02,920
of uh

3082
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:05,839
all kinds of data about the the

3083
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:08,800
the stuff in the world so they can make

3084
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:10,560
contracts between people that in that's

3085
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:13,599
grounded in data and that's actually

3086
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,599
getting closer to

3087
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:17,199
something like truth

3088
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:19,359
because then you can make agreements

3089
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:22,799
based on actual data versus kind of

3090
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:24,238
perceptions of data and if you can

3091
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,320
formalize

3092
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:28,079
like distribute the power of who gets to

3093
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:30,719
tell the story yeah

3094
01:54:28,079 --> 01:54:33,439
that that's an interesting kind of um

3095
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:35,198
resistance yeah again the

3096
01:54:33,439 --> 01:54:37,118
powerful in the space of narrative yeah

3097
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:38,638
david brin has been saying for a while

3098
01:54:37,118 --> 01:54:41,839
that um

3099
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:44,239
the only way to settle arguments with

3100
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,639
you know across the political divide

3101
01:54:44,238 --> 01:54:48,319
is to to make bets

3102
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:49,440
so people can say

3103
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:52,000
you know

3104
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:54,079
the election was stolen or you know what

3105
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,079
whatever controversial

3106
01:54:54,079 --> 01:54:56,960
position they're they're taking

3107
01:54:56,079 --> 01:55:00,559
um

3108
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:01,679
and they'll keep saying it until you

3109
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:05,360
you uh

3110
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:06,960
you wager real money on it

3111
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:09,920
so um

3112
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:12,960
so maybe there's something there

3113
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:14,960
if you could uh kind of turn that into a

3114
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:16,719
put a user interface on that

3115
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:19,760
thing you know

3116
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:21,599
yeah have a stake in your uh

3117
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:23,360
in your divisiveness in your your

3118
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:24,800
arguments right

3119
01:55:23,359 --> 01:55:27,439
right

3120
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:29,119
will uh dogecoin take over the world

3121
01:55:27,439 --> 01:55:31,519
twitter questions you know i don't i

3122
01:55:29,118 --> 01:55:33,839
don't follow the the different coins

3123
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:36,159
that much so i don't i i hear about

3124
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:38,239
dogecoin and you know i've kind of

3125
01:55:36,158 --> 01:55:40,638
followed the story of it so the

3126
01:55:38,238 --> 01:55:42,799
interesting aspect of doshcoin

3127
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,000
is it

3128
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,400
so

3129
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,639
in contrast to like uh bitcoin and

3130
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:50,000
ethereum which are these

3131
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:51,840
serious

3132
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,198
implementations of cryptocurrency that

3133
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,800
seek to solve some of the problems that

3134
01:55:53,198 --> 01:55:55,598
we're talking about with smart contracts

3135
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:58,079
and

3136
01:55:55,599 --> 01:56:00,400
and uh resist the

3137
01:55:58,079 --> 01:56:02,880
the banks and all those kinds of things

3138
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:05,439
deutsche coin operates more in the space

3139
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:07,760
of memes and humor

3140
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:10,559
while still doing some of them similar

3141
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:12,239
things and it presents to the world sort

3142
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:15,039
of a question of

3143
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:16,158
whether um

3144
01:56:15,039 --> 01:56:17,920
memes

3145
01:56:16,158 --> 01:56:19,920
whether humor

3146
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:22,960
whether narrative

3147
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:24,800
will go a long way

3148
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:25,840
in the future

3149
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,480
like

3150
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,760
much farther than some kind of boring

3151
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:32,238
old

3152
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:34,400
uh grounded technologies

3153
01:56:32,238 --> 01:56:35,198
whether we'll be playing in the space of

3154
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:37,439
fun

3155
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:39,919
like once we built a base

3156
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:41,919
of comfort and stability

3157
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:44,079
and like a robust system where everyone

3158
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:46,079
has shelter everyone has

3159
01:56:44,079 --> 01:56:47,359
uh

3160
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:49,760
food

3161
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:53,118
and the basic needs covered are we going

3162
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:54,639
to then operate in the space of fun

3163
01:56:53,118 --> 01:56:58,158
that's that's why i think about deutsche

3164
01:56:54,639 --> 01:57:00,000
going because it seems like fun

3165
01:56:58,158 --> 01:57:02,000
spreads faster

3166
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,599
than anything else

3167
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,158
fun of different kinds and that could be

3168
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:08,239
bad fun and they could be good fun yeah

3169
01:57:06,158 --> 01:57:11,279
and so it's a battle of

3170
01:57:08,238 --> 01:57:13,118
good fights goes very very quickly

3171
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:15,359
when you when you if you post something

3172
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:17,439
that people find fun to yeah and that's

3173
01:57:15,359 --> 01:57:19,279
what does coin represents so there's

3174
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:20,879
like so bitcoin represents like

3175
01:57:19,279 --> 01:57:21,759
financial

3176
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:23,039
uh

3177
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,440
like

3178
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:27,599
serious financial instruments yeah and

3179
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:30,559
then deutsche represents fun

3180
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:33,679
and it's interesting to watch the battle

3181
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:36,320
go on on the internet to see which wins

3182
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:38,560
this is also like open question to me of

3183
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:40,639
what is the internet

3184
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:43,280
because um

3185
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:45,760
fun seems to prevail on the internet

3186
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:47,359
and is that a fundamental property of

3187
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:49,599
the internet moving forward when you

3188
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:51,279
look 100 years out or is this a

3189
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:52,800
temporary thing

3190
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:54,639
that was true at the birth of the

3191
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:57,360
internet and it's just true for a couple

3192
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:59,440
of decades until it fades away and and

3193
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:01,839
the adults take over and become serious

3194
01:57:59,439 --> 01:58:04,719
again well i think the adults took over

3195
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:06,480
initially and then it was later on that

3196
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:09,840
people started using it for fun

3197
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:11,439
frivolous things like memes

3198
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:13,360
and that's i think that's pretty much

3199
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:14,559
unstoppable

3200
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:15,519
you know

3201
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:17,440
yeah

3202
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,560
because even people who are very serious

3203
01:58:17,439 --> 01:58:21,519
uh

3204
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:24,159
you know enjoy um

3205
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:26,400
sending around a funny picture or uh

3206
01:58:24,158 --> 01:58:28,879
something that amuses them

3207
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:30,719
yeah i i personally think

3208
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:32,960
we spoke about world war ii i think

3209
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:35,599
memes will save the world and prevent

3210
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:37,439
all future wars

3211
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:39,440
you've been handwriting your work for

3212
01:58:37,439 --> 01:58:41,839
the past 20 years since writing the

3213
01:58:39,439 --> 01:58:44,960
baroque cycle what are the pros and cons

3214
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:46,960
of handwriting versus typing for me i

3215
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:49,279
started it as an experiment when i

3216
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:51,118
started the baroque cycle because i had

3217
01:58:49,279 --> 01:58:52,000
noticed that if i sometimes if i was

3218
01:58:51,118 --> 01:58:54,079
stuck

3219
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,679
having a hard time getting started if i

3220
01:58:54,079 --> 01:58:58,719
just picked up a pen

3221
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:59,920
and started writing it was easy to

3222
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:01,279
to go

3223
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:04,158
so

3224
01:59:01,279 --> 01:59:06,079
i just decided to keep with that if it

3225
01:59:04,158 --> 01:59:07,679
got in my way i didn't like it i could

3226
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:10,079
always just go back to the word

3227
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:11,920
processor it'd be fine so but i never

3228
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:14,319
that never happened so

3229
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:16,560
there's a certain security that comes

3230
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:18,399
from knowing that it's ink on paper and

3231
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:20,719
there's no

3232
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:24,559
operating system crash or software

3233
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:24,560
failure that can obliterate it

3234
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:27,279
there's

3235
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:32,880
it's a slower output

3236
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:34,000
technique and so

3237
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,400
um

3238
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,880
a sentence or a paragraph spends a

3239
01:59:36,399 --> 01:59:41,198
longer time in the buffer up here

3240
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:43,599
before it gets committed

3241
01:59:41,198 --> 01:59:44,559
to paper whereas i can type really fast

3242
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:47,920
and so

3243
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:49,280
i can slam things out before i've really

3244
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:54,000
thought them through so i think the

3245
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:54,000
first draft quality ends up being higher

3246
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:59,920
and then editing first draft of editing

3247
01:59:57,039 --> 02:00:01,279
is just faster because

3248
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,158
instead of like trying to move the

3249
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:06,238
cursor around or whatever

3250
02:00:04,158 --> 02:00:07,198
or you know hitting the backspace key i

3251
02:00:06,238 --> 02:00:09,198
can just

3252
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:10,000
draw a line through a word or a sentence

3253
02:00:09,198 --> 02:00:12,319
or

3254
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,279
just around a whole paragraph and exit

3255
02:00:12,319 --> 02:00:14,238
out

3256
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:16,639
um

3257
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:18,319
and in doing so i very quickly created

3258
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:20,480
an edit but i've also left behind a

3259
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:22,000
record of what the text was prior to the

3260
02:00:20,479 --> 02:00:24,158
edit

3261
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,319
of course you know all the digital

3262
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:28,158
versions have those quote-unquote

3263
02:00:26,319 --> 02:00:31,198
features but their

3264
02:00:28,158 --> 02:00:33,759
experience is different yeah yeah is

3265
02:00:31,198 --> 02:00:36,399
there a romance to just

3266
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:36,400
the physical

3267
02:00:37,359 --> 02:00:42,238
you know the touch of the pen to the

3268
02:00:39,279 --> 02:00:44,238
paper doing what has been done for

3269
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:45,678
centuries i think there is i think

3270
02:00:44,238 --> 02:00:47,678
there's a

3271
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:50,239
just the simplicity of it

3272
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:52,719
and not having any intermediary

3273
02:00:50,238 --> 02:00:54,559
technology beyond the pen

3274
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:57,439
and the paper

3275
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:59,599
is just very simple and clean

3276
02:00:57,439 --> 02:00:59,598
and

3277
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:06,239
so i've got a bunch of fountain pens and

3278
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:09,520
i i started buying fancy paper from

3279
02:01:06,238 --> 02:01:12,319
italy a few years ago because uh

3280
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:13,280
i i thought i would be more conservative

3281
02:01:12,319 --> 02:01:15,840
with it

3282
02:01:13,279 --> 02:01:18,238
you know it but it still doesn't it

3283
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:20,239
it's still a trivial

3284
02:01:18,238 --> 02:01:21,279
expenditure so it doesn't really alter

3285
02:01:20,238 --> 02:01:24,079
my

3286
02:01:21,279 --> 02:01:25,840
my habits very much

3287
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:28,719
so all that said

3288
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:32,000
you once you do type stuff up

3289
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:34,719
you use emacs yeah i use emacs obviously

3290
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:37,359
the superior editor of course

3291
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:38,960
you uh let me just ask the ridiculous

3292
02:01:37,359 --> 02:01:40,960
futuristic question because emacs has

3293
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:43,599
been around forever

3294
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:47,760
do you think in 100 years

3295
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:47,760
we will still have emacs and vim

3296
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:55,039
or like pick it pick a let's say 50 100

3297
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:58,400
years yeah yeah yes yeah no i mean

3298
02:01:55,039 --> 02:01:59,198
whenever you're doing anything in linux

3299
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:00,960
you

3300
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:03,039
you're spending a lot of time editing

3301
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:05,520
little config files and

3302
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:07,920
scripts and stuff and uh you need to be

3303
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:10,400
able to pop in and out of

3304
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:11,840
of editing those things and it needs to

3305
02:02:10,399 --> 02:02:14,238
work

3306
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:17,679
like even if the the windowing

3307
02:02:14,238 --> 02:02:20,479
gui is dead and all you've got is like a

3308
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:22,880
command line you you to get out of that

3309
02:02:20,479 --> 02:02:23,919
problem you might need to to enter an

3310
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:27,279
editor

3311
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:28,880
and uh and alter a file so i think on

3312
02:02:27,279 --> 02:02:30,800
that level

3313
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,639
there always have to be

3314
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,119
sort of uh

3315
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:36,880
very simple well emacs isn't very simple

3316
02:02:35,118 --> 02:02:38,799
but you know you know what i mean there

3317
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:40,319
there have to be basic editors that you

3318
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:43,760
can use

3319
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:47,279
from either the command line or a gui

3320
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:49,599
just for administering systems

3321
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:51,359
now how widespread they'll be

3322
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:52,400
um

3323
02:02:51,359 --> 02:02:54,559
you know

3324
02:02:52,399 --> 02:02:56,399
there's a certain amount of um what's

3325
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:59,199
the story of the

3326
02:02:56,399 --> 02:03:00,399
the there's the the american folk tale

3327
02:02:59,198 --> 02:03:01,198
of the

3328
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:03,679
the

3329
02:03:01,198 --> 02:03:05,919
the guy who the hammer guy who drives

3330
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:08,800
the railroad spikes john henry

3331
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:10,800
trying to keep up with the steam hammer

3332
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:13,119
and eventually this the steam hammer

3333
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:15,199
wins because he can't drive the spikes

3334
02:03:13,118 --> 02:03:17,519
fast enough so there's there's a sense

3335
02:03:15,198 --> 02:03:20,879
in which

3336
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:20,880
you know microsoft like

3337
02:03:21,198 --> 02:03:27,439
who knows how much they've invested in

3338
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:30,800
code you know visual studio to to you

3339
02:03:27,439 --> 02:03:33,359
know or or apple with xcode so they've

3340
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:34,560
put huge amounts of money into

3341
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:36,238
enhancing

3342
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:39,679
their ides

3343
02:03:36,238 --> 02:03:40,839
and emacs in theory can duplicate

3344
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:42,480
all of those

3345
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:43,840
features

3346
02:03:42,479 --> 02:03:46,079
by you know

3347
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:48,639
if you just have enough linux hackers

3348
02:03:46,079 --> 02:03:49,679
writing emacs lisp macros

3349
02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:53,359
um

3350
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:54,880
but you know at some point um

3351
02:03:53,359 --> 02:03:57,118
it's gonna be hard to

3352
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:58,880
to maintain that

3353
02:03:57,118 --> 02:04:02,960
level of uh

3354
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:04,880
of to to keep up feature for feature

3355
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:08,158
the the interesting thing about emacs

3356
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:10,639
just is lasted a long time yeah and i i

3357
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:12,638
think if you talked about that

3358
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:15,118
there's a certain like there's certain

3359
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:15,118
fads

3360
02:04:15,279 --> 02:04:20,479
uh certainly in the in the um

3361
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,560
software engineering space

3362
02:04:20,479 --> 02:04:25,598
and it's interesting to think about

3363
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:28,159
technologies that sort of last

3364
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:31,599
for a very long time

3365
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:33,598
and just kind of being in the

3366
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:36,000
what is it how do they get by it's like

3367
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:36,000
the the

3368
02:04:36,319 --> 02:04:40,559
the cockroaches of software or yeah the

3369
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:42,559
bacteria are soft or something they like

3370
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:44,800
this base thing that nobody everybody's

3371
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:45,840
just became reliant on

3372
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:47,840
uh

3373
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:50,639
and they just outlast everything else

3374
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:52,560
and slowly slowly adjust with the times

3375
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:54,400
with a little bit of a delay with a

3376
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:56,639
little bit of customization by

3377
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:58,399
individuals kind of that

3378
02:04:56,639 --> 02:05:01,118
but they're always there in the shadows

3379
02:04:58,399 --> 02:05:02,799
yeah and they outlast everybody else

3380
02:05:01,118 --> 02:05:04,238
and i wonder if that's

3381
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:05,840
that might be the story for a lot of

3382
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:07,919
technologies especially in the software

3383
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:10,880
space yeah shell scripts you know all

3384
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:13,039
that stuff you you you can't run the

3385
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:15,039
modern world without

3386
02:05:13,039 --> 02:05:17,679
a bunch of shell scripts

3387
02:05:15,039 --> 02:05:20,399
you know booting out machines and

3388
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:22,560
and running things so um

3389
02:05:20,399 --> 02:05:24,158
it's

3390
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,440
that is going to be a hard thing to to

3391
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:27,279
replace

3392
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:29,039
and then tech for type setting that you

3393
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:30,880
use you said

3394
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:33,599
for when i when i want to print it out

3395
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:37,279
yeah i just have some simple uh

3396
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:39,119
macros that i use but then i have to um

3397
02:05:37,279 --> 02:05:41,519
the the publisher put their foot down

3398
02:05:39,118 --> 02:05:43,439
and they they want it in in word

3399
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,480
format now so

3400
02:05:43,439 --> 02:05:48,799
um

3401
02:05:44,479 --> 02:05:50,879
years ago i wrote some macros to convert

3402
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:52,079
and this time

3403
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:53,359
what did i do

3404
02:05:52,078 --> 02:05:57,359
copy paste

3405
02:05:53,359 --> 02:06:00,960
no i um i use of regular expressions so

3406
02:05:57,359 --> 02:06:02,639
i was to do italics in

3407
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:05,198
you know you you put it in curly

3408
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:06,719
brackets and you do backslash id

3409
02:06:05,198 --> 02:06:09,678
and then you type what you want to type

3410
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:10,560
and that's how you get italics in tech

3411
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:12,719
so

3412
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:15,840
you can create a regular expression

3413
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:17,840
that'll look for some text between curly

3414
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:20,319
brackets preceded by

3415
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:22,800
backslash i.t and then

3416
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:25,679
instead

3417
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:28,000
convert that to italics and word will do

3418
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:29,840
that

3419
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,158
word if you go deep enough into its

3420
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:34,560
search and replace

3421
02:06:32,158 --> 02:06:36,479
ui can do regular expressions is just

3422
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:38,719
reg apps

3423
02:06:36,479 --> 02:06:40,399
yeah it's funny that you did that yeah i

3424
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:42,719
mean i'm sure there's tools that help

3425
02:06:40,399 --> 02:06:45,439
you with that kind of thing but but the

3426
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:46,960
task is sufficiently

3427
02:06:45,439 --> 02:06:48,479
simple

3428
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:51,439
to where you can do a much better job

3429
02:06:48,479 --> 02:06:53,839
than anyone anybody else's tool can yeah

3430
02:06:51,439 --> 02:06:56,000
yeah so this is a fascinating process it

3431
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:57,520
works fine for me yeah

3432
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,880
and it keeps you from messing around

3433
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:00,079
with formatting

3434
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:02,560
yeah like

3435
02:07:00,078 --> 02:07:04,078
oh what if i put this chapter heading

3436
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:06,239
you know in

3437
02:07:04,078 --> 02:07:08,960
you know a sans-serif font you know it's

3438
02:07:06,238 --> 02:07:12,559
a it's just classic wanking

3439
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:14,800
um and so you the the

3440
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:16,159
those options are closed off in what i'm

3441
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:18,159
doing

3442
02:07:16,158 --> 02:07:20,799
is there advice you could say what does

3443
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:22,960
it take to write a great story

3444
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:24,880
the power of of good yarns good

3445
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:28,078
narratives to um

3446
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:30,239
pull people in is is an incredible and i

3447
02:07:28,078 --> 02:07:32,078
think my sort of

3448
02:07:30,238 --> 02:07:33,919
amateur theory is that it's an

3449
02:07:32,078 --> 02:07:35,599
evolutionary

3450
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:37,520
development that

3451
02:07:35,599 --> 02:07:38,480
if you're um

3452
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:40,000
you know

3453
02:07:38,479 --> 02:07:43,039
uh a

3454
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,880
cave person sitting around a fire

3455
02:07:43,039 --> 02:07:46,479
in the rift valley

3456
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:48,719
a million years ago

3457
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:48,718
um

3458
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:55,118
if you can tell the story

3459
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:56,000
of how you escaped from the hyenas

3460
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:56,799
um

3461
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,439
or

3462
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:00,400
how uncle bob you know didn't escape

3463
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:02,319
from the

3464
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:04,000
hyenas and if if the people listening to

3465
02:08:02,319 --> 02:08:06,078
you can take that in

3466
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,238
and they can build that

3467
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:10,880
scenario in their heads like a kind of

3468
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:12,559
virtual reality and see

3469
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:15,679
what you're describing

3470
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:17,599
then you've just conferred an incredibly

3471
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:21,118
important advantage on the people who've

3472
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:23,279
heard that story yeah right and so they

3473
02:08:21,118 --> 02:08:25,359
know a bunch of stuff now about how to

3474
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:26,559
stay alive that they could not have

3475
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:28,639
learned

3476
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,679
in any other way

3477
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:32,078
um

3478
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:34,078
i mean animals who don't have speech

3479
02:08:32,078 --> 02:08:36,799
though they might warn each other

3480
02:08:34,078 --> 02:08:37,920
they might make a sound that says danger

3481
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:39,679
danger

3482
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:40,560
um but uh

3483
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:42,719
but

3484
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:46,159
as far as we know they can't

3485
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:48,880
tell more complicated stories

3486
02:08:46,158 --> 02:08:50,479
so it's a part of us yeah

3487
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:51,920
the the the collective intelligence

3488
02:08:50,479 --> 02:08:54,638
seems to be one of the the key

3489
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:56,158
characteristics of the of homo sapiens

3490
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:58,319
the ability to

3491
02:08:56,158 --> 02:09:00,399
share ideas and hold ideas together in

3492
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:02,319
our minds and storytelling is the

3493
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:06,078
fundamental aspect of that maybe even

3494
02:09:02,319 --> 02:09:06,880
language itself is more fundamental yeah

3495
02:09:06,078 --> 02:09:08,479
because

3496
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:10,639
the language is required to do the

3497
02:09:08,479 --> 02:09:13,359
storytelling or maybe they evolve

3498
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:15,440
together maybe they co-evolve yeah

3499
02:09:13,359 --> 02:09:17,439
so i think that you've got to work with

3500
02:09:15,439 --> 02:09:21,118
that and i think

3501
02:09:17,439 --> 02:09:22,479
sometimes it seems like in kind of um

3502
02:09:21,118 --> 02:09:24,238
literary

3503
02:09:22,479 --> 02:09:26,559
circles that

3504
02:09:24,238 --> 02:09:28,959
having a lot of plot is a little bit

3505
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:31,119
frowned upon as it's pulpy or it's

3506
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:33,599
exploitative but

3507
02:09:31,118 --> 02:09:35,598
for me i don't have any

3508
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:37,920
compunctions whatsoever about that i

3509
02:09:35,599 --> 02:09:40,480
like stories that

3510
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:41,760
are grabby and fun and exciting to read

3511
02:09:40,479 --> 02:09:43,359
and

3512
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:45,679
once you've got one of those going once

3513
02:09:43,359 --> 02:09:47,198
you've got a good yarn going

3514
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:50,319
that people will enjoy reading then

3515
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:52,559
you're free to do whatever you want

3516
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:55,118
in the frame of that story but if you

3517
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:57,119
don't have that

3518
02:09:55,118 --> 02:09:59,039
then you got nothing

3519
02:09:57,118 --> 02:10:01,679
what about having like

3520
02:09:59,039 --> 02:10:04,238
would you do a technological scientific

3521
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:06,000
rigor like to the the accuracy and as

3522
02:10:04,238 --> 02:10:08,000
much as possible

3523
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:10,560
how does that add to the

3524
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,479
to to bob telling the story or telling

3525
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:16,079
the story about bob or on the campfire

3526
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:17,198
well the main thing that it does is

3527
02:10:16,078 --> 02:10:18,000
present

3528
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:20,559
um

3529
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,880
little details that you might not have

3530
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:24,960
come up with on your own

3531
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:27,599
so if you're just sitting there freely

3532
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:29,118
imagining things

3533
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:29,840
you uh

3534
02:10:29,118 --> 02:10:32,319
you

3535
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:34,800
your your brain probably isn't going to

3536
02:10:32,319 --> 02:10:38,000
serve up the wealth of details and the

3537
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:39,279
resulting complications and surprises

3538
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,520
that real

3539
02:10:39,279 --> 02:10:43,840
that the real world is constantly

3540
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:45,760
presenting us with and so

3541
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:47,279
um in my case

3542
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:49,119
if i'm um

3543
02:10:47,279 --> 02:10:51,679
trying to write a story about you know

3544
02:10:49,118 --> 02:10:52,719
some that involve some technology like a

3545
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:55,599
rocket

3546
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:58,560
or a orbital maneuvers or whatever then

3547
02:10:55,599 --> 02:11:01,920
delving into those details eventually is

3548
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:04,000
going to turn up some weird unexpected

3549
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:06,480
you know thing that

3550
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,599
gives me material to work with but also

3551
02:11:06,479 --> 02:11:11,359
subliminally readers who see that

3552
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:13,199
are are going to

3553
02:11:11,359 --> 02:11:15,679
be drawn in more

3554
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:17,198
because if they're going to

3555
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:19,760
to to find that

3556
02:11:17,198 --> 02:11:21,678
oh i didn't see that coming you know

3557
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:24,480
you know it's got some of the complexity

3558
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:26,960
and surprise value of the real world

3559
02:11:24,479 --> 02:11:29,759
yeah it does something um

3560
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:33,118
alex garland director who did who wrote

3561
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:35,599
directed ex machina

3562
02:11:33,118 --> 02:11:38,000
i think about ai movies

3563
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:40,560
and the more care you take in making it

3564
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,560
accurate

3565
02:11:41,039 --> 02:11:44,238
the more compelling the story becomes

3566
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:47,520
smile

3567
02:11:44,238 --> 02:11:49,919
i'm not i'm not sure what that is

3568
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:52,719
uh maybe because it becomes more real to

3569
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:54,480
the people writing the story maybe it

3570
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:56,560
just makes you a better writer

3571
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:57,359
the key to any storytelling is getting

3572
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:59,679
the

3573
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:01,598
the readers to suspend their

3574
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:04,239
their disbelief and there's all kinds of

3575
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:07,119
triggers and little tells that can break

3576
02:12:04,238 --> 02:12:09,118
that right um and once it's broken it's

3577
02:12:07,118 --> 02:12:11,439
really hard to get it back

3578
02:12:09,118 --> 02:12:13,279
uh yeah you know a lot of times that's

3579
02:12:11,439 --> 02:12:14,638
the end somebody will just close the

3580
02:12:13,279 --> 02:12:16,399
book and not

3581
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:17,840
pick it up

3582
02:12:16,399 --> 02:12:21,198
i get to ask you've answered this

3583
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:23,199
question but i got to ask you

3584
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:25,198
the most impossible question for an

3585
02:12:23,198 --> 02:12:27,598
author to answer but

3586
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:30,078
which neil stephenson book

3587
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:32,639
should one read first

3588
02:12:30,078 --> 02:12:34,399
so when people ask me that i usually ask

3589
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:35,599
them what they like to read

3590
02:12:34,399 --> 02:12:36,559
right because

3591
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:37,760
i mean

3592
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:39,520
there's

3593
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:41,760
the best known one is probably snow

3594
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:43,840
crash but that's a

3595
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:46,880
a cyberpunk novel that's at the same

3596
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:49,599
time making fun of cyberpunk

3597
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:50,719
so it's kind of got some layers to it

3598
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:52,159
that

3599
02:12:50,719 --> 02:12:54,800
might not

3600
02:12:52,158 --> 02:12:56,799
seem so funny if you don't have that if

3601
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:58,719
you don't get the joke right

3602
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:59,840
so

3603
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:01,198
there's

3604
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:02,400
i've written as you point out i've

3605
02:13:01,198 --> 02:13:04,559
written historical

3606
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:06,000
novels some people like those some

3607
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:08,719
people prefer

3608
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,198
those so if that's what you like then

3609
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:12,880
cryptonomicon or the baroque cycle

3610
02:13:11,198 --> 02:13:14,559
is where you would start

3611
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:17,520
if you like sort of techno thrillers

3612
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:20,560
that are set in a modern day setting but

3613
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:23,760
aren't science fictiony per se

3614
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:26,639
then uh reem d um

3615
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:29,440
is one of those and termination shock um

3616
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:30,960
is is definitely one of those

3617
02:13:29,439 --> 02:13:32,638
um

3618
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:34,319
so it just depends on

3619
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:36,800
on uh

3620
02:13:34,319 --> 02:13:39,279
what people like

3621
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:42,719
what uh when people a long time ago

3622
02:13:39,279 --> 02:13:44,399
recommend i read snow crash they said uh

3623
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:47,439
it's the

3624
02:13:44,399 --> 02:13:49,359
it's neil stevens in light

3625
02:13:47,439 --> 02:13:51,118
it's it's the uh

3626
02:13:49,359 --> 02:13:53,598
like if you don't want to be overwhelmed

3627
02:13:51,118 --> 02:13:55,439
by the depth like the rigor

3628
02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:57,520
book like that's a good that's a good

3629
02:13:55,439 --> 02:13:59,439
introduction okay

3630
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:01,679
so so essentially you broke it down by

3631
02:13:59,439 --> 02:14:04,799
topics but

3632
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:07,359
if you wanted to read all of them

3633
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:09,039
what's a good introduction to the to the

3634
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:10,960
man because obviously these worlds are

3635
02:14:09,039 --> 02:14:13,118
very different yeah the philosophies are

3636
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:15,679
very different yeah what's a good

3637
02:14:13,118 --> 02:14:16,639
introduction to the human

3638
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:18,399
um

3639
02:14:16,639 --> 02:14:20,560
hmm people ask the same thing with

3640
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:22,960
dostoyevsky people right

3641
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:24,880
it's a it's a hard one to answer

3642
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:27,198
maybe seven eaves

3643
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:29,920
because it's got big themes

3644
02:14:27,198 --> 02:14:32,238
um it's you know it's about heavy

3645
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:34,000
heavy things happening to the human race

3646
02:14:32,238 --> 02:14:36,158
um

3647
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,800
uh but hopefully the story is told

3648
02:14:36,158 --> 02:14:40,638
through a cast of characters that uh

3649
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:42,560
people can relate to

3650
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:43,840
you know it moves along

3651
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:47,360
uh

3652
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:48,239
so uh it does go kind of deep eventually

3653
02:14:47,359 --> 02:14:50,319
on

3654
02:14:48,238 --> 02:14:51,919
how rockets work and orbital mechanics

3655
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:53,599
and all that stuff but

3656
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:54,880
um

3657
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:56,400
people were able to get through it

3658
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:57,279
anyway or some people just skip over

3659
02:14:56,399 --> 02:14:58,559
that

3660
02:14:57,279 --> 02:15:00,078
it's fine

3661
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:00,880
you know

3662
02:15:00,078 --> 02:15:03,039
um

3663
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:06,078
as an author let me ask you

3664
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:08,560
what books had a big impact on your life

3665
02:15:06,078 --> 02:15:09,920
that you've read is there any that jump

3666
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:12,960
to mind

3667
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:15,199
that you learned from as a writer as a

3668
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:16,880
philosopher as a mathematician as an

3669
02:15:15,198 --> 02:15:18,399
engineer

3670
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:20,639
this is one of these questions where i

3671
02:15:18,399 --> 02:15:23,679
always blank out and then when i'm

3672
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:26,078
walking out the door oh i'll remember

3673
02:15:23,679 --> 02:15:29,440
12. so this is a random selection that

3674
02:15:26,078 --> 02:15:31,599
doesn't represent the top the top ones

3675
02:15:29,439 --> 02:15:33,439
um well i mentioned you know gulag

3676
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:36,000
archipelago that's

3677
02:15:33,439 --> 02:15:38,158
kind of a hefty and dark but and then it

3678
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,078
has a personal connection as well

3679
02:15:38,158 --> 02:15:42,158
yeah just yeah because like where you

3680
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:44,078
found the book too right the part the

3681
02:15:42,158 --> 02:15:46,078
time in your life where you found it

3682
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:48,000
yeah who recommended it that's also part

3683
02:15:46,078 --> 02:15:49,359
of the story yeah so there's definitely

3684
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,439
that there's

3685
02:15:49,359 --> 02:15:53,598
you know i circle back to moby dick a

3686
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:56,078
lot um

3687
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:57,520
because we read it in a uh

3688
02:15:56,078 --> 02:15:59,679
a really great

3689
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:02,079
english class i had in high school and i

3690
02:15:59,679 --> 02:16:04,319
came in with an oppositional

3691
02:16:02,078 --> 02:16:06,960
stance because i thought that the

3692
02:16:04,319 --> 02:16:09,439
teacher was going to try to talk me into

3693
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:11,920
having all kinds of highfalutin

3694
02:16:09,439 --> 02:16:14,000
ideas about allegory and what does this

3695
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:18,359
mean what's the symbolism

3696
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,359
and it turned out that uh

3697
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:22,079
it turned out to be a lot more

3698
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:24,639
interesting and satisfying than that

3699
02:16:22,078 --> 02:16:27,359
um what was the first powerful book you

3700
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:29,679
remember reading that like

3701
02:16:27,359 --> 02:16:33,119
convinced you that

3702
02:16:29,679 --> 02:16:35,040
this form could have depth

3703
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:37,359
was it moby dick was it like in high

3704
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:39,599
school i'm trying to remember well moby

3705
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:40,719
dick was definitely a big one

3706
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:43,920
um

3707
02:16:40,718 --> 02:16:45,438
i used to read a lot of classics comics

3708
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:46,719
when i was i don't know if you've seen

3709
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:47,920
these

3710
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:50,239
it's a whole

3711
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:52,079
series of comic books

3712
02:16:50,239 --> 02:16:54,079
that um

3713
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:55,760
it was viral you could uh

3714
02:16:54,079 --> 02:16:57,519
in the in the back of each comic book

3715
02:16:55,760 --> 02:17:00,559
was an order form

3716
02:16:57,519 --> 02:17:02,478
you could check some boxes and fill out

3717
02:17:00,558 --> 02:17:04,079
your address and mail it in

3718
02:17:02,478 --> 02:17:05,438
and more would show up

3719
02:17:04,079 --> 02:17:07,679
and but it was like

3720
02:17:05,439 --> 02:17:09,760
they would do the count of money christo

3721
02:17:07,679 --> 02:17:12,398
you know moby dick

3722
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:14,880
you know robert louis stevenson robinson

3723
02:17:12,398 --> 02:17:15,840
crusoe you know all the sort of classic

3724
02:17:14,879 --> 02:17:16,718
books

3725
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:20,000
uh

3726
02:17:16,718 --> 02:17:22,718
were they had put into comic book form

3727
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:24,318
it's amazing yeah reading moby dick if

3728
02:17:22,718 --> 02:17:26,000
you're nine years old

3729
02:17:24,318 --> 02:17:28,159
is a tall order

3730
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,159
there's some very complicated sentences

3731
02:17:28,159 --> 02:17:32,000
in there yeah

3732
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:33,760
and a lot of digressions but if you're

3733
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:38,000
just looking at the comic books like

3734
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:38,000
holy look at that whale you know

3735
02:17:38,079 --> 02:17:41,120
and um and ultimately the power of the

3736
02:17:40,079 --> 02:17:44,558
story

3737
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:46,880
doesn't need the complicated words

3738
02:17:44,558 --> 02:17:49,119
it's it's all about the man and the and

3739
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:51,438
the whale yeah yeah so you could get

3740
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:52,880
kind of a grounding in a lot of classic

3741
02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:54,639
works of literature without actually

3742
02:17:52,879 --> 02:17:57,438
reading them which is you know

3743
02:17:54,638 --> 02:18:00,079
it's great when you're nine years old

3744
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:02,719
so so i read a lot of that stuff

3745
02:18:00,079 --> 02:18:04,318
uh for sure the annotated sherlock

3746
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:06,558
holmes

3747
02:18:04,318 --> 02:18:06,558
um

3748
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:10,478
you you mentioned david deutsche as an

3749
02:18:08,718 --> 02:18:12,398
inspiration for some of your work i mean

3750
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:14,478
you you've obviously didn't like really

3751
02:18:12,398 --> 02:18:15,199
a lot of research for the books you you

3752
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:17,599
do

3753
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:19,679
roger apparent rose

3754
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:21,840
what uh do you remember a book that made

3755
02:18:19,679 --> 02:18:25,120
you want to become a writer

3756
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:27,519
or a moment that made you become i think

3757
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:29,359
like the

3758
02:18:27,519 --> 02:18:33,200
you know the answer i usually give is

3759
02:18:29,359 --> 02:18:33,200
that when i was in like fifth grade

3760
02:18:33,439 --> 02:18:38,079
one of my friends came to

3761
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:40,000
school one day is wearing leather shoes

3762
02:18:38,079 --> 02:18:41,039
like dress shoes

3763
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,920
and

3764
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:45,840
i hated dress shoes because mine never

3765
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:47,200
fit and so they were uncomfortable i

3766
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:48,799
couldn't run

3767
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:50,240
you know they were cold

3768
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:51,279
it was iowa

3769
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:53,840
so

3770
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:55,840
i kind of said

3771
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:58,000
i remember very clearly thinking okay i

3772
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:59,040
don't like where this is going

3773
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:01,519
like

3774
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:03,679
does this mean that

3775
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:06,159
next year

3776
02:19:03,679 --> 02:19:08,478
all the kids are going to be wearing

3777
02:19:06,159 --> 02:19:10,239
leather shoes

3778
02:19:08,478 --> 02:19:12,398
so i need to find a job where i don't

3779
02:19:10,239 --> 02:19:14,718
have to do that

3780
02:19:12,398 --> 02:19:15,920
so that was like the first time i

3781
02:19:14,718 --> 02:19:17,919
thought about

3782
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:19,840
trying to find such a job you know being

3783
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:21,840
a writer and then

3784
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:23,840
and then i just read a lot of uh

3785
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:26,318
just classic science fiction short

3786
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:28,079
stories and started you know trying to

3787
02:19:26,318 --> 02:19:29,679
write some of my own

3788
02:19:28,079 --> 02:19:30,718
and uh there were just classic young

3789
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:34,000
adult

3790
02:19:30,718 --> 02:19:35,518
stories learned by heinlein and

3791
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,519
the other

3792
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:39,840
classic names that you think of but the

3793
02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:41,840
heinlein ones stuck have stuck with me

3794
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:43,200
in a way that the others didn't

3795
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:45,920
what's the greatest

3796
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:46,880
science fiction book ever written

3797
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:48,558
just

3798
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:52,239
removing your

3799
02:19:48,558 --> 02:19:54,318
uh work from consideration

3800
02:19:52,239 --> 02:19:57,079
uh

3801
02:19:54,318 --> 02:20:00,398
i'm loving torturing you greatest ever

3802
02:19:57,079 --> 02:20:02,559
non-stevenson do we include fantasy

3803
02:20:00,398 --> 02:20:06,799
there's to have to be science fiction

3804
02:20:02,559 --> 02:20:06,799
oh interesting fantasy hmm

3805
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:12,398
i i did not expect that twist uh well in

3806
02:20:10,879 --> 02:20:15,199
a weird way they're lumped together in

3807
02:20:12,398 --> 02:20:17,119
people's minds right so they are but it

3808
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:19,439
there but there's also a boundary

3809
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:21,590
somehow yeah i'm not sure what that is

3810
02:20:19,439 --> 02:20:23,120
exactly nobody is it's a mystery

3811
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:25,040
[Laughter]

3812
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:27,280
so i mean if we do include it then it's

3813
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:28,640
easily the the lord of the rings

3814
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:31,840
but um

3815
02:20:28,639 --> 02:20:34,719
i mean greatness is a interesting

3816
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:36,559
quality to uh to try to define

3817
02:20:34,719 --> 02:20:37,438
um

3818
02:20:36,559 --> 02:20:40,159
and

3819
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:41,359
for me a lot of the the fun and the joy

3820
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:43,439
of

3821
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:46,640
such books is is not in what you'd call

3822
02:20:43,439 --> 02:20:49,600
greatness but just storytelling

3823
02:20:46,639 --> 02:20:51,519
so i was always a big fan of has have

3824
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:53,760
space suit will travel

3825
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:56,319
which is a heinlein young adult book

3826
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:58,159
it's just uh it's just a fun good read

3827
02:20:56,318 --> 02:21:00,719
um

3828
02:20:58,159 --> 02:21:02,959
so so fun is a big component

3829
02:21:00,719 --> 02:21:05,279
greatness is overrated well i don't know

3830
02:21:02,959 --> 02:21:08,079
it's overrated but it's just

3831
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:09,920
you know it's it might be under defined

3832
02:21:08,079 --> 02:21:12,159
let's put it that way

3833
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:13,920
so how space it will travel now i

3834
02:21:12,159 --> 02:21:15,520
definitely have to read that one yeah

3835
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:16,960
you mentioned iowa

3836
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:19,520
i was uh

3837
02:21:16,959 --> 02:21:21,839
there a couple times i got to spend uh

3838
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:24,399
quite a bit of time with dan gable with

3839
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:26,719
tom brands who were wrestlers

3840
02:21:24,398 --> 02:21:28,239
was uh

3841
02:21:26,719 --> 02:21:30,799
is it now

3842
02:21:28,239 --> 02:21:33,280
wrestling martial arts part of your life

3843
02:21:30,799 --> 02:21:35,279
any part of your form formation of who

3844
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:38,319
you are as a human being

3845
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:40,399
i think so in a it was a late it was a

3846
02:21:38,318 --> 02:21:43,439
late thing for me but

3847
02:21:40,398 --> 02:21:43,439
growing up in ames

3848
02:21:44,159 --> 02:21:48,000
dan gable was

3849
02:21:46,239 --> 02:21:49,680
a few years older than me and so

3850
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,000
sometimes we would go

3851
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:53,040
to the arena at the university and watch

3852
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:55,760
wrestling

3853
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:58,720
meets and

3854
02:21:55,760 --> 02:22:01,359
and this was before his olympic career

3855
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:02,318
so everyone knew he was the star of that

3856
02:22:01,359 --> 02:22:04,159
team

3857
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:06,079
and then he was the best but people

3858
02:22:04,159 --> 02:22:08,879
didn't yet know that he was the greatest

3859
02:22:06,079 --> 02:22:12,079
of all time g you saw gabe so that was

3860
02:22:08,879 --> 02:22:14,159
part it's it's funny it's uh it feels

3861
02:22:12,079 --> 02:22:17,039
like a small world that you would

3862
02:22:14,159 --> 02:22:19,119
be in the same space as dan gable well a

3863
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:22,319
hundred feet away a little dot on the

3864
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:25,120
mat pronouncing his opponents him and

3865
02:22:22,318 --> 02:22:28,159
him and chris taylor so the other star

3866
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:29,359
was this 400 pound plus guy named chris

3867
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:30,159
taylor

3868
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:32,079
who

3869
02:22:30,159 --> 02:22:34,000
also went to the olympics

3870
02:22:32,079 --> 02:22:36,559
so yeah people

3871
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:38,398
you know he was he was a no he was a

3872
02:22:36,559 --> 02:22:41,039
athletic hero and

3873
02:22:38,398 --> 02:22:43,279
wrestling is

3874
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:45,520
there's certain states like oklahoma

3875
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:46,800
pennsylvania iowa where wrestling is the

3876
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:48,960
sport

3877
02:22:46,799 --> 02:22:50,799
because those are states of small towns

3878
02:22:48,959 --> 02:22:53,679
and so if you're a small town if you're

3879
02:22:50,799 --> 02:22:53,679
like dan gable

3880
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,439
and you have to be on a football team

3881
02:22:56,398 --> 02:23:00,318
with

3882
02:22:57,439 --> 02:23:02,398
20 other guys who are not dan gable then

3883
02:23:00,318 --> 02:23:04,959
no matter how good you are

3884
02:23:02,398 --> 02:23:06,318
your team might might suck

3885
02:23:04,959 --> 02:23:07,679
uh but if

3886
02:23:06,318 --> 02:23:09,519
in a solo

3887
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:11,680
thing you can

3888
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:14,159
you can go to the olympics

3889
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:16,239
so we did a lot of wrestling in our gym

3890
02:23:14,159 --> 02:23:18,079
classes in school and i didn't like it

3891
02:23:16,239 --> 02:23:19,680
and i think partly it's just that it was

3892
02:23:18,079 --> 02:23:21,840
so

3893
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:24,000
so competitive and the people who were

3894
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:26,478
who cared about it

3895
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:29,120
really cared about it a lot you know and

3896
02:23:26,478 --> 02:23:31,039
so it was it was pretty tough

3897
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:33,840
i didn't think i had the right body type

3898
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:36,399
but then when i was uh after college i

3899
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:38,079
was in iowa city for a few years when he

3900
02:23:36,398 --> 02:23:40,959
was coaching the

3901
02:23:38,079 --> 02:23:42,719
the wrestling team there and he won like

3902
02:23:40,959 --> 02:23:45,358
nine

3903
02:23:42,719 --> 02:23:48,000
championships out of 10 years

3904
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:50,000
during that during that time so he was

3905
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:52,398
both the greatest individual wrestler of

3906
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:54,000
all time and like the greatest

3907
02:23:52,398 --> 02:23:54,879
team coach

3908
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,719
um

3909
02:23:54,879 --> 02:24:00,079
so i've never met him

3910
02:23:56,719 --> 02:24:02,159
but we've

3911
02:24:00,079 --> 02:24:03,840
uh he's kind of been like in my sphere

3912
02:24:02,159 --> 02:24:05,439
of awareness since i was you know kind

3913
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:08,398
of my whole life and people would always

3914
02:24:05,439 --> 02:24:10,398
tell stories about him like

3915
02:24:08,398 --> 02:24:12,478
i think he got arrested once for some

3916
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:13,439
kind of

3917
02:24:12,478 --> 02:24:16,079
i don't know

3918
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:17,760
minor offense in ames and so he just

3919
02:24:16,079 --> 02:24:20,000
basically stayed up all night he was in

3920
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:22,159
this cage in the

3921
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:24,239
jail he just stayed up all night doing

3922
02:24:22,159 --> 02:24:24,959
pull-ups yeah yeah sounds about right

3923
02:24:24,239 --> 02:24:26,840
yeah

3924
02:24:24,959 --> 02:24:28,719
and uh

3925
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:29,920
uh

3926
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:31,760
so yeah

3927
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:33,760
so has that been

3928
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:35,680
i mean i was such an interesting place

3929
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:38,719
in the world i mean wrestling is just

3930
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:38,720
part of that story

3931
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:44,719
does is that somewhere in there does

3932
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:47,120
that resonate deeply with who you are

3933
02:24:44,719 --> 02:24:50,559
it was a formative yeah thing for me

3934
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:52,319
growing up there for sure it's just a uh

3935
02:24:50,559 --> 02:24:56,079
you know a

3936
02:24:52,318 --> 02:24:58,318
at least used to be a very orderly place

3937
02:24:56,079 --> 02:25:02,000
high social capital

3938
02:24:58,318 --> 02:25:04,079
very minimal class differences

3939
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:06,879
so like you'd have some people who would

3940
02:25:04,079 --> 02:25:08,398
drive a cadillac instead of a chevy

3941
02:25:06,879 --> 02:25:10,079
but

3942
02:25:08,398 --> 02:25:12,239
that was it that you know those were the

3943
02:25:10,079 --> 02:25:15,039
rich people right so

3944
02:25:12,239 --> 02:25:17,760
um and a college town is always a

3945
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:19,920
different environment like uh

3946
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:21,680
you know austin

3947
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:23,200
uh has some of this

3948
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:26,159
um

3949
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:27,840
so as a pretty kind of utopian

3950
02:25:26,159 --> 02:25:28,879
other than the weather and a few other

3951
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:31,840
things

3952
02:25:28,879 --> 02:25:33,839
uh environment to grow up in

3953
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:36,000
the the martial art i ended up doing is

3954
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:38,398
sword stuff which is

3955
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:40,559
interesting because it uses a different

3956
02:25:38,398 --> 02:25:43,039
feedback loop so when you're if you're

3957
02:25:40,559 --> 02:25:43,039
grappling

3958
02:25:43,359 --> 02:25:49,120
everything is through sense of touch

3959
02:25:46,079 --> 02:25:52,398
and your sense of touch is very old

3960
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:54,720
and simple right like earthworms

3961
02:25:52,398 --> 02:25:56,318
don't have don't even have eyes but you

3962
02:25:54,719 --> 02:25:57,519
they can tell when they're being touched

3963
02:25:56,318 --> 02:25:59,519
right so

3964
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:00,800
it's very fast

3965
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:02,399
um

3966
02:26:00,799 --> 02:26:04,318
and uh

3967
02:26:02,398 --> 02:26:07,439
with um

3968
02:26:04,318 --> 02:26:10,079
with a standoff or like boxing or some

3969
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:11,439
kind of sword fighting you're

3970
02:26:10,079 --> 02:26:13,280
you're not touching the other person

3971
02:26:11,439 --> 02:26:15,680
most of the time your

3972
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:19,439
your uh your visual system is doing

3973
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:21,040
something way more it's doing slam

3974
02:26:19,439 --> 02:26:23,120
and trying to figure out what the other

3975
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:25,120
person is up to

3976
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:28,079
and so

3977
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:29,280
that always fell more my speed

3978
02:26:28,079 --> 02:26:31,920
so in

3979
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:32,880
in olympic style fencing

3980
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:35,600
your

3981
02:26:32,879 --> 02:26:37,519
it doesn't start really until you're

3982
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:39,680
crossing blades with the other person

3983
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:40,880
and now you're back to wrestling you're

3984
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:42,800
feeling

3985
02:26:40,879 --> 02:26:44,318
what they're doing and it's all about

3986
02:26:42,799 --> 02:26:47,199
that but

3987
02:26:44,318 --> 02:26:50,000
some of the older sword arts um

3988
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:52,640
don't engage the the blade that way you

3989
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,520
stand off their range and then you make

3990
02:26:52,639 --> 02:26:54,959
cutting

3991
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:55,670
attacks

3992
02:26:54,959 --> 02:26:56,959
and um

3993
02:26:55,670 --> 02:26:57,760
[Music]

3994
02:26:56,959 --> 02:27:00,959
and

3995
02:26:57,760 --> 02:27:02,719
uh and so so those are all processed

3996
02:27:00,959 --> 02:27:04,959
visually and

3997
02:27:02,719 --> 02:27:06,079
i think i'm more of a slow

3998
02:27:04,959 --> 02:27:07,839
thinker

3999
02:27:06,079 --> 02:27:10,478
so it works for me

4000
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:11,280
better i mean the same so it has the

4001
02:27:10,478 --> 02:27:13,039
same

4002
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:14,800
the artistry and the beauty of boxing i

4003
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:16,720
suppose just like you said

4004
02:27:14,799 --> 02:27:18,879
is like there's no there's no contact

4005
02:27:16,719 --> 02:27:21,679
and it's all processed visually and i'm

4006
02:27:18,879 --> 02:27:23,438
sure there's a dance of its own yeah

4007
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:25,840
that that depends on the characteristic

4008
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:29,200
of a sword involved yeah there's a set

4009
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:31,600
of of stances and and uh basic reactions

4010
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:33,120
that you try to learn that are thought

4011
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:37,040
to be

4012
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:37,840
defensible um and and safe or safer

4013
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:39,520
and

4014
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:41,439
so it tends to be a series of short

4015
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:42,960
engagements where you'll

4016
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:45,920
you'll close in

4017
02:27:42,959 --> 02:27:47,839
you'll try out your your idea

4018
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:50,719
and it works or it doesn't then you you

4019
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:51,920
back off again

4020
02:27:50,719 --> 02:27:54,799
it's interesting to think about like

4021
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:56,079
human history because martial arts

4022
02:27:54,799 --> 02:27:58,799
okay

4023
02:27:56,079 --> 02:28:00,239
that's a thing but in terms of sword

4024
02:27:58,799 --> 02:28:03,039
fighting

4025
02:28:00,239 --> 02:28:06,079
just the full

4026
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:08,560
range of humans that existed who

4027
02:28:06,079 --> 02:28:11,200
mastered sword fighting or sought the

4028
02:28:08,559 --> 02:28:13,359
masteries were fighting just imagine the

4029
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:15,600
thousands of people who the the heights

4030
02:28:13,359 --> 02:28:18,318
they have achieved because the stakes

4031
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:21,359
are so incredibly high yeah

4032
02:28:18,318 --> 02:28:24,318
to be good and it's the richest most

4033
02:28:21,359 --> 02:28:27,120
powerful people in in those societies

4034
02:28:24,318 --> 02:28:29,920
spending it whatever it takes

4035
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:31,040
to get the best gear and the best

4036
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:32,879
training

4037
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:34,960
because you're right everything depends

4038
02:28:32,879 --> 02:28:38,318
on it and it's still life and death i

4039
02:28:34,959 --> 02:28:39,358
mean that that's fascinating um

4040
02:28:38,318 --> 02:28:42,799
that

4041
02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:44,960
that's fascinating we perhaps

4042
02:28:42,799 --> 02:28:46,079
have lost that forever with greater

4043
02:28:44,959 --> 02:28:48,639
weapons

4044
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:50,318
i mean the artistry of sword fighting

4045
02:28:48,639 --> 02:28:52,079
when it's life and death

4046
02:28:50,318 --> 02:28:53,920
and you go into war

4047
02:28:52,079 --> 02:28:56,079
you have the miyamoto musashi's of the

4048
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:57,120
world right the

4049
02:28:56,079 --> 02:29:00,478
i don't know

4050
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:02,160
there's a poetry to it that that

4051
02:29:00,478 --> 02:29:03,519
there's a mastery to that that i don't

4052
02:29:02,159 --> 02:29:05,359
know if we could achieve with any other

4053
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:07,600
kind of martial art

4054
02:29:05,359 --> 02:29:09,680
well the one of the good

4055
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:12,399
you were talking earlier about

4056
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:15,359
the the the good effects of the internet

4057
02:29:12,398 --> 02:29:16,159
social media that we sometimes overlook

4058
02:29:15,359 --> 02:29:18,559
and

4059
02:29:16,159 --> 02:29:20,318
and one of those is that um there were

4060
02:29:18,559 --> 02:29:22,000
all these isolated people around the

4061
02:29:20,318 --> 02:29:23,519
world who were interested in this who

4062
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:25,120
found each other

4063
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:27,760
and kind of created

4064
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:29,680
a network of of people who help each

4065
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:32,000
other learn these things so that doesn't

4066
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:34,639
mean that anyone is is up to the level

4067
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:39,439
of that you're talking about yet

4068
02:29:34,639 --> 02:29:41,760
but um but it is happening and um

4069
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:44,880
and so um there's a

4070
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:45,920
a a large number of old treatises old

4071
02:29:44,879 --> 02:29:48,398
written

4072
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:50,639
documents uh that have been dug up from

4073
02:29:48,398 --> 02:29:53,680
libraries and and people have been going

4074
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:57,039
over these and translating them from old

4075
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:59,680
dialects of italian in german

4076
02:29:57,040 --> 02:30:01,920
to make sense of them and and learning

4077
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:04,559
how to do these techniques

4078
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:06,318
with different uh different weapons

4079
02:30:04,559 --> 02:30:08,959
um

4080
02:30:06,318 --> 02:30:11,359
actually there's a guy here in austin

4081
02:30:08,959 --> 02:30:14,639
named damon stith who does african

4082
02:30:11,359 --> 02:30:15,600
historical african martial arts um

4083
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:17,519
also

4084
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:19,020
martial arts of uh

4085
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:20,640
of enslaved africans who

4086
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:23,200
[Music]

4087
02:30:20,639 --> 02:30:26,159
would learn machete fighting techniques

4088
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:28,000
in the caribbean south america yeah he's

4089
02:30:26,159 --> 02:30:30,159
probably within a mile of us he's

4090
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:31,680
awesome amazing guy i'm gonna look him

4091
02:30:30,159 --> 02:30:34,000

02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:36,079
can i ask you for advice

4093
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:37,760
can you give advice for young people

4094
02:30:36,079 --> 02:30:39,200
high school

4095
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:41,600
college

4096
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:43,280
you know undergrads

4097
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:45,200
thinking about

4098
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:48,319
their career thinking about life how to

4099
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:50,399
live a life that you'd be proud of

4100
02:30:48,318 --> 02:30:52,478
you think quite a bit about like what

4101
02:30:50,398 --> 02:30:54,398
it's required to be innovative in this

4102
02:30:52,478 --> 02:30:56,799
world you think quite a bit about the

4103
02:30:54,398 --> 02:30:58,719
future so somebody wanted to be

4104
02:30:56,799 --> 02:31:02,719
a person that makes a big impact in the

4105
02:30:58,719 --> 02:31:05,119
future what advice would you give them

4106
02:31:02,719 --> 02:31:09,279
i think a big part of it is

4107
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:09,280
finding the thing that you will do

4108
02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:13,840
happily and

4109
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:16,079
i don't want to say obsessively because

4110
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:16,880
that sounds like maybe it's pathological

4111
02:31:16,079 --> 02:31:19,439
but

4112
02:31:16,879 --> 02:31:21,039
but if you can find a thing that you'll

4113
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:22,479
you know you'll sit down you'll start

4114
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:24,880
doing it and

4115
02:31:22,478 --> 02:31:26,879
hours later you kind of snap out of it

4116
02:31:24,879 --> 02:31:29,920
where did the time go

4117
02:31:26,879 --> 02:31:31,679
um then

4118
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:33,439
that's a really key

4119
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:35,520
discovery for

4120
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:37,040
anyone to make about themselves when

4121
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:40,000
they're young

4122
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:41,280
because if you don't have that

4123
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:43,120
it's hard to

4124
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:44,319
to figure out where you should put your

4125
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:45,359
energies

4126
02:31:44,318 --> 02:31:46,799
you know

4127
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:48,559
and as you might have the best

4128
02:31:46,799 --> 02:31:49,599
intentions you might say i you know i

4129
02:31:48,559 --> 02:31:51,840
want

4130
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:54,239
world peace or whatever

4131
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:55,120
uh but um

4132
02:31:54,239 --> 02:31:56,398
uh

4133
02:31:55,120 --> 02:31:59,520
at the end of the day what really

4134
02:31:56,398 --> 02:32:01,840
matters is how do you spend your time

4135
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:03,680
and are you spending it in a way that's

4136
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:05,359
productive uh

4137
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:06,559
and um

4138
02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:08,800
uh

4139
02:32:06,559 --> 02:32:11,119
because it doesn't matter how smart you

4140
02:32:08,799 --> 02:32:12,000
are or well-intentioned you are unless

4141
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:13,359
you've

4142
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:15,359
figured that out

4143
02:32:13,359 --> 02:32:17,680
and so finding that thing in which you

4144
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:18,559
can sort of you naturally lose yourself

4145
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:21,040
in

4146
02:32:18,559 --> 02:32:21,039
the thing is

4147
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:25,520
at least for me

4148
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:28,239
there's a lot of things like that but i

4149
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:30,880
first have to overcome the initial hump

4150
02:32:28,239 --> 02:32:33,680
of really sucking at that thing

4151
02:32:30,879 --> 02:32:35,519
like the fun starts a little bit

4152
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:37,920
after the first hump of really sucking

4153
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:39,040
and then you could suck just regularly

4154
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:41,280
yeah

4155
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:43,359
so often people oftentimes people can

4156
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:45,760
give up too early i think i mean that's

4157
02:32:43,359 --> 02:32:47,359
true with mathematics for me it's

4158
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:48,800
for a lot of people

4159
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:49,920
is if you just give it a chance to

4160
02:32:48,799 --> 02:32:51,920
struggle

4161
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:54,079
if you give yourself time to struggle

4162
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:56,398
you'll find a way

4163
02:32:54,079 --> 02:32:58,879
you'll find the thing within that thing

4164
02:32:56,398 --> 02:33:00,398
that you can lose track of time with

4165
02:32:58,879 --> 02:33:03,119
yeah that's a key

4166
02:33:00,398 --> 02:33:05,119
detail that um

4167
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:07,120
there's an important thing to add to to

4168
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:09,359
what i said which is that

4169
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:10,640
this might not happen the first time you

4170
02:33:09,359 --> 02:33:12,880
do a thing

4171
02:33:10,639 --> 02:33:15,439
maybe it will but um

4172
02:33:12,879 --> 02:33:17,279
uh you might have to climb that learning

4173
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:19,120
curve and um

4174
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:22,159
if there's pressures in your life that

4175
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:23,359
are making you feel bad about that

4176
02:33:22,159 --> 02:33:25,119
then

4177
02:33:23,359 --> 02:33:26,079
it might prevent you

4178
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:29,760
from

4179
02:33:26,079 --> 02:33:29,760
from getting where you need to be

4180
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:34,398
so there's some complexity there

4181
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:36,640
that may can make this kind of

4182
02:33:34,398 --> 02:33:38,639
non-obvious

4183
02:33:36,639 --> 02:33:40,079
but uh that's what

4184
02:33:38,639 --> 02:33:42,239
that's why we

4185
02:33:40,079 --> 02:33:43,760
need you know good teachers

4186
02:33:42,239 --> 02:33:45,600
um

4187
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:47,280
you know another

4188
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:49,280
beneficial thing

4189
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:52,079
of the internet is youtube and being

4190
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:53,200
able to learn things how to do things on

4191
02:33:52,079 --> 02:33:54,639
youtube

4192
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:56,319
the the

4193
02:33:54,639 --> 02:33:58,398
the dude who made the youtube video

4194
02:33:56,318 --> 02:34:00,478
doesn't care how many times you

4195
02:33:58,398 --> 02:34:02,159
hit pause and rewind

4196
02:34:00,478 --> 02:34:03,920
um

4197
02:34:02,159 --> 02:34:04,879
they're never gonna like roll their eyes

4198
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:07,280
and

4199
02:34:04,879 --> 02:34:08,398
and be impatient with you

4200
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:11,840
um

4201
02:34:08,398 --> 02:34:14,159
and sometimes uh spending

4202
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:16,799
a huge amount of time on one video or

4203
02:34:14,159 --> 02:34:18,318
one book like making that

4204
02:34:16,799 --> 02:34:20,478
the thing you just spent a huge amount

4205
02:34:18,318 --> 02:34:22,398
of time on rereading re-reading or

4206
02:34:20,478 --> 02:34:23,920
re-watching re-watching

4207
02:34:22,398 --> 02:34:25,358
that

4208
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:26,960
that somehow

4209
02:34:25,359 --> 02:34:29,680
really um

4210
02:34:26,959 --> 02:34:31,679
solidifies your love for that thing

4211
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:33,600
and like the depth of understanding you

4212
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:35,520
start to gain and it's okay to stay with

4213
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:37,439
that i used to think like there's all

4214
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:39,760
these books out there

4215
02:34:37,439 --> 02:34:42,880
so like i need to keep reading or keep

4216
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:46,398
reading but then i i realized um

4217
02:34:42,879 --> 02:34:46,398
i think it was somewhere in college uh

4218
02:34:46,879 --> 02:34:50,639
where you could just spend your whole

4219
02:34:48,719 --> 02:34:52,719
life with a single textbook

4220
02:34:50,639 --> 02:34:55,119
there's enough in that textbook

4221
02:34:52,719 --> 02:34:57,760
yeah to really really stay

4222
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:59,840
measner thorne and wheeler gravitation

4223
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:02,398
you know is one of those or another one

4224
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:04,719
is um the road to reality by roger

4225
02:35:02,398 --> 02:35:07,039
penrose which is just

4226
02:35:04,719 --> 02:35:09,599
incredibly deep it starts with like two

4227
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:11,840
plus two equals four and it at the end

4228
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:13,359
you're at the boundaries of

4229
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:15,520
of physics

4230
02:35:13,359 --> 02:35:17,359
uh it's an amazing

4231
02:35:15,520 --> 02:35:18,960
amazing book

4232
02:35:17,359 --> 02:35:21,280
let me ask you the big ridiculous

4233
02:35:18,959 --> 02:35:23,519
question okay since you've

4234
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:24,960
pondered some big ridiculous questions

4235
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:27,120
in your work

4236
02:35:24,959 --> 02:35:29,358
what's the meaning of this whole thing

4237
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:31,200
what's the meaning of life wow human

4238
02:35:29,359 --> 02:35:32,479
life

4239
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:34,880
well

4240
02:35:32,478 --> 02:35:37,519
as far as i know

4241
02:35:34,879 --> 02:35:39,920
we're unique in the the universe there's

4242
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:41,920
no evidence that there's anything else

4243
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:43,760
in the universe that's as complicated as

4244
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:47,920
what's between our ears

4245
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:49,120
might be you can't rule it out but

4246
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:53,040
um

4247
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:54,800
so we appear to be pretty special and um

4248
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:56,240
so it's got to have something to do with

4249
02:35:54,799 --> 02:35:57,759
that and

4250
02:35:56,239 --> 02:35:59,280
one of the reasons i like

4251
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:01,040
david deutsch

4252
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:02,159
in particular his book the beginning of

4253
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:03,200
infinity

4254
02:36:02,159 --> 02:36:04,719
um

4255
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:06,319
is that he talks about the power of

4256
02:36:04,719 --> 02:36:09,840
explanations

4257
02:36:06,318 --> 02:36:12,559
and the fact that um most

4258
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:15,040
civilizations are static that they've

4259
02:36:12,559 --> 02:36:16,959
got a set of dogmas that they

4260
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:20,479
arrive at somehow

4261
02:36:16,959 --> 02:36:23,119
and they just pass those on from one

4262
02:36:20,478 --> 02:36:24,239
uh generation to the next and nothing

4263
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:25,520
changes

4264
02:36:24,239 --> 02:36:27,760
but that

4265
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:29,840
huge changes have happened

4266
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:31,840
when people sort of

4267
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:34,840
follow and whatever you want to call it

4268
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:37,520
the scientific method or enlightenment

4269
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:40,478
uh there's different ways of thinking

4270
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:42,720
about it but basically explanatory

4271
02:36:40,478 --> 02:36:44,398
it's it's about the power of of

4272
02:36:42,719 --> 02:36:46,478
explanations

4273
02:36:44,398 --> 02:36:48,079
and being able to figure out why things

4274
02:36:46,478 --> 02:36:52,159
are the way they are

4275
02:36:48,079 --> 02:36:54,239
and that has created changes in our um

4276
02:36:52,159 --> 02:36:56,959
thinking in our way of life over the

4277
02:36:54,239 --> 02:36:58,159
last few centuries that are

4278
02:36:56,959 --> 02:37:00,318
explosive

4279
02:36:58,159 --> 02:37:04,719
compared to anything that came before

4280
02:37:00,318 --> 02:37:07,039
and david sort of verges on classifying

4281
02:37:04,719 --> 02:37:10,559
this as like a force of nature

4282
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:12,399
in its potential transformative power

4283
02:37:10,559 --> 02:37:13,600
if we keep going

4284
02:37:12,398 --> 02:37:15,519
um

4285
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:17,120
you know we could uh

4286
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:19,359
you know if we figure out how to

4287
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:21,680
colonize the universe

4288
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:24,800
like you were talking about earlier

4289
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:26,318
how this spread to other star systems

4290
02:37:24,799 --> 02:37:29,279
then it is

4291
02:37:26,318 --> 02:37:31,680
effectively a force of nature

4292
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:33,200
this kind of drive to understand more

4293
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:34,398
and more and more deeper and deeper and

4294
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:36,240
deeper

4295
02:37:34,398 --> 02:37:38,398
and to engineer stuff so that we can

4296
02:37:36,239 --> 02:37:41,439
understand even more yeah

4297
02:37:38,398 --> 02:37:43,599
yeah it's the the well it's the old the

4298
02:37:41,439 --> 02:37:45,200
universe created us to understand itself

4299
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:47,439
maybe that's the uh

4300
02:37:45,200 --> 02:37:49,200
the whole purpose

4301
02:37:47,439 --> 02:37:51,359
yeah

4302
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:52,640
it's it is an interesting peculiar side

4303
02:37:51,359 --> 02:37:54,640
effect

4304
02:37:52,639 --> 02:37:56,478
of the way we've been created is we seem

4305
02:37:54,639 --> 02:37:59,199
to be conscious beings we seem to have

4306
02:37:56,478 --> 02:38:01,760
little egos we seem to

4307
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:04,079
be born and die pretty quickly

4308
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:05,600
there's a bunch of drama we're all

4309
02:38:04,079 --> 02:38:08,239
within ourselves

4310
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:10,960
pretty unique and we fall in love and

4311
02:38:08,239 --> 02:38:12,719
start wars and there's hate and all the

4312
02:38:10,959 --> 02:38:14,478
the full interesting dynamic of it so

4313
02:38:12,719 --> 02:38:15,679
it's not just about the individual

4314
02:38:14,478 --> 02:38:17,760
people

4315
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:20,239
yeah somehow like the concert that we

4316
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:21,040
played together

4317
02:38:20,239 --> 02:38:22,719
yeah

4318
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:24,479
yeah so

4319
02:38:22,719 --> 02:38:26,959
that's kind of interesting there's a lot

4320
02:38:24,478 --> 02:38:28,398
of peculiar aspects of that that i

4321
02:38:26,959 --> 02:38:30,559
wonder if they're fundamental or just

4322
02:38:28,398 --> 02:38:32,478
quirks of evolution

4323
02:38:30,559 --> 02:38:35,199
whether it's whether it's death whether

4324
02:38:32,478 --> 02:38:38,000
it's love whether all those things

4325
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:39,760
i wonder if they're um

4326
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,200
from an engineering perspective when

4327
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:43,600
we're trying to create that intelligent

4328
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:46,720
toaster that listens for the

4329
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:50,800
for the slam door

4330
02:38:46,719 --> 02:38:50,799
and this and the smell of burning toast

4331
02:38:50,879 --> 02:38:53,920
whether

4332
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:55,840
that toaster it should be afraid of

4333
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:58,239
death and should fall in love just like

4334
02:38:55,840 --> 02:38:58,239
we do

4335
02:38:58,478 --> 02:39:01,199

snow crash

4351
02:39:32,079 --> 02:39:35,600
