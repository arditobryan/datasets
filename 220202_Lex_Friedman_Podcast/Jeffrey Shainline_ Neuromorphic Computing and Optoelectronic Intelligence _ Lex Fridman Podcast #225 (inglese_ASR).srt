00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,639
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:07,199
jeff shaneline a scientist at nist

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,480
interested in opto electronic

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,960
intelligence

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,880
we have a deep technical dive into

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,759
computing hardware that will make jim

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,839
keller proud i urge you to hop on to

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,679
this rollercoaster ride through

9
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,719
neuromorphic computing and

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,320
superconducting electronics and hold on

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,919
for dear life

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,240
jeff is a great communicator of

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400
technical information and so it was

14
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,960
truly a pleasure to talk to him about

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,879
some physics and engineering

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,439
to support this podcast please check out

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,000
our sponsors in the description

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,839
this is the lex friedman podcast and

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,238
here is my conversation with jeff

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,520
shaneline i got a chance to read a

21
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,919
fascinating paper you um authored called

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,000
optoelectronic intelligence

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,480
so maybe we could start by talking about

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,960
this paper and start with the basic

25
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,319
questions what is optoelectronic

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,120
intelligence

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,359
yeah so in that paper the the concept i

28
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,319
was trying to describe is

29
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,879
sort of an architecture for building

30
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,279
brain-inspired computing

31
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,879
that leverages light for communication

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,599
in conjunction with

33
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,280
electronic circuits for computation

34
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,039
in that particular paper a lot of the

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,840
work we're doing right now in our

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,200
project at nist is focused on

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,799
superconducting electronics for

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
computation i'll go into

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,720
why that is but

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,720
that might make a little more sense in

41
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,359
context if we first

42
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,840
describe what that is in contrast to

43
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,599
which is semiconducting electronics

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,799
so is it worth taking a couple minutes

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,719
to describe

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,920
semiconducting electronics

47
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:49,039
it might even be worthwhile to step back

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,159
and uh talk about electricity and

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,719
circuits and how circuits work right

50
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,399
before we talk about super conductivity

51
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,478
right okay

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,159
how does the computer work jeff well i

53
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,159
won't go into everything that makes a

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,680
computer work but

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,880
let's talk about the

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,640
basic building blocks a transistor so

57
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,799
and even more basic than that a

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:15,359
semiconductor material silicon say so

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,439
uh in silicon silicon is a semiconductor

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,959
and what that means is at low

61
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,878
temperature there are no free charges no

62
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,039
free electrons that can move around so

63
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,560
when you talk about electricity you're

64
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,280
talking about

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
predominantly electrons moving to

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,199
establish electrical currents and they

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,200
move under the influence of voltages so

68
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,039
you apply voltages

69
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,799
electrons move around those can be

70
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,120
measured as currents and you can

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,840
represent information in that way so

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,280
semiconductors are special

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,360
in the sense that

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
they are really malleable so if you have

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,920
a semiconductor material

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
it you can change the number of free

77
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,439
electrons that can move around by

78
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,919
putting different

79
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,120
elements different atoms in lattice

80
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,479
sites so

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,719
what is a lattice site well a

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,479
semiconductor is a crystal which means

83
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,439
all the atoms that comprise the material

84
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,598
are

85
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,598
at exact locations that are perfectly

86
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,518
periodic in space so if you start at any

87
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,039
one atom and you go along the what are

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,319
called the lattice vectors you get to

89
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,799
another atom and another atom and

90
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,878
another atom and for high quality

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,680
devices it's important that it's a a

92
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,560
perfect crystal with very few defects

93
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,120
but you can intentionally replace a

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,799
silicon atom with say a phosphorus atom

95
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,039
and then you can you can change the

96
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,439
number of free electrons that are in a

97
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,840
region of space that has that excess of

98
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,400
what are called dopants so picture a

99
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,920
device that has a left terminal and a

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,760
right terminal

101
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,238
and if you apply a voltage between those

102
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,759
two you can cause electrical current to

103
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,280
flow between them

104
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,158
now we

105
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,158
add a third terminal up on top there and

106
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,318
depending on the voltage between the

107
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,318
left and right terminal and that third

108
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,639
voltage you can you can change that

109
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,518
current so what's commonly done in

110
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,479
digital electronic circuits is to

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,519
leave a fixed voltage from left to right

112
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,119
and then

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
change that voltage that's applied at

114
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
what's called the gate the gate of the

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,920
transistor so

116
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,280
what you do is you you make it to where

117
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,279
there's an excess of electrons on the

118
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,879
left excess of electrons on the right

119
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,559
and very few electrons in the middle and

120
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,560
you do this by changing the

121
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,720
concentration of different dopants in

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,040
the lattice spatially

123
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,199
and then when you apply a voltage to

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,120
that gate you can either cause current

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,600
to flow or turn it off and so that's

126
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,519
sort of your zero and one you if you

127
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,320
apply voltage current can flow that

128
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,918
current is representing a digital one

129
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,279
and uh from that from that basic element

130
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,959
you can build up

131
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,719
all the complexity of digital electronic

132
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,519
circuits that

133
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,199
have

134
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,799
really had a profound influence on our

135
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,960
society now you're talking about

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,879
electrons can you give a sense of what

137
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,279
scale we're talking about when we're

138
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,360
talking about in silicon

139
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,679
uh being able to mass manufacture these

140
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,919
kinds of uh gates

141
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,639
yeah so scale in a number of different

142
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:09,038
senses well at the scale of the silicon

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,759
lattice the distance between two atoms

144
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,639
there is half a nanometer so

145
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
um

146
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,478
people often like to compare these

147
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,159
things to the the width of a human hair

148
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,159
i think it's some

149
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,759
six orders of magnitude smaller than the

150
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,400
width of a human hair

151
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,319
uh something on that order

152
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,319
so remarkably small we're talking about

153
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,918
individual atoms here and electrons are

154
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,439
of that length scale when they're in

155
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,959
that environment

156
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,800
but there's another sense that scale

157
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,399
matters in digital electronics this is

158
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,400
perhaps the more important sense

159
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:42,638
although they're related scale refers to

160
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,359
a number of things it refers to

161
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,280
the size of that transistor so for

162
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,600
example i said you have a left contact a

163
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,719
right contact and some space between

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,039
them where the

165
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,199
the gate electrode sits that that's

166
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,279
called the the channel width uh or the

167
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,439
channel length and um

168
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,679
what has enabled what we think of as

169
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,600
moore's law or the continued

170
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,240
increased performance in silicon

171
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,280
microelectronic circuits is the ability

172
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,160
to make that size that feature size ever

173
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,198
smaller ever smaller at a

174
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,000
a

175
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,160
really remarkable pace i mean

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,639
that that feature size has

177
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,000
decreased uh consistently every couple

178
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,639
of years for

179
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,240
the since the 1960s and that was

180
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,160
that was what moore predicted in the

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
1960s he thought it would continue for

182
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,759
at least two more decades and it's been

183
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,800
much longer than that and so

184
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,960
um

185
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,199
that is why we've been able to fit ever

186
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,680
more devices ever more transistors ever

187
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,600
more computational power on essentially

188
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,079
the same size of chip

189
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,680
so a user sits back and does essentially

190
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,120
nothing you're running the same computer

191
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,879
program but those devices are getting

192
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,720
smaller so they get faster they get more

193
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,959
energy efficient and all of our

194
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,199
computing performance just continues to

195
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,359
improve and we don't have to

196
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,520
think too hard about

197
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,960
what we're what we're doing as say a

198
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,719
software design or something like that i

199
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,560
absolutely don't mean to say that

200
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,080
there's no innovation in

201
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,839
software that are the user side of

202
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,839
things of course there is but

203
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,478
from from the hardware perspective we

204
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,638
just have been given this gift of

205
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:17,199
continued performance improvement

206
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,199
through this scaling that is ever

207
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,199
smaller feature sizes with very similar

208
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,800
um say power consumption that power

209
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,319
consumption is

210
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,800
has not continued to scale in the most

211
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,560
recent decades but um

212
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,639
nevertheless we had a really good run

213
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,800
there for a while and now we're down to

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,120
gates that are seven nanometers which is

215
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,879
state of the art right now maybe

216
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,399
global foundries is trying to push it

217
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,120
even lower than that i can't keep up

218
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,719
with

219
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,959
where the predictions are that it's

220
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,840
going to end but seven nanometer

221
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,680
uh

222
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,318
seven nanometer transistor

223
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,280
has just just a few tens of atoms along

224
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,280
the length of the conduction pathway so

225
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,799
a naive

226
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,399
semiconductor device physicist would

227
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,759
think you can't go much further than

228
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,079
that without

229
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,919
some kind of revolution in the way we

230
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,079
think about the physics of our devices

231
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,240
is there something to be said about

232
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,598
the mass manufacture of these devices

233
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,478
right right so that's another thing so

234
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,279
how have we been able to make those

235
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,839
transistors smaller and smaller well

236
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,679
companies like intel global foundries

237
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,000
they invest a lot of money in the

238
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,519
lithography so how are these

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,478
chips actually made well one of the most

240
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:29,120
important steps is this what's called

241
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:32,000
ion implantation so you have you start

242
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,479
with sort of a pristine silicon crystal

243
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,559
and then using photolithography which is

244
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,879
a technique where you can pattern

245
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,439
different shapes using light

246
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,519
you can define which regions of space

247
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,000
you're going to implant with different

248
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,080
uh different species of ions that are

249
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,679
going to change the local electrical

250
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,399
properties right there

251
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,000
so by using ever shorter wavelengths of

252
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,519
light and different kinds of optical

253
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,759
techniques and different kinds of

254
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,360
lithographic techniques things that go

255
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,120
far beyond

256
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
my knowledge base

257
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,240
you can just simply shrink that feature

258
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,559
size down and you say you're at seven

259
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,720
nanometers well the wavelength of light

260
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,518
that's being used is over 100 nanometers

261
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,240
that's already deep in the uv so

262
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,440
how how are those minut features

263
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,039
patterned well there's there's an

264
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,040
extraordinary amount of innovation that

265
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,559
has gone into that but nevertheless it

266
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,319
stayed very consistent in this

267
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,879
ever-shrinking feature size and now the

268
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,040
question is can you make it smaller and

269
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:29,039
even if you do do you still continue to

270
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,120
get performance improvements but that's

271
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,240
another kind of scaling where

272
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,240
these these companies have been able to

273
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,839
so okay you you picture a chip that has

274
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,879
a processor on it well that chip is not

275
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,320
made as a chip it's made as a on a wafer

276
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,159
and um

277
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,160
using photolithography you basically

278
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,399
print the same pattern

279
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,360
on different dies all across the wafer

280
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,440
multiple layers tens probably

281
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,919
probably a hundred some layers in a

282
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,760
mature foundry process and and you do

283
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,120
this on ever bigger wafers too that's

284
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,039
another aspect of scaling that's

285
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,879
occurred in the last several decades so

286
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,559
now you have this 300 millimeter wafer

287
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,639
it's like as big as a pizza and it has

288
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,958
maybe a thousand processors on it and

289
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,039
then you dice that up using a saw and

290
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,278
now you can sell these things

291
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,838
so cheap because the the manufacturing

292
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,919
process was so streamlined i think a

293
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,360
technology as revolutionary as silicon

294
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,078
microelectronics

295
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,720
has to have that kind of

296
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,199
manufacturing scalability which i will

297
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,639
just emphasize i believe is

298
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,560
enabled by

299
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,319
physics it's not i mean that of course

300
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,239
there's human ingenuity that goes into

301
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,800
it but at least from my

302
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,600
my side where where i sit it sure looks

303
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,078
like the physics of our universe allows

304
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,399
us to to produce that and we've we've

305
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,239
discovered how

306
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,759
more so than we've invented it although

307
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,919
of course we have invented it humans

308
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,559
have invented it but it was it's almost

309
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,319
as if it was there waiting for us to to

310
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,078
discover it you mean the entirety of it

311
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,720
or are you specifically talking about

312
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,439
the techniques of photo lithography like

313
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,360
the optics involved i mean the entirety

314
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,000
of the scaling down to the seven

315
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
nanometers that you're able to have

316
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,799
electrons

317
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,759
not interfere with each other in such a

318
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,319
way that

319
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,120
you could still have gates like that's

320
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,800
enabled to achieve that scale spatial

321
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,519
and temporal

322
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,838
seems to be very special and is enabled

323
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,519
by the physics of our world all the

324
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,920
things you just said so starting with

325
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,759
the the silicon material itself

326
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:32,000
silicon is a unique semiconductor it has

327
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,838
essentially ideal properties for making

328
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,919
a specific kind of transistor that's

329
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,839
extraordinarily useful so

330
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,078
i mentioned that

331
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
silicon has uh well when you make a

332
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,000
transistor you have this gate contact

333
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,319
that sits on top of the conduction

334
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,879
channel and depending on the voltage you

335
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,639
apply there you pull more carriers into

336
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,958
the conduction channel or push them away

337
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,039
so it becomes more or less conductive

338
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,479
in order to have that work without just

339
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,199
sucking those carriers right into that

340
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,920
contact you need a very thin insulator

341
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,720
and and part of scaling has been to

342
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,199
gradually decrease the thickness of that

343
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,360
of that gate insulator so that you can

344
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,480
use a roughly similar voltage and still

345
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,800
have the same

346
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,800
current voltage characteristics so the

347
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,879
material that's used to do that or i

348
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,359
should say was initially used to do that

349
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,679
was a silicon dioxide which just

350
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,680
naturally grows on the silicon surface

351
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,000
so you expose silicon to

352
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,599
the atmosphere that we breathe and

353
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,559
uh well if you're manufacturing you're

354
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,720
going to

355
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,559
purify these gases but nevertheless that

356
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,120
that what's called a native oxide will

357
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,039
grow there there are essentially no

358
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,799
other materials on the entire periodic

359
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:43,039
table that have as good of a

360
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,879
gate insulator as as that silicon

361
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,559
dioxide and that that has to do with

362
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,200
nothing but the physics of the

363
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,838
interaction between silicon and oxygen

364
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,120
and if it wasn't that way transistors

365
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,600
could not

366
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,078
they they could not perform in

367
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,079
nearly the the degree of capability that

368
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,439
they have and that that has to do with

369
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:06,078
the way that the the oxide grows the

370
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,839
reduced density of defects there it's

371
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,599
it's insulation meaning essentially it's

372
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,200
energy gaps you can apply a very large

373
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,839
voltage there without having current

374
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,720
leak through it so that's physics right

375
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,920
there

376
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,440
um

377
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,759
there are other things too silicon is a

378
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,839
semiconductor in in an elemental sense

379
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,679
you you only need silicon atoms a lot of

380
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,000
other semiconductors you need two

381
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,519
different kinds of atoms like a compound

382
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,480
from group three and a compound from

383
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,799
group five that opens you up to lots of

384
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
defects that can occur where one atom's

385
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,838
not sitting quite at the lattice site it

386
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,159
is and it's switched with another one

387
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,760
that degrades performance

388
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,439
but then also on the side that you

389
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:46,078
mentioned with the the manufacturing

390
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,000
we have access to light sources that can

391
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,359
produce these very short wavelengths of

392
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,120
light

393
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,278
how does photolithography occur well you

394
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,399
actually put this polymer on top of your

395
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,879
wafer

396
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,240
and you expose it to light and then you

397
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,039
use a

398
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,879
aqueous chemical processing to dissolve

399
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,879
away the regions that were exposed to

400
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,919
light and leave the regions that were

401
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,720
not

402
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,639
and

403
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,639
we are blessed with these polymers that

404
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,480
have the right property where

405
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,399
they can um

406
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,959
cause scission events where the polymer

407
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,198
splits where a photon hits i mean you

408
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,719
know maybe maybe that's not too

409
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,559
surprising but i don't know it all it

410
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,199
all comes together to have this

411
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,278
really complex uh manufacturable

412
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,278
ecosystem where

413
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,559
very sophisticated technologies can be

414
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,958
devised

415
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,559
and it works quite well

416
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,319
and amazingly like you said with a

417
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,078
wavelength at like 100 nanometers or

418
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,040
something like that you're still able to

419
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,638
achieve on this polymer precision of

420
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,799
whatever whatever we said seven

421
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,480
nanometers yeah i think i've heard like

422
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,838
four nanometers being talked about

423
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,839
something like that yes

424
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,040
i if we could just pause on this and

425
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,279
we'll return to super connectivity but

426
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,120
in this whole journey from a history

427
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,360
perspective what what do you think is

428
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,278
the most beautiful

429
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,120
at the intersection of engineering and

430
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,799
physics to you and this whole process

431
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,480
that we talked about with silicon and

432
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,319
photolithography

433
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,920
things that people were able to achieve

434
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
in order to uh

435
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,039
push

436
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,439
the moore's law forward is it the early

437
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,639
days the the invention of the transistor

438
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,560
itself is it uh some particular cool

439
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,000
little thing that um

440
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,439
maybe not many people know about like

441
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,639
what do you think is most beautiful in

442
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,720
this

443
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,039
in this whole process journey

444
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,440
the most beautiful is a little difficult

445
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,360
to answer let me let me try and sidestep

446
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,560
it a little bit and just say

447
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,480
what strikes me about looking at the the

448
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,518
history of

449
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,839
silicon microelectronics is that

450
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,240
uh so when when quantum mechanics was

451
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,399
developed people quickly began applying

452
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
it to semiconductors and it was

453
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,278
broadly understood that these are

454
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,800
fascinating systems and people cared

455
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:53,600
about them for their basic physics but

456
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,919
also

457
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,199
their utility is devices and then the

458
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,000
transistor was invented in the late 40s

459
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,919
in a

460
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,159
relatively crude experimental setup

461
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,879
where you just crammed a metal electrode

462
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,799
into the semiconductor and and that was

463
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,879
that was ingenious these people were

464
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,958
able to um

465
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,320
make it work you know uh

466
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,758
but so

467
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,240
what what i want to get to that that

468
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,519
really strikes me is that in those early

469
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,399
days

470
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,519
there were a number of different

471
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,120
semiconductors that were being

472
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,799
considered they had different properties

473
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
different strengths different weaknesses

474
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,639
most people thought germanium was the

475
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,759
the way to go

476
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,839
it it had some some nice properties uh

477
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,919
related to things

478
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,279
about how the electrons move inside the

479
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,039
lattice

480
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,039
but other people thought that compound

481
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:45,519
semiconductors with group 3 and group 5

482
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:47,838
also had really really extraordinary um

483
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,560
properties that might be conducive to to

484
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,399
making the best devices so there were

485
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,919
different groups exploring each of these

486
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,159
and that's great that's how science

487
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,879
works you have to cast a broad net but

488
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,759
then

489
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,439
what i what i find striking is why why

490
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,680
is it that silicon

491
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,360
won because it's not that it's not that

492
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,279
germanium is a useless material and it's

493
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,198
not present in technology or compound

494
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,558
semiconductors they're both

495
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,640
doing

496
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,558
doing exciting and important things

497
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,919
slightly more niche applications whereas

498
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,519
silicon is the semiconductor material

499
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,280
for microelectronics which is the

500
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,599
platform for digital computing which has

501
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,399
transformed our world why did silicon

502
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,798
win it's because of a remarkable

503
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,000
assemblage of qualities

504
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:34,480
that no one of them was the clear winner

505
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,640
but it it made these sort of compromises

506
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,599
between a number of different influences

507
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,520
it had that really excellent

508
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,519
gate oxide that allowed it to that

509
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:45,359
allowed us to make mosfets these high

510
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,119
performance transistors

511
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,639
so quickly and cheaply and easily

512
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,519
without having to do a lot of materials

513
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,480
development the the band gap of silicon

514
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,798
um

515
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,160
is actually so in a semiconductor

516
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,839
there's there's an important parameter

517
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,919
which is called the band gap which tells

518
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,399
you uh if you they're they're sort of

519
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,759
electrons that fill up to one level in

520
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,600
in the energy

521
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,038
diagram and then there's a gap where

522
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:08,319
electrons aren't allowed to have an

523
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,200
energy in a certain range and then

524
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,359
there's another energy level above that

525
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,279
and that that difference between the

526
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,079
lower sort of filled level and the

527
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,079
unoccupied level that tells you how much

528
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,079
voltage you have to apply in order to

529
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:26,000
induce a current to flow

530
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,678
so with germanium that's about 0.75

531
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,640
electron volts that means you have to

532
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,840
apply 0.75 volts to to get a current

533
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,360
moving

534
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,359
and it turns out that

535
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:38,399
if you compare that to the

536
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:39,599
the thermal excitations that are induced

537
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,679
just by the temperature of our

538
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,279
environment that gap's not quite big

539
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,360
enough you start to

540
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,798
use it to perform computations it gets a

541
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,719
little hot and you get all these

542
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,038
accidental carriers that are excited

543
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,360
into the the conduction band and it

544
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,759
causes errors in your computation

545
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,759
silicon's band gap is just a little

546
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,679
higher 1.1

547
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,480
electron volts but you have an

548
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,080
exponential dependence on the

549
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,240
the number of carriers that are present

550
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,918
that can induce those errors

551
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,400
uh it decays exponentially with that

552
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,799
voltage so just that that slight extra

553
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,280
energy in that band gap

554
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,038
really puts it in an ideal position to

555
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,279
be operated

556
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,480
in the in the conditions of our of our

557
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,399
ambient environment it's kind of

558
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,919
fascinating that so like you mentioned

559
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,880
air is um decrease exponentially

560
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,720
uh with the voltage so

561
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,559
it's funny because this error thing

562
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,558
comes up you know when you start talking

563
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,918
about quantum computing

564
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,000
it's kind of amazing that everything

565
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,440
we've been talking about the errors as

566
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,359
we scale down seems to be extremely low

567
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,798
yes and like all of our computation

568
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,879
is based on the assumption that it's

569
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,558
extremely low yes so it's not digital

570
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,799
computation digital sorry digital

571
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,599
computation so as opposed to our

572
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:58,240
biological computation our brain is like

573
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,918
the assumption is stuff is gonna fail

574
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,919
all over the place and we somehow have

575
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,480
to still be robust to that that's

576
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,919
exactly right so this also this is gonna

577
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,038
be the most controversial part of our

578
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,200
conversation where you're gonna make

579
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,640
some enemies so let me ask because we've

580
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,360
been talking about physics and

581
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,360
engineering

582
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,679
a which group of people is smarter and

583
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,558
more important for this one

584
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,120
let me ask the question in a better way

585
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,038
some of the big innovations some of the

586
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,199
beautiful things that we've been talking

587
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,200
about how much of it is physics how much

588
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,080
of it is engineering my dad is a

589
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,400
physicist and he talks down to all the

590
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,359
amazing engineering that we're doing

591
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,038
in

592
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,798
the artificial intelligence and the

593
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,879
computer science and the robotics and

594
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,639
all that space so we argue about this

595
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,039
all the time so what do you think who

596
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,559
gets more credit i'm genuinely not

597
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:49,038
trying to just be politically correct

598
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:50,399
here i don't see how you would have

599
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:51,839
any of the

600
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,759
what we consider sort of the great

601
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,439
accomplishments of society without both

602
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,158
and you absolutely need both of those

603
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,558
things physics tends to play a key role

604
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,120
earlier in the development and then

605
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,639
engineering optimization these things

606
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,279
take over

607
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,600
and uh i mean

608
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,960
the invention of the transistor or

609
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,798
actually even before that the

610
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,079
understanding of semiconductor physics

611
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:15,759
that allowed the invention of the

612
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,519
transistor that's all physics so if you

613
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,319
didn't have that physics you don't even

614
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,119
get to get on the on the on the field

615
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,720
but

616
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,639
once you have

617
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,400
understood and demonstrated that this is

618
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,320
in principle possible

619
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,640
moore's law is engineering that

620
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,960
why we have uh

621
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,440
computers more powerful than

622
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,640
than old supercomputers in each of our

623
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,320
phones is that's all engineering and

624
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,559
i i think i would

625
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,359
be quite foolish to say that

626
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:45,119
that's

627
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,038
i mean that that's not valuable if it's

628
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,558
not a great contribution uh it's a

629
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:49,679
beautiful dance would you put like

630
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,440
silicon

631
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,640
the understanding of the material

632
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,480
properties

633
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,679
in the space of engineering like how

634
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,200
does that whole process work to

635
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,519
understand that it has all these nice

636
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,159
properties or even the development of

637
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,759
photolithography

638
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,960
is is that basically

639
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,158
would you put that in the category of

640
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,000
engineering

641
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,640
no i would say that

642
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,319
it is basic physics it is applied

643
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,960
physics it's material science it's um

644
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,720
x-ray crystallography it's polymer

645
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,240
chemistry it's it's everything i mean

646
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,880
chemistry even is thrown in there

647
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,880
absolutely yes yes absolutely just no

648
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,640
biology

649
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,480
okay we can get to biology right well

650
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,919
the biology is in the humans that are

651
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,480
engineering the system that's all

652
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,080
integrated deeply okay so let's return

653
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,599
you mentioned this uh word

654
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,199
superconductivity

655
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,199
so what does that have to do

656
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,759
with what we're talking about right okay

657
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,240
so in a semiconductor as i

658
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,038
tried to describe a second ago

659
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,000
you can sort of uh

660
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,599
in induce currents by applying voltages

661
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,240
and those have sort of typical

662
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,959
properties that you would expect from

663
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,880
some kind of a conductor those electrons

664
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,640
they don't just flow

665
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,559
perfectly without dissipation if an

666
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,880
electron collides with an imperfection

667
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,000
in the lattice or another electron it's

668
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,520
going to slow down it's going to lose

669
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,159
its momentum so you have to keep

670
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,158
applying that voltage in order to keep

671
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,559
the current flowing in a superconductor

672
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,720
something different happens if you get a

673
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,558
current to start flowing it will

674
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,720
continue to flow indefinitely there's

675
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:24,079
there's no dissipation so

676
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,159
that's crazy how does that happen well

677
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:29,038
it happens at low temperature and this

678
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,440
is crucial it has to it has to be a

679
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,679
quite low temperature and

680
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,679
what what i'm talking about there i

681
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,720
for essentially all of our conversation

682
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,759
i'm going to be talking about

683
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,159
conventional superconductors um

684
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:45,038
sometimes called low tc superconductors

685
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,559
low critical temperature superconductors

686
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,640
and so

687
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,519
those materials have to be

688
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,120
in at a temperature around say around 4

689
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,119
kelvin i mean their critical temperature

690
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,639
might be 10 kelvin something like that

691
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,519
but you want to operate them at around 4

692
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,799
kelvin 4 degrees above absolute zero and

693
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,319
what happens at

694
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,119
that temperature at that very low

695
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:08,720
temperatures in certain materials is

696
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,719
that the the noise of

697
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,120
atoms moving around the lattice

698
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,200
vibrating electrons colliding with each

699
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,599
other that becomes sufficiently low that

700
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
the electrons can settle into this very

701
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,959
special state it's sometimes referred to

702
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:25,199
as a macroscopic quantum state because

703
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,880
if i had a piece of

704
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,038
superconducting material here let's say

705
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
niobium is a very typical

706
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,158
um

707
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,199
superconductor if i if i had a block of

708
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,720
niobium here and we cooled it below its

709
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,840
critical temperature

710
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,519
all of the electrons in that in that

711
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,519
superconducting state would be in one

712
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,480
coherent quantum state they would

713
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:48,400
the the wave function of that state

714
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,400
is described in terms of all of the

715
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,559
particles simultaneously but it extends

716
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,080
across macroscopic dimensions the size

717
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,038
of a whatever material the size of

718
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,558
whatever

719
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,240
block of that material i have sitting

720
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,399
here and the way that the way this

721
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,159
occurs is that

722
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,600
you know we let's try to be a little bit

723
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,760
light on the technical details but

724
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,399
essentially the electrons coordinate

725
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,158
with each other they they are able to

726
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,320
in this macroscopic quantum state

727
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,159
they're able to sort of

728
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,678
one can quickly take the place of the

729
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,640
other you can't tell electrons apart

730
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,759
they're they're what's known as

731
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,360
identical particles so if this electron

732
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,679
runs into a

733
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,879
defect that would otherwise cause it to

734
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,640
scatter

735
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,520
it can just sort of

736
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,320
um

737
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:32,158
almost miraculously avoid that defect

738
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,839
because it's not really in that location

739
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,919
it's part of a macroscopic quantum state

740
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,918
and the entire quantum state was not

741
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,640
scattered by that defect so you can get

742
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,038
a current that flows without dissipation

743
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,919
and that's called a supercurrent

744
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:44,720
that's

745
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,880
uh

746
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,079
sort of just very much scratching the

747
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,159
surface of of superconductivity there's

748
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,599
very deep and rich physics there which

749
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,120
is probably not

750
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,439
the main subject we need to go into

751
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,278
right now but it turns out that when you

752
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,000
have

753
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,000
this material you can you can do usual

754
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,679
things like make wires out of it so you

755
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,278
can get current to flow in a straight

756
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,080
line on a chip but you can also make

757
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,480
other

758
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,079
devices that perform

759
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,798
different kinds of operations some of

760
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,678
them are kind of logic operations like

761
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:21,038
you like you'd get in a transistor the

762
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,640
most common or most um

763
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,599
i would say

764
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,000
diverse in its utility the component is

765
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,240
a joseph's injunction it's not analogous

766
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,159
to a transistor in the sense that if you

767
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,079
apply a voltage here it changes how much

768
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,120
current flows from left to right but it

769
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,439
is analogous in sort of a sense of

770
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,918
it's the it's the go-to component that a

771
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,558
that a circuit engineer is going to use

772
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,600
to start to build up more complexity so

773
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,720
these are uh these junctions serve as

774
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,558
gates

775
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,360
they can they can serve as gates they

776
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,558
can

777
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,959
so i'm not sure how house

778
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,639
um concerned to be with semantics but

779
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,319
let me just briefly say what a joseph's

780
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,159
injunction is and we can talk about

781
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,319
different ways that they can be used

782
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,278
basically if you have a superconducting

783
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,798
wire and then a small

784
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,079
gap of

785
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,639
a different material that's not

786
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,720
superconducting an insulator or normal

787
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,480
metal and then another superconducting

788
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,480
wire on the other side that's a joseph's

789
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,558
injunction so it's sometimes referred to

790
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,839
as a superconducting weak link so you

791
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,319
have this

792
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,439
superconducting state on one side and on

793
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,519
the other side and that the

794
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,960
superconducting wave function

795
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:34,639
actually tunnels across that gap and

796
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,759
when you when you create such a physical

797
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,640
entity it has very unusual

798
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,079
um

799
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,880
current voltage

800
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,720
characteristics within in that gap

801
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,559
like like weird stuff through the entire

802
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,798
circuit so you can imagine suppose you

803
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,119
had a loop set up that had one of those

804
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,200
weak links in in the loop

805
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,798
current would flow in that loop

806
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,080
independent even if you hadn't applied a

807
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,079
voltage to it and that's called the

808
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,599
josephson effect so the fact that

809
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,759
there's this

810
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,359
phase difference in the quantum wave

811
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,278
function from one side of the tunneling

812
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,000
barrier to the other induces current to

813
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,679
flow so how does you change state right

814
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,640
exactly so how do you change state now

815
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,320
picture

816
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,480
if i have a

817
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,599
current bias coming down this line in my

818
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,159
circuit and there's a joseph's

819
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,319
injunction right in in the middle of it

820
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,000
and now i make another wire that goes

821
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,558
around the joseph's injunction so i have

822
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,319
a loop here a superconducting loop

823
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:29,038
i can add

824
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,319
current to that loop by exceeding the

825
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:31,599
critical current of that joseph's

826
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:34,960
injunction so

827
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:37,119
like any superconducting material

828
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,880
it can carry this supercurrent that i've

829
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,879
described this current that can

830
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,799
propagate without dissipation up to a

831
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,799
certain level and if you try and pass

832
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,240
more current than that through the

833
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:50,240
material it's going to become a

834
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,480
resistive material a normal normal

835
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,038
material so in the in the joseph's

836
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,278
injunction the same thing happens i can

837
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,278
bias it above its critical current and

838
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,278
then what it's going to do it's going to

839
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,919
add a

840
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:06,240
quantized amount of current into that

841
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,880
loop and what i mean by quantized is

842
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,440
it's going to come in discrete packets

843
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,559
with a well-defined value of current so

844
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,278
in the

845
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,960
vernacular of of some people working in

846
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:18,159
this community

847
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,480
you would say

848
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,679
you pop a flux on into the loop so a

849
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,360
flux on you pop a flux on into the loop

850
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,798
yeah so if that's a skateboarder

851
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,599
sorry go ahead

852
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:34,240
a flux on is one of these quantized

853
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,759
uh sort of uh amounts of current that

854
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,120
you can add to a loop and this is a

855
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,278
cartoon picture but i think it's

856
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,678
sufficient for our purposes so which uh

857
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,919
maybe it's useful to say

858
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,880
what is the speed at which these

859
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,640
discrete packets of current travel

860
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,480
because we'll be talking about light a

861
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,000
little bit it seems like the speed is

862
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,440
important the speed is important that's

863
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,599
an excellent question

864
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,759
sometimes i wonder where you

865
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,079
how you became so astute

866
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:03,038
but um so

867
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:05,278
this uh matrix four is coming out so

868
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,879
maybe that's related i'm not sure i'm

869
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:08,720
dressed for the job

870
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,559
i was trying to get to become an extra

871
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,798
matrix for it didn't work out

872
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,960
anyway uh so what's the speed of these

873
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:17,200
packets you'll have to find another gig

874
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,919
i know i'm sorry um so the speed of the

875
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,759
pack is actually these flux ons these

876
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,520
these uh sort of pulses of of um

877
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,759
current that are generated by joseph's

878
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,599
injunctions they can actually propagate

879
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,960
very close to the speed of light uh

880
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:33,678
maybe something like a third of the

881
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,519
speed of light that's quite fast so

882
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,399
one of the reasons why joseph's

883
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:40,558
injunctions are appealing is because

884
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:43,038
their signals can propagate quite fast

885
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:45,278
and they can they can also switch very

886
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,038
fast what i mean by switch is perform

887
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:49,440
that operation that i described where

888
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,158
you add current to the loop

889
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,200
that can happen within um

890
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,039
a few tens of picoseconds so you can get

891
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,120
you can get devices that operate in the

892
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,319
hundreds of gigahertz range and by

893
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,000
comparison

894
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,918
most processors

895
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,720
in our in our conventional computers

896
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,799
operate closer to the the one gigahertz

897
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,839
range maybe three gigahertz seems to be

898
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,918
kind of

899
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,918
where where those speeds have have

900
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,679
leveled out so the gamers listening to

901
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,840
this are getting really excited that

902
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,919
overclock their system to like what is

903
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,558
it like four gigahertz or something 100

904
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,200
this sounds incredible uh can i just as

905
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,119
a tiny tangent is the

906
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,440
physics of this understood well how to

907
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,038
do this stably oh yes the physics is

908
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,640
understood well the physics of joseph's

909
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,480
injunctions is understood well the

910
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,000
technology's understood quite well too

911
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,000
the reasons why

912
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,480
it hasn't displaced silicon

913
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,679
microelectronics in conventional digital

914
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,000
computing

915
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,399
i think are more related to what i was

916
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,119
alluding to before about the the

917
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:52,158
myriad practical almost mundane aspects

918
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,319
of silicon that make it so useful

919
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,840
you can make a transistor ever smaller

920
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,759
and smaller

921
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,599
and it will still perform its digital

922
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,679
function quite well the same is not true

923
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,359
of a joseph's injunction you really they

924
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,798
don't they just it's not the same thing

925
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,240
that there's this feature that you can

926
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,278
keep making smaller and smaller and

927
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,240
it'll keep performing the same

928
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:12,720
operations this loop i described any

929
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,159
joseph's in circuit well i i'm going to

930
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,278
be careful i shouldn't say any joseph's

931
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,519
in circuit but many josephs and circuits

932
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,200
the way they process information or the

933
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,720
way they perform whatever function it is

934
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,480
they're trying to do maybe it's sensing

935
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,720
a weak magnetic field

936
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,278
it it depends on an interplay between

937
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,960
the junction and that loop and you can't

938
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,480
make that loop much smaller and it's not

939
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,720
for practical reasons that have to do

940
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,200
with lithography it's for fundamental

941
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,440
physical reasons about the way

942
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,600
the magnetic field interacts with that

943
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,000
superconducting material there's there

944
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:45,839
are physical limits that no matter how

945
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,558
good our technology got

946
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,199
those circuits would i think would never

947
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:53,519
be able to be scaled down to the the

948
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,679
densities that silicon microelectronics

949
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,519
can i don't know if we mentioned is

950
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,600
there something interesting about the

951
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,599
various superconducting materials

952
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,439
involved or is it all there's a lot of

953
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:06,959
stuff that's interesting and it's not

954
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,759
silicon it's not silicon no so like it's

955
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,600
some materials that also required to be

956
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,879
super cold for calvin yes so so let's

957
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,599
dissect a couple of those different

958
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,679
things the super cold part let me just

959
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,199
mention for your gamers out there that

960
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,320
are trying to clock it at four gigahertz

961
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,240
and would love to go to what kind of

962
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,720
cooling system can achieve exactly four

963
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,120
kelvin you need liquid helium and so

964
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,200
liquid helium is expensive it's

965
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,879
inconvenient you need a cryostat that

966
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,480
that sits there and

967
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,120
the energy consumption of that cryostat

968
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,720
is impracticable for it's not going in

969
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,759
your cell phone you're not so you can

970
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,839
picture holding your cell phone like

971
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,278
this and then something the size of you

972
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:47,119
know uh

973
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,519
a keg of beer or something on your back

974
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,839
to cool it like that makes no sense yeah

975
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,798
so if you if you're trying to make this

976
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,879
in consumer devices uh electronics that

977
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,879
are ubiquitous across society

978
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,919
superconductors are not in the race for

979
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,600
that for now but you're saying so we're

980
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,000
just to frame the conversation maybe the

981
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:09,358
thing we're focused on is computing

982
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,239
systems that serve as like as servers

983
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,239
like large yes large systems so so then

984
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,398
you can contrast what's going on in your

985
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,398
cell phone with what's going on at

986
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,358
one of the super computers

987
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:21,358
um

988
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,039
colleague katie schuman invited us out

989
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,199
to oak ridge a few years ago so we got

990
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,960
to see titan and that was when they were

991
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,439
building summits so these are some high

992
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,519
performance supercomputers

993
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,599
out in tennessee and those are filling

994
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:36,159
entire rooms the size of warehouses you

995
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,359
know so once you're at that level okay

996
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,119
there you're already putting a lot of

997
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:42,159
power into cooling you need

998
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,159
cooling is part of your engineering task

999
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,878
that you have to deal with so there it's

1000
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,480
not entirely obvious that cooling to 4

1001
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:52,559
kelvin is out of the question it's it

1002
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,240
has not happened yet and i can speak to

1003
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:55,440
why that is in the digital domain if

1004
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,000
you're interested

1005
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,880
i think it's not going to happen i don't

1006
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,639
think

1007
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,559
i don't think superconductors are going

1008
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:05,039
to replace semiconductors

1009
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,199
for digital computation

1010
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,119
um there are there are a lot of reasons

1011
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,279
for that but i think ultimately what it

1012
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,400
comes down to is all things considered

1013
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,440
cooling

1014
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,358
errors

1015
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,159
scaling down to feature sizes all that

1016
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:21,039
stuff semiconductors work better at the

1017
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,078
system level is there some aspect of uh

1018
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,719
just

1019
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,280
curious about the historical momentum of

1020
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,519
this is there some power to the momentum

1021
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,920
of an industry that's mass manufacturing

1022
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,079
using a certain material is this is like

1023
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,358
a titanic shifting like what's your

1024
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,079
sense when a good idea comes along how

1025
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:42,559
good does that idea need to be for the

1026
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,000
titanic to start shifting

1027
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:46,400
that's a that's an excellent question

1028
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,199
that's an excellent way to to frame it

1029
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,200
and you know

1030
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,640
i don't know the answer to that but what

1031
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,400
i think is okay so the the history of

1032
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,279
the superconducting logic

1033
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,358
goes back to the 70s ibm made a big push

1034
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,519
to do superconducting digital computing

1035
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,279
in the 70s and they made some choices

1036
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:06,880
about their

1037
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,240
devices and their architectures and

1038
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,880
things that

1039
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,319
in hindsight were kind of doomed to fail

1040
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,838
and i don't mean any disrespect for the

1041
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,559
people that did it it was hard to see at

1042
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:20,078
the time but then another generation of

1043
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:22,159
superconducting logic was introduced

1044
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,440
i want to say the 90s

1045
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:28,239
someone named likarev and seminov they

1046
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,159
propose an entire family of circuits

1047
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,719
based on joseph's injunctions that are

1048
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,799
doing digital computing based on logic

1049
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,799
gates and or

1050
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,760
not these kinds of things

1051
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,640
um

1052
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,079
and they showed how it could go hundreds

1053
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,319
of times faster than silicon

1054
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,079
microelectronics and it was it's

1055
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,079
extremely exciting i wasn't working in

1056
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,599
the field at that time but later when i

1057
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,640
went back and read the literature i was

1058
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,920
just like wow this is this is so awesome

1059
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:57,759
uh and so it you might think well

1060
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,280
the reason why it didn't displace

1061
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,599
silicon is because silicon already had

1062
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,760
so much momentum at that time

1063
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,000
but that was the 90s silicon kept that

1064
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,359
momentum because it had the simple way

1065
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,920
to keep getting better you just make

1066
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,679
features smaller and smaller so

1067
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,880
you know it would have to be

1068
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,279
i don't think it would have to be that

1069
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,880
much better than silicon to displace it

1070
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,400
but the problem is it's just not better

1071
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,400
than silicon it might be better than

1072
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,480
silicon in one metric speed of a

1073
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,320
switching operation or power consumption

1074
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,400
of a switching operation

1075
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,640
but building a digital computer is a lot

1076
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,440
more than just that elemental operation

1077
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,279
it's

1078
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,639
everything that goes into it including

1079
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,839
the manufacturing including the

1080
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:38,000
packaging including the

1081
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:39,599
um the you know various materials

1082
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,760
aspects of things so

1083
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,039
the reason why and even in even in some

1084
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,200
of those early papers i can't remember

1085
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,440
which one it was licorice said something

1086
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:49,358
along the lines of

1087
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,280
you can see how we could build an entire

1088
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,119
family of digital electronic circuits

1089
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,599
based on these components they could go

1090
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,440
100 or more times faster than

1091
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,280
semiconductor

1092
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,800
logic gates

1093
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
but i don't think that's the right way

1094
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,680
to use superconducting electronic

1095
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,159
circuits he didn't say what the right

1096
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:09,440
way was but he basically said

1097
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:12,078
digital logic trying to

1098
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,880
steal the show from silicon is probably

1099
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,519
not what these circuits are are most

1100
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,800
suited to accomplish so if we can just

1101
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:23,280
linger and use the word computation

1102
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,440
when you talk about computation how do

1103
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,800
you think about it do you think purely

1104
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,320
on just um the the switching

1105
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,640
or do you think something a little bit

1106
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,079
larger scale a circuit taken together

1107
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:38,400
performing the basic arithmetic

1108
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,599
operations that are then required to do

1109
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,000
the kind of

1110
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,519
computation that makes up a computer

1111
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,760
because when we talk about the speed of

1112
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,920
computation is it boiled down to the

1113
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,359
basic switching or is there some bigger

1114
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,639
picture that you're thinking about well

1115
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:52,880
all right so

1116
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:54,078
maybe we should disambiguate there are a

1117
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,440
variety of different kinds of

1118
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,920
computation

1119
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,519
i don't pretend to be an expert in

1120
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,760
the theory of computation or anything

1121
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,759
like that i guess it's important to

1122
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,760
differentiate though between

1123
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,720
digital logic

1124
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,240
which represents information as a series

1125
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,598
of bits binary digits which you know uh

1126
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,399
you can think of them as zeros and ones

1127
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,359
or whatever usually they correspond to

1128
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,119
a physical system that has two very well

1129
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:22,880
separated states

1130
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,800
and then other kinds of computation like

1131
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,079
we'll get into more the way your brain

1132
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,039
works which

1133
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,400
it is i think indisputably processing

1134
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:31,519
information

1135
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,160
but

1136
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:36,639
where the computation begins and ends is

1137
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:38,399
not anywhere near as well defined it it

1138
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,639
doesn't depend on

1139
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,480
these two levels here's a zero here's a

1140
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:44,719
one it's there's a lot of gray area

1141
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,000
that's usually referred to as analog

1142
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,679
computing

1143
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,480
um also

1144
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,440
in in conventional digital computers or

1145
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,320
um

1146
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,920
digital computers in general

1147
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,039
you have a concept of what's called

1148
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,119
arithmetic depth which is jargon that

1149
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:04,559
basically means how many

1150
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,599
sequential operations are performed to

1151
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,400
turn

1152
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,800
an input into an output and those kinds

1153
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,720
of computations in in digital systems

1154
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,720
are highly serial

1155
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,118
meaning that data streams they don't

1156
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,559
branch off too far to the side you do

1157
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,160
you have to pull some information over

1158
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:21,759
there and access memory from here and

1159
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,519
stuff like that but

1160
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,240
by and large the the computation

1161
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,838
proceeds in a serial manner

1162
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,719
it's not that way in the brain in the

1163
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:30,799
brain

1164
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,159
you're always drawing information from

1165
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,400
different places it's much more

1166
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,159
network-based computing neurons don't

1167
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,160
wait for their turn they fire when

1168
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,318
they're ready to fire and so it's it's

1169
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,239
asynchronous so one of the other things

1170
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,400
about a digital system is you're

1171
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,479
performing these operations on a clock

1172
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,000
and that's a that's a crucial aspect of

1173
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,480
it get rid of a clock in a digital

1174
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,800
system nothing makes sense anymore the

1175
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,480
brain has no clock it builds its own

1176
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,839
time scales based on its internal

1177
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,920
activity

1178
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,039
so so you can think of the brain as kind

1179
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,599
of uh

1180
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,519
like this like network computation where

1181
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,960
it's actually really trivial simple

1182
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:07,519
computers

1183
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,039
uh just a huge number of them and

1184
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,920
they're networked

1185
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,759
i would say it is complex sophisticated

1186
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,680
little processors and there's a huge

1187
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,520
number of things neurons are not no

1188
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:19,118
offense i don't mean to offend sure no

1189
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,400
they're very complicated and beautiful

1190
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,480
and yeah but

1191
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,400
we often oversimplify them yes they're

1192
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,400
actually like there's computation

1193
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,838
happening within a neuron right so i i

1194
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,680
would say

1195
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,759
to think of a a transistor as the

1196
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:33,598
building block of a digital computer is

1197
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,839
accurate you use a few transistors to

1198
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,760
make your logic gates you build up more

1199
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,838
you build up processors from logic gates

1200
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,839
and things like that so you can think of

1201
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,000
a transistor as a fundamental building

1202
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,239
block or you can think of as we get into

1203
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,760
more highly parallelized architectures

1204
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,679
you can think of a processor as a

1205
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,119
fundamental building block to make the

1206
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,039
analogy to the

1207
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,838
neuro side of things

1208
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:58,719
a neuron is not a transistor a neuron is

1209
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,480
a is a processor it has synapses even

1210
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,439
synapses are not transistors but they

1211
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,760
are more

1212
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,240
um they're lower on the information

1213
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,280
processing hierarchy in a sense they do

1214
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:11,919
a bulk of the computation but neurons

1215
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,240
are entire

1216
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,240
processors in and of themselves that can

1217
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,159
take in many different kinds of inputs

1218
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:20,078
on many different spatial and temporal

1219
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:22,239
scales and produce many different kinds

1220
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,240
of outputs so that they can perform

1221
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,719
different computations in different

1222
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:29,358
contexts so this is where it enters this

1223
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,559
distinction between computation and

1224
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:32,719
communication

1225
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,078
so you can think of neurons performing

1226
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,919
computation

1227
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,920
and the inter

1228
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,800
networking the interconnectivity of

1229
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,639
neurons is communication routine neurons

1230
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,800
and you see this with very large server

1231
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,318
systems i've been i mentioned offline

1232
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,880
i've been talking to jim keller whose

1233
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,239
dream is to build giant computers that

1234
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,680
uh you know

1235
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,279
the bottom like there's often the

1236
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:54,719
communication between the different

1237
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,280
pieces of computing

1238
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:59,519
so in this paper that we mentioned

1239
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,200
optoelectronic intelligence

1240
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,079
you say electrons excel at computation

1241
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:05,118
while

1242
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,400
light

1243
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,400
is excellent for communication

1244
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,240
maybe you can linger and say in this

1245
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,000
context what do you mean by computation

1246
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:17,279
and communication

1247
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,639
what what are electrons what is light

1248
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,880
and why do they excel at those two tasks

1249
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,519
yeah just to to first speak to

1250
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,720
computation versus communication

1251
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,318
i would say computation is essentially

1252
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,399
taking in

1253
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,079
some information

1254
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,200
performing operations on that

1255
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,440
information and producing new

1256
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,719
hopefully more useful information so for

1257
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,000
example

1258
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,318
um

1259
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,039
imagine you have a picture in front of

1260
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:46,318
you

1261
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,318
and

1262
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:49,519
there is a key in it and that's what

1263
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:50,719
you're looking for for whatever reason

1264
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,519
you want to you want to find the key we

1265
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:56,399
all want to find the key so

1266
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:58,159
the input is that that entire picture

1267
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,160
and the output might be the coordinates

1268
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,519
where the key is so you've reduced the

1269
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,358
total amount of information you have but

1270
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,960
you found the useful information for you

1271
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:06,159
in that present moment that's the useful

1272
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,318
information you think about this

1273
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,000
computation as like controlled

1274
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,559
synchronous

1275
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,079
sequential not necessarily it could be

1276
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,440
that could be how

1277
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,079
your system is performing the

1278
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,159
computation or it could be

1279
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,280
asynchronous it there are lots of ways

1280
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,118
to find the key

1281
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,880
it depends it depends on the nature of

1282
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,599
the data depends on

1283
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,119
um that's a very simplified example a

1284
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,280
picture with a key in it what about if

1285
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,838
you're in the world and you're trying to

1286
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,319
decide the best way to

1287
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,759
live your life you know that it might be

1288
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,920
interactive it might be there might be

1289
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,000
some recurrence or some weird

1290
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,519
asynchrony i got it so but there's an

1291
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,880
input and there's an output and you do

1292
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:46,159
some stuff in the middle that yeah it

1293
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,838
goes from the input to the app you've

1294
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:50,559
taken in information and output

1295
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:51,838
different information hopefully reducing

1296
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,759
the total amount of information and

1297
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,838
extracting what's useful yeah

1298
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,000
communication is then

1299
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,838
getting that information from the

1300
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
location in which it's stored because

1301
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:04,318
information is physical as landauer

1302
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,920
emphasized and so it is more in one

1303
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,079
place and you need to get that

1304
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,599
information to another place so that

1305
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,440
something else can

1306
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,960
use it for whatever computation it's

1307
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,240
working on maybe it's part of the same

1308
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,599
network and you're all trying to solve

1309
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,439
the same problem but neuron a over here

1310
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,599
just

1311
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,079
deduced something based on its inputs

1312
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,400
and it's now sending that information

1313
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,680
across the network to another location

1314
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,760
so that would be the act of

1315
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:32,159
communication can you linger on landau

1316
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,160
and saying information is physical roth

1317
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,358
landauer not to be confused with lev

1318
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:36,719
landau

1319
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,960
yeah and he he

1320
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,959
made huge contributions to our our

1321
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,280
understanding of

1322
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,119
the reversibility of information in in

1323
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,760
this concept that

1324
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,160
energy has to be dissipated in computing

1325
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,079
when the computation is irreversible but

1326
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,960
if you can manage to make it reversible

1327
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,160
then you you don't need to expend energy

1328
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,039
but if you

1329
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,039
um

1330
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,039
if you do expend energy to perform a

1331
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,358
computation there's sort of a minimal

1332
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:06,079
amount that you have to do and it's kt

1333
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,838
log2 and it's all somehow related to the

1334
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,599
second law of thermodynamics and that

1335
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,440
the universe is an information process

1336
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,160
and then we're living in a simulation

1337
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,159
so okay sorry sorry for that tangent so

1338
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,078
information so that's the defining the

1339
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,598
the distinction between computation and

1340
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,119
communication

1341
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,838
let me say one more thing just to

1342
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:27,039
clarify communication

1343
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,880
ideally does not change the information

1344
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,880
it moves it from one place to another

1345
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,400
but it is preserved

1346
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,640
got it okay

1347
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,680
all right that's beautiful so

1348
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:40,879
uh then the an electron versus light

1349
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:43,598
distinction and why are electrons

1350
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,358
uh good at computation and light good at

1351
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,119
communication yes

1352
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,719
this is um

1353
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,880
there's a lot that goes into it i guess

1354
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:53,358
but just try to speak to the simplest

1355
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,358
part of it

1356
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,960
electrons interact strongly with one

1357
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:59,838
another they're charged particles so if

1358
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,000
i

1359
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,519
pile a bunch of them over here

1360
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,039
they're feeling a certain amount of

1361
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,318
force and they want to they want to move

1362
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,480
somewhere else they're strongly

1363
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,719
interactive you can also get them to sit

1364
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,599
still you can an electron has a mass so

1365
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:16,559
you can you can cause it to

1366
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,640
be spatially localized so for

1367
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,639
computation that's useful because now i

1368
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,719
can make these little devices that put a

1369
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,118
bunch of electrons over here and then i

1370
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,719
change the the state of

1371
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,800
a gate like i've been describing put a

1372
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,239
different voltage on this gate and now i

1373
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,240
move the electrons over here now they're

1374
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:34,558
sitting somewhere else i have

1375
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:36,639
a physical mechanism with which i can

1376
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,480
represent information it's spatially

1377
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:40,960
localized and have knobs that i can

1378
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,960
adjust to change where those electrons

1379
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,838
are or what they're doing light by

1380
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,679
contrast photons of light

1381
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,799
uh which are the discrete packets of

1382
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:54,480
energy that were identified by einstein

1383
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,559
they do not interact with each other um

1384
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,880
especially at low light levels if you're

1385
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,400
in a medium and you have a high a bright

1386
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,160
high light level

1387
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,760
you you can get them to interact with

1388
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,318
each other through the interaction with

1389
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,400
that medium that they're in but that's

1390
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:10,639
that's a little bit more exotic and for

1391
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,720
the purposes of this conversation we can

1392
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,879
assume that photons don't interact with

1393
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,078
each other so if you have a bunch of

1394
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,519
them

1395
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,200
all propagating in the same direction

1396
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,880
they don't interfere with each other if

1397
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,879
i want to send

1398
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,559
if i if i have a communication channel

1399
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,000
and i put one more photon on it it

1400
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,280
doesn't screw up with those other one it

1401
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,119
doesn't change what those other ones

1402
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,559
were doing at all

1403
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,079
so that's really useful for

1404
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,280
communication because that means you can

1405
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,920
sort of

1406
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,720
allow a lot of these photons to flow

1407
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,800
uh

1408
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,159
with without disruption of each other

1409
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,599
and they can they can branch really

1410
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:43,358
easily and things like that but it's not

1411
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,240
good for computation because it's very

1412
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:45,119
hard

1413
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,439
for

1414
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,358
this packet of light to change what this

1415
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,039
packet of light is doing they they pass

1416
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:52,639
right through each other so in

1417
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,079
computation you want to change

1418
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,239
information and if photons don't

1419
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,000
interact with each other it's difficult

1420
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:59,919
to get them to change the information

1421
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,079
represented by the others so that that's

1422
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,599
the fundamental difference is is there

1423
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,280
also something about

1424
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,440
the way they travel through different

1425
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,640
materials

1426
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,559
or is that just a particular engineering

1427
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:13,759
no it's not that's deep physics i think

1428
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,839
so

1429
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,880
this gets back to electrons interact

1430
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:20,799
with each other and photons don't so say

1431
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,400
say i'm trying to get a

1432
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,920
packet of information

1433
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,920
from me to you

1434
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,079
and we have a wire going between us in

1435
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,480
order for me to send electrons across

1436
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,480
that wire i first have to raise the

1437
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,559
voltage on my end of the wire and that

1438
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,199
means putting a bunch of charges on it

1439
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,599
and then that that charge packet has to

1440
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:41,519
propagate along the wire and it has to

1441
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,880
get all the way over to you there's that

1442
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,199
wire is going to have something that's

1443
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,519
called capacitance which basically tells

1444
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,519
you how much charge you need to put on

1445
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,838
the wire in order to raise the voltage

1446
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:54,000
on it and the capacitance is going to be

1447
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:56,639
proportional to the length of the wire

1448
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,039
so the longer the the length of the wire

1449
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:00,000
is the more charge i have to put on it

1450
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,719
and

1451
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,119
the energy required to charge up that

1452
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,879
line and move those electrons to you is

1453
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,280
also proportional to the capacitance and

1454
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,920
goes as the voltage squared so you get

1455
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,800
this huge penalty if you if you want to

1456
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,760
send

1457
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,318
electrons across a wire over appreciable

1458
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,920
distances so distance is an important

1459
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:21,679
thing here when you're doing

1460
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,159
communication distance is an important

1461
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:25,358
thing so is the number of connections

1462
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,759
i'm trying to make

1463
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,159
me to you okay one that's not so bad if

1464
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,359
i want to now send it to 10 000 other

1465
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:33,920
friends

1466
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:36,318
then then all of those wires are adding

1467
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,720
tons of extra capacitance now not only

1468
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:40,719
does it take forever to put the charge

1469
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,639
on that wire and raise the voltage on

1470
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:43,519
all those lines but it takes a ton of

1471
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,639
power

1472
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:46,880
and

1473
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,279
the number 10000 is not randomly chosen

1474
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,119
that's roughly how many connections each

1475
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,359
neuron in your brain makes so it a

1476
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,000
neuron in your brain needs to send 10

1477
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,759
000 messages every time it has something

1478
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,119
to say you can't do that if you're

1479
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,359
trying to

1480
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,880
drive electrons from here to 10 000

1481
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,239
different places the brain does it in a

1482
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,480
slightly different way which we can

1483
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,959
discuss how can light achieve the 10 000

1484
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,679
connections and why is it um why is it

1485
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,519
better in terms of like the energy use

1486
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:14,879
uh required to use light for the

1487
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:16,400
communication of the ten thousand

1488
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,000
connections right right so now instead

1489
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,160
of trying to send electrons from me to

1490
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,719
you i'm trying to send photons so i can

1491
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:25,440
make what's called a guide which is just

1492
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:28,399
a simple piece of a material it could be

1493
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,039
glass like an optical fiber or silicon

1494
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,440
on a on a chip and i just have to i just

1495
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,519
have to inject photons into that

1496
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,000
waveguide and independent of how long it

1497
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:40,559
is independent of how many different

1498
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,960
connections i'm making it doesn't change

1499
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,040
the the voltage or anything like that

1500
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,920
that i have to raise up on the on the

1501
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:50,159
wire so if i have one more connection if

1502
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,920
i add additional connections i need to

1503
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:53,598
add more light to the waveguide because

1504
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,480
those photons need to split and go to

1505
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,480
different

1506
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,119
paths that makes sense but i don't have

1507
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,358
a capacitive penalty that sometimes

1508
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,440
these are called wiring parasitics there

1509
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:05,119
are no parasitics associated with light

1510
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,440
in that same sense so

1511
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,160
well just this might be a dumb question

1512
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,559
but

1513
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:13,039
how do i catch a photon on the other end

1514
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,960
uh what's is it material is it's with

1515
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:15,838
the polymer stuff you were talking about

1516
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,920
for the

1517
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,159
for a different application for

1518
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,079
photolithography like how do you catch

1519
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,078
photo there's a lot of ways to catch a

1520
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,880
photon it's not a dumb question it's a

1521
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:29,280
it's a deep and important question that

1522
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,280
basically defines a lot of the work that

1523
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,280
goes on in our group at nist

1524
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,680
one of my group leaders

1525
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,760
say woonam has built his career around

1526
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,279
these superconducting single photon

1527
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,520
detectors so

1528
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,519
if you're going to try to sort of reach

1529
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,199
a lower limit and detect just one

1530
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:46,880
particle of light

1531
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:48,480
superconductors come back into our

1532
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,318
conversation and

1533
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,838
just picture a simple device where you

1534
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:53,440
have current flowing through a

1535
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,558
superconducting wire

1536
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,079
and um a loop again or no

1537
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,760
let's say yes you have a loop so you

1538
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,760
have a superconducting wire that goes

1539
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,240
straight down like this and on on your

1540
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,920
loop branch you have a little ammeter

1541
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:07,919
something that measures current there's

1542
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,880
a resistor up there too

1543
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,240
go with me here so um

1544
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,280
your current biasing this so there's

1545
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:14,799
current flowing through that

1546
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,480
superconducting branch since there's a

1547
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,519
resistor over here

1548
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,599
all the current goes through the

1549
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:22,239
superconducting branch now a photon

1550
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,240
comes in strikes that superconductor

1551
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:26,000
we talked about this superconducting

1552
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,919
macroscopic quantum state that's going

1553
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,559
to be destroyed by the energy of that

1554
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,000
photon so now that branch of the circuit

1555
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,359
is resistive too

1556
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,039
and you've properly designed your

1557
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:37,358
circuit so that the resistance on that

1558
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,960
superconducting branch is much greater

1559
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:40,880
than the other resistance now all of

1560
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,800
your current's going to go that way your

1561
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,318
ammeter says oh i just got a pulse of

1562
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,240
current that must mean i detected a

1563
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:48,000
photon then where you broke that

1564
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:50,479
superconductivity in a matter of a few

1565
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,719
nanoseconds it cools back off dissipates

1566
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,480
that energy and the current flows back

1567
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:55,598
through that superconducting branch this

1568
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,760
is a

1569
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,559
very powerful

1570
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,319
superconducting device that allows us to

1571
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,599
understand quantum states of light i

1572
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:05,759
didn't realize

1573
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,559
a loop like that could be sensitive to a

1574
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:12,960
single photon i mean that um

1575
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:14,960
that seems strange to me because

1576
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,119
i mean so what happens when you just

1577
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,720
barrage it with photons if you put a

1578
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,559
bunch of photons in there essentially

1579
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,000
the same thing happens you just drive it

1580
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,119
into the normal state it becomes

1581
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,358
resistive

1582
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,358
and it's not particularly interesting so

1583
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:28,799
you have to be careful how many photons

1584
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:30,558
you send like you have to be very

1585
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,160
precise with your communication well it

1586
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,319
depends so i would say that that's

1587
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:37,039
actually in the in the application that

1588
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:39,199
we're trying to use these detectors for

1589
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,159
that's a feature because what we want is

1590
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:41,039
for

1591
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:42,879
uh

1592
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,920
if if a neuron

1593
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,039
sends one photon to a synaptic

1594
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,720
connection and one of these

1595
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:49,759
superconducting detectors is sitting

1596
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,598
there

1597
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,040
you get this pulse of current and that

1598
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,000
synapse says

1599
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,039
event

1600
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,239
then i'm going to do what i do when

1601
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,558
there's a synapse event i'm going to

1602
00:54:56,239 --> 00:55:00,719
perform computations that kind of thing

1603
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:03,359
but if accidentally you send two there

1604
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:06,639
or three or five it does the exact same

1605
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:08,639
got it and so that's this is this is how

1606
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:11,759
in the system that we're

1607
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,759
devising here communication is entirely

1608
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,680
binary and that's what i tried to

1609
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,920
emphasize a second ago communication

1610
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,279
should not change the information you're

1611
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,200
not saying

1612
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,960
oh i got this kind of communication

1613
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:24,798
event four photons no we're not keeping

1614
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,960
track of that this neuron fired this

1615
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:29,039
synapse says that neuron fired that's it

1616
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,079
so that's a that's a noise filtering

1617
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,159
property

1618
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,920
of those detectors however there are

1619
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,318
other applications where you'd rather

1620
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,240
know the exact number of photons that

1621
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:39,279
can be very useful in quantum computing

1622
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,479
with light

1623
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,079
and

1624
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,480
our group does a lot of work around

1625
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,200
another kind of superconducting sensor

1626
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,199
called a transition edge sensor that uh

1627
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,639
adrian alita in our group does a lot of

1628
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,919
work on that and

1629
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:56,239
that can tell you based on the amplitude

1630
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,240
of the current pulse you divert exactly

1631
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:00,239
how many photons

1632
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:02,798
were in that pulse

1633
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,719
so what's that useful for just one way

1634
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:06,639
that you can encode information in

1635
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,399
quantum states of light is in the number

1636
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,719
of photons you can have what are called

1637
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,960
number states and a number state will

1638
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:15,118
have a well-defined number of photons

1639
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,920
and maybe the output of your quantum

1640
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,680
computation encodes

1641
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,798
its information in the number of photons

1642
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:23,118
that are generated so if you have a

1643
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:26,159
detector that is sensitive to that it's

1644
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:27,920
extremely useful can you achieve

1645
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:30,239
like a clock

1646
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,200
with photons or is that not important is

1647
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:36,399
there a synchronicity here

1648
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:39,358
in general it can be important

1649
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,880
uh clock distribution is a big challenge

1650
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:43,199
in

1651
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,160
especially large computational systems

1652
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,919
and so yes optical clocks optical clock

1653
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:51,358
distribution

1654
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,960
is a is a very powerful technology i i

1655
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,480
don't know the state of that field right

1656
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,480
now but i imagine that if you're trying

1657
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,559
to distribute a clock across

1658
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,480
any appreciable size computational

1659
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,680
system you you want to use light yeah i

1660
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:07,280
wonder how these giant systems

1661
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:09,679
work especially like uh super computers

1662
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,559
do they need to do clock distribution or

1663
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:13,279
are they

1664
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,440
doing more ad hoc

1665
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,640
parallel like concurrent programming

1666
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,318
like there's some kind of locking

1667
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:20,239
mechanisms or something that's the

1668
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:23,199
fascinating question but the

1669
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:25,199
let's zoom in at this very particular

1670
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:26,798
question of

1671
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:29,919
computation

1672
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:31,519
on a processor and communication

1673
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,039
between processors

1674
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:34,400
so

1675
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:36,318
what does this

1676
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,318
system look like

1677
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:40,000
that you're envisioning

1678
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:41,838
one of the places you're envisioning it

1679
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,039
is in the paper on optoelectronic

1680
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:45,039
intelligence

1681
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:46,719
so what are we talking about are we

1682
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:48,960
talking about something that starts to

1683
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:51,358
look a lot like the human brain or does

1684
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,199
it still look a lot like a computer what

1685
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:55,199
are the size of this thing is it go

1686
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:57,358
inside a smartphone or as you said does

1687
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,480
it go inside something that's more like

1688
00:57:57,358 --> 00:57:59,679
a house

1689
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,599
like uh

1690
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:02,558
what should we be imagining what are you

1691
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,280
thinking about when you're thinking

1692
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,280
about these fundamental systems

1693
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,119
let me introduce the word neuromorphic

1694
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,160
there's this concept of neuromorphic

1695
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:14,720
computing where what that broadly refers

1696
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,639
to is um

1697
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:19,199
computing based on the information

1698
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:20,719
processing principles of the brain

1699
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:22,558
and as

1700
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,318
digital computing

1701
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,400
seems to be pushing towards some

1702
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:28,400
fundamental performance limits

1703
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,318
people are considering architectural

1704
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,639
advances drawing inspiration from the

1705
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,639
brain more distributed parallel network

1706
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,558
kind of architectures and stuff and so

1707
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:38,480
there's this continuum of

1708
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,920
neuromorphic from

1709
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,760
things that are

1710
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,798
pretty similar to digital computers but

1711
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:49,119
maybe there are more cores and the way

1712
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:50,880
they send messages is a little bit more

1713
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,440
like the way brain

1714
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:56,000
neurons send spikes but for the most

1715
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,079
part it's still digital electronics

1716
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,599
and then you know you have some things

1717
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,119
in between where maybe you're you're

1718
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,798
using

1719
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,640
transistors but now you're starting to

1720
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:07,039
use them instead of in a digital way in

1721
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:09,279
an analog way and so you're trying to

1722
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:12,000
get those circuits to behave more like

1723
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,680
neurons and then that's a little bit

1724
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,039
quite quite a bit more on the

1725
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:17,358
neuromorphic side of things you're

1726
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:19,199
trying to get your circuits although

1727
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:21,039
they're still based on silicon you're

1728
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:22,879
trying to get them to

1729
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,480
perform operations that are highly

1730
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,480
analogous to the operations in the brain

1731
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,920
and that's where a great deal of work is

1732
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,880
in neuromorphic computing people like

1733
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,119
yakimo and davari and gert kaunbergs

1734
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,119
jennifer hasler countless others it's

1735
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,680
it's a rich and exciting field

1736
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:40,720
uh going back to carver mead in the

1737
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:44,159
late 1980s and then all the way on the

1738
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:47,358
other extreme of the continuum

1739
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:50,000
is where you say i'll give up

1740
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,440
anything related to transistors or

1741
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,440
semiconductors or anything like that i'm

1742
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,039
not not starting with the assumption

1743
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,358
that i'm going to use any kind of

1744
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,798
conventional computing hardware and

1745
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:00,558
instead what i want to do is try and

1746
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:02,559
understand what makes the brain powerful

1747
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,880
at the kind of information processing it

1748
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,480
does and i want to think from first

1749
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,160
principles about

1750
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,199
what hardware

1751
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:13,039
is best going to enable us to

1752
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:15,838
capture those information processing

1753
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:18,000
principles in an artificial system

1754
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:19,519
and that's where i live that's where

1755
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,039
that's where i'm

1756
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:25,679
doing my exploration these days so uh

1757
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,719
what are the first principles

1758
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,919
of

1759
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:32,480
brain like computation communication

1760
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,400
right yeah this is this is so important

1761
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,318
and i'm glad we booked 14 hours for this

1762
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:40,639
because uh i only have 13 i'm sorry

1763
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:43,119
okay so the brain is notoriously

1764
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:45,118
complicated and i think that's a

1765
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,880
an important part of why it

1766
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,119
why it can do what it does but okay let

1767
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,400
me let me try to break it down

1768
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,798
uh starting with the devices

1769
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,480
neurons as i as i said before they're

1770
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:59,119
they're sophisticated devices in and of

1771
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,719
themselves and synapses are too they

1772
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,960
they can um

1773
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:05,039
change their state based on the activity

1774
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,119
so they they adapt over time that's

1775
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,440
crucial to the way the brain works they

1776
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:11,280
don't just adapt on one time scale they

1777
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,440
can adapt on

1778
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,079
myriad time scales from

1779
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,159
the the spacing between pulses the

1780
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,640
spacing between spikes that come from

1781
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:21,759
neurons all the way to the age of the

1782
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:23,039
organism

1783
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,240
um

1784
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:28,239
also relevant perhaps

1785
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:30,558
i think the most important thing that's

1786
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:32,239
guided my thinking is the the network

1787
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,720
structure

1788
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,558
of the brain so which can also be

1789
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:38,480
adjusted yeah in different scales

1790
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,079
absolutely yes so so you're you're

1791
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,559
making new con you're changing the

1792
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,079
strength of contacts you're changing the

1793
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,599
the spatial distribution of them

1794
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,798
although spatial distribution doesn't

1795
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:51,359
change that much once you're a mature

1796
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:52,880
organism but that network structure is

1797
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:55,759
is really crucial

1798
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,039
so let me dwell on that for a second

1799
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,400
um

1800
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:01,039
you can't talk about the brain without

1801
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,519
emphasizing that most of the neurons in

1802
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,960
the the neocortex or the prefrontal

1803
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,960
cortex the part of the brain that we

1804
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,480
think is most responsible for

1805
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,720
high-level reasoning and things like

1806
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,639
that those neurons make thousands of

1807
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:15,519
connections so you have this network

1808
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:16,879
that is highly interconnected

1809
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:18,798
and

1810
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,200
i think it's safe to say that one of the

1811
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:24,480
primary reasons that they make so many

1812
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:26,239
different connections is that allows

1813
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,480
information to be communicated very

1814
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:31,199
rapidly from any spot in the network to

1815
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,838
any other spot in the network so that's

1816
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:37,838
a that's a sort of spatial aspect of it

1817
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:39,838
you can quantify this in terms of

1818
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:41,920
concepts that are related to fractals

1819
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:44,239
and scale invariants which i think is is

1820
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,720
a very beautiful concept so

1821
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:49,118
what i mean by that is kind of no matter

1822
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:50,639
what spatial scale you're looking at in

1823
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,519
the brain

1824
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:56,078
within certain bounds you see the same

1825
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:59,599
general statistical pattern so if i draw

1826
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:01,280
a box around some region of my cortex

1827
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:03,200
most of the connections

1828
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,798
that those neurons within that box make

1829
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:06,239
are going to be within the box to each

1830
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:08,400
other in their local neighborhood and

1831
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:10,798
that's sort of called clustering loosely

1832
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,639
speaking but a non-negligible fraction

1833
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:14,480
is going to go outside of that box and

1834
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,639
then if i draw a bigger box the pattern

1835
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,358
is going to be exactly the same so you

1836
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:21,759
have the scale and variance and you also

1837
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:24,000
have a a non-vanishing

1838
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,480
probability of a neuron making

1839
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,920
connection very far away so

1840
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,000
suppose you you want to plot the

1841
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,480
probability of a neuron making a

1842
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,159
connection as a function of distance if

1843
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,000
that were an exponential function it

1844
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:38,558
would go e to the minus

1845
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,480
radius over some characteristic radius

1846
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,839
and it would it would drop off

1847
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,280
up to some certain radius the

1848
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:45,519
probability would be

1849
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:49,039
reasonable close to one and then a

1850
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:51,280
beyond that characteristic length r0

1851
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:53,119
it would it would drop off sharply and

1852
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:55,440
so that would mean that the neurons in

1853
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,358
your brain are really

1854
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,039
localized and

1855
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:00,719
that's not what we observe in instead

1856
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,720
what you see is that the probability of

1857
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:05,038
making a longer distance connection it

1858
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:06,879
does drop off but it drops off as a

1859
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,720
power law so the probability that you're

1860
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:12,400
going to have a connection at some

1861
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:14,959
radius r goes as r to the minus some

1862
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,280
power and that's more that's what we see

1863
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,880
with with forces in nature like the

1864
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,400
electromagnetic force between two

1865
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,039
particles or gravity

1866
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,798
goes as one over the radius squared so

1867
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,599
you can see this in fractals i love that

1868
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:28,480
there's a like a fractal dynamics to the

1869
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,280
brain

1870
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,838
that

1871
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,880
if you zoom out you draw the box and you

1872
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:36,719
increase that box by certain step sizes

1873
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,039
you're gonna see the same statistics i

1874
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:40,639
think that's probably

1875
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,640
very important to the way the brain

1876
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:44,239
processes information it's not just in

1877
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:46,798
the spatial domain it's also in the

1878
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,558
temporal domain and what i mean by that

1879
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:50,480
is

1880
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,480
that's incredible that this emerged

1881
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:55,519
through the evolutionary process that

1882
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:58,240
potentially somehow connected to the way

1883
01:04:55,519 --> 01:05:00,000
the physics of the universe works yeah i

1884
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:02,078
i couldn't agree more that it's it's a

1885
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,679
deep and fascinating subject that i i

1886
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:05,760
hope to be able to spend my life

1887
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:08,399
studying you think you need to solve

1888
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,079
understand this this fractal nature in

1889
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,318
order to understand intelligence and

1890
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,160
company i do think so i think they're

1891
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:15,440
deeply intertwined yes i think power

1892
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,239
laws are

1893
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,000
right at the heart of it so just to just

1894
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,838
to push that one through the same thing

1895
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,440
happens in the temporal domain so

1896
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:24,318
suppose you had

1897
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,079
um

1898
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:28,159
suppose your neurons in your brain were

1899
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:30,640
always oscillating at the same frequency

1900
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:32,399
then the probability of finding a neuron

1901
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:34,480
oscillating as a function of frequency

1902
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,920
would be this narrowly peaked function

1903
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,760
around that certain characteristic

1904
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,599
frequency that's not at all what we see

1905
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,280
the probability of finding neurons

1906
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,280
oscillating or

1907
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,359
pulsing producing spikes at a certain

1908
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,440
frequency is again a power law which

1909
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:50,400
means there's no

1910
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,000
there's no defined scale of the temporal

1911
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,639
activity in the brain

1912
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,159
it's you don't what at what

1913
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:57,759
speed do your thoughts occur well

1914
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:59,679
there's a there's a fastest speed that

1915
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,240
can occur and that is limited by

1916
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:04,078
communication and other other things but

1917
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:06,879
there's not a characteristic scale we

1918
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,680
have thoughts on all temporal scales

1919
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,280
from you know a few

1920
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:13,279
tens of milliseconds which is

1921
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,640
physiologically limited by our devices

1922
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,160
compare that to

1923
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:17,838
tens of picoseconds that i talked about

1924
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:19,920
in superconductors all the way up to the

1925
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:21,440
lifetime of the organism you can still

1926
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,960
think about things that happened to you

1927
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,200
when you were a kid well if you want to

1928
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,720
be really trippy then across multiple

1929
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:28,480
organisms in the entirety of human

1930
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:30,798
civilization you have thoughts that span

1931
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,039
organisms right yes taking it to that

1932
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:34,719
level if you're willing to see the

1933
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,240
entirety of the human species as a

1934
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:38,480
single organism with the collective

1935
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,399
intelligence and that too on a spatial

1936
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,480
and temporal scale there's thoughts

1937
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,960
occurring and then if you look at not

1938
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,400
just the human species but the entirety

1939
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,720
of life on earth

1940
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,559
is as an organism with thoughts that

1941
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:51,838
occurring that are greater and greater

1942
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:53,599
sophisticated thoughts there's a

1943
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:54,639
different spatial and temporal skill

1944
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:57,440
there

1945
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,960
this is getting very suspicious

1946
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,519
hold on though before we're done i just

1947
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,480
want to just tie the bow yes and say

1948
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:04,559
that the

1949
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,400
the spatial and temporal aspects are

1950
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,280
intimately interrelated with each other

1951
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,039
so activity between neurons that are

1952
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,519
very close to each other is more likely

1953
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,280
to happen on this this faster time scale

1954
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:17,838
and information is going to propagate

1955
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,920
and encompass more of the brain more of

1956
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:22,239
your cortices different modules in the

1957
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,880
brain are going to be engaged in

1958
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,479
information processing on longer time

1959
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,798
scales so there's this concept of

1960
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:31,920
information integration where

1961
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:33,440
most neurons are neurons are specialized

1962
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,838
any given neuron or any cluster of

1963
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,599
neuron has its specific purpose but

1964
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:38,798
they're also

1965
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,640
they're also

1966
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:42,559
very much integrated so you you have

1967
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:45,038
neurons that specialize but share their

1968
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,599
information and so that happens through

1969
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,440
these fractal nested oscillations that

1970
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:52,318
occur across spatial and temporal scales

1971
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,599
i think capturing those dynamics in

1972
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,159
hardware

1973
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,798
to me that's the goal of of neuromorphic

1974
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,960
computing so does it need to look so

1975
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:03,920
first of all that's fascinating we

1976
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,798
stated some clear principles here

1977
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,798
now does it have to

1978
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:10,400
look like the brain outside of those

1979
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:12,079
principles as well like what other

1980
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,039
characteristics have to look like the

1981
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:16,798
human brain or can it be something very

1982
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,520
different well it depends on what you're

1983
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:21,679
trying to use it for and so i i think a

1984
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,279
lot of the community

1985
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,359
asks that question a lot what are you

1986
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,040
going to do with it and

1987
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,880
i i completely get it i think that's a

1988
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:31,838
very important question and it's also

1989
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,279
sometimes not the most helpful question

1990
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:35,119
what if what you want to do with it is

1991
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,719
study it what if you just want to see

1992
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:38,399
um

1993
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,239
what does it what do you have to build

1994
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:42,238
into your hardware in order to observe

1995
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:43,119
these dynamical principles

1996
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,238
so

1997
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,399
and also

1998
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:48,399
i ask sometimes i ask myself that

1999
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:50,318
question every day and i'm not sure i'm

2000
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:51,519
able to answer that it's like what are

2001
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,600
you what are you gonna do with this

2002
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,279
particular neuromorphic machine so

2003
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,120
suppose what we're trying to do with it

2004
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:59,440
is build something that thinks we're not

2005
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,278
trying to get it to make us any money or

2006
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,198
drive a car maybe we'll be able to do

2007
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,000
that but that's not our goal our goal is

2008
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:06,719
to

2009
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,560
see if we can get the same types of

2010
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:10,399
behaviors that we observe in our own

2011
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,520
brain and by behaviors in this sense

2012
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:13,599
what i mean

2013
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,359
the behaviors of the

2014
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,880
components the neurons the network that

2015
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,440
kind of stuff i think there's another

2016
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,039
element that i didn't really hit on that

2017
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,798
that you also have to build into this

2018
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:24,238
and those are architectural principles

2019
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:26,880
they have to do with the

2020
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:29,119
hierarchical modular construction of the

2021
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,159
network and without getting too lost in

2022
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:32,880
jargon

2023
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:34,559
the the main point that i think is

2024
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,880
relevant there let me try and illustrate

2025
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,560
it with a cartoon picture of

2026
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,239
the architecture of the brain so in the

2027
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,880
brain you have the

2028
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:45,919
the cortex which is sort of this outer

2029
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,520
sheet um it's actually a you can it's a

2030
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,119
layered structure you can if you could

2031
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,120
take it out of your brain you could

2032
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:53,039
unroll it on the table and it would be

2033
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:54,479
about the size of a of a pizza sitting

2034
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:56,238
there

2035
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,238
and um

2036
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:01,359
that's a module it it does certain

2037
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:03,198
things it it processes as yorgi buzaki

2038
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:04,719
would say it processes the what of of

2039
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:07,198
what's going on around you but you have

2040
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:08,880
another really crucial module that's

2041
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:10,639
called the hippocampus

2042
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,000
and that that network is structured

2043
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,000
entirely differently first of all this

2044
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,238
this cortex that had described 10

2045
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,840
billion neurons in there so numbers

2046
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:19,519
matter here

2047
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,520
and they're they're organized in that

2048
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,440
sort of power law distribution where the

2049
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,199
probability of making a connection drops

2050
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:27,119
off as a power law in space the

2051
01:10:25,198 --> 01:10:28,639
hippocampus is another module that's

2052
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:30,399
important for

2053
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,679
understanding how

2054
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:34,000
where you are

2055
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:36,880
when you are um

2056
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,880
keeping track of of your your position

2057
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,800
in space and time and that network is

2058
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,640
very much random so the probability of

2059
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,560
making a connection

2060
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,000
it it almost doesn't even drop off as a

2061
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,600
function of distance it's the same

2062
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,238
probability that you'll make it here to

2063
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,560
over there but there are only about 100

2064
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:55,039
million neurons there so you can have

2065
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,840
that huge densely connected module

2066
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:57,679
because

2067
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:01,360
it's not so big

2068
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:03,920
and the neocortex or the cortex and the

2069
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:05,279
hippocampus they talk to each other

2070
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,600
constantly

2071
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:09,359
and that communication is largely

2072
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,280
facilitated by what's called the

2073
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:13,359
thalamus i'm not a neuroscientist here

2074
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:15,119
i'm trying to do my best to recite this

2075
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:16,238
cartoon picture of the brain i gotcha

2076
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:19,039
yeah something like that so this

2077
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:20,319
thalamus is is coordinating the activity

2078
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,960
between the neocortex and the

2079
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:24,399
hippocampus and making sure that they

2080
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,920
they talk to each other at the right

2081
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:28,238
time and send messages that would be

2082
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,719
useful to one another so this all taken

2083
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:32,000
together is called the thalamocortical

2084
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,560
complex

2085
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,039
and it seems like building something

2086
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,719
like that is going to be crucial to

2087
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:40,479
capturing the

2088
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,920
types of activity we're looking for

2089
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:44,079
because

2090
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,760
though those responsibilities those

2091
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,719
separate modules they do different

2092
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,000
things that's got to be central to

2093
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,679
um

2094
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,279
achieving these

2095
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:56,079
states of efficient information

2096
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:57,439
integration across space and time

2097
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:59,600
by the way

2098
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:02,158
i am able to achieve this state by

2099
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,880
watching uh simulations visualizations

2100
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:06,960
of the thelma cortical complex there's a

2101
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,199
few people i forget from where they've

2102
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,279
created these incredible visual

2103
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:14,079
illustrations of like

2104
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:16,000
visual stimulation from the eye or

2105
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:18,880
something like that it this in this

2106
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,640
image like flowing through the brain wow

2107
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,480
i haven't seen that i gotta check that

2108
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,159
out so it's one of those things you you

2109
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:25,839
find this stuff in the world

2110
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:28,319
and you see like on youtube it has like

2111
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,719
1000 views these like

2112
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:33,439
these visualizations of the human brain

2113
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,279
processing information and like

2114
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:37,599
because there's uh there's chemistry

2115
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,279
there like because this is act from

2116
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,039
actual human brains i don't know how

2117
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:42,800
they're doing the coloring but they're

2118
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:45,439
able to actually trace

2119
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,880
the uh like different the the chemical

2120
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:49,678
and the electrical signals throughout

2121
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,359
the brain and the visual thing it's like

2122
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,359
whoa because it looks kind of like the

2123
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:55,359
universe i mean the whole thing is just

2124
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:56,880
incred i recommend it highly i'll

2125
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:58,639
probably post a link to it but you can

2126
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,679
just look for uh

2127
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,520
um

2128
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:02,399
one of the things they simulate is the

2129
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,040
uh

2130
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:06,879
thelma cortical uh complex and just

2131
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:09,439
visualization you can find that yourself

2132
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:12,640
on youtube but it's it's beautiful um

2133
01:13:09,439 --> 01:13:14,399
the other question i have for you is um

2134
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,320
how does memory play into all of this

2135
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,158
because all the signals sending back and

2136
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,599
forth that's kind of like uh that's

2137
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:21,439
computation

2138
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,400
and communication but that's kind of

2139
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:24,479
like

2140
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:26,960
uh you know processing of

2141
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:28,399
inputs and outputs uh to produce outputs

2142
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,760
in the system that's kind of like maybe

2143
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:30,879
reasoning maybe there's some kind of

2144
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,039
recurrence

2145
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,560
but like is there a storage mechanism

2146
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,560
that you think about in the context of

2147
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,159
neuromorphic computing yeah absolutely

2148
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,239
so that's got to be central you have to

2149
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:42,238
have a way that you can

2150
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:44,079
store memories and

2151
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:46,639
there are a lot of different kinds of

2152
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:48,238
memory in the brain that's

2153
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,640
yet another example of how it's it's not

2154
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:53,439
a simple system so

2155
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,360
there's one kind of memory one way of

2156
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:58,000
talking about memory

2157
01:13:55,359 --> 01:14:00,238
uh usually starts in the context of

2158
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,039
hopfield networks you were lucky to talk

2159
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:05,359
to john hopfield on this program but the

2160
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:07,198
the basic idea there is uh working

2161
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:11,119
memory is stored in the dynamical

2162
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:13,519
patterns of activity between neurons and

2163
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:16,000
you can you can think of a certain

2164
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,080
pattern of activity as an attractor

2165
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,039
meaning if you put in

2166
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:22,399
some

2167
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:25,840
signal that's similar enough to other

2168
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:27,599
previously experienced signals

2169
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,760
like that then you're going to converge

2170
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,719
to the same network dynamics and you

2171
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,520
will see

2172
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,520
these neurons

2173
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,520
participate in the same network patterns

2174
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,679
of activity that they have in the past

2175
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,400
so you can talk about the probability

2176
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:41,920
that

2177
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:43,519
different inputs will allow you to

2178
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,760
converge to different basins of

2179
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,960
attraction and you might think of that

2180
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:51,440
as oh i saw this face and then i excited

2181
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,920
this network pattern of activity because

2182
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,319
last time i saw that face i was at you

2183
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,679
know what some movie and that that's a

2184
01:14:56,319 --> 01:14:59,599
famous person on the screen or something

2185
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:02,239
like that so so that's one memory

2186
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,480
storage mechanism but crucial to

2187
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:08,079
the ability to imprint those memories in

2188
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:10,399
your brain is the ability to change the

2189
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:12,158
strength of connection between one

2190
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:14,238
neuron and another that synaptic

2191
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:17,279
connection between them so synaptic

2192
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:19,039
weight update is a massive field of

2193
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:20,880
neuroscience and neuromorphic computing

2194
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:22,000
as well so

2195
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,039
there are

2196
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,960
two

2197
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:27,519
poles to that

2198
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,960
on that spectrum one in okay so in more

2199
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,320
in the language of machine learning we

2200
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,920
would talk about supervised and

2201
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:34,000
unsupervised learning

2202
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,319
in when i'm trying to tie that down to

2203
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,640
neuromorphic computing i will use a

2204
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:40,719
definition of supervised learning which

2205
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,400
basically means

2206
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,239
the external

2207
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:45,519
user the person who's controlling this

2208
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:47,759
hardware

2209
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,000
has some knob that they can

2210
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,760
tune to change each of the synaptic

2211
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,520
weights depending on whether or not the

2212
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,000
network's doing what you want it to do

2213
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,320
whereas what i mean in this conversation

2214
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,800
when i say unsupervised learning is that

2215
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:03,119
those synaptic weights are are

2216
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,960
dynamically changing in your network

2217
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:06,640
based on nothing that the user is doing

2218
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,039
nothing that there's no wire from the

2219
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,119
outside going into any of those synapses

2220
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:13,679
the network itself is reconfiguring

2221
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:15,119
those synaptic weights based on

2222
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,960
physical

2223
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:19,840
properties that you've built into the

2224
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,359
devices so if if the synapse receives a

2225
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:23,520
pulse from here

2226
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:26,639
and that causes the neuron to spike

2227
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,719
some circuit built in there with no help

2228
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,880
from me or anybody else adjusts the

2229
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:33,119
weight in a way that makes it more

2230
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,880
likely to

2231
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:36,960
store the useful information and excite

2232
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,319
the useful network patterns and makes it

2233
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:42,560
less likely that random noise useless

2234
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:44,960
communication events will have an

2235
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,960
important uh effect on the network

2236
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,679
activity so there's memory encoded in

2237
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,760
the weights uh the synaptic weights yeah

2238
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,279
what about the formation of something

2239
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,360
that's not often done in machine

2240
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:57,759
learning the formation of new synaptic

2241
01:16:55,359 --> 01:17:00,479
connections right well that seems to so

2242
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:02,079
again not not a neuroscientist here but

2243
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,479
my reading of the literature is that

2244
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:06,719
that's particularly crucial in early

2245
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:08,639
stages of brain development where a

2246
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:11,039
newborn is uh

2247
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:13,280
born with tons of extra synaptic

2248
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:15,840
connections and it's actually pruned

2249
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:18,319
over time so the number of synapses

2250
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:20,560
decreases as opposed to growing new

2251
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:23,119
long-distance connections it is possible

2252
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,000
in the brain to grow new neurons and

2253
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:26,319
um

2254
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,479
assign new synaptic connections

2255
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:31,759
but it doesn't seem to be the primary

2256
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:34,238
mechanism by which the brain is learning

2257
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,159
so for example like right now

2258
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:38,079
sitting here talking to you you say lots

2259
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:40,399
of interesting things and i learn what i

2260
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:43,039
learn from you and i can remember things

2261
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:45,839
that you just said and i didn't grow new

2262
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,719
axonal connections down to new synapses

2263
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:51,199
to to enable those it's

2264
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,880
plasticity mechanisms in the between the

2265
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:54,479
synaptic connections between neurons

2266
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,960
that enable me to

2267
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:58,559
learn on that time scale so at the very

2268
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,800
least that you can sufficiently

2269
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,159
approximate that with just weight

2270
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,000
updates you don't need to form new

2271
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:05,519
connections i would say weight updates

2272
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,679
are a big part of it i also think

2273
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,040
there's more because

2274
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:11,279
broadly speaking when we're doing

2275
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:12,880
machine learning our networks say we're

2276
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:14,079
talking about feed forward deep neural

2277
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,640
networks

2278
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,079
the temporal domain is not really part

2279
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:18,960
of it okay you're gonna put in an image

2280
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:20,960
and you're gonna get out of

2281
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,719
classification and you're gonna do that

2282
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:25,359
as fast as possible so you care about

2283
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:26,880
time but time is not part of the essence

2284
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:29,920
of this thing really

2285
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:31,679
um whereas in spiking neural networks

2286
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,520
what we see in the brain

2287
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,119
time is as crucial as space and they're

2288
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,920
intimately intertwined as i've tried to

2289
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:38,800
say

2290
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:41,920
and so adaptation on

2291
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:44,000
on different time scales is important

2292
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,520
not not just in memory for formation

2293
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,399
although it plays a key role there but

2294
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:51,199
also in just keeping the activity in a

2295
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:53,279
useful dynamic range so you have other

2296
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:56,079
plasticity mechanisms not just weight

2297
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:58,800
update or at least not on the

2298
01:18:56,079 --> 01:19:00,719
time scale of many action potentials but

2299
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,159
even on the shorter time scale so a

2300
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:05,039
synapse can

2301
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:07,519
become much less efficacious it can it

2302
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:10,158
can transmit a weaker signal after the

2303
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:12,000
second third fourth that can

2304
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:13,679
second third fourth action potential to

2305
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,920
occur in a sequence so that's what's

2306
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:17,679
called short-term synaptic plasticity

2307
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,960
which is a form of learning you're

2308
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,800
learning that i'm getting too much

2309
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,800
stimulus from looking at something

2310
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,880
bright right now so i need to tone that

2311
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,279
down you know

2312
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,359
there's also another really important

2313
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:32,079
mechanism in learning it's called

2314
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:33,039
metaplasticity what that seems to be is

2315
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:36,479
a

2316
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:39,119
a way that you change not the weights

2317
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:41,198
themselves but the rate at which the

2318
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:42,960
weights change so

2319
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:45,519
when i am in

2320
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,800
say a lecture hall and my

2321
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,400
this is a

2322
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,800
potentially terrible cartoon example but

2323
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:52,879
let's say i'm in a lecture hall and uh

2324
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,360
it's time to learn right so my brain

2325
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,239
will release more perhaps dopamine or

2326
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:59,198
some

2327
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:01,119
neuromodulator that's going to change

2328
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:03,039
the the rate at which synaptic

2329
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:04,640
plasticity occurs so that can make me

2330
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:06,800
more sensitive to learning at certain

2331
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:09,199
times more sensitive to overwriting

2332
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,360
previous information and less sensitive

2333
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:13,519
at other times and finally as long as

2334
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:15,839
i'm rattling off the list i think

2335
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,320
another concept that falls in the

2336
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:21,679
category of learning or memory

2337
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:23,279
adaptation is homeostasis or homeostatic

2338
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:26,319
adaptation where

2339
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:28,559
neurons have the ability to

2340
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:30,799
control their firing rate so if if one

2341
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,960
neuron is just like blasting way too

2342
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,520
much it will naturally tone itself down

2343
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,760
it's its threshold will adjust

2344
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,679
so that it's it stays in a useful

2345
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,199
dynamical range and we see that that's

2346
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,560
that's captured in in deep neural

2347
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:44,079
networks where you don't just change the

2348
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,639
synaptic weights but you can also move

2349
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:49,198
the thresholds of simple neurons in

2350
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:50,400
those models and so to uh

2351
01:20:49,198 --> 01:20:51,198
to achieve

2352
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,679
this

2353
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:55,919
spiking neural networks

2354
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,158
you want to use

2355
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,158
like

2356
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:02,719
you want to implement the first

2357
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:05,039
principles that you mentioned of the

2358
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:07,920
temporal and the spatial

2359
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:11,519
fractal dynamics here so you can you can

2360
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:13,920
communicate locally you can communicate

2361
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,199
across much greater distances and do the

2362
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:18,000
same thing

2363
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:18,799
in space and do the same thing in time

2364
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,960
now

2365
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,560
you have like a chapter called

2366
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,119
superconducting hardware for

2367
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,960
neuromorphic computing so what are some

2368
01:21:25,119 --> 01:21:28,238
ideas

2369
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,760
that integrates some of the things we've

2370
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:32,079
been talking about in terms of the first

2371
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:35,920
principles of neuromorphic computing

2372
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:38,000
and the ideas that you outline in uh

2373
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,960
optoelectronic intelligence

2374
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,119
yeah

2375
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,639
so let me start i guess on the

2376
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:44,158
communication side of things because

2377
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,639
that's

2378
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:48,879
what led us down this track in the first

2379
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:51,840
place by us i'm talking about

2380
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:54,319
my my team of colleagues at nist

2381
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,560
you know saeed han bryce primavera sonia

2382
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:58,960
buckley jeff chiles adam mcconnel to

2383
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,600
name alex tate name a few our group

2384
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:03,439
leaders cew nam and rich mirin we've all

2385
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,199
contributed to this so this is not this

2386
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:06,879
is not me saying

2387
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:08,559
necessarily just the things that that

2388
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,719
i've proposed but sort of where our

2389
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:14,639
team's thinking has evolved over the

2390
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:16,719
years can i can quickly ask what is nist

2391
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:19,279
and where is this amazing group of

2392
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:21,600
people located nist is the national

2393
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:23,198
institute of standards and technology

2394
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,039
the

2395
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:27,359
the the larger facility is out in

2396
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:30,158
gaithersburg maryland our team is

2397
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,359
located in boulder colorado

2398
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:33,519
um

2399
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:35,439
we nist is a is a

2400
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:38,719
federal agency under the department of

2401
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:40,960
commerce we do a lot with by we i mean

2402
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:43,679
other people at nist would do a lot with

2403
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,880
standards you know um

2404
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:47,039
making sure that we understand the

2405
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,440
system of units international system of

2406
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:51,039
units uh precision measurements there's

2407
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:54,000
a lot going on in

2408
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:56,158
uh electrical engineering material

2409
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,760
science and it's historic i mean i mean

2410
01:22:56,158 --> 01:22:59,359
it's like it's one of those it's like

2411
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,280
mit or something like that it has a

2412
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:03,599
reputation over many decades of just

2413
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:05,279
being this really um

2414
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,400
a place where there's a lot of brilliant

2415
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:08,158
people have done

2416
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:10,559
a lot of amazing things but in terms of

2417
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:12,799
the people in your team

2418
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,880
in this team of people involved in the

2419
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,560
concept we're talking about now i'm just

2420
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,319
curious what kind of disciplines are we

2421
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,400
talking about what is it mostly

2422
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:22,960
physicists and electrical engineers some

2423
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:24,719
material scientists

2424
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,639
but i would say

2425
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:29,359
yeah i think physicists and electrical

2426
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:32,480
engineers my background is in photonics

2427
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:35,119
the use of light for technology so

2428
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:37,439
coming from there i i tend to

2429
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:39,119
have found colleagues that are more from

2430
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:41,198
that background although

2431
01:23:39,119 --> 01:23:43,198
uh adam akan more of a superconducting

2432
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:45,359
electronics background we need a

2433
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:47,599
diversity of folks this project is sort

2434
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,759
of cross-disciplinary i would love to be

2435
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,840
working more with neuroscientists and

2436
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,600
things um but

2437
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,880
we haven't we haven't reached that scale

2438
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,320
yet but yeah

2439
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,239
you're focused on the hardware side

2440
01:23:56,319 --> 01:23:59,679
which requires all the disciplines that

2441
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:01,198
you mentioned yes and then of course

2442
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,440
neuroscience may be a source of

2443
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:04,879
inspiration for some of the the the

2444
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:07,119
long-term vision i would actually call

2445
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,600
it more than inspiration i would call it

2446
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:11,279
sort of um

2447
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,320
a road map you know

2448
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:16,719
we're not trying to to build exactly the

2449
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:18,880
brain but i don't think it's enough to

2450
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:21,039
just say oh neurons kind of work like

2451
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,880
that let's kind of do that thing i mean

2452
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:25,359
we're

2453
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,199
very much following the concepts that

2454
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:29,359
the cognitive sciences have laid out for

2455
01:24:27,198 --> 01:24:31,198
us which i believe is is a

2456
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:33,839
really robust road map i mean just on a

2457
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:35,678
little bit of a tangent it's often

2458
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,039
stated that we just don't understand the

2459
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,279
brain and so it's really hard to

2460
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:40,319
replicate it because we just don't know

2461
01:24:39,279 --> 01:24:42,319
what's going on

2462
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:44,238
and i maybe

2463
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:45,519
five or seven years ago i would have

2464
01:24:44,238 --> 01:24:47,839
said that but

2465
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,000
as i got more interested in the subject

2466
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,159
i had read more of the neuroscience

2467
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,479
literature and i was just taken by the

2468
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:56,079
exact opposite sense i can't believe how

2469
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:57,519
much they know about this i can't

2470
01:24:56,079 --> 01:25:01,279
believe how

2471
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:03,520
mathematically rigorous and um sort of

2472
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:05,439
theoretically complete a lot of the

2473
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,800
concepts are that's not to say we

2474
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:08,238
understand consciousness or we

2475
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,400
understand the self or anything like

2476
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:12,238
that but why is the brain what is the

2477
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:14,479
brain doing and why is it doing those

2478
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:16,000
things we have a neuroscientists have a

2479
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:17,359
lot of answers to those questions so

2480
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,439
there's a lot if you're a hardware

2481
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,439
designer that just wants to get going

2482
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:22,879
whoa it's pretty clear which direction

2483
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:25,119
to go in i think

2484
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,679
okay uh so

2485
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:30,158
i love i love the the optimism behind

2486
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,639
that but um in the implementation of

2487
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:35,198
these systems

2488
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,960
that uh uses supercontext super

2489
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:39,359
connectivity

2490
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:41,920
how do you make it happen

2491
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:44,238
so to me it starts with thinking about

2492
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,920
the communication network you know for

2493
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:47,599
sure that

2494
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:50,000
the ability of each neuron to

2495
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,360
communicate to many thousands of

2496
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,679
colleagues across the network is

2497
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:55,198
indispensable i take that as a core

2498
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:56,880
principle of my

2499
01:25:55,198 --> 01:25:58,399
my architecture my thinking on the

2500
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,840
subject

2501
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:02,319
so coming from

2502
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,920
coming from a background in photonics it

2503
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:05,840
was very natural to say okay we're going

2504
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:08,719
to use light for communication just in

2505
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:10,800
case listeners may not know

2506
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,319
light is often used in communication i

2507
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,920
mean if you think about radio that's

2508
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:16,000
light it's long wavelengths but it's

2509
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,600
electromagnetic radiation it's the same

2510
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,279
it's the same physical phenomenon

2511
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:23,039
obeying exactly the same maxwell's

2512
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:25,679
equations and then all the way down to

2513
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:27,439
uh fiber fiber optics now you're using

2514
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:29,279
visible or near-infrared wavelengths of

2515
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:31,919
light but the way you send messages

2516
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:34,479
across the ocean is now contemporary

2517
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,399
over optical fibers so using light for

2518
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:39,039
communication is

2519
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:41,198
not a stretch it makes perfect sense so

2520
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:42,639
you might ask well why don't you use

2521
01:26:41,198 --> 01:26:44,000
light for communication in a

2522
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:46,639
conventional

2523
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,679
microchip and the answer to that is i

2524
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:50,480
believe

2525
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:53,039
physical it's v we

2526
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:56,000
a light source on a silicon chip

2527
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:57,679
that was as simple as a transistor

2528
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,039
we would there would not be a processor

2529
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:01,119
in the world that didn't use light for

2530
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:03,198
communication at least above some

2531
01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:05,279
distance how many light sources are

2532
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:07,599
needed oh you need a light source at

2533
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:11,359
every single point a light source per

2534
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:13,120
neuron per neuron per per liter but then

2535
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:15,279
if you could have a really small and

2536
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:16,840
nice light source you can

2537
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:19,759
your definition of neuron could be

2538
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,679
flexible could be yes yes sometimes it's

2539
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,480
helpful to me to say

2540
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:27,279
in this hardware a neuron is that entity

2541
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:29,198
which has a light source that

2542
01:27:27,279 --> 01:27:30,639
and i i can and then there was light

2543
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:33,599
yeah i mean i can explain more about

2544
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:35,920
that but um somehow this like rhymes

2545
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,360
with consciousness because the the

2546
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,840
people will often say the light of

2547
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:43,519
consciousness so that consciousness is

2548
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:45,600
that which is conscious i got it

2549
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,560
that's not my quote that's me that's my

2550
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,880
quote

2551
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:51,920
uh you see that quote comes from my

2552
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:55,199
background yours is in optics mine in

2553
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,199
light mine is in darkness

2554
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:58,719
so go ahead

2555
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,520
so what the point i was making there is

2556
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:02,399
that

2557
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:04,480
if it was easy to manufacture light

2558
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:06,799
sources along with transistors on a

2559
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:08,959
silicon chip they would be everywhere

2560
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,320
yeah and it's not easy it's there people

2561
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,399
have been trying for decades and it's

2562
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,238
actually extremely difficult i think an

2563
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:16,638
important part of our research is is

2564
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:19,519
dwelling right at that at that spot

2565
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:22,560
there so is it physics or engineering

2566
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:24,480
so okay so it's it's physics i think so

2567
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,960
and what i mean by that is

2568
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:28,638
as as we discussed

2569
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,520
silicon is the material of choice for

2570
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:33,520
transistors and it it's

2571
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:36,639
very difficult to imagine that that's

2572
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:39,120
going to change anytime soon silicon is

2573
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:41,119
notoriously bad at emitting light and

2574
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:43,760
that has to do with

2575
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:46,399
the immutable properties of silicon

2576
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,800
itself the way that the energy bands are

2577
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:50,960
structured in silicon you're never going

2578
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,440
to make silicon efficient as a light

2579
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:56,319
source at room temperature

2580
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:58,238
without doing very exotic things that

2581
01:28:56,319 --> 01:28:59,519
degrade its ability to interface nicely

2582
01:28:58,238 --> 01:29:00,479
with those transistors in the first

2583
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,920
place so

2584
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:04,559
that's that's like one of these things

2585
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:06,319
where it's why why is nature dealing us

2586
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,920
that blow you give us these beautiful

2587
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:09,119
transistors and you give us all the

2588
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,800
motivation to use light for

2589
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:13,039
communication but then you don't give us

2590
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,480
a light source so well okay you do give

2591
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:16,158
us a light source compound

2592
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:17,759
semiconductors like we talked about back

2593
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:19,519
at the beginning an element from group

2594
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,280
three and an element from group five

2595
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,920
from an alloy where every other lattice

2596
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:25,599
site switches which element it is those

2597
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,199
have much better properties for

2598
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:30,000
generating light

2599
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:32,479
you put electrons in light comes out

2600
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
almost 100 percent of the the electron

2601
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:36,000
hole

2602
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,158
it can be made efficiently

2603
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,238
i'll take your warfare okay however i

2604
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:43,119
say it's physics not engineering because

2605
01:29:40,238 --> 01:29:45,359
it's very difficult to get those

2606
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:48,000
compound semiconductor light sources

2607
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:49,759
situated with your silicon in order to

2608
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,520
do that ion implantation that i talked

2609
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,639
about at the beginning high temperatures

2610
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,639
are required

2611
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:56,239
so you you got to make all of your

2612
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:58,560
transistors first and then put the

2613
01:29:56,238 --> 01:30:01,119
compound semiconductors on top of there

2614
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:02,719
you can't grow them afterwards because

2615
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:04,800
that requires high temperature it screws

2616
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,560
up all your transistors you try and

2617
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,400
stick them on there they don't have the

2618
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:10,480
same lattice constant the spacing

2619
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,960
between atoms is different enough that

2620
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:14,799
it just doesn't work so

2621
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,520
nature does not seem to be telling us

2622
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:20,719
that hey go ahead and combine light

2623
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:23,120
sources with your digital switches for

2624
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,880
conventional digital computing and

2625
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:25,679
conventional digital computing will

2626
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,079
often

2627
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:30,560
require smaller scale i guess in terms

2628
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:33,198
of like smartphone like

2629
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:37,039
so in which kind of systems

2630
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:38,319
can does nature hint that we can use

2631
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:41,198
um

2632
01:30:38,319 --> 01:30:44,238
light and photons for communication well

2633
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:46,319
so let me just try and be clear you can

2634
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:48,959
use light for communication in digital

2635
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:50,960
systems just the light sources are not

2636
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,719
intimately integrated with the silicon

2637
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,079
you you manufacture all the silicon you

2638
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:56,158
have your microchip

2639
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:58,079
plunk it down and then you manufacture

2640
01:30:56,158 --> 01:30:59,679
your light sources separate chip

2641
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:00,960
completely different process made in a

2642
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,480
different foundry

2643
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:05,359
and then you put those together at the

2644
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:07,439
package level got it so now you have

2645
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:08,639
you have some

2646
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:11,119
i would say a great deal of

2647
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:14,480
architectural limitations that

2648
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:16,399
are introduced by that sort of

2649
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:18,399
package level integration as opposed to

2650
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:20,079
monolithic on the same chip integration

2651
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:21,759
but it's still a very useful thing to do

2652
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:23,600
and that's

2653
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:26,239
where i had done some work previously

2654
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:29,120
before i came to nist there's a project

2655
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:32,238
led by vladimir stoyanovic that now spun

2656
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:34,079
out into a company called ir labs led by

2657
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:35,519
mark wade and chen sun where they're

2658
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:36,880
doing exactly that so you have your

2659
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,000
light source chip

2660
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,600
your

2661
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,039
silicon chip whatever it may be doing

2662
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,159
maybe it's digital electronics maybe

2663
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:43,600
it's some other control purpose

2664
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:45,679
something

2665
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,920
and the the silicon chip

2666
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:49,760
drives the the light source chip and

2667
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,440
modulates the intensity of the light so

2668
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,280
you can get data out of the package on

2669
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:56,479
an optical fiber and that still gives

2670
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:58,719
you tremendous advantages in bandwidth

2671
01:31:56,479 --> 01:32:00,879
as opposed to sending those signals out

2672
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:02,239
over electrical lines

2673
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,199
but

2674
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:05,919
it is

2675
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:07,198
somewhat peculiar to my eye that

2676
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,719
they have to be integrated at this

2677
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:10,719
package level and those those people i

2678
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:12,560
mean they're so smart those are my

2679
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:14,560
my colleagues that i respect a great

2680
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:16,800
deal so it's it's very clear that it's

2681
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:19,199
not just

2682
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,279
they're making a bad choice this is what

2683
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:23,439
physics is telling us it just wouldn't

2684
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:25,519
make any sense to to try to stick them

2685
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:26,960
together yeah so there even if it's

2686
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,159
difficult

2687
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,319
um

2688
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:32,479
it's uh easier than the alternative

2689
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:34,000
unfortunately i think so yes and i again

2690
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:35,519
i need to go back and and make sure that

2691
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,439
i'm not taking the wrong way i'm not

2692
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,520
saying that the pursuit of integrating

2693
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:41,279
compound semiconductors with silicon is

2694
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,360
fruitless and shouldn't be pursued it

2695
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:45,599
should and people are doing great work

2696
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:46,399
kaimei lao and john bowers others

2697
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,679
they're

2698
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:50,158
they're doing it and they're making

2699
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:53,679
progress but to my eye it doesn't look

2700
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:54,559
like that's ever going to be

2701
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:56,239
just

2702
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,159
the standard

2703
01:32:56,238 --> 01:33:00,238
monolithic light source on silicon

2704
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:02,719
process i i just don't see it it's yeah

2705
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:04,399
so nature kind of points the way usually

2706
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:05,600
and if you resist nature it's just

2707
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:07,039
you're gonna have to do a lot more work

2708
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,600
and it's gonna be expensive and not

2709
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,439
scalable got it but okay so let me uh

2710
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:13,199
let's go like far into the future let's

2711
01:33:11,439 --> 01:33:14,719
imagine this gigantic neuromorphic

2712
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:17,279
computing system

2713
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:19,119
that uh simulates all of our realities

2714
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:20,559
it currently is mentioned matrix four so

2715
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:23,198
this thing

2716
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:25,840
uh this powerful computer

2717
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:27,439
how does it operate like so so what what

2718
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:29,360
are the neurons

2719
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:32,399
what is the communication what's your

2720
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:34,880
sense all right so let me let me now

2721
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:36,638
after spending 45 minutes trashing light

2722
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,600
source integration with silicon let me

2723
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:42,079
now say why i'm basing my entire life

2724
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,840
yeah professional life on

2725
01:33:42,079 --> 01:33:46,079
integrating light sources with

2726
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,440
electronics i think the game is

2727
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:49,600
completely different when you're talking

2728
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:50,559
about superconducting electronics

2729
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,639
for

2730
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,320
several reasons um

2731
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,800
let me try to go through them

2732
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:58,399
one is that as i mentioned it's

2733
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:01,199
difficult to integrate those compound

2734
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:02,559
semiconductor light sources with silicon

2735
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:04,799
with silicon

2736
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:06,320
is a requirement that is introduced by

2737
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,000
the fact that using semiconducting

2738
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:09,679
electronics in superconducting

2739
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,760
electronics you're still going to start

2740
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:13,520
with a silicon wafer but it's it's just

2741
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,840
the bread for your sandwich in a lot of

2742
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,120
ways you're not using that silicon in

2743
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,199
precisely the same way for the

2744
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:21,840
electronics you're now depositing

2745
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:24,000
superconducting materials on top of that

2746
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,199
the prospects for integrating light

2747
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,800
sources with

2748
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:31,119
that kind of an electronic process are

2749
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,279
certainly less explored but i think much

2750
01:34:31,119 --> 01:34:35,039
more promising because you don't need

2751
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:36,719
those light sources to be intimately

2752
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:38,079
integrated with the transistors that's

2753
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,359
where the problems come up they don't

2754
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:42,158
need to be lattice matched to the

2755
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:44,238
silicon all that kind of stuff instead

2756
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:45,759
it seems possible that you can take

2757
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:47,279
those compound semiconductor light

2758
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,360
sources

2759
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:51,519
stick them on the silicon wafer and then

2760
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:53,519
grow your superconducting electronics on

2761
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:56,000
the top of that it's at least not

2762
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:58,080
obviously going to fail so the

2763
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,800
computation would be done on the

2764
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:02,000
superconductive material as well yes the

2765
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,840
computation is done in the

2766
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,238
superconducting electronics

2767
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,159
and the light sources receive signals

2768
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:10,399
that say hey a neuron reach threshold

2769
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:12,399
produce a pulse of light send it out to

2770
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:14,719
all your downstream synaptic connections

2771
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:16,638
those are again super conductive elect

2772
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:19,760
superconducting electronics perform your

2773
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:21,440
computation and you're off to the races

2774
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:24,239
your network works so then if we can

2775
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:26,799
rewind real quick so what are the

2776
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:28,799
limitations of the challenges of super

2777
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,320
conducting electronics

2778
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:32,320
when we think about constructing these

2779
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:35,279
kinds of systems so

2780
01:35:32,319 --> 01:35:37,519
actually let me let me say uh one other

2781
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:39,359
thing about the light sources yes please

2782
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,960
and then i'll then i'll move on i

2783
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:43,920
promise because this is this is probably

2784
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:45,279
tedious first this is super exciting

2785
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,600
okay one other thing about the light

2786
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:49,519
sources i said that silicon is terrible

2787
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:52,400
at emitting photons it's just not what

2788
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:54,000
it's meant to do however the game is

2789
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:55,599
different when you're at low temperature

2790
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,880
if you're working with superconductors

2791
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,719
you have to be at low temperature

2792
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:01,679
because they don't work otherwise when

2793
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:03,600
you're at 4 kelvin silicon is not

2794
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:05,118
obviously a terrible light source it's

2795
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,719
still not as efficient as compound

2796
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:08,639
semiconductors but it might be good

2797
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,079
enough for this application

2798
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:12,719
the final thing that i'll mention about

2799
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:13,920
that is again leveraging superconductors

2800
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:15,359
as i said

2801
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,840
in in a different context

2802
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:19,439
superconducting detectors can receive

2803
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,119
one single photon

2804
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:22,879
in that conversation i failed to mention

2805
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:25,039
that semiconductors can also receive

2806
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:26,560
photons that's the primary mechanism by

2807
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:28,319
which it's done

2808
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,159
a camera in your phone that's receptive

2809
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:32,719
to visible light it's is receiving

2810
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:34,479
photons it's based on silicon or you can

2811
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:36,639
make it in different semiconductors for

2812
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:38,959
different wavelengths

2813
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:41,920
but it requires on the order of a

2814
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:43,520
thousand a few thousand photons to

2815
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:45,440
receive a pulse

2816
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,320
now when you're using a superconducting

2817
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:49,359
detector you need one photon exactly one

2818
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:50,880
i mean

2819
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:54,319
one or more

2820
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:56,639
so the fact that your synapses can now

2821
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:58,799
be based on superconducting detectors

2822
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:00,159
instead of semiconducting detectors

2823
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:02,400
brings the light levels that are

2824
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:04,399
required down by some three orders of

2825
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:06,559
magnitude so now

2826
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:08,719
you don't need good light sources you

2827
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,800
can have the world's worst light sources

2828
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:12,639
as long as they spit out maybe a few

2829
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,760
thousand photons every time a neuron

2830
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:14,960
fires

2831
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,480
you have

2832
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,399
the heart you have the hardware

2833
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:20,718
principles in place that you might be

2834
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:22,719
able to do perform this optoelectronic

2835
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:25,198
integration to me optoelectronic

2836
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:27,520
integration is it's just so enticing we

2837
01:37:25,198 --> 01:37:30,319
want to be able to leverage electronics

2838
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:32,159
for computation light for communication

2839
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:33,198
working with silicon microelectronics at

2840
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:34,960
room temperature that has been

2841
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:36,319
exceedingly difficult

2842
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:39,039
and i hope

2843
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:40,000
that when we move to the superconducting

2844
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:41,760
domain

2845
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,800
target a different application space

2846
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:47,679
that is neuromorphic instead of digital

2847
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:49,520
and use superconducting detectors

2848
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:51,118
maybe optoelectronic integration comes

2849
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,679
to us okay so there's a bunch of

2850
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:56,799
questions so one is temperature

2851
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:58,239
so in these kind of hybrid heterogeneous

2852
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,079
systems

2853
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:01,678
what's the temperature what are some of

2854
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:03,118
the constraints of the operation here

2855
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:05,039
does it all have to be a four kelvin as

2856
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:06,799
well four kelvin everything has to be at

2857
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:08,880
four kelvin

2858
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:12,320
okay so what are the other engineering

2859
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:14,239
challenges of making this kind of

2860
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:16,000
optoelectronic systems

2861
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:17,359
let me just dwell on that four kelvin

2862
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,880
for a second because some people hear

2863
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:20,479
four kelvin and they just get up and

2864
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:23,279
leave they just say i don't i'm not

2865
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:26,079
doing it you know and to me that's very

2866
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:28,399
earth-centric species-centric we live in

2867
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:30,000
300 kelvin so we want our technologies

2868
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:32,799
to operate there too i totally get it

2869
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,198
yeah what's zero celsius zero celsius is

2870
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:37,760
273 kelvin so

2871
01:38:35,198 --> 01:38:41,198
we're talking very very cold here this

2872
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:44,480
is this is even boston cold

2873
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:46,000
this is real cold yeah siberia no okay

2874
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:47,439
so just for reference the the

2875
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,760
temperature of the cosmic microwave

2876
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:50,559
background is about 2.7 kelvin so we're

2877
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,320
still

2878
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:55,119
warmer than deep space

2879
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:56,399
good so that when the universe

2880
01:38:55,118 --> 01:38:58,399
dies out

2881
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:01,279
it'll be colder than 4k it's already

2882
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:03,759
colder than 4k in the in the expanses

2883
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:06,559
you know you don't have to get that far

2884
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:08,560
away from the earth in order to to drop

2885
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:11,119
down to not far from what you're saying

2886
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:13,280
is the aliens that live at the edge

2887
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:15,279
of the observable universe

2888
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:16,800
are using superconductive material for

2889
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:17,920
their computation they don't have to

2890
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,039
live at the edge of the universe the

2891
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:23,199
aliens that are more advanced than us

2892
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:24,399
in their solar system are

2893
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:26,399
doing this

2894
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:28,399
in their asteroid belt

2895
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:30,479
we can get to that oh

2896
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:32,319
because of the they can get that to that

2897
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:33,759
temperature easier there sure yeah all

2898
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:36,079
you have to do is reflect the sunlight

2899
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,840
away and you have a huge head start oh

2900
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:40,238
so the sun is the problem here yeah like

2901
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:42,880
it's warm here on earth yeah okay okay

2902
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:45,198
so can you uh so how do we get to 4k

2903
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:46,239
what's well okay so very different kind

2904
01:39:45,198 --> 01:39:48,479
of 4k

2905
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:50,638
temperature yeah what i want to say

2906
01:39:48,479 --> 01:39:53,759
about temperature is that

2907
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:55,440
if you can swallow that if you can say

2908
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,039
all right i give up

2909
01:39:55,439 --> 01:39:58,158
applications that have to do with my

2910
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:00,399
cell phone

2911
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:02,238
and the convenience of

2912
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:03,839
you know a laptop on a train and you

2913
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:05,279
instead

2914
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:07,440
for me i'm i'm very much in the

2915
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:08,719
scientific head space i'm not looking at

2916
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:10,960
products i'm not looking at what this

2917
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:12,480
will be useful to sell to consumers

2918
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:15,359
instead i'm thinking about scientific

2919
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:17,118
questions well it's just not that bad to

2920
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:19,759
have to work at 4 kelvin we do it all

2921
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:20,559
the time in our labs at nist and so does

2922
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,480
i mean

2923
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:24,400
for reference the entire quantum

2924
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:25,519
computing

2925
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:27,439
sector

2926
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:30,400
usually has to work at something like

2927
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:32,079
100 millikelvin 50 millikelvin so now

2928
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:34,559
you're talking another factor of 100

2929
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:36,559
even colder than that a fraction of a

2930
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:38,000
degree and everybody seems to think

2931
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:39,119
quantum computing is going to take over

2932
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,039
the world that

2933
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:42,799
it's so much more expensive to have to

2934
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:43,840
get that extra

2935
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,480
factor

2936
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:48,719
of 10 or whatever colder

2937
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:50,559
and yet it's not stopping people from

2938
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:52,960
investing in in that area and by

2939
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,800
investing i i mean putting their

2940
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,679
research into it as well as venture

2941
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,520
capital or whatever so oh so so based on

2942
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:01,118
the energy of what you're commenting on

2943
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:04,000
i'm getting a sense that's one of the

2944
01:41:01,118 --> 01:41:05,118
criticism of this approach is 4k for

2945
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,079
kelvin

2946
01:41:05,118 --> 01:41:11,039
is uh is a big negative it is the show

2947
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:13,679
stopper for a lot of people they just i

2948
01:41:11,039 --> 01:41:15,039
mean and understandably i i'm not saying

2949
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:16,800
that

2950
01:41:15,039 --> 01:41:19,279
that that's not a consideration of

2951
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,800
course it is for for some okay so

2952
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:23,519
different motivations for different

2953
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,719
people in the academic world suppose you

2954
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,440
spent your whole life learning about

2955
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:29,198
silicon microelectronic circuits you you

2956
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:30,399
send a design to a foundry they send you

2957
01:41:29,198 --> 01:41:32,879
back a chip

2958
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:35,439
and you go test it at your tabletop

2959
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:36,880
and now i'm saying here now learn how to

2960
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:38,479
use all these cryogenics so you can do

2961
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:41,039
that at 4 kelvin

2962
01:41:38,479 --> 01:41:43,198
no come on man i don't want to do that

2963
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:45,760
that sounds it's the old momentum the

2964
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:47,359
titanic or the turning yeah kind of but

2965
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,520
you're saying that's not that too much

2966
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:51,759
of a finding when we're looking at large

2967
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,040
systems and the gain you can potentially

2968
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,320
get from them that's not that much of a

2969
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:55,760
cost and when you want to answer the

2970
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:58,079
scientific question about what are the

2971
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:00,320
physical limits of cognition

2972
01:41:58,079 --> 01:42:02,960
well the physical limits they don't care

2973
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:05,599
if you're at 4 kelvin if you can perform

2974
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,520
cognition at a scale orders of magnitude

2975
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:09,600
beyond any room temperature technology

2976
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,280
but you got to get cold to do it

2977
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,639
you're going to do it and to me that's

2978
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:14,479
the interesting

2979
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:16,079
application space

2980
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:17,759
it's not even an application space

2981
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:18,880
that's the interesting scientific

2982
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,280
paradigm

2983
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,560
so i i personally am not going to let

2984
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:24,559
low temperature

2985
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:27,039
stop me from realizing

2986
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:31,119
a technological

2987
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:33,679
domain or or realm that is

2988
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:35,279
achieving in most ways everything else

2989
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:37,520
that i that i'm looking for in my

2990
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:39,118
hardware so that okay that's a big one

2991
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,040
is there other kind of engineering

2992
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:43,039
challenges that you envision yeah yeah

2993
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:45,118
yeah so let me take a moment here

2994
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:47,198
because i haven't really described

2995
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:49,359
what i mean by a neuron or a network in

2996
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:51,759
this particular hardware yeah do you

2997
01:42:49,359 --> 01:42:54,479
want to talk about loop neurons and

2998
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:56,159
there's so many fascinating but you just

2999
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:58,319
have so many amazing papers that people

3000
01:42:56,158 --> 01:43:00,559
should definitely check out and uh the

3001
01:42:58,319 --> 01:43:04,559
titles alone are just killers so anyway

3002
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:06,639
go ahead right so let me say big picture

3003
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,320
based on optics photonics for

3004
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:10,719
communication superconducting

3005
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:13,439
electronics for computation how how does

3006
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:16,480
this all work so

3007
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:19,439
a neuron in this in this hardware

3008
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:20,959
platform can be thought of as circuits

3009
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:22,719
that are based on joseph's injunctions

3010
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:25,520
like we talked about before

3011
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:27,118
where every time a photon comes in so

3012
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:29,600
let's start by talking about a synapse a

3013
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:31,759
synapse receives a photon one or more

3014
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,840
from a from a different neuron and it

3015
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:35,280
converts that optical signal to an

3016
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:38,079
electrical signal

3017
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:40,479
the amount of current that that adds to

3018
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:42,479
a loop is controlled by the synaptic

3019
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:45,279
weight so as i said before you're

3020
01:43:42,479 --> 01:43:46,959
popping fluxons into a loop right so

3021
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:49,118
a photon comes in it hits a

3022
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:51,600
superconducting single photon detector

3023
01:43:49,118 --> 01:43:53,039
one photon the the absolute physical

3024
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,719
minimum that you can communicate from

3025
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:56,319
one place to another with light and that

3026
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,158
detector then converts that to an

3027
01:43:56,319 --> 01:44:00,719
electrical signal and the amount of

3028
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:02,399
signal is uh correlated with some kind

3029
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:04,639
of weight yeah so the synaptic weight

3030
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:06,479
will tell you how many fluxons you pop

3031
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:08,639
into the loop it's an analog number

3032
01:44:06,479 --> 01:44:09,919
we're doing analog computation now well

3033
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:11,440
can you just linger on that what the

3034
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:14,158
heck is the flux on are we supposed to

3035
01:44:11,439 --> 01:44:16,960
know this or is this is this a funny uh

3036
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:18,319
it's like the big bang is this is this a

3037
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,079
funny word for something deeply

3038
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:21,359
technical no let's let's try to avoid

3039
01:44:20,079 --> 01:44:24,000
using the word flux line because it's

3040
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:27,118
not actually necessary when a when a

3041
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:29,359
photo is fun to say though so uh so

3042
01:44:27,118 --> 01:44:31,198
it's very necessary i would say when

3043
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:32,960
when a photon hits that superconducting

3044
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:35,839
single photon detector

3045
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,560
current is added to a superconducting

3046
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,480
loop

3047
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:40,880
and the the amount of current that you

3048
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:42,959
add can is an analog value can have

3049
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,239
eight bit equivalent resolution

3050
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:46,880
something like that

3051
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:48,079
10 bits maybe that's amazing by the way

3052
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:50,000
this is starting to make a lot more

3053
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:52,479
sense when you're using superconductors

3054
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:55,840
for this the energy

3055
01:44:52,479 --> 01:44:58,559
of that circulating current is

3056
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:59,440
is less than the energy of that photon

3057
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:01,840
so your

3058
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:04,000
your energy budget is not destroyed by

3059
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:06,159
doing this analog computation

3060
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,920
so now in the language of a

3061
01:45:06,158 --> 01:45:09,839
neuroscientist you would say that's your

3062
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:12,239
post-synaptic signal you have this

3063
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,679
current being stored in a loop you can

3064
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:15,359
decide what you want to do with it most

3065
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,199
likely you're going to have it decay

3066
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:18,960
exponentially so

3067
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:20,960
every single synapse is going to have

3068
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,520
some given time constant

3069
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,719
and that's determined by set by putting

3070
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,800
some

3071
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:29,359
resistor in that in that superconducting

3072
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:31,360
loop so a synapse a synapse event occurs

3073
01:45:29,359 --> 01:45:33,759
when a photon strikes a detector adds

3074
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:36,079
current to that loop it decays over time

3075
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:38,480
that's the postsynaptic signal then you

3076
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:40,960
can process that in a dendritic tree

3077
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:43,439
bryce primavera and i have a paper

3078
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:45,039
that we've submitted about that

3079
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:46,479
for the more neuroscience oriented

3080
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:48,079
people there's a lot of dendritic

3081
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:49,519
processing a lot of plasticity

3082
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:51,359
mechanisms you can implement with

3083
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:52,480
essentially exactly the same circuits

3084
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:54,479
you have this

3085
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:57,118
one simple building block circuit that

3086
01:45:54,479 --> 01:45:59,118
you can use for a synapse for a dendrite

3087
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:01,118
for the neuron cell body for all the

3088
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:02,880
plasticity functions it's all based on

3089
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:04,719
the same building block just tweaking a

3090
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:06,159
couple parameters so this basic building

3091
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:08,079
block has both an optical and an

3092
01:46:06,158 --> 01:46:09,118
electrical component and then you can

3093
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:11,679
just

3094
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:13,920
build arbitrary large systems with that

3095
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:15,600
close you're not at fault for thinking

3096
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,960
that that's what i meant what i what i

3097
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,360
should say is that

3098
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:21,118
if you want it to be a synapse you tack

3099
01:46:19,359 --> 01:46:22,639
a detector a superconducting detector

3100
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:24,238
onto the front of it and if you want it

3101
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:28,319
to be anything else there's no optical

3102
01:46:24,238 --> 01:46:31,678
component got it so at the front

3103
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:33,439
optics in the front uh electrical stuff

3104
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:35,760
in the back electrical yeah in the

3105
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:37,279
processing and in the the output signal

3106
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,400
that it sends to the next stage of

3107
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:40,960
processing

3108
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:42,719
further so the dendritic trees is

3109
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:45,920
electrical it's all electrical it's all

3110
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:47,439
electrical in the super domain for

3111
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,279
anybody who's up on their

3112
01:46:47,439 --> 01:46:52,319
superconducting circuits it's just based

3113
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:54,000
on a dc squid the most ubiquitous it's

3114
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:57,039
which is a circuit composed of two

3115
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,118
joseph's injunctions so it's it's a very

3116
01:46:57,039 --> 01:47:00,800
bread and butter kind of thing and then

3117
01:46:59,118 --> 01:47:03,198
the only place where you go beyond that

3118
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:05,199
is the neuron cell body itself it's

3119
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:06,960
receiving all these electrical inputs

3120
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:08,238
from the synapses or dendrites or

3121
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,480
however you've structured that

3122
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:12,959
particular unique neuron and when it

3123
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:14,718
reaches its threshold which occurs by

3124
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:16,719
driving a joseph's injunction above its

3125
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:18,800
critical current it produces a pulse of

3126
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:21,520
current which starts an amplification

3127
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:24,719
sequence voltage amplification that

3128
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:26,800
produces light out of a transmitter so

3129
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:28,319
one of one of our colleagues adam akan

3130
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:29,920
and sonia buckley as well did a lot of

3131
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:32,238
work on the

3132
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:35,600
the light sources and the

3133
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:37,198
amplifiers that drive the current and

3134
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,800
produce sufficient voltage to drive

3135
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:40,719
current through that now semiconducting

3136
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:43,119
part so that light source is the

3137
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:45,039
semiconducting part of a neuron

3138
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:47,599
and that so the neuron has reached

3139
01:47:45,039 --> 01:47:50,238
threshold it produces a pulse of light

3140
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:52,239
that light then fans out across a

3141
01:47:50,238 --> 01:47:54,559
network of wave guides to reach all the

3142
01:47:52,238 --> 01:47:55,359
downstream synaptic terminals

3143
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:58,239
that

3144
01:47:55,359 --> 01:48:00,238
do perform this process themselves so

3145
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:02,638
it's probably worth explaining what a

3146
01:48:00,238 --> 01:48:04,718
network of wave guides is because a lot

3147
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,560
of listeners aren't going to know that

3148
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:08,480
look up the papers by jeff chiles on

3149
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,440
this one but basically

3150
01:48:08,479 --> 01:48:14,238
light can be guided in a a simple

3151
01:48:11,439 --> 01:48:15,599
basically wire of usually an insulating

3152
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:18,799
material so

3153
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:20,639
silicon silicon nitride different

3154
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,360
different kinds of glass just like in a

3155
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:24,960
fiber optic it's glass silicon dioxide

3156
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:26,639
that makes it a little bit big we want

3157
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:28,079
to bring these down so we use different

3158
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:31,279
materials like silicon nitride but

3159
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:32,880
basically just imagine a rectangle of

3160
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:37,039
some material

3161
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:38,239
that just goes and branches

3162
01:48:37,039 --> 01:48:40,479
forms different

3163
01:48:38,238 --> 01:48:43,118
different branch points that target

3164
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:44,799
different sub-regions of the network you

3165
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:46,319
can transition between layers of these

3166
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,760
so now we're talking about building in

3167
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:50,319
the third dimension which is absolutely

3168
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:52,880
crucial so that's what waveguides are

3169
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:54,639
so yeah that's great uh what why the

3170
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:56,639
third dimension is crucial

3171
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:59,679
okay so yes you were talking about what

3172
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:02,079
are some of the technical limitations

3173
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:04,399
one of the things that

3174
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:05,279
i believe we have to grapple with is

3175
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:08,799
that

3176
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:10,319
our brains are miraculously compact for

3177
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,440
the number of neurons that are in our

3178
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:13,679
brain

3179
01:49:11,439 --> 01:49:14,879
it sure does fit in a small volume as it

3180
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:17,279
would have to if we're going to be

3181
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,199
biological organisms that are resource

3182
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:21,519
limited and things like that

3183
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:23,039
any kind of hardware neuron is almost

3184
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:26,000
certainly going to be much bigger than

3185
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:27,599
that if it is of comparable complexity

3186
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,840
even whether it's based on silicon

3187
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:32,079
transistors okay a transistor seven

3188
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:34,000
nanometers that doesn't mean a

3189
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:36,000
semiconductor based neuron is seven

3190
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,439
nanometers they they're big they they

3191
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,359
require

3192
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:41,039
many transistors different other things

3193
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:42,960
like capacitors and things that store

3194
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:44,800
charge they end up being

3195
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:46,719
on the order of a hundred microns by a

3196
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,320
hundred microns and it's difficult to

3197
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:50,719
get them down any smaller than that the

3198
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:52,639
same is true for superconducting neurons

3199
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:54,239
and the same is true if we're trying to

3200
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,880
use light for communication even if

3201
01:49:54,238 --> 01:50:00,000
you're using electrons for communication

3202
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:02,239
you you have these wires where

3203
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,238
okay the elect the size of an electron

3204
01:50:02,238 --> 01:50:06,079
might be angstroms but the size of a

3205
01:50:04,238 --> 01:50:08,000
wire is not angstroms and if you try and

3206
01:50:06,079 --> 01:50:10,639
make it narrower the resistance just

3207
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,319
goes up so it you don't actually win

3208
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:14,000
to communicate over long distances you

3209
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:16,479
need your wires to be

3210
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,479
microns wide and it's the same thing for

3211
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:20,399
wave guides waveguides are essentially

3212
01:50:18,479 --> 01:50:22,559
limited by the wavelength of light and

3213
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:25,118
that's going to be about a micron so

3214
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:26,880
whereas compare that to an axon the

3215
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:28,158
analogous component in the brain which

3216
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,560
is

3217
01:50:28,158 --> 01:50:32,079
10 nanometers in diameter something like

3218
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,119
that they

3219
01:50:32,079 --> 01:50:35,439
they're bigger when they need to

3220
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:37,118
communicate over long distances but

3221
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:39,919
grappling with the size of these

3222
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:41,359
structures is inevitable and crucial and

3223
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:44,560
so

3224
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:46,960
in order to make systems of comparable

3225
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:49,760
scale to the human brain by scale here i

3226
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:51,760
mean number of interconnected neurons

3227
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:53,599
you absolutely have to be using the

3228
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:55,039
third spatial dimension

3229
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:57,520
and that means

3230
01:50:55,039 --> 01:50:59,599
on the wafer you need multiple layers of

3231
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:01,040
both active and passive components

3232
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:03,279
active i mean

3233
01:51:01,039 --> 01:51:05,519
superconducting electronic circuits

3234
01:51:03,279 --> 01:51:07,439
that are performing computations and

3235
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,880
passive i mean these wave guides that

3236
01:51:07,439 --> 01:51:10,879
are routing the optical signals to

3237
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:12,880
different places you have to be able to

3238
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:13,760
stack those if you can get to something

3239
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,679
like

3240
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,800
10 planes of each of those or maybe not

3241
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:20,399
even 10 maybe 5 6 something like that

3242
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:22,800
then you're in business now you can get

3243
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:25,039
millions of neurons on a wafer

3244
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:26,960
but that's not that's not anywhere close

3245
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:28,000
to the brain scale in order to get to

3246
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:29,520
the scale of the human brain you're

3247
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,439
going to have to also use the third

3248
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:33,440
dimension in the sense that

3249
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:34,799
entire wafers need to be stacked on top

3250
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:36,479
of each other with fiber optic

3251
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,000
communication between them and we need

3252
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:40,238
to be able to fill

3253
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,920
a space the size of this table with

3254
01:51:40,238 --> 01:51:43,519
stacked wafers

3255
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:44,960
and that's when you can get to some 10

3256
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:46,719
billion neurons like your human brain

3257
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:48,399
and i i don't think that's specific to

3258
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:50,719
the optoelectronic approach that we're

3259
01:51:48,399 --> 01:51:52,479
taking i think that applies to any

3260
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:54,319
hardware where you're trying to reach

3261
01:51:52,479 --> 01:51:56,799
commensurate scale and complexity as the

3262
01:51:54,319 --> 01:51:59,519
human brain so you need that fractal

3263
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:02,079
stacking so stacking on the wafer and

3264
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:04,560
stacking of the wafers and then whatever

3265
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:06,639
the system that combined this stacking

3266
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:08,239
of the tables with the wafers and it has

3267
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,079
to be fractal all the way you're exactly

3268
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:12,638
right because that's the only way that

3269
01:52:10,079 --> 01:52:14,639
you can efficiently get information from

3270
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:17,039
a small point to across that whole

3271
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:19,520
network it has to have the the power law

3272
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:21,439
connecting and photons are like uh

3273
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:23,040
optics throughout yeah absolutely once

3274
01:52:21,439 --> 01:52:24,879
you're at this scale to me it's just

3275
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:26,319
obvious of course you're using light for

3276
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:27,920
communication you have

3277
01:52:26,319 --> 01:52:29,439
fiber optics

3278
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:31,599
given to us

3279
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:33,839
you know from nature so simple

3280
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:35,679
the the thought of even trying to this

3281
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,039
any kind of electrical communication

3282
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:38,480
just doesn't

3283
01:52:37,039 --> 01:52:40,319
it doesn't make sense to me i'm not

3284
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:42,079
saying it's wrong i don't know but

3285
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:44,799
that's where i'm coming from so let's

3286
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:47,279
return to loop neurons

3287
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:49,199
why are they called loop neurons

3288
01:52:47,279 --> 01:52:50,719
yeah the term loop neurons comes from

3289
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:52,399
the fact like we've been talking about

3290
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:55,198
that they rely heavily on these

3291
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:56,238
superconducting loops so

3292
01:52:55,198 --> 01:52:58,319
even in

3293
01:52:56,238 --> 01:53:02,238
a lot of forms of digital computing with

3294
01:52:58,319 --> 01:53:04,719
superconductors storing uh a signal in a

3295
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:05,839
superconducting loop is a a primary

3296
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:08,158
technique

3297
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:10,719
in this particular case it's it's just

3298
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:12,479
loops everywhere you look so the

3299
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:14,880
the strength of a synaptic weight is

3300
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:17,039
going to be set by the state the amount

3301
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:19,359
of current circulating in a loop that is

3302
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:21,198
coupled to the synapse so

3303
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:23,359
memory is

3304
01:53:21,198 --> 01:53:24,960
implemented as current circulating in a

3305
01:53:23,359 --> 01:53:27,198
superconducting loop

3306
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,639
the the coupling between say a synapse

3307
01:53:27,198 --> 01:53:31,678
and a dendrite or a synapse in the

3308
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:33,760
neuron cell body occurs through

3309
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:35,599
loop loop coupling through transformer

3310
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,599
so current circulating in a synapse is

3311
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,679
going to induce current in a in a

3312
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:41,440
different loop a receiving loop in the

3313
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:42,319
in the neuron cell body

3314
01:53:41,439 --> 01:53:44,319
so

3315
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:47,279
since all of the computation is

3316
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:49,519
happening in these flux storage loops

3317
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:51,039
and they play such a central role in in

3318
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:53,440
how the information is processed how

3319
01:53:51,039 --> 01:53:55,118
memories are formed all that stuff

3320
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:56,879
i didn't think too much about it just

3321
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:58,799
call them loop neurons because it rolls

3322
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:02,159
off the tongue a little bit better than

3323
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:06,880
superconducting optoelectronic neurons

3324
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:09,118
okay so uh how do you design circuits

3325
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:10,800
for these loop neurons that's a great

3326
01:54:09,118 --> 01:54:13,118
question there's a lot of different

3327
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:16,639
scales of design so

3328
01:54:13,118 --> 01:54:19,198
at the level of just one synapse you can

3329
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:21,039
use conventional methods

3330
01:54:19,198 --> 01:54:22,879
they don't they're not that complicated

3331
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:24,158
as as far as superconducting electronics

3332
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:26,159
goes it's just

3333
01:54:24,158 --> 01:54:27,920
for joseph's injunctions or something

3334
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:29,839
like that depending on how much

3335
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:33,118
complexity you want to add so you can

3336
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:34,480
just directly simulate each component in

3337
01:54:33,118 --> 01:54:35,759
in spice

3338
01:54:34,479 --> 01:54:38,079
we've been what

3339
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:39,679
it's standard electrical simulation

3340
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:41,519
software okay basically so you're just

3341
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:43,039
you're just explicitly solving the

3342
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:45,119
differential equations that describe the

3343
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:47,118
circuit elements and then you can stack

3344
01:54:45,118 --> 01:54:49,359
these things together in that simulation

3345
01:54:47,118 --> 01:54:50,880
software to then build circuits you can

3346
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:53,359
but that becomes computationally

3347
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:55,279
expensive so one of the things when when

3348
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:57,039
covet hit we knew we had to turn some

3349
01:54:55,279 --> 01:54:58,960
attention to more

3350
01:54:57,039 --> 01:55:00,639
things you can do at home in your

3351
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,520
basement or whatever and one of them was

3352
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:03,440
was

3353
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:06,080
computational modeling so

3354
01:55:03,439 --> 01:55:07,759
we started working on

3355
01:55:06,079 --> 01:55:10,079
adapting

3356
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:12,079
abstracting out the circuit performance

3357
01:55:10,079 --> 01:55:14,800
so that you don't have to explicitly

3358
01:55:12,079 --> 01:55:16,479
solve the circuit equations which for

3359
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:18,480
joseph's injunctions usually needs to be

3360
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:19,439
done on like a picosecond time scale and

3361
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:22,799
you have

3362
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:24,319
a lot of nodes in your circuit so it

3363
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:25,440
results in a lot of differential

3364
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:27,198
equations that need to be solved

3365
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:29,439
simultaneously we were looking for a way

3366
01:55:27,198 --> 01:55:31,839
to simulate these circuits

3367
01:55:29,439 --> 01:55:34,799
that is scalable up to networks of

3368
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:36,560
millions or so neurons is sort of where

3369
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,320
we're targeting right now

3370
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,639
so we were able to

3371
01:55:38,319 --> 01:55:42,238
analyze the behavior of these circuits

3372
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,159
and as i said there it's based on these

3373
01:55:42,238 --> 01:55:45,598
simple building blocks so you really

3374
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:46,960
only need to understand this one

3375
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:49,599
building block and if you get a good

3376
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:51,198
model of that boom it tiles and you you

3377
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:52,880
can change the parameters in there to

3378
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:55,118
get different behaviors and stuff but

3379
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:56,639
it's all based on now it's one

3380
01:55:55,118 --> 01:55:58,158
differential equation that you need to

3381
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:00,159
solve so

3382
01:55:58,158 --> 01:56:03,039
one differential equation for every

3383
01:56:00,158 --> 01:56:04,960
synapse dendrite or neuron in your in

3384
01:56:03,039 --> 01:56:06,639
your system and for the neuroscientists

3385
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:08,399
out there it's just a simple leaky

3386
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:10,800
integrated fire model

3387
01:56:08,399 --> 01:56:12,399
leaky integrator basically the synapse

3388
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,239
is a leaky integrator a dendrite is a

3389
01:56:12,399 --> 01:56:16,000
leaky integrator so i'm really

3390
01:56:14,238 --> 01:56:18,399
fascinated by how

3391
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:21,760
this one simple component

3392
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:24,399
can be used to achieve lots of different

3393
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:25,360
types of dynamical activity

3394
01:56:24,399 --> 01:56:26,960
and

3395
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:29,118
to me that's where scalability comes

3396
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:32,158
from and also complexity as well

3397
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:35,359
complexity is often characterized by

3398
01:56:32,158 --> 01:56:36,879
relatively simple building blocks

3399
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:38,399
connected in

3400
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:40,560
potentially simple or sometimes

3401
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:42,079
complicated ways and then emergent new

3402
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,880
behavior that was hard to predict from

3403
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:45,039
those

3404
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:46,719
simple simple elements and that's

3405
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:48,960
exactly what we're working with here so

3406
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:50,480
it's a very exciting platform

3407
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,158
both from a modeling perspective and

3408
01:56:50,479 --> 01:56:53,759
from a hardware manifestation

3409
01:56:52,158 --> 01:56:57,039
perspective where we can

3410
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:59,440
hopefully start to to have this uh test

3411
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:01,599
bed where we can explore things not just

3412
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:03,439
related to neuroscience but also related

3413
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:05,920
to other things

3414
01:57:03,439 --> 01:57:08,079
that connected to other physics like

3415
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:09,920
critical phenomenon icing models things

3416
01:57:08,079 --> 01:57:11,519
like that so

3417
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:12,960
you were asking how we simulate these

3418
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:15,280
circuits

3419
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:17,760
it's it's at different levels and we've

3420
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:20,238
got the simple spice circuit

3421
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:22,079
stuff that's no problem and now we're

3422
01:57:20,238 --> 01:57:23,598
building these network models based on

3423
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:24,800
this more efficient leaky integrator so

3424
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:26,960
we can actually

3425
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:28,400
reduce every element to one differential

3426
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:30,560
equation and then we can also step

3427
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:31,920
through it on a much coarser time grid

3428
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,239
so it ends up being something like a

3429
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:36,480
factor of a thousand to ten thousand

3430
01:57:34,238 --> 01:57:37,598
speed improvement which allows us to

3431
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:39,678
simulate

3432
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:40,800
but hopefully up to up to millions of

3433
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:42,319
neurons

3434
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:44,159
um whereas before we would have been

3435
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:46,238
limited to

3436
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:48,319
tens 100 something like that and just

3437
01:57:46,238 --> 01:57:50,079
like uh simulating quantum mechanical

3438
01:57:48,319 --> 01:57:53,359
systems with a quantum computer so the

3439
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:54,479
goal here is to understand such systems

3440
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:56,319
for me

3441
01:57:54,479 --> 01:57:59,839
the goal is to study this as a

3442
01:57:56,319 --> 01:58:02,238
scientific physical system it i'm not

3443
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:04,159
drawn towards turning this into an

3444
01:58:02,238 --> 01:58:06,399
enterprise at this point i feel

3445
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:09,279
short-term applications that obviously

3446
01:58:06,399 --> 01:58:11,359
make a lot of money is not necessarily a

3447
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:12,800
curiosity driver for you at the moment

3448
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:14,559
absolutely not if you're interested in

3449
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:16,560
short-term making money go with deep

3450
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:19,199
learning use silicon microelectronics if

3451
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:21,039
you want to understand

3452
01:58:19,198 --> 01:58:23,598
things like the the physics of a

3453
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:24,880
fascinating system or if you want to

3454
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:26,560
understand

3455
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:29,440
something more along the lines of the

3456
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:31,119
physical limits of what can be achieved

3457
01:58:29,439 --> 01:58:32,559
then i think

3458
01:58:31,118 --> 01:58:34,559
single photon communication

3459
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:37,280
superconducting electronics

3460
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:40,400
is extremely exciting what if i want to

3461
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:43,118
use superconducting hardware at 4 kelvin

3462
01:58:40,399 --> 01:58:45,039
to mine bitcoin that's my main interest

3463
01:58:43,118 --> 01:58:46,880
that's that's the reason i wanted to

3464
01:58:45,039 --> 01:58:48,760
talk to you today i want us not i don't

3465
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:50,239
know what's what's bitcoin

3466
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:51,520
[Laughter]

3467
01:58:50,238 --> 01:58:53,759
it's a

3468
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:55,119
look it up on the internet somebody

3469
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:56,400
somebody told me about it i'm not sure

3470
01:58:55,118 --> 01:58:59,359
exactly what it is

3471
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:03,519
uh so but let me ask nevertheless about

3472
01:58:59,359 --> 01:59:05,920
applications to machine learning okay so

3473
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:09,520
what like if you look at the scale of 5

3474
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:12,079
10 20 years is the is it possible

3475
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:13,599
to uh before we understand the nature of

3476
01:59:12,079 --> 01:59:15,840
human intelligence and general

3477
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:19,199
intelligence do you think we'll start

3478
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:21,520
falling out of this exploration

3479
01:59:19,198 --> 01:59:23,759
of neuromorphic systems

3480
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:25,360
ability to solve some of the problems

3481
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:27,599
that the machine learning systems of

3482
01:59:25,359 --> 01:59:29,679
today can't solve

3483
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:32,400
i'm i'm really

3484
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:35,039
hesitant to over promise so

3485
01:59:32,399 --> 01:59:36,879
i i really don't know i also i i don't

3486
01:59:35,039 --> 01:59:39,840
really understand machine learning in a

3487
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:41,359
lot of senses i mean

3488
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:44,400
machine learning

3489
01:59:41,359 --> 01:59:45,759
from my perspective appears to require

3490
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:46,799
that you

3491
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:49,119
know

3492
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:52,000
precisely what your input is

3493
01:59:49,118 --> 01:59:53,359
and also what your goal is you usually

3494
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,679
have some objective function or

3495
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:57,598
something like that and

3496
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:59,760
that's just that's very limiting i mean

3497
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:01,599
of course a lot of times that that's the

3498
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,360
case you know there's a there's a

3499
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:04,719
picture and there's a horse in it so

3500
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:06,479
you're done but that's not a very

3501
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:07,520
interesting problem

3502
02:00:06,479 --> 02:00:09,439
i think

3503
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:10,560
when i when i think about intelligence

3504
02:00:09,439 --> 02:00:12,319
it's

3505
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:14,480
it's almost defined by the ability to

3506
02:00:12,319 --> 02:00:16,158
handle problems where you don't know

3507
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:17,519
what your inputs are going to be and you

3508
02:00:16,158 --> 02:00:19,839
don't even necessarily know what you're

3509
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:21,040
trying to accomplish i mean

3510
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:23,760
i'm not sure what i'm trying to

3511
02:00:21,039 --> 02:00:26,158
accomplish in this world but at all

3512
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:27,520
scales yeah at all scales right i mean

3513
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:31,439
so and sometimes

3514
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:35,199
so i i'm i'm more drawn to

3515
02:00:31,439 --> 02:00:37,198
the underlying phenomena the the

3516
02:00:35,198 --> 02:00:40,000
the critical dynamics of this of this

3517
02:00:37,198 --> 02:00:40,799
system trying to understand

3518
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,158
how

3519
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,599
elements that you build into your

3520
02:00:42,158 --> 02:00:45,279
hardware

3521
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:48,560
result in

3522
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:51,039
emergent fascinating activity

3523
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:52,960
that was very difficult to predict

3524
02:00:51,039 --> 02:00:54,238
things like that so but but but i got to

3525
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:56,158
be really careful because i think a lot

3526
02:00:54,238 --> 02:00:57,839
of other people who if they found

3527
02:00:56,158 --> 02:00:59,839
themselves working on this project in my

3528
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,119
shoes they would say all right what are

3529
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,639
what are all the different ways we can

3530
02:01:01,118 --> 02:01:04,799
use this for machine learning actually

3531
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:07,440
let me let me just definitely mention

3532
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:09,199
colleague nist mike schneider he's also

3533
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:10,719
very much interested

3534
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:11,759
particularly in the super conducting

3535
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:14,158
side of things

3536
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:16,880
using the incredible speed power

3537
02:01:14,158 --> 02:01:18,799
efficiency also ken segall at colgate

3538
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:20,480
other people working on specifically the

3539
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:23,039
superconducting side of this

3540
02:01:20,479 --> 02:01:25,439
for machine learning and

3541
02:01:23,039 --> 02:01:27,519
deep feed-forward neural networks there

3542
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:30,000
the advantages are obvious it's

3543
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:33,280
extremely fast yeah so that's less on

3544
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,760
the nature of intelligences and more on

3545
02:01:33,279 --> 02:01:37,679
various characteristics of this hardware

3546
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:39,840
right yes you can use for the basic

3547
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:41,199
computation as we know it today yeah and

3548
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,199
communication one of the things that

3549
02:01:41,198 --> 02:01:45,439
mike schneider's working on right now is

3550
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:47,198
an image classifier at a relatively

3551
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:48,719
small scale i think he's targeting that

3552
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:51,759
nine pixel problem where you can have

3553
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:54,079
three different characters and um

3554
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:55,360
you just you put in a nine pixel image

3555
02:01:54,079 --> 02:01:59,198
and you classify it as one of these

3556
02:01:55,359 --> 02:02:00,319
three three uh categories and that's

3557
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:02,719
going to be really interesting to see

3558
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:05,599
what happens there because

3559
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:07,679
if you can show that even at that scale

3560
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:09,279
you just put these images in and you get

3561
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:11,599
it out and you can he thinks he can do

3562
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:13,920
it i forgot if it's a nanosecond or some

3563
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:15,679
extra extremely fast classification time

3564
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:17,359
it's probably less it's probably 100

3565
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:19,840
picoseconds or something

3566
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:21,598
there you have challenges though because

3567
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:23,840
the joseph's injunctions themselves the

3568
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:26,159
electronic circuit is extremely power

3569
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:28,159
efficient some orders of magnitude for

3570
02:02:26,158 --> 02:02:29,920
something more than a transistor doing

3571
02:02:28,158 --> 02:02:32,158
the same thing but when you have to cool

3572
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:33,920
it down to 4 kelvin you pay a huge

3573
02:02:32,158 --> 02:02:36,879
overhead just for keeping it cold even

3574
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:39,840
if it's not doing anything so

3575
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:42,079
it's it you ha it has to work at big at

3576
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:43,599
large scale in order to overcome that

3577
02:02:42,079 --> 02:02:46,719
power penalty

3578
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:48,239
but that's possible it's just it's gonna

3579
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:49,279
have to get that performance and this is

3580
02:02:48,238 --> 02:02:50,879
sort of what you were asking about

3581
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:52,639
before is like how much better than

3582
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:54,319
silicon would it need to be

3583
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:56,639
and the answer is i don't know i think

3584
02:02:54,319 --> 02:02:59,118
if it's if it's just overall better than

3585
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:01,440
silicon at a problem that a lot of

3586
02:02:59,118 --> 02:03:03,279
people care about maybe it's

3587
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:04,960
image classification maybe it's face

3588
02:03:03,279 --> 02:03:06,800
recognition maybe it's

3589
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,960
monitoring credit transactions i don't

3590
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:10,320
know then i think it will have a place

3591
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:12,880
it's not going to be in your cell phone

3592
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:14,639
but it could be in your data center

3593
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,319
uh so what about

3594
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:17,840
in terms of the data center i don't know

3595
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:21,118
if you're paying attention to the

3596
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:23,760
various systems like um tesla recently

3597
02:03:21,118 --> 02:03:25,920
now announced uh dojo

3598
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:27,280
which is a large scale machine learning

3599
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:29,039
training system

3600
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:30,880
that again the bottom like there is

3601
02:03:29,039 --> 02:03:32,399
probably going to be communication

3602
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:35,039
between those systems

3603
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:36,719
um is there something from your work on

3604
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:38,639
um

3605
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:41,599
the everything we've been talking about

3606
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:44,560
in terms of superconductive hardware

3607
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:47,679
that could be useful there oh i mean i

3608
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:49,280
okay tomorrow no in the long term it

3609
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:51,118
could be the whole thing it could be

3610
02:03:49,279 --> 02:03:52,800
nothing i i don't know but definitely

3611
02:03:51,118 --> 02:03:54,000
definitely

3612
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,679
um

3613
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,439
when you look at the so i don't know

3614
02:03:55,679 --> 02:04:00,158
that much about dojo my understanding is

3615
02:03:57,439 --> 02:04:02,078
that that's new right that's just just

3616
02:04:00,158 --> 02:04:04,319
coming online well

3617
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:07,599
i don't i don't even know where

3618
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:09,840
uh it's it hasn't come online and and

3619
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:11,520
when you announce big sexy so let me

3620
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:13,760
explain to you the way things work in

3621
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:16,480
the in the world out there in the word

3622
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:18,960
of business and marketing it's not

3623
02:04:16,479 --> 02:04:21,198
always clear where you are on the coming

3624
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:24,078
online part of that so i don't know

3625
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:26,479
where they are exactly but the vision is

3626
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:28,559
from ground up to build up you know a

3627
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:31,359
very very large scale

3628
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:33,119
modular machine learning asic basically

3629
02:04:31,359 --> 02:04:34,719
hardware that's optimized for training

3630
02:04:33,118 --> 02:04:37,519
neural networks and of course there's a

3631
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:39,439
lot of companies that are small and big

3632
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:41,280
working on this kind of problem the

3633
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:44,238
question is how to do it

3634
02:04:41,279 --> 02:04:46,479
in a modular way that uh this has very

3635
02:04:44,238 --> 02:04:49,439
fast communication the interesting

3636
02:04:46,479 --> 02:04:51,519
aspect of tesla is you have a company

3637
02:04:49,439 --> 02:04:53,279
that at least at this time

3638
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:55,280
is so

3639
02:04:53,279 --> 02:04:57,679
singularly focused on solving a

3640
02:04:55,279 --> 02:04:59,920
particular machine learning problem

3641
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:01,840
and is making obviously a lot of money

3642
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:03,679
doing so because the machine learning

3643
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:06,078
problem happens to be involved with

3644
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:07,520
autonomous driving so you have a system

3645
02:05:06,078 --> 02:05:09,679
that's um

3646
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:11,760
driven by an application

3647
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:12,880
and that's really interesting because

3648
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:13,840
you know

3649
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:16,078
uh

3650
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:17,599
you have maybe google working on tpus

3651
02:05:16,078 --> 02:05:19,599
and so on

3652
02:05:17,599 --> 02:05:21,440
you have all these other

3653
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:24,000
companies with asics

3654
02:05:21,439 --> 02:05:25,919
they're usually more kind of always

3655
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,840
thinking general

3656
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:29,599
so i like it when it's driven by a

3657
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:32,078
particular application because then you

3658
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:33,679
can really get to the

3659
02:05:32,078 --> 02:05:36,158
it's like

3660
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:38,399
it's somehow if you just talk broadly

3661
02:05:36,158 --> 02:05:39,198
about intelligence you may not always

3662
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:40,638
get

3663
02:05:39,198 --> 02:05:43,839
to the right solutions it's nice to

3664
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:46,159
couple that sometimes a specific

3665
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:47,920
clear illustration of something that

3666
02:05:46,158 --> 02:05:50,158
requires general intelligence which for

3667
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:51,520
me driving is one such case i think

3668
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:54,319
you're exactly right sometimes just

3669
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:56,079
having that focus on that application

3670
02:05:54,319 --> 02:05:59,039
brings a lot of people focuses their

3671
02:05:56,078 --> 02:06:00,238
energy and attention i think that so one

3672
02:05:59,039 --> 02:06:02,560
of the things that's appealing about

3673
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:04,399
what you're saying is not just that the

3674
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:06,960
application is specific but also that

3675
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:08,719
the scale is big big and that the

3676
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:11,599
benefit is

3677
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:13,840
is also huge so financial and to

3678
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:15,679
humanity right right right yeah so i

3679
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:18,880
guess let me just try to understand is

3680
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:22,239
the point of this dojo system to

3681
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:24,800
figure out the the parameters that then

3682
02:06:22,238 --> 02:06:26,959
plug into neural networks and then

3683
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:29,440
you don't need to retrain you you just

3684
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:31,760
make copies of a certain chip that has

3685
02:06:29,439 --> 02:06:35,598
all the all the parameters established

3686
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:37,840
or no it's straight up retraining a

3687
02:06:35,599 --> 02:06:40,319
large neural network over and over and

3688
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:41,599
over so you have to do it once for every

3689
02:06:40,319 --> 02:06:43,920
new car

3690
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:45,440
no no you have to uh so they do this

3691
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:47,520
interesting process which i think is a

3692
02:06:45,439 --> 02:06:49,279
process for machine learning supervised

3693
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:52,159
machine learning systems

3694
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:54,319
you're going to have to do which is

3695
02:06:52,158 --> 02:06:56,319
you uh have a system you train your

3696
02:06:54,319 --> 02:06:58,559
network once it takes a long time i

3697
02:06:56,319 --> 02:07:00,719
don't know how long but maybe a week

3698
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:03,520
okay the train

3699
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:05,439
and then you deploy it on let's say

3700
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:07,280
about a million cars i don't know what

3701
02:07:05,439 --> 02:07:08,960
the number is that part you just write

3702
02:07:07,279 --> 02:07:12,238
software that updates some weights in a

3703
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:15,198
table and yeah okay but there's a loop

3704
02:07:12,238 --> 02:07:17,919
back yeah yeah okay each of those cars

3705
02:07:15,198 --> 02:07:21,759
run into trouble

3706
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:23,920
rarely but like they they uh

3707
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:25,920
they catch the edge cases of the

3708
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:28,239
performance of that particular system

3709
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:31,359
and then send that data back

3710
02:07:28,238 --> 02:07:32,238
and either automatically or by humans

3711
02:07:31,359 --> 02:07:34,799
that

3712
02:07:32,238 --> 02:07:37,118
weird edge case data is annotated and

3713
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:39,199
then the network has to become smart

3714
02:07:37,118 --> 02:07:41,679
enough to now be able to perform in

3715
02:07:39,198 --> 02:07:43,279
those edge cases so has to get retrained

3716
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:45,118
there's clever ways of retraining

3717
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:47,198
different parts of that network but for

3718
02:07:45,118 --> 02:07:49,519
the most part i think they prefer to

3719
02:07:47,198 --> 02:07:53,198
retrain the entire thing so you have

3720
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:56,800
this giant monster that kind of has to

3721
02:07:53,198 --> 02:08:00,158
be trained regularly i think the vision

3722
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:02,400
with uh dojo is to have a very large

3723
02:08:00,158 --> 02:08:05,839
machine learning focused

3724
02:08:02,399 --> 02:08:07,920
driving focused super computer that then

3725
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:09,279
is sufficiently modular they could be

3726
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:11,359
scaled to other machine learning

3727
02:08:09,279 --> 02:08:12,800
applications right but like so they're

3728
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:14,880
not limiting themselves completely to

3729
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:17,440
this particular application but is this

3730
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:19,359
application is the way they kind of test

3731
02:08:17,439 --> 02:08:20,559
this iterative process of machine

3732
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:23,439
learning is

3733
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:25,039
you make a system that's very dumb

3734
02:08:23,439 --> 02:08:27,279
deploy it

3735
02:08:25,039 --> 02:08:28,960
get the edge cases where it fails make

3736
02:08:27,279 --> 02:08:31,279
it a little smarter it becomes a little

3737
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:33,679
less dumb and that where that iterative

3738
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:35,439
process achieves something that you can

3739
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:36,880
call intelligent or as

3740
02:08:35,439 --> 02:08:38,719
smart enough to be able to solve this

3741
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:39,760
particular application so it has to do

3742
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:40,639
with

3743
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:42,480
uh

3744
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:43,599
training neural networks

3745
02:08:42,479 --> 02:08:45,198
fast

3746
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:48,078
and training neural networks that are

3747
02:08:45,198 --> 02:08:50,719
large but also based on an extraordinary

3748
02:08:48,078 --> 02:08:52,559
amount of diverse input data yeah and

3749
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:55,679
that's one of the things so this does

3750
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:57,840
seem like one of those spaces where

3751
02:08:55,679 --> 02:09:01,118
the the scale of superconducting

3752
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:02,719
optoelectronics the way that um so when

3753
02:09:01,118 --> 02:09:04,078
you talk about the weaknesses like i

3754
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:06,000
said okay well you have to cool it down

3755
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:08,479
at this scale that's fine that's because

3756
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:10,399
that's not that's not an too much of an

3757
02:09:08,479 --> 02:09:12,000
added cost most of your power is being

3758
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:14,319
dissipated by the circuits themselves

3759
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,840
not the cooling and also

3760
02:09:14,319 --> 02:09:19,679
you have one

3761
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:20,719
centralized kind of cognitive hub if you

3762
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:22,319
will

3763
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:24,880
and so

3764
02:09:22,319 --> 02:09:27,599
when if we're talking about putting a

3765
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:29,279
superconducting system in a car that's a

3766
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:30,960
that's questionable do you really want

3767
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:32,399
to cryostat in the trunk of everyone

3768
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:34,158
your car it'll fit it's not that big of

3769
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:35,839
a deal but

3770
02:09:34,158 --> 02:09:38,319
hopefully there's a better way right but

3771
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:40,319
since this is sort of a central supreme

3772
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:43,439
intelligence or something like that

3773
02:09:40,319 --> 02:09:45,679
and it's it needs to really have this

3774
02:09:43,439 --> 02:09:47,039
massive data acquisition massive data

3775
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:48,399
integration

3776
02:09:47,039 --> 02:09:50,238
i would think that that's where

3777
02:09:48,399 --> 02:09:51,759
large-scale spiking neural networks with

3778
02:09:50,238 --> 02:09:53,279
vast communication and all these things

3779
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:54,719
would would have something pretty

3780
02:09:53,279 --> 02:09:56,238
tremendous to offer it's not going to

3781
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:58,239
happen tomorrow there's a lot of

3782
02:09:56,238 --> 02:09:59,598
development that needs to be done

3783
02:09:58,238 --> 02:10:01,039
but you know

3784
02:09:59,599 --> 02:10:02,719
we have to be patient with self-driving

3785
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:04,238
cars for a lot of reasons we were all

3786
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:07,198
optimistic that they would be here by

3787
02:10:04,238 --> 02:10:09,039
now and okay they are to some extent but

3788
02:10:07,198 --> 02:10:11,439
if we're thinking five or ten years down

3789
02:10:09,039 --> 02:10:12,960
the line it it's it's not

3790
02:10:11,439 --> 02:10:14,719
unreasonable one other thing i'll just

3791
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:16,639
let me just mention

3792
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:18,560
that getting into self-driving cars and

3793
02:10:16,639 --> 02:10:20,800
technologies that are using ai out in

3794
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:23,840
the world this is something nist cares a

3795
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:26,880
lot about elham dabasi is leading up a

3796
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:29,279
much larger effort in ai at nist than

3797
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:30,078
than my my little project

3798
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:31,439
and

3799
02:10:30,078 --> 02:10:33,359
really

3800
02:10:31,439 --> 02:10:35,039
central to that mission is this concept

3801
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:35,920
of trustworthiness

3802
02:10:35,039 --> 02:10:38,158
so

3803
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:39,840
when you're going to deploy this neural

3804
02:10:38,158 --> 02:10:42,158
network

3805
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:44,480
in every single automobile with so much

3806
02:10:42,158 --> 02:10:46,879
on the line you have to be able to trust

3807
02:10:44,479 --> 02:10:48,238
that so now how do we know how do we

3808
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:49,679
know that we can trust that how do we

3809
02:10:48,238 --> 02:10:52,559
know that we can trust the self-driving

3810
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:53,679
car or the the supercomputer that that

3811
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:54,960
trained it

3812
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:57,199
there's a lot of work there and there's

3813
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:59,599
a lot of that going on at nist and we're

3814
02:10:57,198 --> 02:11:01,198
it's still early days i mean

3815
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:03,599
you're familiar with the yeah yeah and

3816
02:11:01,198 --> 02:11:05,519
all that but there's a fascinating dance

3817
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:06,560
in engineering with like safety critical

3818
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:08,800
systems

3819
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:11,520
there's a desire in computer science i

3820
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:14,239
just recently talked to don knuth

3821
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:16,239
to to uh you know for algorithms and for

3822
02:11:14,238 --> 02:11:18,479
systems for them to be provably correct

3823
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:20,158
or provably safe and

3824
02:11:18,479 --> 02:11:22,399
you know this is one other difference

3825
02:11:20,158 --> 02:11:24,799
between humans and biological systems is

3826
02:11:22,399 --> 02:11:27,920
we're not provably anything right right

3827
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:31,520
and so there's uh some aspect of uh

3828
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:34,800
imperfection yes that we need to have

3829
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:35,760
built in like robustness to imperfection

3830
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:38,800
um

3831
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:40,400
be part of our systems which is a

3832
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:42,400
difficult thing for engineers to contend

3833
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:44,000
with they're very uncomfortable with the

3834
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:47,039
idea that

3835
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:49,679
you have to be okay with failure and

3836
02:11:47,039 --> 02:11:51,599
almost engineer failure into the system

3837
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:53,279
mathematicians hate it too but i think

3838
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:54,960
it was i think it was turing who said

3839
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:57,198
something along the lines of

3840
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:59,760
i can give you an intelligent system or

3841
02:11:57,198 --> 02:12:02,238
i can give you a flawless system but i

3842
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:04,400
can't give you both and it's in sort of

3843
02:12:02,238 --> 02:12:06,598
creativity and abstract thinking seem to

3844
02:12:04,399 --> 02:12:09,279
rely somewhat on

3845
02:12:06,599 --> 02:12:10,400
stochasticity and um

3846
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:12,399
not

3847
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:14,319
having components that perform exactly

3848
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:16,078
the same way every time this is where

3849
02:12:14,319 --> 02:12:18,158
like the disagreement i have with not

3850
02:12:16,078 --> 02:12:19,759
disagreement but a different view on the

3851
02:12:18,158 --> 02:12:21,359
world i'm with touring

3852
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:22,880
when i talk to

3853
02:12:21,359 --> 02:12:25,198
robotic

3854
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:27,440
uh robot colleagues that sounds like i'm

3855
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:29,759
talking to robots colleagues that are

3856
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:31,919
roboticists

3857
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:33,440
the goal is perfection

3858
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:35,840
and to me is like

3859
02:12:33,439 --> 02:12:38,078
no i think the goal

3860
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:40,960
should be um

3861
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:42,880
imperfection that's communicated

3862
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:46,480
and through the interaction between

3863
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:49,520
humans and robots that imperfection

3864
02:12:46,479 --> 02:12:52,238
becomes um a feature not a bug right

3865
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:54,079
like together as a seen as a system the

3866
02:12:52,238 --> 02:12:56,479
human and the robot together are better

3867
02:12:54,078 --> 02:12:59,359
than any either of them individually but

3868
02:12:56,479 --> 02:13:02,000
the robot itself is not perfect any in

3869
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:04,319
in any way of course there's had a bunch

3870
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,198
of disagreements including with mr elon

3871
02:13:04,319 --> 02:13:06,319
about

3872
02:13:05,198 --> 02:13:08,000
uh

3873
02:13:06,319 --> 02:13:10,000
to me autonomous driving is

3874
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,399
fundamentally a human robot interaction

3875
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,639
problem not a robotics problem right

3876
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:16,799
elon is a robotics problem that's

3877
02:13:14,639 --> 02:13:19,199
actually an open

3878
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:23,440
and fascinating question whether humans

3879
02:13:19,198 --> 02:13:23,439
can be removed from the loop completely

3880
02:13:24,399 --> 02:13:28,638
we've talked about a lot of fascinating

3881
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:31,920
chemistry and

3882
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:34,078
physics and engineering and we're always

3883
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:36,158
running up against this issue that

3884
02:13:34,078 --> 02:13:37,439
nature seems to dictate what's easy and

3885
02:13:36,158 --> 02:13:40,000
what's hard

3886
02:13:37,439 --> 02:13:43,598
so you have this uh cool little paper

3887
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:45,920
that i'd love to just ask you about

3888
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:48,159
it's titled does cosmological evolution

3889
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:49,199
select for technology

3890
02:13:48,158 --> 02:13:50,479
so

3891
02:13:49,198 --> 02:13:52,158
in physics

3892
02:13:50,479 --> 02:13:54,399
there's uh

3893
02:13:52,158 --> 02:13:56,078
parameters that seem to define the way

3894
02:13:54,399 --> 02:13:58,479
our universe works

3895
02:13:56,078 --> 02:14:00,479
that physics works that if it worked any

3896
02:13:58,479 --> 02:14:02,479
differently we would get a very

3897
02:14:00,479 --> 02:14:04,399
different world so it seems like the

3898
02:14:02,479 --> 02:14:06,399
parameters are very fine-tuned to the

3899
02:14:04,399 --> 02:14:08,399
kind of physics that we see

3900
02:14:06,399 --> 02:14:10,319
all the beautiful e equals mc squared

3901
02:14:08,399 --> 02:14:13,039
that would get these nice beautiful laws

3902
02:14:10,319 --> 02:14:16,000
it seems like very fine-tuned for that

3903
02:14:13,039 --> 02:14:19,198
so what you argue in this article

3904
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:22,479
is uh it may be that the universe has

3905
02:14:19,198 --> 02:14:25,359
also fine-tuned its parameters

3906
02:14:22,479 --> 02:14:27,198
that enable the kind of technological

3907
02:14:25,359 --> 02:14:30,000
innovation that we see

3908
02:14:27,198 --> 02:14:32,238
that technology that we see can you can

3909
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,920
you explain this idea yeah i think

3910
02:14:32,238 --> 02:14:35,359
you've introduced it nicely let me let

3911
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:37,599
me just

3912
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:39,118
try to say a few things in in

3913
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:41,199
my language

3914
02:14:39,118 --> 02:14:42,719
leia what is what is this fine-tuning

3915
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:45,279
problem so

3916
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:46,560
physicists have spent centuries

3917
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:47,679
trying to understand

3918
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:50,239
the

3919
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:52,239
the system of equations that govern the

3920
02:14:50,238 --> 02:14:53,279
way nature behaves the way particles

3921
02:14:52,238 --> 02:14:55,039
move and

3922
02:14:53,279 --> 02:14:58,800
interact with each other

3923
02:14:55,039 --> 02:15:00,719
and as that understanding has become

3924
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:05,279
more clear over time

3925
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:09,679
it it it became sort of evident that

3926
02:15:05,279 --> 02:15:12,960
it's all it's all well adjusted to allow

3927
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:16,399
a universe like like we see very complex

3928
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:19,279
this this large long-lived universe

3929
02:15:16,399 --> 02:15:20,960
and so one one answer to that is well of

3930
02:15:19,279 --> 02:15:23,599
course it is because we wouldn't be here

3931
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:25,118
otherwise but um i don't know that's not

3932
02:15:23,599 --> 02:15:26,639
very satisfying that's sort of that's

3933
02:15:25,118 --> 02:15:28,799
what's known as the weak anthropic

3934
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:30,800
principle it's a statement of selection

3935
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:32,320
bias we can only observe a universe that

3936
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:34,560
is fit for us

3937
02:15:32,319 --> 02:15:36,078
to to live in so what does it mean for a

3938
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:36,960
universe to be fit for us to live in

3939
02:15:36,078 --> 02:15:40,078
well

3940
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:42,480
the pursuit of physics it is based

3941
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:44,719
partially on coming up with equations

3942
02:15:42,479 --> 02:15:46,319
that describe how things behave and

3943
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:48,560
interact with each other

3944
02:15:46,319 --> 02:15:50,158
but in all those equations you have so

3945
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:52,239
there's the form of the equation sort of

3946
02:15:50,158 --> 02:15:55,279
how how different

3947
02:15:52,238 --> 02:15:56,319
fields or particles um move in space and

3948
02:15:55,279 --> 02:15:58,399
time

3949
02:15:56,319 --> 02:15:59,198
but then they're also the the parameters

3950
02:15:58,399 --> 02:16:01,359
that

3951
02:15:59,198 --> 02:16:02,238
just tell you sort of the strength of

3952
02:16:01,359 --> 02:16:04,719
different

3953
02:16:02,238 --> 02:16:06,479
couplings how strongly does a charged

3954
02:16:04,719 --> 02:16:09,840
particle couple to the electromagnetic

3955
02:16:06,479 --> 02:16:11,598
field or masses how how strongly does a

3956
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:12,960
a particle couple to the higgs field or

3957
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:13,840
something like that

3958
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:16,480
and

3959
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:19,039
those parameters that define

3960
02:16:16,479 --> 02:16:20,638
that not not the general structure of

3961
02:16:19,039 --> 02:16:23,599
the equations but the

3962
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:25,199
relative importance of different terms

3963
02:16:23,599 --> 02:16:26,719
they seem to be every bit as important

3964
02:16:25,198 --> 02:16:29,279
as the the structure of the equations

3965
02:16:26,719 --> 02:16:30,880
themselves and so i forget who it was

3966
02:16:29,279 --> 02:16:33,199
somebody when they were working through

3967
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:34,719
this and trying to see okay if i adjust

3968
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:36,319
the parameter this parameter over here

3969
02:16:34,718 --> 02:16:38,318
call it the say the fine structure

3970
02:16:36,318 --> 02:16:41,119
constant which tells us the strength of

3971
02:16:38,318 --> 02:16:42,799
the electromagnetic interaction oh boy i

3972
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:44,880
can't change it very much otherwise

3973
02:16:42,799 --> 02:16:46,718
nothing works the universe sort of

3974
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:48,318
doesn't it just pops into existence and

3975
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:50,318
goes away in a nanosecond or something

3976
02:16:48,318 --> 02:16:52,959
like that and and somebody had the

3977
02:16:50,318 --> 02:16:53,920
phrase this looks like a put up job

3978
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:56,000
meaning

3979
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:57,200
every one of these parameters was dialed

3980
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,040
in

3981
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,800
it's arguable how

3982
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:03,040
precisely they have to be dialed in but

3983
02:17:00,799 --> 02:17:04,638
dialed in to some extent

3984
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:06,719
not just in order to enable our

3985
02:17:04,638 --> 02:17:09,438
existence that's a very anthropocentric

3986
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:11,759
view but to enable a universe like this

3987
02:17:09,439 --> 02:17:14,960
one so okay maybe

3988
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:16,960
i think the majority position of working

3989
02:17:14,959 --> 02:17:18,478
physicists in the field is

3990
02:17:16,959 --> 02:17:19,678
it has to be that way in order for us to

3991
02:17:18,478 --> 02:17:21,760
exist we're here we shouldn't be

3992
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:23,840
surprised that that's the way

3993
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:26,318
the universe is and i don't know for a

3994
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:27,359
while that never sat well with me but i

3995
02:17:26,318 --> 02:17:29,359
just kind of

3996
02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:31,359
moved on because there are things to do

3997
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:33,200
and a lot of exciting work doesn't

3998
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:35,280
depend on resolving this

3999
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:38,000
puzzle but

4000
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:40,639
as i started working more

4001
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,398
with technology getting into the more

4002
02:17:40,638 --> 02:17:43,679
recent years of my careers particularly

4003
02:17:42,398 --> 02:17:45,679
when i started

4004
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:47,679
after having worked with silicon for a

4005
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:49,439
long time which was

4006
02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:51,120
kind of eerie on its own but then when i

4007
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:52,079
switched over to superconductor i was

4008
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:53,519
just like

4009
02:17:52,079 --> 02:17:57,519
this is crazy

4010
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:58,800
it's just absolutely um astonishing that

4011
02:17:57,519 --> 02:18:00,880
our universe

4012
02:17:58,799 --> 02:18:02,398
gives us super conductivity it's one of

4013
02:18:00,879 --> 02:18:03,638
the most beautiful physical phenomena

4014
02:18:02,398 --> 02:18:06,638
and it's also

4015
02:18:03,638 --> 02:18:08,239
extraordinarily useful for technology so

4016
02:18:06,638 --> 02:18:10,718
you can argue that the universe has to

4017
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:12,239
have the parameters it does for us to

4018
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:14,000
exist because we couldn't be here

4019
02:18:12,239 --> 02:18:16,000
otherwise but why does it give us

4020
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:18,879
technology why does it give us

4021
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:21,200
silicon that has this ideal oxide that

4022
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:23,839
allows us to make a transistor without

4023
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:25,439
trying that hard

4024
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:27,840
that can't be explained by the same

4025
02:18:25,439 --> 02:18:30,398
anthropic reasoning

4026
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:31,760
yeah so it's asking the why question i

4027
02:18:30,398 --> 02:18:33,679
mean the

4028
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:36,719
a slight natural extension of that

4029
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:39,439
question is i wonder if

4030
02:18:36,718 --> 02:18:41,839
the parameters were different

4031
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:45,359
if we would simply have just

4032
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:47,439
another set of paint brushes to create

4033
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:49,120
totally other things that wouldn't like

4034
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:51,120
like that wouldn't look like anything

4035
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:52,960
like the technology of today but would

4036
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:55,120
nevertheless have

4037
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:56,799
incredible complexity which is if you

4038
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:58,479
sort of zoom out and start defining

4039
02:18:56,799 --> 02:19:01,518
things not by

4040
02:18:58,478 --> 02:19:03,599
uh like how many batteries it needs and

4041
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:05,519
whether it can make toast

4042
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:07,040
but more like how much complexities

4043
02:19:05,519 --> 02:19:08,960
within the system or something like that

4044
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:10,559
right well yeah you can you can start to

4045
02:19:08,959 --> 02:19:12,159
quantify things like you're exactly

4046
02:19:10,558 --> 02:19:14,718
right so

4047
02:19:12,159 --> 02:19:16,478
nowhere am i arguing that in all of the

4048
02:19:14,718 --> 02:19:18,318
vast parameter space of everything that

4049
02:19:16,478 --> 02:19:20,558
could conceivably exist in the

4050
02:19:18,318 --> 02:19:22,879
multiverse of nature

4051
02:19:20,558 --> 02:19:25,840
there is this one point in parameter

4052
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:28,159
space where complexity arises i i doubt

4053
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:30,558
it it that would be

4054
02:19:28,159 --> 02:19:34,079
a shameful waste of resources it seems

4055
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:36,079
yeah but it might be that we reside at

4056
02:19:34,079 --> 02:19:37,120
one place in parameter space that has

4057
02:19:36,079 --> 02:19:39,439
been

4058
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:42,479
um adapted through an evolutionary

4059
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:44,880
process to allow us to make certain

4060
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:48,000
technologies that that allow our our

4061
02:19:44,879 --> 02:19:50,079
particular kind of universe to arise and

4062
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:52,000
sort of achieve the things it does see i

4063
02:19:50,079 --> 02:19:55,039
wonder if nature in this kind of

4064
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:57,040
discussion if nature is a catalyst for

4065
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,880
innovation or if it's a ceiling for

4066
02:19:57,040 --> 02:20:01,920
innovation so like

4067
02:19:58,879 --> 02:20:03,839
is it going to always limit us like what

4068
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:05,760
you're talking about silicon

4069
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:08,000
is it just make it super easy to do

4070
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:09,680
awesome stuff in a certain dimension but

4071
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,478
we could still do awesome stuff in other

4072
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:15,680
ways it'll just be harder or it doesn't

4073
02:20:12,478 --> 02:20:18,079
really set like the maximum we can do

4074
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:20,159
this that's a good thing to that's a

4075
02:20:18,079 --> 02:20:22,318
good subject to discuss i guess i feel

4076
02:20:20,159 --> 02:20:24,879
like we need to lay a little bit more

4077
02:20:22,318 --> 02:20:27,119
groundwork so i want to make sure that

4078
02:20:24,879 --> 02:20:27,119
um

4079
02:20:27,439 --> 02:20:32,559
i introduce this in the context of lee

4080
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:35,200
smolin's previous idea so who's lee

4081
02:20:32,559 --> 02:20:38,079
smolin and what kind of ideas does he

4082
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:39,840
have okay lee smolin is a theoretical

4083
02:20:38,079 --> 02:20:42,318
physicist who

4084
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:44,960
back in the late 1980s published a paper

4085
02:20:42,318 --> 02:20:47,279
in the early 1990s introduced this idea

4086
02:20:44,959 --> 02:20:49,519
of cosmological natural selection which

4087
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:52,399
argues that

4088
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:56,000
the universe did evolve so his paper was

4089
02:20:52,398 --> 02:20:58,639
called did the universe evolve and

4090
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:01,439
i gave myself the liberty of titling my

4091
02:20:58,639 --> 02:21:03,039
paper does cosmological selection or

4092
02:21:01,439 --> 02:21:05,840
just cosmological evolution select for

4093
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:08,720
technology in reference to that so he

4094
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:10,559
introduced that idea decades ago now he

4095
02:21:08,719 --> 02:21:13,119
primarily works on

4096
02:21:10,559 --> 02:21:15,439
um quantum gravity loop quantum gravity

4097
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:16,640
other approaches to

4098
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:18,318
um

4099
02:21:16,639 --> 02:21:20,959
unifying quantum mechanics with general

4100
02:21:18,318 --> 02:21:22,719
relativity as you can read about in his

4101
02:21:20,959 --> 02:21:24,318
most recent book i believe and he's been

4102
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:27,679
on your show as well

4103
02:21:24,318 --> 02:21:29,279
so but i i want to introduce this idea

4104
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:30,880
of cosmological natural selection

4105
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:34,399
because i think that is

4106
02:21:30,879 --> 02:21:36,000
one of the core ideas that could change

4107
02:21:34,398 --> 02:21:37,680
our understanding of

4108
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,760
how the universe got here our role in it

4109
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:41,280
what technology's doing here

4110
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:43,200
but there's a couple more pieces that

4111
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:45,280
need to be set up first so the beginning

4112
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:47,359
of our universe is

4113
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:49,439
largely accepted to be the big bang and

4114
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:50,800
what that means is if you look back in

4115
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:54,000
time by looking

4116
02:21:50,799 --> 02:21:56,799
far away in space you see that um

4117
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:59,040
everything used to be at at one point

4118
02:21:56,799 --> 02:22:00,559
and it expanded away from there there

4119
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:02,960
was a uh

4120
02:22:00,559 --> 02:22:05,439
era in the evolutionary process of our

4121
02:22:02,959 --> 02:22:08,079
universe that was called inflation and

4122
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:10,318
this idea was developed primarily by

4123
02:22:08,079 --> 02:22:13,039
alan guth and and others andre linde and

4124
02:22:10,318 --> 02:22:15,039
other others in the 80s

4125
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:18,160
and this idea of inflation is is

4126
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:19,680
basically that when a

4127
02:22:18,159 --> 02:22:21,119
a singularity

4128
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:22,880
uh

4129
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:25,120
begins this process

4130
02:22:22,879 --> 02:22:28,000
of of growth

4131
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:31,439
there can be a temporary stage where it

4132
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,478
just accelerates incredibly rapidly and

4133
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:34,398
based on

4134
02:22:32,478 --> 02:22:36,559
quantum field theory this tells us that

4135
02:22:34,398 --> 02:22:38,639
this should produce matter in precisely

4136
02:22:36,559 --> 02:22:41,359
the proportions that we find of hydrogen

4137
02:22:38,639 --> 02:22:43,920
and helium and the big bang lithium-2

4138
02:22:41,359 --> 02:22:45,359
lithium also um

4139
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:47,040
and other things too so so the

4140
02:22:45,359 --> 02:22:49,520
predictions that come out of big bang

4141
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:52,399
inflationary cosmology have stood up

4142
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:54,960
extremely well to empirical verification

4143
02:22:52,398 --> 02:22:56,559
the cosmic microwave background

4144
02:22:54,959 --> 02:22:59,438
things like this so

4145
02:22:56,559 --> 02:23:00,719
most scientists working in the field

4146
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:02,800
think that

4147
02:23:00,719 --> 02:23:03,679
the origin of our universe is the big

4148
02:23:02,799 --> 02:23:05,119
bang

4149
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,920
and i i

4150
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:09,520
base all my thinking on that as well

4151
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:11,520
i'm just laying this out there so that

4152
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:13,520
people understand

4153
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:16,720
that where i'm coming from is an

4154
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:19,040
extension not a replacement of

4155
02:23:16,719 --> 02:23:22,879
of existing well-founded ideas

4156
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:26,560
in a paper i believe it was 1986 with uh

4157
02:23:22,879 --> 02:23:27,679
alan guth and um another author farhy

4158
02:23:26,559 --> 02:23:30,478
they

4159
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:32,159
they wrote that a a big bang i don't

4160
02:23:30,478 --> 02:23:34,398
remember the exact quote a big bang is

4161
02:23:32,159 --> 02:23:37,439
inextric inextricably linked with a

4162
02:23:34,398 --> 02:23:39,199
black hole this singularity that we call

4163
02:23:37,439 --> 02:23:41,280
our origin

4164
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:43,120
is mathematically indistinguishable from

4165
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:44,239
a black hole they're they're the same

4166
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:48,079
thing

4167
02:23:44,239 --> 02:23:50,000
and lee smolin based his thinking uh on

4168
02:23:48,079 --> 02:23:51,840
that idea i i believe i don't mean to

4169
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,959
speak for him but this is my reading of

4170
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:55,920
it so

4171
02:23:52,959 --> 02:23:58,159
what lee smullen will say is that

4172
02:23:55,920 --> 02:24:00,639
a black hole in one universe is a big

4173
02:23:58,159 --> 02:24:03,359
bang in another universe

4174
02:24:00,639 --> 02:24:05,840
and this allows us to have

4175
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:08,318
progeny offspring so uh

4176
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:10,398
a universe can be said to have come

4177
02:24:08,318 --> 02:24:12,959
before another universe

4178
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:16,079
and very crucially small and arguably

4179
02:24:12,959 --> 02:24:18,000
argues i i think this is potentially one

4180
02:24:16,079 --> 02:24:19,439
of the great ideas of all time that's my

4181
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,359
opinion that

4182
02:24:19,439 --> 02:24:23,359
when a black hole forms it's not a

4183
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:25,439
classical entity it's a quantum

4184
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:27,439
gravitational entity so there it is

4185
02:24:25,439 --> 02:24:31,200
subject to the fluctuations that are

4186
02:24:27,439 --> 02:24:32,800
inherent in quantum mechanics

4187
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:34,479
the

4188
02:24:32,799 --> 02:24:36,799
the properties that what we're calling

4189
02:24:34,478 --> 02:24:38,559
the parameters that describe the physics

4190
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:40,959
of that system

4191
02:24:38,559 --> 02:24:43,519
are subject to slight mutations so that

4192
02:24:40,959 --> 02:24:45,679
the offspring universe does not have the

4193
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:48,319
exact same parameters defining its

4194
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:49,920
physics as its parent universe

4195
02:24:48,318 --> 02:24:51,439
they're close but they're a little bit

4196
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:53,760
different and so now you have a

4197
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:55,120
mechanism for

4198
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:57,120
evolution

4199
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:59,600
for natural selection

4200
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:01,760
so this mutation so there's

4201
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:03,840
and then if you think about the

4202
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:06,398
the dna of the universe are the basic

4203
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:07,520
parameters that govern its laws exactly

4204
02:25:06,398 --> 02:25:10,398
so so

4205
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:12,960
that so what smallin said is our

4206
02:25:10,398 --> 02:25:14,799
universe results from an evolutionary

4207
02:25:12,959 --> 02:25:17,599
process that can be traced back some he

4208
02:25:14,799 --> 02:25:19,279
estimated 200 million generations

4209
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:22,399
initially there was something like a

4210
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:24,880
vacuum fluctuation that produced

4211
02:25:22,398 --> 02:25:26,799
through through random chance uh

4212
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:28,719
a universe that was able to reproduce

4213
02:25:26,799 --> 02:25:30,318
just once so now it had one offspring

4214
02:25:28,719 --> 02:25:33,039
and then over time it was able to make

4215
02:25:30,318 --> 02:25:34,799
more and more until it evolved into a

4216
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:37,680
highly structured

4217
02:25:34,799 --> 02:25:40,398
universe with a very long lifetime with

4218
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:42,800
a great deal of complexity and

4219
02:25:40,398 --> 02:25:44,159
importantly especially importantly for

4220
02:25:42,799 --> 02:25:45,519
lee smolin

4221
02:25:44,159 --> 02:25:48,000
stars

4222
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:50,239
stars make black holes therefore we

4223
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,239
should expect our universe to be

4224
02:25:50,239 --> 02:25:54,799
optimized have its physical parameters

4225
02:25:52,239 --> 02:25:57,199
optimized to make very large numbers of

4226
02:25:54,799 --> 02:25:59,599
stars because that's how you make black

4227
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:01,680
holes and black holes make offspring so

4228
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:04,479
we expect our the physics of our

4229
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:06,960
universe to have evolved to maximize

4230
02:26:04,478 --> 02:26:09,358
fecundity the number of offspring and

4231
02:26:06,959 --> 02:26:12,079
the way lee smolin argues you do that is

4232
02:26:09,359 --> 02:26:13,600
through stars that the biggest ones die

4233
02:26:12,079 --> 02:26:17,120
in these core collapse supernova that

4234
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:21,359
make a black hole and a child

4235
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:23,760
okay first of all i agree with you that

4236
02:26:21,359 --> 02:26:25,840
this is back to our fractal view of

4237
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:27,120
everything from intelligence to our

4238
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:29,439
universe

4239
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:31,040
that is very compelling and a very

4240
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:32,880
powerful idea

4241
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:34,800
that um

4242
02:26:32,879 --> 02:26:36,879
unites

4243
02:26:34,799 --> 02:26:39,599
the origin of life and perhaps the

4244
02:26:36,879 --> 02:26:41,519
origin of ideas and intelligence

4245
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:43,920
so from a dawkins perspective here on

4246
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:47,040
earth the evolution of those

4247
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:50,879
and then the evolution of the laws of

4248
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:52,880
physics that led to us

4249
02:26:50,879 --> 02:26:55,599
i mean it's beautiful and then you

4250
02:26:52,879 --> 02:26:57,438
stacking on top of that that maybe we

4251
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:58,800
are one of the offspring

4252
02:26:57,439 --> 02:27:01,040
right okay so

4253
02:26:58,799 --> 02:27:03,279
before getting into

4254
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:05,280
where i'd like to take that idea let me

4255
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:07,439
just a little bit more groundwork there

4256
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:09,280
is this concept of the multiverse and it

4257
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:11,680
it can be confusing different people use

4258
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:12,720
the word multiverse in different ways

4259
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:13,600
in

4260
02:27:12,719 --> 02:27:15,039
in the

4261
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:17,520
multiverse

4262
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:20,800
that i think is relevant to picture when

4263
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:22,800
trying to grasp lee smolin's idea

4264
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:24,879
essentially every

4265
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:27,920
every vacuum fluctuation can be referred

4266
02:27:24,879 --> 02:27:29,519
to as a universe it it occurs it borrows

4267
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:31,600
energy from the vacuum for some finite

4268
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:32,960
amount of time and it evanesces back

4269
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:35,200
into

4270
02:27:32,959 --> 02:27:38,478
the quantum vacuum and

4271
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:40,479
ideas of uh guth before that and and

4272
02:27:38,478 --> 02:27:42,719
andre linday with uh

4273
02:27:40,478 --> 02:27:44,799
eternal inflation aren't that different

4274
02:27:42,719 --> 02:27:46,799
that you would expect nature

4275
02:27:44,799 --> 02:27:48,879
due to the the quantum properties of the

4276
02:27:46,799 --> 02:27:50,318
vacuum which we we know exists they're

4277
02:27:48,879 --> 02:27:52,559
they're measurable through things like

4278
02:27:50,318 --> 02:27:53,760
the casimir effect and others

4279
02:27:52,559 --> 02:27:55,840
you know that there are these

4280
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:58,318
fluctuations that are occurring what

4281
02:27:55,840 --> 02:28:01,120
what smallin is arguing is that there is

4282
02:27:58,318 --> 02:28:03,279
this extensive multiverse that we this

4283
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:05,920
universe what we can

4284
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:07,359
measure and interact with is not unique

4285
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:10,159
in nature

4286
02:28:07,359 --> 02:28:11,920
it's just our residence it's it's where

4287
02:28:10,159 --> 02:28:13,600
we reside and there are countless

4288
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:15,439
potentially infinity

4289
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:18,079
other universes other entire

4290
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:19,600
evolutionary trajectories that have

4291
02:28:18,079 --> 02:28:21,439
evolved into things like what you were

4292
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:23,600
mentioning a second ago with different

4293
02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:25,200
parameters and different

4294
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:27,439
ways of achieving complexity and

4295
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:30,399
reproduction and all that stuff so it's

4296
02:28:27,439 --> 02:28:33,520
not that the evolutionary process

4297
02:28:30,398 --> 02:28:35,920
is a funnel towards this end point not

4298
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:37,520
at all just like the biological

4299
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:40,559
evolutionary process that has occurred

4300
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:43,200
within our universe is not

4301
02:28:40,559 --> 02:28:45,680
a unique route toward achieving one

4302
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:46,960
specific chosen kind of species no we we

4303
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,280
have

4304
02:28:46,959 --> 02:28:51,039
extraordinary diversity around us that's

4305
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:53,359
what evolution does and for any one

4306
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:55,520
species like us it might feel like we're

4307
02:28:53,359 --> 02:28:57,439
at the center of the process we're the

4308
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:58,960
destination of this process but we're

4309
02:28:57,439 --> 02:29:01,680
just one of the many

4310
02:28:58,959 --> 02:29:03,839
uh nearly infinite branches of this

4311
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:06,000
process and i suspect it is exactly

4312
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:07,520
infinite i mean i just can't understand

4313
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:09,760
how

4314
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:11,680
with this idea you can never draw a

4315
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:14,239
boundary around and say no the uni the

4316
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:15,280
universe i mean the multiverse has ten

4317
02:29:14,239 --> 02:29:18,239
to the

4318
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:20,239
one quadrillion components but not

4319
02:29:18,239 --> 02:29:23,920
infinity i don't know that that's well

4320
02:29:20,239 --> 02:29:26,239
yeah i have uh cognitively in incapable

4321
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:28,239
as i think all of us are and

4322
02:29:26,239 --> 02:29:30,398
truly understanding the concept of

4323
02:29:28,239 --> 02:29:33,520
infinity and the concept of nothing as

4324
02:29:30,398 --> 02:29:36,478
well and nothing but also the concept of

4325
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:38,479
a lot is pretty difficult

4326
02:29:36,478 --> 02:29:40,159
i could just i can count i run out of

4327
02:29:38,478 --> 02:29:41,358
fingers yeah at a certain point and then

4328
02:29:40,159 --> 02:29:42,559
you're screwed and when you're wearing

4329
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:44,318
shoes and you can't even get down to

4330
02:29:42,559 --> 02:29:47,199
your toes it's like

4331
02:29:44,318 --> 02:29:49,519
it's like a thousand fine a million is

4332
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:51,600
that what and then it gets crazier and

4333
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:53,359
crazier right right

4334
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:55,680
so this particular so when we say

4335
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:56,960
technology by the way

4336
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:58,239
i mean

4337
02:29:56,959 --> 02:30:00,879
there's some

4338
02:29:58,239 --> 02:30:02,879
not to over romanticize the thing but

4339
02:30:00,879 --> 02:30:06,478
there is some aspect about this branch

4340
02:30:02,879 --> 02:30:09,679
of ours that allows us to um for the

4341
02:30:06,478 --> 02:30:12,398
universe to know itself yes yes so to be

4342
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:15,040
to to have like little

4343
02:30:12,398 --> 02:30:16,799
conscious cognitive fingers

4344
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:18,800
they're able to feel

4345
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:21,039
like to scratch the head right right

4346
02:30:18,799 --> 02:30:22,478
right uh to to be able to construct e

4347
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:25,040
equals something squared and to

4348
02:30:22,478 --> 02:30:27,358
introspect to have to start to gain some

4349
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:29,280
understanding of the laws that govern it

4350
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:32,000
isn't that um

4351
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:34,479
isn't that kind of uh amazing you know

4352
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:36,559
okay i'm just human but

4353
02:30:34,478 --> 02:30:39,519
it feels like that if i were to build a

4354
02:30:36,559 --> 02:30:41,680
system that does this kind of thing that

4355
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:44,159
involves laws of physics that evolves

4356
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:45,359
life that involves intelligence that my

4357
02:30:44,159 --> 02:30:47,200
goal would be

4358
02:30:45,359 --> 02:30:48,880
to come up with things that are able to

4359
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:51,520
think about itself

4360
02:30:48,879 --> 02:30:54,639
right aren't we kind of close to the

4361
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:56,239
the the design specs the destination

4362
02:30:54,639 --> 02:30:58,239
we're pretty close i don't know i mean

4363
02:30:56,239 --> 02:30:59,760
i'm spending my career designing things

4364
02:30:58,239 --> 02:31:01,680
that i hope will think about themselves

4365
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:04,559
exactly you and i aren't too far apart

4366
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:06,639
on that one but then maybe that problem

4367
02:31:04,559 --> 02:31:07,760
is a lot harder than we imagined maybe

4368
02:31:06,639 --> 02:31:09,439
we need to

4369
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:11,040
let's not get let's not get too far

4370
02:31:09,439 --> 02:31:12,000
because i want to emphasize something

4371
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:14,000
that

4372
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:16,318
what you're saying is isn't it

4373
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:18,959
fascinating that the universe evolved

4374
02:31:16,318 --> 02:31:21,359
something that can be conscious reflect

4375
02:31:18,959 --> 02:31:23,039
on itself but

4376
02:31:21,359 --> 02:31:25,760
lee smolin's idea didn't take us there

4377
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:28,479
remember it took us to stars

4378
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:32,079
lee smullen has argued

4379
02:31:28,478 --> 02:31:33,840
i think right on almost every single way

4380
02:31:32,079 --> 02:31:36,000
that

4381
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:38,719
cosmological natural selection could

4382
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:41,280
lead to a universe with rich structure

4383
02:31:38,719 --> 02:31:43,199
and he argued that the structure the

4384
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:44,880
physics of our universe is designed to

4385
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:46,560
make a lot of stars so that they can

4386
02:31:44,879 --> 02:31:48,639
make black holes but that doesn't

4387
02:31:46,559 --> 02:31:49,840
explain what we're doing here in order

4388
02:31:48,639 --> 02:31:51,920
to in order for that to be an

4389
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:53,359
explanation of us what you have to

4390
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:55,439
assume is

4391
02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:58,159
that once you made that universe that

4392
02:31:55,439 --> 02:32:00,398
was capable of producing stars

4393
02:31:58,159 --> 02:32:02,799
life planets all these other things were

4394
02:32:00,398 --> 02:32:05,119
along for the ride they got lucky we're

4395
02:32:02,799 --> 02:32:06,639
we're kind of arising growing up in the

4396
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:08,640
cracks but the universe isn't here for

4397
02:32:06,639 --> 02:32:11,599
us we're still kind of a fluke in that

4398
02:32:08,639 --> 02:32:13,358
picture and i can't i don't i don't

4399
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:16,159
necessarily have like a philosophical

4400
02:32:13,359 --> 02:32:17,120
opposition to that stance it's just not

4401
02:32:16,159 --> 02:32:18,478
um

4402
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:20,880
okay so

4403
02:32:18,478 --> 02:32:22,639
i don't think it's complete so it seems

4404
02:32:20,879 --> 02:32:24,398
like whatever we got going on here to

4405
02:32:22,639 --> 02:32:25,680
you it seems like whatever we have here

4406
02:32:24,398 --> 02:32:27,519
on earth

4407
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:29,680
seems like a thing you might want to

4408
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:32,800
select for in this whole big process

4409
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:34,880
exactly so if what you are truly if your

4410
02:32:32,799 --> 02:32:37,679
entire evolutionary process

4411
02:32:34,879 --> 02:32:40,000
only cares about fecundity it only cares

4412
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:41,439
about making offspring universes because

4413
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,719
then there's going to be the most of

4414
02:32:41,439 --> 02:32:45,359
them in that

4415
02:32:42,719 --> 02:32:47,519
local region of of hyperspace which is

4416
02:32:45,359 --> 02:32:50,559
the set of all possible

4417
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:52,960
universes let's let's say um you don't

4418
02:32:50,559 --> 02:32:54,799
care how those universes are made you

4419
02:32:52,959 --> 02:32:57,119
know they have to be made by black holes

4420
02:32:54,799 --> 02:32:59,039
this is what this is what inflationary

4421
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:02,000
theory tells us the big bang tells us

4422
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:03,840
that black holes make universes

4423
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:07,439
but what if there was a technological

4424
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:09,359
means to make universes stars require a

4425
02:33:07,439 --> 02:33:11,040
ton of matter

4426
02:33:09,359 --> 02:33:12,318
because they're they're not thinking

4427
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:14,399
very carefully about how you make a

4428
02:33:12,318 --> 02:33:15,439
black hole they're just using gravity

4429
02:33:14,398 --> 02:33:16,959
you know

4430
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:19,520
um but

4431
02:33:16,959 --> 02:33:21,519
if we devise technologies that can

4432
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:23,280
efficiently compress matter into a

4433
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:24,960
singularity

4434
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:27,359
it turns out that if you can compress

4435
02:33:24,959 --> 02:33:28,639
about 10 kilograms into a very small

4436
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:30,000
volume

4437
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:32,639
that will make a black hole that is

4438
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:35,040
likely highly probable to inflate into

4439
02:33:32,639 --> 02:33:36,799
its own offspring universe this is

4440
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:38,240
according to calculations done by other

4441
02:33:36,799 --> 02:33:41,358
people who are professional quantum

4442
02:33:38,239 --> 02:33:42,719
theorists quantum field theorists and i

4443
02:33:41,359 --> 02:33:44,000
hope i am

4444
02:33:42,719 --> 02:33:46,159
grasping what they're telling me

4445
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:49,120
correctly i'm somewhat of a of a

4446
02:33:46,159 --> 02:33:51,760
translator here but so so that's

4447
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:54,720
that's the position that is particularly

4448
02:33:51,760 --> 02:33:57,040
intriguing to me which is that

4449
02:33:54,719 --> 02:33:58,478
what might have happened is that okay

4450
02:33:57,040 --> 02:34:01,200
this particular

4451
02:33:58,478 --> 02:34:02,959
branch on the vast tree of evolution

4452
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:05,040
cosmological evolution now we're talking

4453
02:34:02,959 --> 02:34:07,759
about not biological evolution within

4454
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:09,680
our universe but cosmological evolution

4455
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:11,920
went through exactly the process that

4456
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:12,800
elise mullin described got to the stage

4457
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:15,680
where

4458
02:34:12,799 --> 02:34:18,559
stars were making lots of black holes

4459
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:21,280
but then continued to evolve and somehow

4460
02:34:18,559 --> 02:34:23,039
bridged that gap and made intelligence

4461
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:26,479
and intelligence capable of devising

4462
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:28,319
technologies because technologies

4463
02:34:26,478 --> 02:34:30,159
in intelligent species working in

4464
02:34:28,318 --> 02:34:31,119
conjunction with technologies could then

4465
02:34:30,159 --> 02:34:34,079
produce

4466
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:36,160
even more more efficiently more

4467
02:34:34,079 --> 02:34:37,600
like faster and better and more

4468
02:34:36,159 --> 02:34:39,359
different then you start to have

4469
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:41,120
different kind of mechanisms of mutation

4470
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:43,040
perhaps all that kind of stuff and so if

4471
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:45,200
you do a simple calculation that says

4472
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:47,600
all right if i want to

4473
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:48,479
we know roughly how many

4474
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:51,120
um

4475
02:34:48,478 --> 02:34:54,478
core collapse supernova supernovae have

4476
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:56,079
resulted in black holes in our galaxy

4477
02:34:54,478 --> 02:34:58,719
since the beginning of the universe and

4478
02:34:56,079 --> 02:35:01,039
it's something like a billion so then

4479
02:34:58,719 --> 02:35:02,959
you would have to estimate that it would

4480
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:05,200
be possible for a technological

4481
02:35:02,959 --> 02:35:07,519
civilization to produce more than a

4482
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:09,280
billion black holes

4483
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:10,880
with the energy and matter at their

4484
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:12,640
disposal and so

4485
02:35:10,879 --> 02:35:14,559
one of the calculations in that paper

4486
02:35:12,639 --> 02:35:16,639
back of the envelope but i think

4487
02:35:14,559 --> 02:35:17,680
revealing nonetheless is that if you

4488
02:35:16,639 --> 02:35:19,358
take a

4489
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:21,760
relatively um

4490
02:35:19,359 --> 02:35:24,318
common asteroid something that's about a

4491
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:25,600
kilometer in diameter what i'm thinking

4492
02:35:24,318 --> 02:35:27,519
of is just

4493
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:28,880
scrap material laying around in our

4494
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:31,280
solar system

4495
02:35:28,879 --> 02:35:33,279
and break it up into 10 kilogram chunks

4496
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:35,040
and turn each of those into a universe

4497
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:36,720
then you would have made at least a

4498
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:38,080
trillion

4499
02:35:36,719 --> 02:35:42,159
black holes

4500
02:35:38,079 --> 02:35:43,600
outpacing the star production rate by

4501
02:35:42,159 --> 02:35:45,840
some three orders of magnitude that's

4502
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:48,159
one asteroid so now if you envision an

4503
02:35:45,840 --> 02:35:50,880
intelligent species that would

4504
02:35:48,159 --> 02:35:52,318
potentially have been devised initially

4505
02:35:50,879 --> 02:35:54,159
by humans but then based on

4506
02:35:52,318 --> 02:35:57,199
superconducting optoelectronic networks

4507
02:35:54,159 --> 02:35:58,398
no doubt and they go out and populate

4508
02:35:57,200 --> 02:36:00,079
they don't they don't have to fill the

4509
02:35:58,398 --> 02:36:01,599
galaxy they just have to get out to the

4510
02:36:00,079 --> 02:36:04,239
asteroid belt

4511
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:06,479
they could potentially dramatically

4512
02:36:04,239 --> 02:36:08,159
outpace the rate at which stars are

4513
02:36:06,478 --> 02:36:10,639
producing offspring universes and then

4514
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:12,318
wouldn't you expect that

4515
02:36:10,639 --> 02:36:15,199
that's where we came from instead of a

4516
02:36:12,318 --> 02:36:17,760
star yeah so you have to somehow become

4517
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:19,760
masters of gravity so like or just

4518
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:21,920
necessarily gravity so stars make black

4519
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:23,520
holes with gravity but any force that

4520
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:26,079
can

4521
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:28,960
make the energy density

4522
02:36:26,079 --> 02:36:30,478
can compactify matter to produce a great

4523
02:36:28,959 --> 02:36:32,478
enough energy density can form a

4524
02:36:30,478 --> 02:36:34,398
singularity it doesn't it would not

4525
02:36:32,478 --> 02:36:36,478
likely be gravity it's the weakest force

4526
02:36:34,398 --> 02:36:38,478
you're more likely to use

4527
02:36:36,478 --> 02:36:40,478
something like the technologies that

4528
02:36:38,478 --> 02:36:42,639
we're developing for fusion for example

4529
02:36:40,478 --> 02:36:45,519
so i don't know um

4530
02:36:42,639 --> 02:36:47,680
the large ignition facility recently

4531
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:51,359
blasted a pellet with

4532
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:53,840
a 100 really bright lasers and

4533
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:55,920
caused that to get dense enough to

4534
02:36:53,840 --> 02:36:57,760
engage in nuclear fusion so something

4535
02:36:55,920 --> 02:37:00,159
more like that or a tokamak with a

4536
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:01,680
really hot plasma i'm not sure something

4537
02:37:00,159 --> 02:37:04,478
i don't know exactly how it would be

4538
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:06,079
done i do like the idea that um

4539
02:37:04,478 --> 02:37:08,398
especially just been reading a lot about

4540
02:37:06,079 --> 02:37:09,840
gravitational waves and you know

4541
02:37:08,398 --> 02:37:11,920
the fact that us humans with our

4542
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:13,439
technological capabilities one of the

4543
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:15,840
most impressive

4544
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:17,840
uh technological accomplishments of

4545
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:21,439
human history is ligo being able to

4546
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:23,680
precisely detect gravitational waves i'm

4547
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:26,239
particularly

4548
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:28,159
find appealing the idea that other alien

4549
02:37:26,239 --> 02:37:31,680
civilizations from

4550
02:37:28,159 --> 02:37:34,318
very far distances communicate

4551
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:36,318
with gravity with gravitational waves

4552
02:37:34,318 --> 02:37:38,478
because as you become greater and

4553
02:37:36,318 --> 02:37:40,559
greater master of gravity which seems

4554
02:37:38,478 --> 02:37:42,719
way out of reach for us right now

4555
02:37:40,559 --> 02:37:44,079
maybe that seems like a effective way of

4556
02:37:42,719 --> 02:37:46,639
sending signals

4557
02:37:44,079 --> 02:37:49,200
especially if your job is to

4558
02:37:46,639 --> 02:37:53,358
manufacture black holes right

4559
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:56,399
so that that so let me ask there

4560
02:37:53,359 --> 02:37:58,079
whatever i mean broadly thinking because

4561
02:37:56,398 --> 02:37:59,920
we tend to think other alien

4562
02:37:58,079 --> 02:38:01,039
civilizations would be very human-like

4563
02:37:59,920 --> 02:38:03,200
but

4564
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:05,840
if we think of alien civilizations out

4565
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:07,520
there as basically generators of black

4566
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:09,280
holes

4567
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:10,880
however they do it because they get

4568
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:12,960
stars

4569
02:38:10,879 --> 02:38:14,959
do you think there's a lot of them in

4570
02:38:12,959 --> 02:38:17,438
our particular universe

4571
02:38:14,959 --> 02:38:17,438
out there

4572
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:23,200
in our universe

4573
02:38:20,398 --> 02:38:24,239
well okay let me ask okay this is great

4574
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:26,560
let me ask

4575
02:38:24,239 --> 02:38:27,600
a very generic question

4576
02:38:26,559 --> 02:38:30,879
and then

4577
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:33,520
let's see how you answer it which is uh

4578
02:38:30,879 --> 02:38:34,959
how many alien civilizations are out

4579
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:38,319
there

4580
02:38:34,959 --> 02:38:39,199
if the hypothesis that i just described

4581
02:38:38,318 --> 02:38:41,439
is

4582
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:44,240
on the right track yes it would mean

4583
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:45,680
that the parameters of our universe have

4584
02:38:44,239 --> 02:38:47,039
been selected

4585
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:48,960
so that

4586
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:51,120
intelligent civilizations will occur in

4587
02:38:48,959 --> 02:38:54,239
sufficient numbers

4588
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:55,920
so that the if they reach

4589
02:38:54,239 --> 02:38:57,680
something like supreme technological

4590
02:38:55,920 --> 02:39:00,079
maturity let's define that as the

4591
02:38:57,680 --> 02:39:02,079
ability to produce black holes

4592
02:39:00,079 --> 02:39:03,359
then that's not a highly improbable

4593
02:39:02,079 --> 02:39:05,600
event it

4594
02:39:03,359 --> 02:39:07,760
it doesn't need to happen often because

4595
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:09,600
as i just described if you get one of

4596
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:11,359
them in a galaxy you're going to make

4597
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:12,800
more black holes than the stars in that

4598
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:14,000
galaxy

4599
02:39:12,799 --> 02:39:15,679
but

4600
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:18,719
there's also not a super strong

4601
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:18,720
motivation well

4602
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:23,760
it's not obvious that you need them to

4603
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:25,520
be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy

4604
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:27,760
right so so one of the things that's

4605
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:29,280
that i try to emphasize in that paper is

4606
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:32,318
that

4607
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:35,040
given this idea of of how

4608
02:39:32,318 --> 02:39:36,719
our parameters might have been selected

4609
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:39,200
it's clear that

4610
02:39:36,719 --> 02:39:40,959
it's a it's a series of trade-offs right

4611
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:43,760
if you make i mean in order for

4612
02:39:40,959 --> 02:39:45,839
intelligent life of our variety or

4613
02:39:43,760 --> 02:39:48,559
anything resembling us to occur you need

4614
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:50,559
a bunch of stuff you need stars so

4615
02:39:48,559 --> 02:39:52,478
that's right back to smolin's roots of

4616
02:39:50,559 --> 02:39:54,398
this idea but you also need

4617
02:39:52,478 --> 02:39:55,358
water to have certain certain properties

4618
02:39:54,398 --> 02:39:57,039
you need

4619
02:39:55,359 --> 02:39:57,760
you need things like the

4620
02:39:57,040 --> 02:39:59,520
the

4621
02:39:57,760 --> 02:40:00,880
rocky planets like the earth to be

4622
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:02,880
within the habitable zone all these

4623
02:40:00,879 --> 02:40:04,159
things that you start talking about in

4624
02:40:02,879 --> 02:40:05,199
the

4625
02:40:04,159 --> 02:40:06,959
um

4626
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:09,200
the field of astrobiology trying to

4627
02:40:06,959 --> 02:40:11,519
understand life in the universe but you

4628
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:13,680
can't over emphasize you can't

4629
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:16,159
tune the parameters so precisely to

4630
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:19,200
maximize the number of stars or to

4631
02:40:16,159 --> 02:40:21,520
to give water exactly the properties or

4632
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:23,680
or to make rocky planets like earth the

4633
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:25,520
most numerous you have to compromise on

4634
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:27,359
all these things and so i think the way

4635
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:29,600
to test this idea

4636
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:31,359
is to look at what parameters are

4637
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:33,520
necessary for for each of these

4638
02:40:31,359 --> 02:40:34,960
different subsystems and i've laid out a

4639
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:36,960
few that i think are promising there

4640
02:40:34,959 --> 02:40:38,799
there could be countless others

4641
02:40:36,959 --> 02:40:40,879
and see how

4642
02:40:38,799 --> 02:40:43,039
changing the parameters

4643
02:40:40,879 --> 02:40:44,639
makes it more or less likely that stars

4644
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:46,479
would form and have long lifetimes or

4645
02:40:44,639 --> 02:40:48,318
that or that rocky planets in the

4646
02:40:46,478 --> 02:40:50,719
habitable zone are likely to form all

4647
02:40:48,318 --> 02:40:52,879
these different things so we can test

4648
02:40:50,719 --> 02:40:54,478
how how much these things are in a tug

4649
02:40:52,879 --> 02:40:56,639
of war with each other

4650
02:40:54,478 --> 02:40:58,879
and the prediction would be that we kind

4651
02:40:56,639 --> 02:41:00,799
of sit at this central point where

4652
02:40:58,879 --> 02:41:04,159
if you if you move the parameters too

4653
02:41:00,799 --> 02:41:06,959
much stars aren't stable or

4654
02:41:04,159 --> 02:41:09,520
life doesn't form or technology's

4655
02:41:06,959 --> 02:41:12,559
infeasible because because life alone at

4656
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:14,640
least the kind of life that we know of

4657
02:41:12,559 --> 02:41:16,879
cannot make black holes we don't have

4658
02:41:14,639 --> 02:41:19,278
this well i'm speaking for myself

4659
02:41:16,879 --> 02:41:21,039
you're a very fit strong person but

4660
02:41:19,279 --> 02:41:23,040
it might be possible for you but not for

4661
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:24,560
me to compress matter so we need these

4662
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:25,920
technologies but

4663
02:41:24,559 --> 02:41:28,000
we don't know

4664
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:31,520
we have not been able to

4665
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:33,279
quantify yet how um

4666
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:34,800
finely adjusted the parameters would

4667
02:41:33,279 --> 02:41:36,319
need to be in order for silicon to have

4668
02:41:34,799 --> 02:41:37,759
the properties it does okay this is not

4669
02:41:36,318 --> 02:41:39,439
directly speaking to what you're saying

4670
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:41,920
you're getting to the fermi paradox

4671
02:41:39,439 --> 02:41:43,520
which is where are they where are the

4672
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:44,799
the life forms out there how numerous

4673
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:47,920
are they that sort of thing what i'm

4674
02:41:44,799 --> 02:41:50,159
trying to argue is that

4675
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:52,318
if this framework is is on the right

4676
02:41:50,159 --> 02:41:53,760
track a potentially correct explanation

4677
02:41:52,318 --> 02:41:56,239
for our existence

4678
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:58,639
we don't it doesn't necessarily predict

4679
02:41:56,239 --> 02:42:00,959
that intelligent civilizations are just

4680
02:41:58,639 --> 02:42:03,119
everywhere because even if you just get

4681
02:42:00,959 --> 02:42:04,639
one of them in a galaxy which is quite

4682
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:07,439
rare

4683
02:42:04,639 --> 02:42:09,519
it could be enough to dramatically uh

4684
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:11,680
increase the fecundity of the universe

4685
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:13,359
as a whole yeah and i wonder once you

4686
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:15,439
start generating the offspring for

4687
02:42:13,359 --> 02:42:18,399
universes black holes

4688
02:42:15,439 --> 02:42:20,318
how that has effect on the

4689
02:42:18,398 --> 02:42:21,760
what kind of effect does it have on the

4690
02:42:20,318 --> 02:42:23,840
other

4691
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:26,398
uh candidates

4692
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:28,880
civilizations within that universe maybe

4693
02:42:26,398 --> 02:42:30,318
it has a destructive aspect or there

4694
02:42:28,879 --> 02:42:32,879
could be some arguments about once you

4695
02:42:30,318 --> 02:42:34,478
have a lot of offspring that that just

4696
02:42:32,879 --> 02:42:36,719
quickly accelerates to where the other

4697
02:42:34,478 --> 02:42:38,079
ones can't even catch up it could

4698
02:42:36,719 --> 02:42:41,438
but i guess

4699
02:42:38,079 --> 02:42:44,000
if you want me to put my chips on the

4700
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:46,398
table or whatever i think i come down

4701
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:47,799
more on the side

4702
02:42:46,398 --> 02:42:50,959
that

4703
02:42:47,799 --> 02:42:52,318
intelligent life civilizations

4704
02:42:50,959 --> 02:42:57,278
are rare

4705
02:42:52,318 --> 02:42:59,920
and um i guess i follow max tegmark here

4706
02:42:57,279 --> 02:43:01,760
and also there's there's a lot of papers

4707
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:04,318
coming out recently in the field of

4708
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:05,359
astrobiology that are seeming to say all

4709
02:43:04,318 --> 02:43:06,719
right you just worked through the

4710
02:43:05,359 --> 02:43:08,880
numbers on

4711
02:43:06,719 --> 02:43:11,438
on some modified drake equation or

4712
02:43:08,879 --> 02:43:13,839
something like that and it looks like

4713
02:43:11,439 --> 02:43:15,200
it's not improbable you wouldn't you

4714
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:16,880
shouldn't be surprised that an

4715
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:19,120
intelligent species has arisen in our

4716
02:43:16,879 --> 02:43:20,879
galaxy but if you think there's one the

4717
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:23,760
next solar system over it's it's highly

4718
02:43:20,879 --> 02:43:26,239
improbable so i can see that the number

4719
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:28,639
the probability of finding a

4720
02:43:26,239 --> 02:43:31,039
a civilization in a galaxy maybe it's

4721
02:43:28,639 --> 02:43:33,278
most likely that you're gonna find

4722
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:35,120
one to a hundred or something but okay

4723
02:43:33,279 --> 02:43:37,600
now it's it's really important to put a

4724
02:43:35,120 --> 02:43:40,000
time window on that i think because

4725
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:44,239
does that mean in the entire lifetime of

4726
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:46,079
the galaxy before it it um

4727
02:43:44,239 --> 02:43:48,719
so for in our case before we run into

4728
02:43:46,079 --> 02:43:48,719
andromeda

4729
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:53,840
i think it's highly probable i shouldn't

4730
02:43:52,079 --> 02:43:55,439
say i think

4731
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:58,639
it's tempting to believe that it's

4732
02:43:55,439 --> 02:44:00,159
highly probable that in that entire

4733
02:43:58,639 --> 02:44:02,559
lifetime of your galaxy you're going to

4734
02:44:00,159 --> 02:44:05,119
get at least one intelligent species

4735
02:44:02,559 --> 02:44:06,559
maybe thousands or something like that

4736
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:08,960
but it's also

4737
02:44:06,559 --> 02:44:10,719
i think um

4738
02:44:08,959 --> 02:44:13,278
a little bit naive to think that they're

4739
02:44:10,719 --> 02:44:15,039
going to coincide in time

4740
02:44:13,279 --> 02:44:17,040
and we'll be able to observe them and

4741
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:19,040
also if you look at the

4742
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:21,520
span of

4743
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:23,200
life on earth the earth earth

4744
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:25,439
history

4745
02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:26,399
it was surprising to me to kind of look

4746
02:44:25,439 --> 02:44:28,479
at

4747
02:44:26,398 --> 02:44:30,318
the amount of time well first of all the

4748
02:44:28,478 --> 02:44:32,799
the short amount of time there's no life

4749
02:44:30,318 --> 02:44:35,359
is surprising life sprang up pretty

4750
02:44:32,799 --> 02:44:36,639
quickly it's cellular single cell so but

4751
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:40,318
that was that's the point i'm trying to

4752
02:44:36,639 --> 02:44:42,879
make is like so much with what

4753
02:44:40,318 --> 02:44:46,159
of life on earth was just like single

4754
02:44:42,879 --> 02:44:48,478
cell organisms like most of it most of

4755
02:44:46,159 --> 02:44:50,239
us like boring bacteria type of stuff

4756
02:44:48,478 --> 02:44:52,239
well bacteria are fascinating but i take

4757
02:44:50,239 --> 02:44:54,398
your point no i get it i mean no offense

4758
02:44:52,239 --> 02:44:56,239
to them

4759
02:44:54,398 --> 02:44:58,159
this kind of speaking from the

4760
02:44:56,239 --> 02:45:00,159
perspective of your paper of something

4761
02:44:58,159 --> 02:45:02,159
that's able to generate technology as we

4762
02:45:00,159 --> 02:45:05,359
kind of understand it that's a very

4763
02:45:02,159 --> 02:45:08,719
short moment in time relative to that

4764
02:45:05,359 --> 02:45:11,439
that full history of life on earth and

4765
02:45:08,719 --> 02:45:13,039
maybe our universe is just

4766
02:45:11,439 --> 02:45:14,960
saturated with

4767
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:17,520
bacteria like

4768
02:45:14,959 --> 02:45:18,398
humans right

4769
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:20,960
but

4770
02:45:18,398 --> 02:45:22,719
not the special extra

4771
02:45:20,959 --> 02:45:24,159
agi

4772
02:45:22,719 --> 02:45:26,959
super humans

4773
02:45:24,159 --> 02:45:28,398
that those are very rare and once those

4774
02:45:26,959 --> 02:45:31,278
spring up

4775
02:45:28,398 --> 02:45:33,358
everything just goes to like it

4776
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:35,359
accelerates very quickly

4777
02:45:33,359 --> 02:45:37,520
yeah it's it's we just don't have enough

4778
02:45:35,359 --> 02:45:40,399
data to really say but i find this whole

4779
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:42,239
subject extremely engaging i mean

4780
02:45:40,398 --> 02:45:45,119
there's this concept i think it's called

4781
02:45:42,239 --> 02:45:46,879
the rare earth hypothesis which is that

4782
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:49,439
basically stating that

4783
02:45:46,879 --> 02:45:51,358
okay microbes were here right away after

4784
02:45:49,439 --> 02:45:54,079
the haitian era where we were being

4785
02:45:51,359 --> 02:45:55,359
bombarded well after yeah bombarded by

4786
02:45:54,079 --> 02:45:57,439
comets asteroids things like that and

4787
02:45:55,359 --> 02:45:59,439
also after the moon formed so once

4788
02:45:57,439 --> 02:46:02,239
things settled down a little bit

4789
02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:03,680
in a few hundred million years

4790
02:46:02,239 --> 02:46:05,039
you have microbes everywhere and it

4791
02:46:03,680 --> 02:46:07,279
could have been we don't know exactly

4792
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:09,840
when it could have been remarkably brief

4793
02:46:07,279 --> 02:46:12,159
that that took so it does indicate that

4794
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:12,960
okay life forms relatively easily i

4795
02:46:12,159 --> 02:46:15,439
think

4796
02:46:12,959 --> 02:46:16,799
that alone is sort of a checker on the

4797
02:46:15,439 --> 02:46:19,600
scale for the

4798
02:46:16,799 --> 02:46:22,159
argument that

4799
02:46:19,600 --> 02:46:25,040
the parameters that allow even microbial

4800
02:46:22,159 --> 02:46:27,840
life to form are not just a fluke but

4801
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:30,560
anyway that aside yes then there was

4802
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:32,318
this long dormant period not dormant

4803
02:46:30,559 --> 02:46:34,639
things were happening but

4804
02:46:32,318 --> 02:46:36,719
um important things were happening for

4805
02:46:34,639 --> 02:46:40,000
some two and a half billion years or

4806
02:46:36,719 --> 02:46:43,679
something after um the metabolic process

4807
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:45,359
that releases oxygen was developed then

4808
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:47,439
basically the plant is just sitting

4809
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:49,600
there getting more and more oxygenated

4810
02:46:47,439 --> 02:46:52,800
more and more oxygenated until it's

4811
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:55,040
enough that you can build these large

4812
02:46:52,799 --> 02:46:58,398
complex organisms and so the rare earth

4813
02:46:55,040 --> 02:47:01,040
hypothesis would argue that

4814
02:46:58,398 --> 02:47:03,119
the microbes are common in everywhere in

4815
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:04,960
any planet that's like roughly in the

4816
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:06,960
habitable zone and has some water on

4817
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:09,358
it's probably gonna have those but then

4818
02:47:06,959 --> 02:47:11,919
getting to this cambrian explosion that

4819
02:47:09,359 --> 02:47:13,760
happened some between five and six

4820
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:16,239
hundred million years ago

4821
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:19,279
that's that's rare you know

4822
02:47:16,239 --> 02:47:21,359
and i i buy that i think that is rare so

4823
02:47:19,279 --> 02:47:23,279
if you say how much life is in our

4824
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:25,359
galaxy i think that's probably

4825
02:47:23,279 --> 02:47:27,760
the right answer is that microbes are

4826
02:47:25,359 --> 02:47:29,200
everywhere cambrian explosion is

4827
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:30,398
extremely rare

4828
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:32,079
and then

4829
02:47:30,398 --> 02:47:33,439
but the cambrian explosion kind of went

4830
02:47:32,079 --> 02:47:37,120
like that where

4831
02:47:33,439 --> 02:47:38,479
um within a couple tens or 100 million

4832
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:40,319
years

4833
02:47:38,478 --> 02:47:42,318
all of these body plans came into

4834
02:47:40,318 --> 02:47:44,318
existence and and basically all of the

4835
02:47:42,318 --> 02:47:45,920
body plans that are now in existence on

4836
02:47:44,318 --> 02:47:48,559
the on the planet

4837
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:50,398
were formed in that brief window

4838
02:47:48,559 --> 02:47:52,239
and we've just been

4839
02:47:50,398 --> 02:47:53,039
shuffling around since then so then what

4840
02:47:52,239 --> 02:47:56,159
what

4841
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:58,479
caused humans to pop out of that i mean

4842
02:47:56,159 --> 02:48:00,840
that could be another

4843
02:47:58,478 --> 02:48:04,318
extremely rare

4844
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:06,719
threshold that a planet roughly in the

4845
02:48:04,318 --> 02:48:08,799
habitable zone with water is not

4846
02:48:06,719 --> 02:48:10,398
guaranteed to cross you know to me it's

4847
02:48:08,799 --> 02:48:12,239
fascinating for being humble like the

4848
02:48:10,398 --> 02:48:14,478
humans cannot possibly be the most

4849
02:48:12,239 --> 02:48:16,239
amazing thing that such if you look at

4850
02:48:14,478 --> 02:48:18,719
the entirety of the system that lease

4851
02:48:16,239 --> 02:48:20,559
mola and you paint that cannot possibly

4852
02:48:18,719 --> 02:48:22,559
be the most amazing thing that process

4853
02:48:20,559 --> 02:48:24,959
generates so like if you look at the

4854
02:48:22,559 --> 02:48:27,840
evolution what's the equivalent in the

4855
02:48:24,959 --> 02:48:29,839
cosmological evolution and its selection

4856
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:33,120
for technology the equivalent of the

4857
02:48:29,840 --> 02:48:35,439
human eye or the human brain universes

4858
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:37,680
that are able to do some like

4859
02:48:35,439 --> 02:48:39,880
they don't need the damn stars

4860
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:44,079
they they're able to just do some

4861
02:48:39,879 --> 02:48:45,759
incredible generation of complexity fast

4862
02:48:44,079 --> 02:48:47,680
on like

4863
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:49,279
much more than if you think about it's

4864
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:50,720
like most of our universes are pretty

4865
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:52,319
freaking boring

4866
02:48:50,719 --> 02:48:53,760
there's not much going on there's a few

4867
02:48:52,318 --> 02:48:55,760
rocks flying around and there's some

4868
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:56,960
like apes that are just like

4869
02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:59,279
um

4870
02:48:56,959 --> 02:49:01,599
doing podcasts

4871
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:04,239
on some weird planet it just seems very

4872
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:06,000
inefficient if you think about like the

4873
02:49:04,239 --> 02:49:08,879
the amazing thing the human eye the

4874
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:12,159
visual cortex can do the the brain the

4875
02:49:08,879 --> 02:49:13,679
nervous everything that makes us more

4876
02:49:12,159 --> 02:49:16,159
powerful than

4877
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:18,880
single cell organisms like if there's an

4878
02:49:16,159 --> 02:49:21,600
equivalent of that for universes

4879
02:49:18,879 --> 02:49:23,278
they're like the richness of physics

4880
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:24,800
that could be uh

4881
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:26,800
they could be expressed through a

4882
02:49:24,799 --> 02:49:27,599
particular set of parameters

4883
02:49:26,799 --> 02:49:29,039
like

4884
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:30,399
i mean

4885
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:32,479
that

4886
02:49:30,398 --> 02:49:34,318
like for me i'm uh so from a computer

4887
02:49:32,478 --> 02:49:37,278
science perspective a huge fan of

4888
02:49:34,318 --> 02:49:40,318
cellular automata which is a nice

4889
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:43,680
sort of pretty visual way to illustrate

4890
02:49:40,318 --> 02:49:45,278
how different laws can result in uh

4891
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:48,880
drastically different levels of

4892
02:49:45,279 --> 02:49:50,800
complexity so like it's like yeah okay

4893
02:49:48,879 --> 02:49:52,478
so we're all like celebrating look our

4894
02:49:50,799 --> 02:49:54,478
little cellular automata is able to

4895
02:49:52,478 --> 02:49:56,639
generate pretty triangles and squares

4896
02:49:54,478 --> 02:49:59,199
and therefore we achieve general

4897
02:49:56,639 --> 02:50:02,719
intelligence and then there'll be like

4898
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:03,600
some badass chuck norris type like

4899
02:50:02,719 --> 02:50:05,519
uh

4900
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:06,960
universal touring machine type of

4901
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:09,439
cellular automata they're able to

4902
02:50:06,959 --> 02:50:10,959
generate other cellular automata

4903
02:50:09,439 --> 02:50:13,439
that does any arbitrary level of

4904
02:50:10,959 --> 02:50:16,318
computation off the bat

4905
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:18,720
it like those have to then exist

4906
02:50:16,318 --> 02:50:20,799
and then we're just like this we're just

4907
02:50:18,719 --> 02:50:23,760
we'll be forgotten is this the story

4908
02:50:20,799 --> 02:50:25,759
this is uh this podcast just entertains

4909
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:28,079
a few other apes for

4910
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:30,880
for a few months well i i'm kind of

4911
02:50:28,079 --> 02:50:33,279
surprised to hear your cynicism be no

4912
02:50:30,879 --> 02:50:34,318
i'm very up i i usually think of you as

4913
02:50:33,279 --> 02:50:36,479
like a

4914
02:50:34,318 --> 02:50:38,079
one who celebrates humanity in all its

4915
02:50:36,478 --> 02:50:40,398
forms and things like that and i i guess

4916
02:50:38,079 --> 02:50:42,639
i just i don't i see it the way you just

4917
02:50:40,398 --> 02:50:44,799
described i mean okay fif we've been

4918
02:50:42,639 --> 02:50:45,840
here for 13.7 billion years and you're

4919
02:50:44,799 --> 02:50:47,599
saying

4920
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:49,200
gosh that's a long time let's get on

4921
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:51,200
with the show already some other

4922
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:53,600
universe could have kicked our butt by

4923
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:53,600
now but

4924
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:58,318
that's putting a characteristic time i

4925
02:50:55,279 --> 02:51:00,479
mean why is 13.7 billion a long time i

4926
02:50:58,318 --> 02:51:02,398
mean compared to compared to what i

4927
02:51:00,478 --> 02:51:05,519
guess so when i look at our universe i

4928
02:51:02,398 --> 02:51:08,559
see this extraordinary hierarchy that

4929
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:11,600
has developed over that time so at the

4930
02:51:08,559 --> 02:51:12,799
beginning it was a chaotic mess of

4931
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:14,318
you know some

4932
02:51:12,799 --> 02:51:16,719
plasma and

4933
02:51:14,318 --> 02:51:19,359
nothing interesting going on there and

4934
02:51:16,719 --> 02:51:20,799
even for the first stars to form that a

4935
02:51:19,359 --> 02:51:23,200
lot of

4936
02:51:20,799 --> 02:51:25,679
really interesting uh evolutionary

4937
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:27,439
processes had to occur by evolutionary

4938
02:51:25,680 --> 02:51:29,439
in that sense i just mean

4939
02:51:27,439 --> 02:51:30,398
um taking place over extended periods of

4940
02:51:29,439 --> 02:51:32,239
time

4941
02:51:30,398 --> 02:51:34,559
and structures are forming then and then

4942
02:51:32,239 --> 02:51:36,239
it took that first generation of stars

4943
02:51:34,559 --> 02:51:38,719
in order to

4944
02:51:36,239 --> 02:51:41,199
produce the metals

4945
02:51:38,719 --> 02:51:43,039
that then can more efficiently produce

4946
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:45,279
another generation of stars we're only

4947
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:47,120
the third generation of stars so we

4948
02:51:45,279 --> 02:51:48,720
might still be pretty quick to the to

4949
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:50,640
the game here so

4950
02:51:48,719 --> 02:51:52,079
i but i don't think i don't

4951
02:51:50,639 --> 02:51:53,519
okay so then so then you have these

4952
02:51:52,079 --> 02:51:55,600
stars now you have solar systems on

4953
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:56,800
those solar systems you have

4954
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:58,880
um

4955
02:51:56,799 --> 02:52:00,318
rocky worlds you have gas giants like

4956
02:51:58,879 --> 02:52:02,079
all this complexity and then you start

4957
02:52:00,318 --> 02:52:03,920
getting life and the

4958
02:52:02,079 --> 02:52:06,000
the complexity that's evolved through

4959
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:07,600
the evolutionary process in in life

4960
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:10,398
forms is just

4961
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:12,000
it's not a a letdown to me just no no

4962
02:52:10,398 --> 02:52:13,519
and there's some of it is like some some

4963
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:15,760
of the planets is like

4964
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:17,200
icy it's like different flavors of ice

4965
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:18,559
cream they're icy but there might be

4966
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:19,760
water under yeah

4967
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:22,239
all kinds of life forms with some

4968
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:24,079
volcanoes right all kinds of weird stuff

4969
02:52:22,239 --> 02:52:25,840
no no i i don't uh i think it's

4970
02:52:24,079 --> 02:52:28,719
beautiful i think our life is beautiful

4971
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:30,559
and i think it was uh designed that by

4972
02:52:28,719 --> 02:52:33,438
by design the scarcity of the whole

4973
02:52:30,559 --> 02:52:35,920
thing i think mortality as terrifying as

4974
02:52:33,439 --> 02:52:37,600
it is is fundamental to the whole

4975
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:39,200
reason we enjoy everything no i think

4976
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:40,399
it's beautiful i just think that all of

4977
02:52:39,200 --> 02:52:43,279
us

4978
02:52:40,398 --> 02:52:45,519
um conscious beings in the grand scheme

4979
02:52:43,279 --> 02:52:47,680
of basically every at every scale will

4980
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:49,520
be completely forgotten well that's true

4981
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:51,120
i think everything is transient and that

4982
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:51,840
would go back to maybe something more

4983
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:53,760
like

4984
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:55,439
lao tzu the dao de jing or something

4985
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:57,920
where it's like

4986
02:52:55,439 --> 02:52:59,920
yes there is nothing but change there is

4987
02:52:57,920 --> 02:53:02,079
nothing but emergence and dissolve and

4988
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:03,920
that that's it but i just

4989
02:53:02,079 --> 02:53:05,840
in this picture of this hierarchy that's

4990
02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:07,439
developed i don't mean to say that now

4991
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:08,799
it gets to us and that's the pinnacle in

4992
02:53:07,439 --> 02:53:09,760
fact i think

4993
02:53:08,799 --> 02:53:12,478
the

4994
02:53:09,760 --> 02:53:14,398
at a high level the story i'm trying to

4995
02:53:12,478 --> 02:53:16,239
tease out in my research is about okay

4996
02:53:14,398 --> 02:53:19,199
well so then what's the next level of

4997
02:53:16,239 --> 02:53:21,520
hierarchy and if in if it's

4998
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:23,680
okay we're we're kind of pretty smart i

4999
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:25,600
mean talking about people like lee small

5000
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:27,120
and alan guth max tegmark okay we're

5001
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:29,439
really smart talking about me okay we're

5002
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:31,840
kind of we're we can find our way to the

5003
02:53:29,439 --> 02:53:33,680
grocery store or whatever but sometimes

5004
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:35,439
but what's next you know i mean what if

5005
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:37,920
what if there's another level of

5006
02:53:35,439 --> 02:53:41,040
hierarchy that grows on top of us that

5007
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:42,239
is even more profoundly capable and

5008
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:44,960
i mean we've talked a lot about

5009
02:53:42,239 --> 02:53:48,159
superconducting sensors imagine these

5010
02:53:44,959 --> 02:53:50,318
uh cognitive systems far more capable

5011
02:53:48,159 --> 02:53:52,478
than us residing

5012
02:53:50,318 --> 02:53:54,159
somewhere else in the solar system off

5013
02:53:52,478 --> 02:53:55,840
of the surface of the earth where it's

5014
02:53:54,159 --> 02:53:57,439
much darker much colder much more

5015
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:59,760
naturally suited to them and they have

5016
02:53:57,439 --> 02:54:02,800
these sensors that can detect single

5017
02:53:59,760 --> 02:54:05,120
photons of light uh from radio waves out

5018
02:54:02,799 --> 02:54:07,759
to all across the spectrum to gamma rays

5019
02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:10,399
and just see the whole universe and they

5020
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:11,520
just live in space with these massive

5021
02:54:10,398 --> 02:54:13,199
um

5022
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:15,279
collection optics so that they what what

5023
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:19,439
did they do they just look out and and

5024
02:54:15,279 --> 02:54:20,800
experience that that vast array of

5025
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:22,398
of what's

5026
02:54:20,799 --> 02:54:25,039
being developed

5027
02:54:22,398 --> 02:54:27,920
and if you're such a system

5028
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:28,800
presumably you would do some things for

5029
02:54:27,920 --> 02:54:31,840
fun

5030
02:54:28,799 --> 02:54:34,318
and the kind of fun thing i would do

5031
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:37,920
somebody who likes video games is i

5032
02:54:34,318 --> 02:54:41,039
would create and maintain and observe

5033
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:41,040
something like earth

5034
02:54:41,279 --> 02:54:45,120
and

5035
02:54:42,639 --> 02:54:46,000
so in some sense we're like all what

5036
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:49,760
players

5037
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:51,200
on a stage for this uh superconducting

5038
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:52,239
um

5039
02:54:51,200 --> 02:54:54,720
cold

5040
02:54:52,239 --> 02:54:57,199
computing system out there i mean all of

5041
02:54:54,719 --> 02:54:58,879
this is fascinating to think the the

5042
02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:00,319
fact that you're actually designing

5043
02:54:58,879 --> 02:55:02,159
systems here on earth that are trying to

5044
02:55:00,318 --> 02:55:05,039
push this technological at the very

5045
02:55:02,159 --> 02:55:06,079
cutting edge and also thinking about how

5046
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:09,760
does the

5047
02:55:06,079 --> 02:55:13,200
like the evolution of physical laws

5048
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:14,960
lead us to the way we are

5049
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:18,079
it's fascinating that that coupling is

5050
02:55:14,959 --> 02:55:20,719
fascinating it's like the ultimate

5051
02:55:18,079 --> 02:55:22,398
rigorous application of philosophy

5052
02:55:20,719 --> 02:55:23,599
to the rigorous application of

5053
02:55:22,398 --> 02:55:25,680
engineering

5054
02:55:23,600 --> 02:55:27,600
so i um jeff you're one of the most

5055
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:29,840
fascinating i'm i'm so glad i did not

5056
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:33,279
know much about you accept through your

5057
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:35,200
work and i'm so glad we got this um

5058
02:55:33,279 --> 02:55:36,159
chance to talk you're

5059
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:37,920
you're

5060
02:55:36,159 --> 02:55:40,879
one of the best explainers of

5061
02:55:37,920 --> 02:55:44,000
exceptionally difficult concepts um

5062
02:55:40,879 --> 02:55:45,920
and you're also the the speaking of like

5063
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:47,680
fractal you're able to function

5064
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:50,079
intellectually at all levels of the

5065
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:52,079
stack which which i deeply appreciate

5066
02:55:50,079 --> 02:55:54,639
this was really fun you're a great

5067
02:55:52,079 --> 02:55:56,079
educator a great scientist it's

5068
02:55:54,639 --> 02:55:57,760
it's an honor that you spend your

5069
02:55:56,079 --> 02:55:59,359
valuable time with me it's an honor that

5070
02:55:57,760 --> 02:56:01,680
you would spend your time with me as

5071
02:55:59,359 --> 02:56:02,720
well thanks jeff

5072
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:05,279
thanks for listening to this

5073
02:56:02,719 --> 02:56:07,119
conversation with jeff shaneline to

5074
02:56:05,279 --> 02:56:09,520
support this podcast please check out

5075
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:11,920
our sponsors in the description

5076
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:15,120
and now let me leave you with some words

5077
02:56:11,920 --> 02:56:18,079
from the great john carmack who surely

5078
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:20,079
will be a guest on this podcast soon

5079
02:56:18,079 --> 02:56:21,840
because of the nature of moore's law

5080
02:56:20,079 --> 02:56:24,639
anything that an extremely clever

5081
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:27,120
graphics programmer can do at one point

5082
02:56:24,639 --> 02:56:30,398
can be replicated by a merely competent

5083
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:32,160
programmer some number of years later

5084
02:56:30,398 --> 02:56:35,799
thank you for listening and hope to see

5085
02:56:32,159 --> 02:56:35,799
you next time

5086
02:56:41,920 --> 02:56:44,000
you
