00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,798
kamran vaffa a theoretical physicist at

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,919
harvard

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,400
specializing in string theory he is the

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,039
winner

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,320
of the 2017 breakthrough prize in

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:14,239
fundamental physics

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,759
which is the most lucrative academic

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,399
prize in the world

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,160
quick mention of our sponsors headspace

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,358
jordan harmon just show

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,800
squarespace and all form check them out

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,920
in the description to support this

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,599
podcast

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,840
as a side note let me say that string

16
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,518
theory is a theory of quantum gravity

17
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,759
that unifies quantum mechanics

18
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,519
and general relativity it says that

19
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,000
quarks electrons and

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,160
all other particles are made up of much

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,799
tinier strings of vibrating energy

22
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,959
they vibrate in 10 or more dimensions

23
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,959
depending on the flavor of the theory

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,480
different vibrating patterns result in

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,878
different particles

26
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,000
from its origins for a long time string

27
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,960
theory was seen

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,480
as too good not to be true but has

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,679
recently fallen out of favor in the

30
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,238
physics community

31
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,079
partly because over the past 40 years it

32
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:02,959
has not been able to make any novel

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,879
predictions

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,159
that could then be validated through

35
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,960
experiment

36
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,320
nevertheless to this day it remains one

37
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,039
of our best candidates

38
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,438
for a theory of everything or a theory

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,439
that unifies the laws of physics

40
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,039
let me mention that a similar story

41
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:20,959
happened with neural networks in the

42
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,200
field of artificial intelligence

43
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,640
where it fell out of favor after decades

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
of promise and research

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
but found success again in the past

46
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
decade

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,118
as part of the deep learning revolution

48
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,438
so i think it pays to keep an open mind

49
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,879
since we don't know which of the ideas

50
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,359
in physics may be brought back

51
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,560
decades later and be found to solve the

52
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,438
biggest mysteries

53
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,079
in theoretical physics string theory

54
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,719
still

55
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,319
has that promise this is the lex

56
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,280
friedman podcast and here is my

57
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,719
conversation

58
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,359
with kamran vaffa what is the difference

59
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,560
between

60
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,319
mathematics and physics well that's a

61
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,439
difficult question because in many ways

62
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,839
math and physics

63
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,798
are unified in many ways so to

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,280
distinguish them

65
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,320
is not an easy task i would say that

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,679
perhaps the goals

67
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:13,280
are of math and physics are different uh

68
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,080
math does not care to describe reality

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,680
physics does that's the major difference

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,760
but a lot of the

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,640
thoughts processes and so on which goes

72
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,479
to understanding the nature and reality

73
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,119
are the same things that mathematicians

74
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,799
do so in many ways they are similar

75
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,879
mathematicians care about deductive

76
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,000
reasoning and physicists or physics in

77
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,719
general we care less

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,959
about that we care more about

79
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,039
interconnection of ideas

80
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,800
about how ideas support each other or if

81
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,560
there's a puzzle con

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,080
discord between ideas that's more

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,519
interesting for us

84
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
and part of the reason is that we have

85
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,200
learned in physics that the ideas are

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,800
not sequential

87
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,399
and if we think that there's one idea

88
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,159
which is more important and we start

89
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
with there and go to the next idea and

90
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,439
next one and deduce things from that

91
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,120
like mathematicians do

92
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,639
we have learned that the like the third

93
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,800
or fourth thing we deduce from that

94
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,318
principle turns out later on to be the

95
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,879
actual principle

96
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,639
and from a different perspective

97
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,799
starting from there leads to new ideas

98
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,238
which the original one didn't lead to

99
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,000
and that's the beginning of a new

100
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,759
revolution in science

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
so this kind of thing we have seen again

102
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,079
and again in the history of science we

103
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,239
have learned

104
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,840
to not like deductive reasoning because

105
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,920
that gives us a

106
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,598
bad starting point to think that we

107
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,238
actually have the original thought

108
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,158
process

109
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,840
should be viewed as the primary thought

110
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,359
and all these are deductions

111
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,360
like the way mathematicians sometimes

112
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,959
does so in physics we are learning to be

113
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
skeptical of that way of thinking we

114
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,199
have to be a bit open to the possibility

115
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,200
that what we thought is a deduction

116
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,238
of a hypothesis actually the reason

117
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,560
that's true

118
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,759
is the opposite and so we reverse the

119
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,519
order and so this

120
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,438
this switching back and forth between

121
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,719
ideas makes us

122
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:57,359
more fluid about a deductive fashion of

123
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,359
course

124
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
it sometimes gives a wrong impression

125
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,439
like physicists don't care about rigor

126
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,120
they just

127
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,959
you know they just say random things you

128
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,640
know they are willing to to say things

129
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,479
that are not backed by you know

130
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,000
the logical reasoning that's not true at

131
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,039
all so

132
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,080
despite despite this fluidity in saying

133
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,560
which one is a primary

134
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
thought we are very careful about trying

135
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
to understand what we have really

136
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,120
understood

137
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,759
in terms of relationship between ideas

138
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
so that's

139
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,199
that's the that's an important

140
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,600
ingredient and in fact

141
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,319
solid math being behind physics is i

142
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,280
think

143
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,199
uh one of the attractive features of a

144
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,599
of a physical law so we look for

145
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
beautiful math underpinning can we dig

146
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,560
into that process

147
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,120
of starting from one place and then the

148
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,240
uh ending up at like the fourth step and

149
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,000
realizing

150
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,360
all along that the place you started at

151
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,680
was wrong so

152
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,759
is that happen when there's a

153
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,840
discrepancy between

154
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,879
what the math says and what the physical

155
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,119
world shows

156
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,918
is that how you then can go back and do

157
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
the

158
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,918
revolutionary idea for different

159
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,160
starting place altogether

160
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,758
perhaps i'll give an example to see see

161
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,800
how it goes and in fact the historical

162
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,160
example

163
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,560
is newton's work on classical mechanics

164
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
so so newton formulated the laws of

165
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,240
mechanics

166
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,639
uh you know the force f equals to m a

167
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,879
and

168
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,879
his other laws and they look very simple

169
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,399
elegant and so forth

170
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:27,600
later when we studied more examples

171
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,038
of of mechanics and other similar things

172
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
physicists came up with the idea that

173
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:33,120
the notion of potential is interesting

174
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
potential was an abstract idea which

175
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,399
kind of came you could

176
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
take its gradient and relate it to the

177
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,839
force so you don't really need

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
it apiary but it solved helps some

179
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,959
thoughts

180
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,360
and then later euler and lagrange

181
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,120
reformulated newtonian mechanics in a

182
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
totally different way

183
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,319
in the following fashion they said if

184
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,478
you take if you want to know where

185
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,240
particle at this point and at this time

186
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,000
how does it get to this point at the

187
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,918
later time

188
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,839
is the following you take all possible

189
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:02,399
paths connecting this particle from

190
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,038
going from

191
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,159
the initial point to the final point and

192
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,800
you compute

193
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,639
the action on what is an action action

194
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,800
is the integral over time

195
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,879
of the kinetic term of the particle

196
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,759
minus its potential

197
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,439
so you take this integral and each path

198
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,319
will give you some quantity and

199
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,959
the path it actually takes the physical

200
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,960
path

201
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,478
is the one which minimizes this integral

202
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,120
or this action

203
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,360
now this sounded like a backwards step

204
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,199
from newton's newton's

205
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
form that seems very simple f equals to

206
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,800
m a and you can write f is minus the

207
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,120
gradient of the potential

208
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,639
so why would anybody start formatting

209
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,840
such a simple thing in terms of this

210
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
complicated

211
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,879
looking principle you have to study the

212
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,199
space of

213
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,319
all paths and all things and find the

214
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,919
minimum and then you get the same

215
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,000
equation so what's the point

216
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,959
so euler and lagrange's formulation of

217
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,680
newton which is a

218
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,318
which was kind of recasting in this

219
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,079
language

220
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,439
is just a consequence of newton's law f

221
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,159
equals m it gives you the same

222
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,639
fact that this path is a minimum action

223
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,680
now

224
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,400
what we learned later last century was

225
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,478
that

226
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,079
when we deal with quantum mechanics

227
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,360
newton's law is only

228
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,758
an average correct and

229
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,560
the particle going from one to the other

230
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,598
doesn't take

231
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,079
exactly one path it takes all the paths

232
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,759
yes with the with the amplitude which is

233
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,918
proportional to the exponential of the

234
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,120
action times an imaginary number

235
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,799
i and so this fact turned out to be the

236
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,478
reformulation of quantum mechanics we

237
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,000
should start there as the basis

238
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,680
of the new law which is quantum

239
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,839
mechanics and newton is only an

240
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
approximation on the average correct

241
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,598
when we say amplitude you mean

242
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,279
probability but yes the amplitude means

243
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,038
if you com sum up all these paths with

244
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,799
exponential i times the action

245
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,240
if you sum this up you get the number

246
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,079
complex number

247
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,360
you square the norm of this complex

248
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,719
number gives you a probability to go

249
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,680
from one to the other

250
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,840
is there ways in which mathematics can

251
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,840
lead us astray

252
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,439
when we use it as a tool to understand

253
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,758
the physical world

254
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,439
yes i would say that mathematics can

255
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,720
lead us astray as much as

256
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:11,598
all physical ideas can lead us so

257
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,440
sure if you get stuck in some something

258
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,639
then you can easily fool yourself that

259
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,000
just like

260
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,160
the thought process we have to free

261
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,680
ourselves of that sometimes math does

262
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,520
that rule like say oh this is such a

263
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,478
beautiful math i definitely want to use

264
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,159
it somewhere and so

265
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,159
you just get carried away and you just

266
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,080
get maybe carried too far away so that

267
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,759
is certainly true but i wouldn't say

268
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,279
it's more dangerous than all physical

269
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,320
ideas to me

270
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,319
new math ideas uh is as much potential

271
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,278
to lead us astray as all physical ideas

272
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,039
which could be

273
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,120
long-held principles of physics so i'm

274
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,838
just saying that we should keep an open

275
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,000
uh mind about the role the math plays

276
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,959
not to be antagonistic towards it

277
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,958
and not to over overwhelming it we

278
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,639
should just be open to possibilities

279
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,639
what about looking at a particular

280
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,720
characteristics of both physical ideas

281
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,199
and mathematical ideas which is beauty

282
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
you think beauty leads us astray meaning

283
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
um

284
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,639
and and you offline showed me a a really

285
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,959
nice puzzle that illustrates this

286
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,000
this idea a little bit now maybe you can

287
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,759
speak to that or another

288
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,600
example where uh beauty

289
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,360
makes it tempting for us to assume that

290
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,000
the the law and the theory

291
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
we found is actually one that perfectly

292
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,080
describes reality

293
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
i think that beauty does not lead us

294
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
astray

295
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,920
because i feel that beauty is a

296
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,480
requirement

297
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,838
for principles of physics so beauty is a

298
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,879
fundamental in the universe i think

299
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,560
beauty is fundamental

300
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,919
at least that's the way many of us view

301
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,159
it it's not emergent

302
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,838
it's not immersion i think i think hardy

303
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,480
is the mathematician who said that

304
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,800
there's no

305
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
permanent place for ugly mathematics and

306
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:46,159
so i think the same is true in physics

307
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,679
that if we find a principle which looks

308
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,199
ugly

309
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,199
we're not going to be that's not the end

310
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,278
stage so therefore beauty is going to

311
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,720
lead us somewhere now it doesn't mean

312
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,399
beauty is enough

313
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,160
it doesn't mean if you just have beauty

314
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,080
if i just look at something is beautiful

315
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,480
then i'm fine no that's not the case

316
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,120
beauty is certainly a criteria that

317
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
every

318
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,480
good physical theory should pass that's

319
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
at least the view we have

320
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,680
why do we have this view that's a good

321
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,320
question

322
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,879
it is a partly uh you could say based on

323
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,040
experi

324
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,919
experience of science over centuries

325
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,159
partly is

326
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,000
a philosophical view of what what what

327
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,319
reality is or should be

328
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,679
and uh in principle you know it could

329
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
have been ugly

330
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,958
and we might have had to deal with it

331
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,680
but we have gotten maybe

332
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,039
uh confident through examples after

333
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,399
examples in the history of science to

334
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,759
look for beauty

335
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,120
and our sense of beauty seems to

336
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,879
incorporate a lot of things that are

337
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,799
essential for us to solve some difficult

338
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,320
problems like symmetry we find symmetry

339
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:41,120
beautiful and the breaking of symmetry

340
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,879
beautiful

341
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,240
somehow symmetry is a is a fundamental

342
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,240
part of how we conceive of beauty

343
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,519
at all layers of reality which is

344
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,320
interesting like

345
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,200
uh in in both the visual space like when

346
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,040
we look at art

347
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,480
we look at each other as human beings

348
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,599
the way we look at creatures in the

349
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
biological space

350
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,879
the way we look at chemistry and then

351
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,640
into the physics world as

352
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,399
as the work you do it's kind of

353
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:10,078
interesting it makes you wonder like

354
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,159
which one is the chicken or the egg is

355
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,599
symmetry the the chicken and our

356
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,639
conception of beauty the egg

357
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,879
or the other way around or somehow

358
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,159
the fact that every the symmetry is is

359
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,240
part of reality

360
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,078
is it somehow creates the brain that

361
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,120
then is able to perceive it

362
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:30,319
or maybe that's this is just because we

363
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,120
maybe it's so obvious

364
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,959
it's almost trivial that symmetry of

365
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,879
course will be part of every kind of

366
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,919
universe that's possible

367
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,600
uh and then our any kind of organism

368
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,039
that's able to observe that universe is

369
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,278
going to appreciate

370
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,719
uh symmetry well these are good

371
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,639
questions we don't have a deeper

372
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,759
understanding of why we get attracted to

373
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,879
symmetry

374
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,919
why do laws of nature seem to have

375
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,720
symmetries

376
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,838
underlying them and the reasoning or the

377
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,360
examples of whether

378
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,279
if it wasn't symmetric we would have

379
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,480
understood it or not we could have said

380
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:03,679
that yeah if there were

381
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,959
you know things which didn't look that

382
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,479
great we could understand them for

383
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,479
example we know

384
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,240
that symmetries get broken and we have

385
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,399
appreciated nature

386
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,600
in the broken symmetry phase as well the

387
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,799
word we live in

388
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,600
has many things which do not look

389
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,759
symmetric but even those

390
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,040
have underlying symmetry when you look

391
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,278
at it more deeply so

392
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,879
we have gotten maybe spoiled perhaps by

393
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:25,838
by the appearance of symmetry all over

394
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,039
the place

395
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,720
and we look for it and i think this is

396
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,199
this is perhaps related to the sense of

397
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,040
aesthetics that scientists have

398
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,720
and we don't usually talk about it among

399
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,120
scientists

400
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,839
in fact it's kind of a philosophical

401
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,919
view of

402
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,200
why do we look for simplicity or beauty

403
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,240
or so forth

404
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,879
and uh i think in a sense scientists are

405
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,519
ma

406
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,519
a lot like philosophers sometimes i

407
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,078
think especially modern science seems to

408
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,919
shine away

409
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,519
sean's philosophers and philosophical

410
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,919
views and i think

411
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,120
at their peril i think i think in my

412
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,240
view science

413
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,879
owes a lot to philosophy and

414
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,720
in my view many scientists in fact

415
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,120
probably all good scientists are

416
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,120
perhaps amateur philosophers they may

417
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,078
not state that they are philosophers or

418
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,679
they they may not

419
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,519
like to be labeled philosophers but in

420
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,638
many ways what they do is like what

421
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,480
is philosophical takes of things

422
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,000
looking for simplicity or symmetry is an

423
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,879
example of that in my opinion

424
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,078
or seeing patterns you see for example

425
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,240
another example of the

426
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:30,319
symmetry is like how you come up with

427
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,560
new ideas in science you see for example

428
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,600
an

429
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,599
idea a is connected with an idea b

430
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,720
okay so you you study this connection

431
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,639
very deeply

432
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,040
and then you find the cousin of an idea

433
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,519
a let me call it a prime

434
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,559
and then you immediately look for b

435
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,320
prime if a

436
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,719
is like b and if there's an a prime then

437
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,000
you look for b prime why well

438
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,600
it completes the picture why well it's

439
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,198
philosophically appealing to have more

440
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,120
balance in terms of that

441
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,799
and then you look for b prime and behold

442
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,399
you find this other phenomena which is a

443
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,519
physical phenomenon which you call b

444
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,440
prime so this kind of thinking motivates

445
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,519
asking questions and looking for things

446
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,199
and it has guided scientists i think

447
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,720
through many centuries and i think it

448
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,319
continues to do so today

449
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,639
and i think if you look at the long arc

450
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,399
of history i suspect that the things

451
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,000
that will be remembered

452
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,879
is the philosophical flavor of the ideas

453
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,480
of physics and chemistry and computer

454
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:29,278
science and mathematics

455
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:32,079
like i think the actual details

456
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,120
will be shown to be incomplete or maybe

457
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,120
wrong

458
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,720
but the philosophical intuitions will

459
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,278
carry through much longer

460
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,959
there's a sense in which if it's true

461
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,240
that we haven't figured out

462
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:46,719
most of how things work currently

463
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
that uh it'll all be shown as wrong and

464
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
silly it'd

465
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,600
almost be a historical artifact but the

466
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,519
the human spirit whatever like the the

467
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,120
longing to understand

468
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,198
the the way we perceive the world the

469
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,278
way we conceive of it

470
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,479
of our place in the world those those

471
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,078
ideas will carry on

472
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,519
i completely agree in fact i believe

473
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,599
that uh almost

474
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,440
well i believe that none of the

475
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,519
principles or laws of physics we know

476
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,199
today are exactly correct

477
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,320
all of them are approximations to

478
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,159
something they are better than the

479
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,839
previous versions that we had but

480
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,838
none of them are exactly correct and

481
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,240
none of them are going to stand forever

482
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,079
so i agree that that's the process we

483
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,480
are heading we are improving

484
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,239
and yes indeed the thought process and

485
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,480
that philosophical take

486
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,720
is common so when we look at you know

487
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,560
older uh

488
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,240
scientists or maybe even all the way

489
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,679
back to greek philosophers and the

490
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,320
things that the way they thought and so

491
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,919
on

492
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,079
almost everything they said about you

493
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,919
know nature was incorrect

494
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,758
but the way they thought about it and

495
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,679
many things that they were thinking

496
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,919
is still valid today for example they

497
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,198
thought about symmetry breaking

498
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,639
they were trying to explain the

499
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,319
following they were this is a beautiful

500
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
example i think they had figured out

501
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,440
that the earth is round

502
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,879
and they said okay earth is around they

503
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,199
have you know they have seen the

504
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,639
length of the shadow of this meter stick

505
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,399
and they have seen that if you go from

506
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,079
the equator upwards north

507
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,759
they find that depending on how far away

508
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,198
you are the length of the shadow changes

509
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,039
and from that they have either they had

510
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,120
even measured the radius of the earth

511
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,480
to good accuracy that's brilliant by the

512
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,919
way the fact that they did that

513
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,839
very brilliant very brilliant so these

514
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,799
greek philosophers were very smart and

515
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,720
so

516
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,958
they had taken it to the next step they

517
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,600
asked okay so the earth is round

518
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,278
why doesn't it move they thought it

519
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,120
doesn't move they they were looking

520
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,720
around nothing seemed to move so

521
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,560
so they said okay we have to have a good

522
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,000
explanation it wasn't enough for them to

523
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,239
you know be there so they really want to

524
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,559
deeply understand that fact and they

525
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,278
come up with a symmetry argument

526
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,559
and the symmetry argument was oh if the

527
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,320
earth

528
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,919
is a spherical it must be at the center

529
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,959
of the universe for sure so they said

530
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,078
the earth is at the center of the

531
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,518
universe it makes sense

532
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,519
and they said you know if the earth is

533
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,078
going to move which direction does it

534
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,919
pick

535
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,278
any direction it picks it breaks that

536
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,958
spherical symmetry because you have to

537
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,399
pick a direction

538
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,078
and that's not good because it's not

539
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,320
symmetrical anymore so therefore

540
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,318
the earth decides to sit put because it

541
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,759
would break the symmetry so

542
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,279
so they had the incorrect science they

543
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:08,720
thought earth doesn't move and they but

544
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,038
they had this beautiful idea that

545
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,558
symmetry might explain it

546
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,000
but they were even smarter than that

547
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,838
aristotle didn't agree with this

548
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,279
argument

549
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,720
he said why do you think symmetry

550
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,838
prevents it from moving because the

551
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,480
preferred position

552
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,678
not so he gave an example he said

553
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,880
suppose

554
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,280
you are a person and you put we put you

555
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,280
at the center of a circle

556
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,798
and we spread food around you on a

557
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,440
circle around you

558
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,240
loaves of bread let's say and we say

559
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,960
okay

560
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
stay at the center of the circle forever

561
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,200
are you going to do that just because of

562
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,720
the symmetric point

563
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,000
no you're going to get hungry you're

564
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,880
going to move towards one of those

565
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,319
levels of bread

566
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
despite the fact that it breaks the

567
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,279
symmetry so from this way he tried to

568
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:53,038
argue

569
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,200
being at this symmetric point may not be

570
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,038
the preferred thing to do

571
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,880
and this idea of spontaneous mystery

572
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,960
breaking is something we just

573
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,480
used today to describe many physical

574
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,519
phenomena so spontaneous symmetry

575
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,279
breaking

576
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,038
is the feature that we now use but this

577
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,639
idea was there

578
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,119
thousands of years ago but applied

579
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,960
incorrectly to the physical world but

580
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,639
now we are using it so these ideas are

581
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,880
coming back in different forms

582
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,720
so i agree very much that the thought

583
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,240
process is more important and these

584
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,759
ideas are more interesting than the

585
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,599
actual applications that

586
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,359
people may find today did they use the

587
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,959
language of symmetry and the symmetry

588
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,079
breaking and spontaneous symmetry that's

589
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,840
really interesting yes

590
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:34,079
because like i could see a conception of

591
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:37,038
the universe that kind of tends towards

592
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,678
perfect symmetry and is stuck there like

593
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,160
they

594
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,000
not stuck there but achieves that

595
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,759
optimal and stays there

596
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,759
the idea that you would spontaneously

597
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,558
break out of symmetry

598
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,599
like have these perturbations like jump

599
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,079
out of symmetry

600
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,599
and back that's not that's a really

601
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,240
difficult idea to uh

602
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:57,439
to load into your head like where where

603
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,440
does that come from

604
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,400
and then and then the idea that you may

605
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,120
not be at the center of the universe

606
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,280
right that is a really tough idea right

607
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,879
so symmetry sometimes is an explanation

608
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,639
of being at the symmetric point is

609
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,280
sometimes a simple explanation of many

610
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,559
things like

611
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:17,440
if you have a bowl a

612
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,798
circular ball then the bottom of it is

613
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,240
the lowest point so if you put a you

614
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,599
know pebble or something it will slide

615
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,319
down and go there at the bottom and

616
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,000
stays there

617
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,240
at the symmetric point because the

618
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,640
preferred point the lowest energy point

619
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,000
but if that same symmetric circular ball

620
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,038
that you had had a

621
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,319
bump on the on the bottom the bottom

622
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,240
might not be at the center

623
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,319
it might be on a circle on the table

624
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,160
yeah in which case the pebble would not

625
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,798
end up at the center would be the lower

626
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,880
energy point

627
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,200
symmetrical but it breaks the symmetry

628
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,760
once it picks a point on that circle

629
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,880
so so we can't have symmetry reasoning

630
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,359
for where things end up

631
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,640
or symmetry breakings like this example

632
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,519
would suggest

633
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,799
we talked about beauty i find geometry

634
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,960
to be beautiful

635
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:02,960
uh you have uh a few examples

636
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,400
that are geometric in nature in your

637
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,400
book

638
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,400
how can geometry in ancient times or

639
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,840
today be used to understand

640
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,600
reality and maybe how do you think about

641
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:18,079
geometry as a distinct tool

642
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,480
in mathematics and physics yes geometry

643
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,639
is my favorite part of math as well and

644
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,519
greeks were enamored by geometry they

645
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,759
tried to describe

646
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,839
physical reality using geometry and

647
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,480
principles of geometry and symmetry

648
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:33,119
platonic solids the five solids they had

649
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,720
discovered had these beautiful solids

650
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,558
they thought it must be good for some

651
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,640
reality there must be explaining

652
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,879
something they attached you know

653
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,000
one to air one to fire and so forth they

654
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,280
try to give

655
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,200
physical reality to symmetric objects

656
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,480
these symmetric objects are symmetries

657
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,240
of rotation

658
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,839
and discrete symmetry groups we call

659
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,359
today of rotation group in three

660
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,918
dimensions

661
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,359
now we know now we kind of laugh at the

662
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,759
way they were trying to connect that

663
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,959
symmetry to you know the laws of the the

664
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,240
realities of

665
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,759
of physics but actually it turns out

666
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,839
in modern days we use symmetries in not

667
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,839
too far away

668
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,519
exactly in these kind of thoughts

669
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,119
processes in the following way

670
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,119
in the co in the context of string

671
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,359
theory which is this

672
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,719
the field i study we have these extra

673
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,719
dimensions

674
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,400
and these extra dimensions are compact

675
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,120
tiny spaces typically but they have

676
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,880
different shapes and sizes

677
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,038
we have learned that if you if these

678
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,360
extra shapes and sizes have symmetries

679
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,200
which are related to the same rotation

680
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,079
symmetries that the greek we're talking

681
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,400
about

682
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,199
if they enjoy those discrete symmetries

683
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,960
and if you

684
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,080
if you take that symmetry and quotient

685
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,480
the space by that in other words

686
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,359
identify points under these symmetries

687
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,480
you get properties of that space at the

688
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,519
singular points

689
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,240
which force emanates from them what

690
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,158
forces

691
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,159
forces like the ones we have seen in

692
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,200
nature today like electric forces

693
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,120
like strong forces like weak forces so

694
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,279
these same principles

695
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,439
that was were driving them to connect

696
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:09,038
geometry and symmetries

697
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,400
to nature is driving today's

698
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:14,798
physics now much more you know modern

699
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
ideas but nevertheless the symmetries

700
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,558
connecting

701
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,159
geometry to physics in fact often we

702
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,240
sometimes we have we ask the following

703
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,520
questions suppose i want to get this

704
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,200
particular

705
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,200
you know physical reality i want to have

706
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,720
this particles with these forces and so

707
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,480
on what do i do

708
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,159
it turns out that you can geometrically

709
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,000
design the space

710
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,520
to give you that you say oh i put the

711
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,558
sphere here i would do this i will

712
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,158
shrink them

713
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,720
so if you have two spheres touching each

714
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,559
other and shrinking through

715
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,759
to zero size that gives you strong

716
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,119
forces

717
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,480
if you have one of them it gives you the

718
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,399
weak forces if you have this you get

719
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,038
that and if you want to unify forces do

720
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,000
the other thing

721
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,919
so these geometrical translation of

722
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,440
physics is one of my favorite things

723
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,799
that we have discovered in modern

724
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
physics in the context of strength

725
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:58,798
theory

726
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,798
the sad thing is when you go into

727
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,440
multiple dimensions and

728
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:03,918
we'll talk about it is we start to lose

729
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,679
our

730
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,919
capacity to uh visually intuit

731
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,679
the world we're discussing and then we

732
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,640
go into the realm of mathematics and

733
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,400
we'll lose that

734
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,159
unfortunately our brains are such that

735
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,080
we're limited but

736
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,760
before we go into that mysterious

737
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,599
beautiful world

738
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,038
let's take a small step back and you

739
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,079
also in your book have this

740
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,679
kind of through the space of puzzles

741
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,720
through the space of ideas have a

742
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,200
brief history of physics

743
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,798
of physical ideas now we we talked about

744
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,159
newtonian mechanics

745
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,879
uh leading all through different

746
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,039
lagrangian hamiltonian mechanics

747
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,720
can you describe some of the key ideas

748
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,079
in the history of physics

749
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,600
maybe lingering on each from

750
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,839
electromagnetism to relativity to

751
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,079
quantum mechanics and to today as we'll

752
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,558
talk about with quantum gravity and

753
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,319
strength theory sure so um i mentioned

754
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,359
the classical mechanics and the euler

755
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:02,720
lagrangian formulation

756
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:05,199
one of the next important milestones for

757
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,278
physics were the discoveries of laws of

758
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,000
their christian magnetism

759
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,599
so maxwell put put the discoveries all

760
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,519
together in the context of what we call

761
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,158
the maxwell's equations

762
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,079
and he noticed that when he put these

763
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,760
discoveries that you know faradays and

764
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,599
others had made

765
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,519
about electric and magnetic phenomena

766
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:25,038
the in terms of mathematical equations

767
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,759
it didn't quite work

768
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,960
there was a mathematical inconsistency

769
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,558
now

770
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,400
uh you know one could have had two

771
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,158
attitudes won't say okay who cares about

772
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,360
math i'm doing nature you know electric

773
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,600
force magnetic force

774
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,439
math i don't care about but it bothered

775
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,798
him it was inconsistent the equations

776
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,320
you were writing the two equations he

777
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,200
had written down did not agree with each

778
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,960
other

779
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,798
and this bothered him but he figured out

780
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,880
you know if you add this jiggle this

781
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:49,918
equation by adding one little term there

782
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,840
it works

783
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,278
at least it's consistent what is the

784
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,199
motivation for that term

785
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:57,119
he said i don't know have we seen it in

786
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,480
experiments no

787
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,399
why did you add it well because of

788
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,599
mathematical consistency so he said

789
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,679
okay math forced him to

790
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,158
do this term he added this term which we

791
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,000
now today call the maxwell term

792
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,278
and once he added that term his

793
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,960
equations were nice you know

794
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:14,319
differential equations mathematically

795
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,840
consistent beautiful

796
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:18,558
but he also found the new physical

797
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:18,959
phenomena he found that because of that

798
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,678
term

799
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,558
he could now get electric and magnetic

800
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,679
waves

801
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,440
moving through space

802
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,440
at a speed that he could calculate so he

803
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,880
calculated the speed of the wave

804
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,558
and low and behold he found it's the

805
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,000
same as the speed of light

806
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:35,440
which puzzled him because he didn't

807
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,679
think light had anything to do with

808
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,360
electricity and magnetism

809
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,360
but then he was courageous enough to say

810
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,959
well maybe light is nothing but these

811
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,479
electric and magnetic fields moving

812
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,240
around

813
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,679
and he didn't he wasn't alive to see the

814
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,359
verification of that prediction and

815
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,038
indeed was true so this mathematical

816
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,079
inconsistency which which we could say

817
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,919
you know this mathematical

818
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:03,359
beauty drove him to this physical

819
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,278
very important connection between light

820
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,519
and electric magnetic phenomena which

821
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,759
was later confirmed

822
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,960
so then physics progresses and it comes

823
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,278
to einstein

824
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,720
einstein looks at maxwell's equation

825
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,079
this is beautiful these are a nice

826
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,600
equation except

827
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,000
we get one speed light who measures this

828
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,639
light

829
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,480
speed and he asks the question are you

830
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,240
are you moving are you not moving if you

831
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,240
move the speed of light changes but

832
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,839
maxwell's equation has no hint of

833
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,400
different speeds of light it doesn't say

834
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,079
oh

835
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,278
only if you're not moving you get the

836
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,240
speed it's just you always get this

837
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,558
speed so

838
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,480
einstein was very puzzled and he he was

839
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,319
daring enough to say well you know maybe

840
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,558
everybody gets the same speed for light

841
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,240
yeah and that motivated his theory of

842
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:45,678
special relativity

843
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,278
and this is an interesting example

844
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,320
because the idea was motivated from

845
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,640
physics from

846
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,960
maxwell's equations from the fact that

847
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,559
people tried to

848
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,798
try to measure the properties of ether

849
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,639
which was supposed to be the medium in

850
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:03,200
which the light travels through

851
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,038
and the idea was that only in that in

852
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,720
that medium the speed the speed of

853
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,558
if you're at rest with respect to the

854
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,319
ether this speed the speed of light then

855
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:11,839
if you're moving the speed changes

856
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,278
and people did not discover it

857
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,038
michaelson and morley's experiments

858
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,119
showed there is no ether

859
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,398
so uh then einstein was courageous

860
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,479
enough to say you know light is

861
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,398
the same speed for everybody regardless

862
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,960
of whether you're moving or not

863
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,959
and the interesting thing is about

864
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,000
special theory of relativity is that

865
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,200
the under the math underpinning it is

866
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,480
very simple

867
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,519
it's linear algebra nothing terribly

868
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,759
deep

869
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,519
you can teach it at a high school level

870
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,679
if not earlier

871
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,359
okay is does that mean einstein's

872
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,759
especially relativity is boring

873
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,558
not at all so this is an example where

874
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,839
simple math

875
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,798
you know linear algebra leads to deep

876
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,038
physics

877
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,960
einstein's theory of special relativity

878
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,158
motivated by this inconsistency at

879
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,759
maxwell

880
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,120
equation would suggest for the speed of

881
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,200
light depending on who observes it

882
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,038
what's the most daring idea there that

883
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,960
that the the speed of light could be the

884
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,398
same everywhere that's the basic that's

885
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,079
the guts of it that's the core of

886
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,079
einstein's theory that statement

887
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,439
underlies the whole thing speed of light

888
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,319
is the same for everybody is hard to

889
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,679
swallow

890
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,240
and it doesn't sound right it sounds

891
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,399
completely wrong on the face of it

892
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,240
and it was it took einstein to make to

893
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,239
make this the daring statement

894
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,679
it would be it would be laughing in some

895
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,880
sense how could possibly how could

896
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,120
anybody make this

897
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,399
possibly ridiculous claim and it turned

898
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,359
out to be true how does that make you

899
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:31,839
feel because it

900
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,519
it still sounds ridiculous it sounds

901
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,599
ridiculous until you learn that

902
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,440
our intuition is at fault about the way

903
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,278
we conceive of space on time

904
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,200
the way we think about space on time is

905
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,278
wrong because we think about the nature

906
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,159
of time as absolute

907
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,159
and part of it is because we live in a

908
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,399
situation where we don't go with very

909
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,840
high speeds that our speeds are small

910
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:54,239
compared to the speed of light

911
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,759
and therefore the phenomena we we

912
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,278
observe does not distinguish the

913
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,960
relativity of time

914
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,640
the time also depends on who measures

915
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,880
that there's no absolute time

916
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,880
when you say it's noon today now it

917
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,480
depends on who's measuring it and it

918
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,399
not everybody would agree with that

919
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,480
statement and to see that

920
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:11,439
you will have to have fast observer

921
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,440
moving you know

922
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,200
speeds close to speed of light so so

923
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,759
this shows that our intuition is at

924
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,278
fault

925
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:22,640
and a lot of the discoveries in physics

926
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,599
precisely is getting rid of the wrong

927
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,919
old intuition

928
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:28,158
and it is funny because we get rid of it

929
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,559
but it always lingers in us in some form

930
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,559
like

931
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,000
even when i'm describing it i feel like

932
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:32,879
a little bit like isn't it you know

933
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,640
funny

934
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,880
as you're just feeling the same way it

935
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,480
is yes it is but we kind of

936
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,240
replace it by an intuition

937
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,720
and actually there's a very beautiful

938
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,240
example of this how physicist do this

939
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,839
try to replace their intuition and i

940
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,000
think this is one of my favorite

941
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:53,439
examples about how physicists

942
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,960
develop intuition it goes to the work of

943
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,679
galileo

944
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,519
so you know again uh let's go back to

945
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,399
greek philosophers or maybe aristotle in

946
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,480
this case

947
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,479
now again let's let's make a criticism

948
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,079
he thought that objects

949
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,759
the heavier objects fall faster than the

950
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,278
lighter objects makes sense

951
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,278
it kind of makes sense and you know

952
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,798
people say about feather and swan but

953
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:15,119
that's because of the air resistant but

954
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:17,599
you might think like if you have a heavy

955
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:19,119
stone and a light pebble the heavy one

956
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,480
will fall first if you don't

957
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,158
you know do any experiments that's the

958
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,919
first gut reaction i would say everybody

959
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,159
would say that's the natural thing

960
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,919
galileo did not believe this and he kind

961
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,960
of

962
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,880
did the experiment famously it said he

963
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,240
went on the top of piso tower and he

964
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,760
dropped you know these heavy and light

965
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,079
stones and they fell at the same time

966
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,158
when they he dropped it at the same time

967
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,000
from the same height okay good so he

968
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,399
said i'm done you know i've showed that

969
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
the

970
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:45,918
heavy and lighter objects fought the

971
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,480
same time i did the experiment

972
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,440
scientists at that time did not accept

973
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,599
it

974
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,558
why was that because at that time

975
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,359
science was not just

976
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,639
experimental the experiment was not

977
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,479
enough

978
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,960
they didn't think that they have to sort

979
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,960
their hands in doing experiments to get

980
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,360
to the reality they said why is it the

981
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,600
case

982
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,759
why so galileo had to come up with an

983
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,439
explanation of why heavier and lighter

984
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,759
objects fought the same ray

985
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,120
this is the way he convinced them using

986
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,079
symmetry

987
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,879
he said suppose you have three bricks

988
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,839
the same

989
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,840
shape the same size

990
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,960
same as everything and we hold these

991
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:28,480
three bricks at the same height

992
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,880
and drop them which one will fall to the

993
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,360
ground

994
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,240
first everybody said of course we know

995
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,678
that symmetry

996
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,359
tells you know they're all the same

997
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,880
shape same size same height

998
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,719
of course they fall at the same time

999
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,039
yeah we know that next next

1000
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,558
it's trivial he says okay what if we

1001
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:44,079
move these bricks around with the same

1002
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,200
height does it change the time they hit

1003
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,639
the ground

1004
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,240
they said if it's the same height again

1005
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,519
by the symmetry principle because the

1006
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,960
height translation horizontal

1007
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,798
translation the symmetry

1008
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,960
no it doesn't matter they all fall the

1009
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,960
same rate good doesn't matter how close

1010
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,960
i bring them together no it doesn't

1011
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,319
okay suppose i make the two bricks touch

1012
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,120
and then let them go do they fall out

1013
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,079
the same raid

1014
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,879
yes they do but they said well the two

1015
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,398
bricks that touch

1016
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,240
are twice more mass than this other

1017
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,518
brick and you just agreed that they

1018
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,960
fought the same rate

1019
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,038
they say yeah yeah we just agreed that's

1020
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,038
right that's strange yes

1021
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:16,558
so he deconfused them by the symmetry

1022
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,398
design so this way

1023
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,759
of repackaging some intuition a

1024
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,719
different intuition

1025
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,319
when the intuitions clash then you then

1026
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,960
you decide on the you replace the

1027
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,599
intuition

1028
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,000
that's brilliant i i in some of these

1029
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,278
dif

1030
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,200
more difficult physical ideas

1031
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:35,440
physics ideas in the 20th century in the

1032
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,159
21st century it starts becoming more and

1033
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,720
more difficult

1034
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,559
than replace the intuition you know what

1035
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,038
does the world look like for an object

1036
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,960
traveling close to the speed of light

1037
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:47,359
you start to think about like the edges

1038
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,000
of supermassive black holes

1039
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:50,959
and you start to think like what what's

1040
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,839
that look like

1041
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,679
or uh i've been re into gravitational

1042
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,000
waves recently

1043
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,000
it's like when the fabric of space-time

1044
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,398
is being morphed

1045
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,359
by gravity like what's that actually

1046
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,839
feel like

1047
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,639
if i'm writing a gravitational wave

1048
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,639
what's that feel like

1049
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:12,240
i mean i think some of those are more

1050
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,759
sort of hippie

1051
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,960
not useful uh intuitions to have

1052
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,640
but if you're an actual physicist or

1053
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,440
whatever the particular discipline is i

1054
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,440
wonder if it's possible to meditate

1055
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,000
to sort of uh escape through thinking

1056
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,720
prolonged thinking and meditation on a

1057
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,200
war

1058
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,200
on a world like live in a visualized

1059
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
world that's not like our own

1060
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,440
in order to understand a phenomenon

1061
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,679
deeply so like replace the intuition

1062
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,480
like through rigorous meditation on the

1063
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,720
idea

1064
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,640
in order to conceive of it i mean if we

1065
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,600
talk about multiple dimensions

1066
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,120
i wonder if there's a way to escape with

1067
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,038
the three-dimensional world

1068
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,239
in our mind in order to then start to

1069
00:33:55,038 --> 00:34:00,720
reason about it

1070
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,720
it's uh the more i talk to topologists

1071
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,599
the more they seem to not operate at all

1072
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,919
at all in the visual space

1073
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:09,598
they really trust the mathematics like

1074
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,000
which is really annoying to me because

1075
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,960
topology

1076
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,559
and differential geometry feels like it

1077
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,440
has a lot of potential for beautiful

1078
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:20,320
pictures

1079
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,760
yes i think they do actually i would not

1080
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,079
be able to

1081
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,159
uh do my my research if i don't have an

1082
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,639
intuitive feel about geometry

1083
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,559
and i i will get to it as you mentioned

1084
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,159
late uh before that

1085
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:33,440
how for example in strength there you

1086
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,398
deal with these extra dimensions and

1087
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,760
i'll be very happy

1088
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:37,598
to describe how we do it because with

1089
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,159
that intuition we will not get anywhere

1090
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,599
and i

1091
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,280
i don't think you can just rely on

1092
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,119
formalism i don't

1093
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,200
i don't think any physicist just relies

1094
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,639
on formalism that's not physics that's

1095
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,638
not understanding

1096
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,399
so we have to intuit it and that's

1097
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,838
crucial and this there are steps of

1098
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:52,638
doing it and we learned it might not be

1099
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,559
trivial

1100
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,399
but we learned how to do it similar to

1101
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,679
this galileo picture i just told you

1102
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:03,759
you have to build these gradually but

1103
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:06,799
about to connect the bricks

1104
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,480
literally yeah so yeah so then uh so

1105
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,920
going back to your question about this

1106
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,719
the path of the history of the science

1107
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,400
so i was

1108
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,480
saying about the existing magnesium and

1109
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,119
the special relativity where simple idea

1110
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,079
led to special relativity but then he

1111
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,160
went further

1112
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,160
thinking about acceleration in the

1113
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,679
context of relativity and he came up

1114
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,799
with general relativity

1115
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,960
where he talked about you know the

1116
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,000
fabric of space time being curved and so

1117
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,639
forth and

1118
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,920
matter affecting the the curvature of

1119
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,679
the space on time so

1120
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,680
so this gradually became a

1121
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,479
connection between geometry and physics

1122
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,519
namely he replaced newton's

1123
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,920
you know gravitational force with

1124
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,679
a very geometrical beautiful picture

1125
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,920
it's much more elegant than newton's but

1126
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:53,679
much more complicated mathematically

1127
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,680
so so when we say it's simpler we mean

1128
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,838
in some form it's simpler but not in

1129
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:58,719
pragmatic terms of equation solving the

1130
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:00,719
equations are

1131
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,239
much harder to solve in einstein's

1132
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,838
theory and in fact so much

1133
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,519
so much harder that einstein himself

1134
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:06,799
couldn't solve many of his many of the

1135
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,400
cases he thought for example you

1136
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,200
couldn't solve the equation for a

1137
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,800
spherical symmetric matter uh like like

1138
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,159
if you had this symmetric sun

1139
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,000
he didn't think you can actually write

1140
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,759
this solve his equation for that and

1141
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,239
a year after he he said that it was

1142
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,920
solved by by short child so it was

1143
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,358
it was that hard that he didn't think

1144
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,880
it's going to be that easy so yeah the

1145
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,880
formalism is hard

1146
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,320
but the contrast between the special

1147
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,760
relativity and general relativity is

1148
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,440
very interesting because one of them has

1149
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,520
almost trivial math

1150
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,480
and the other one has super complicated

1151
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:37,519
math

1152
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,000
both are physically amazingly important

1153
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:41,759
and so so we have learned that you know

1154
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,800
the physics

1155
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,280
may or may not require complicated math

1156
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,720
we should not shy from using complicated

1157
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,240
math like einstein did

1158
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,598
nobody einstein wouldn't say i'm not

1159
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,118
going to touch this math because it's

1160
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,800
too much you know

1161
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,240
tensors or you know curvature and i

1162
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,079
don't like four-dimensional space-time

1163
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,399
because i can't see four-dimension

1164
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,000
he wasn't doing that he was willing to

1165
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,000
abstract from that because

1166
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,760
physics drove him in that direction but

1167
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,480
his motivation was physics physics

1168
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,440
pushed him

1169
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,358
just like newton pushed to develop

1170
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,039
calculus because physics pushed him that

1171
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,000
he didn't have the tools so he had to

1172
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,480
develop the tools

1173
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,719
to answer his physics questions so his

1174
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,719
motivation was physics again

1175
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,799
so to me those are examples which showed

1176
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,879
that math and physics have this

1177
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,119
symbiotic reality relationship which

1178
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,280
which kind of reinforce each other here

1179
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,760
i'm using i'm giving you examples

1180
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,280
of both of them namely newton's work led

1181
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,760
to development of mathematics

1182
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,480
calculus and in the case of einstein he

1183
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,200
didn't develop

1184
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,320
the premium geometry just use them so so

1185
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,159
it goes both ways

1186
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,920
and in the context of modern physics we

1187
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,480
see that again and again it goes both

1188
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,960
ways

1189
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,559
let me ask a ridiculous question you

1190
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,599
know you talk about your favorite soccer

1191
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:50,799
player at a bar

1192
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,960
i'll ask the same question about

1193
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,440
einstein's ideas which is

1194
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,480
uh which one do you think is the biggest

1195
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,920
leap of genius

1196
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,400
is it the uh e equals mc squared

1197
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,119
is the brownian motion is it special

1198
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,440
relativity is the general relativity

1199
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,880
which which of of the famous set of

1200
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,679
papers he's written in

1201
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,680
1905 and in general his work was the

1202
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,319
biggest leap of genius

1203
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,078
in my opinion special relativity the

1204
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,838
idea that speed of light is the same

1205
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,039
for everybody is the beginning of

1206
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,559
everything he did at the beginning is

1207
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,119
this the beginning it's just once you

1208
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,679
embrace

1209
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,480
that weirdness the all the weirdness i

1210
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,078
would say that's

1211
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,000
that's it even though he says the most

1212
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,440
beautiful moment for him yes he says

1213
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,039
that is when he realized that if you

1214
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,559
fall in an elevator you don't know if

1215
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,920
you're falling or whether you're

1216
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,679
in the whether you're in the falling

1217
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,039
elevator or whether you're next to the

1218
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,679
earth gravitational field

1219
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:43,358
that that to him was his aha moment

1220
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,960
which inertial mass and gravitational

1221
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,880
mass being identical

1222
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,800
geometrically and so forth as part of

1223
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,838
the theory not because of

1224
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,519
uh you know some some funny coincidence

1225
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,199
uh that's for him but i feel from

1226
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,280
outside at least it feels like

1227
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,399
the speed of light being the same is the

1228
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,640
is the really

1229
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,079
aha moment the general relativity to you

1230
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:05,118
is not

1231
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,480
like the conception of space time in a

1232
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,440
sense the conception of space time

1233
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,880
already was

1234
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,800
part of the speciality when you talk

1235
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,400
about length contraction

1236
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,320
so general relativity takes that to the

1237
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,039
next step but beginning of it was

1238
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,838
already

1239
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,199
space link contracts time dilays so once

1240
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:20,639
you talk about those then yeah you can

1241
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,838
dilate more or less different places

1242
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,440
than it's curvature

1243
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:25,838
so you don't have a choice so it's kind

1244
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,400
of started just with that same simple

1245
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:28,960
thought

1246
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,079
speed of light is the same for all where

1247
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,480
does uh

1248
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,320
quantum mechanics come into view exactly

1249
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,039
so this is the next step so einstein's

1250
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,039
you know

1251
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,480
uh develops general activity and is

1252
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:39,920
beginning to develop the foundation of

1253
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,240
quantum mechanics at the same time the

1254
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,358
photoelectric effects on others

1255
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,959
and um so so quantum mechanics overtakes

1256
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:48,078
in fact einstein in many ways because he

1257
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,760
doesn't like the

1258
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,280
probabilistic interpretation of quantum

1259
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,240
mechanics and the formulas that's

1260
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,760
emerging

1261
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,319
but physicists march on and try to for

1262
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,760
example

1263
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,400
combine einstein's theory of relativity

1264
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,000
with quantum mechanics so dirac takes

1265
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,800
special relativity

1266
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,760
tries to see how is it compatible with

1267
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,519
quantum mechanics

1268
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,440
can we pause and briefly say what is

1269
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:12,800
quantum mechanics oh yes sure so quantum

1270
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,440
mechanics

1271
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,280
so i i discussed briefly when i talked

1272
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,480
about the connection between newtonian

1273
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,960
mechanics

1274
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,400
and the euler lagrangian formulation of

1275
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,760
of the newtonian mechanics and

1276
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,639
interpretation of this

1277
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,480
audio dot grunge formalism in terms of

1278
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,239
the paths that the particle take

1279
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,519
so when we say a particle goes from here

1280
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,159
to here

1281
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,239
we usually think it classically it

1282
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,719
follows a specific trajectory

1283
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,279
but actually in quantum mechanics it

1284
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,598
falls

1285
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,880
follows every trajectory with different

1286
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,079
probabilities

1287
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,000
and so there's this fuzziness now

1288
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,280
most probable it's the path that you

1289
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,199
actually see

1290
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,800
and the deviation from that is very very

1291
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,759
unlikely and probabilistically very

1292
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,519
minuscule

1293
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,000
so in everyday experiments we don't see

1294
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:00,400
anything deviated from what we expect

1295
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,318
but quantum mechanics tells us that the

1296
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,838
things are more fuzzy things are

1297
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:08,159
are not as precise as the line you draw

1298
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,920
things are a bit like cloud so if you go

1299
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,480
to microscopic

1300
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,720
uh scales like atomic scales and lower

1301
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,119
these phenomena become more pronounced

1302
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,559
you can see it much better the electron

1303
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,200
is is not at the point but

1304
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:23,440
the clouds spread out around the nucleus

1305
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:24,399
and so this fuzziness this probabilistic

1306
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,599
aspect

1307
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,160
of reality is what quantum mechanics

1308
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,599
describes can i briefly pause on that on

1309
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,759
that idea

1310
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:37,280
do you think this is quantum mechanics

1311
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,720
is just a really damn good approximation

1312
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,359
a tool for predicting reality or does it

1313
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,039
actually describe reality

1314
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:46,960
do you think reality is fuzzy at that

1315
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,639
level well i think that

1316
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,838
reality is fuzzy at that level but i

1317
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,519
don't think quantum mechanics is

1318
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,799
necessarily the end of the story

1319
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:56,719
right so um so quantum mechanics is

1320
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,119
certainly an improvement over classical

1321
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,078
physics that much we know by experiments

1322
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,079
and so forth

1323
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,920
whether i'm happy with quantum mechanics

1324
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,440
whether i view quantum mechanics

1325
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,440
for example the the thought the

1326
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,119
measurement uh

1327
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,800
description of quantum mechanics am i

1328
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,760
happy with it am i thinking that's the

1329
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,599
end stage or not

1330
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,599
i don't i don't think we're at the end

1331
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,760
of that story and many physicists

1332
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,960
may or may not view this way some do

1333
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,440
some don't

1334
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,960
but i think that it's the best we have

1335
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,639
right now that's for sure

1336
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,720
it's the best approximation for reality

1337
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,559
we know today and so far we don't know

1338
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:30,399
what it is the next thing that

1339
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,759
improves it or replaces it and so on so

1340
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
but as i mentioned before i don't

1341
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,800
believe

1342
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,440
any of the laws of physics we know today

1343
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,519
are friends

1344
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,838
that's exactly correct it doesn't bother

1345
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,838
me yes i'm not like dogmatic say i have

1346
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,559
figured out this is the law of nature

1347
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,078
i know everything no no that's that's

1348
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,519
the the beauty about science is that we

1349
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,599
are not dogmatic

1350
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,880
and we are we are willing to in fact we

1351
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,000
are encouraged to

1352
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,358
be skeptical of what we ourselves do so

1353
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,719
you were talking about dirac

1354
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:59,598
yes i was talking about direct right so

1355
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:02,159
direct was trying to now combine this

1356
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,760
schrodinger's equations which which was

1357
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:04,159
described in the context of you know

1358
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,000
trying to

1359
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,199
talk about how these probabilistic waves

1360
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,519
of electrons move

1361
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,799
for the atom which was good for for

1362
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,679
speeds which were not too close to the

1363
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,359
speed of light

1364
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,879
to what happens when you get to the near

1365
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,880
the speed of light

1366
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,720
so then you need relativity so then

1367
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,640
dirac tried to combine einstein's

1368
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:23,679
relativity with quantum mechanics

1369
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,199
so he tried to combine them and he wrote

1370
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:28,000
this beautiful equation

1371
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:30,318
the dirac equation which roughly

1372
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,318
speaking take the square root of of the

1373
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:33,838
einstein's equation in order to connect

1374
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,119
it to schrodinger's time evolution

1375
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,519
operator which is

1376
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,400
first order in time derivative to get

1377
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:40,079
rid of the

1378
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,358
the naive thing that einstein's equation

1379
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,280
would have given which is second order

1380
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:44,880
so you have to take a square root

1381
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,440
now square root usually has a plus or

1382
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,519
minus sign when you take it

1383
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,720
and when he did this he originally

1384
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:52,000
didn't notice this

1385
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,399
didn't pay attention to this plus or

1386
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,079
minus sign but later physics pointed out

1387
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,160
to direct says look there's also this

1388
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,039
minus sign and if you use this minus

1389
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:04,318
sign you get negative energy

1390
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,599
in fact it was very very annoying that

1391
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:07,759
you know somebody else tells you this

1392
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,359
obvious mistake you make paulie

1393
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,640
famous physicist told direct this is

1394
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:12,159
nonsense you're going to get negative

1395
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,920
energy with your equation with negative

1396
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,759
energy without any bottom you can go all

1397
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,200
the way down to negative

1398
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,599
infinite energy so it doesn't make any

1399
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,519
sense direct thought about it and then

1400
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,359
he remembered paulie's exclusion

1401
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,239
principle before just before him paulie

1402
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:25,440
had said you know

1403
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,439
there's this principle called the

1404
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,800
exclusion principle that you know two or

1405
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,318
two electrons cannot be on the same

1406
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,720
orbit

1407
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:35,519
and so direct said okay you know what

1408
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:38,879
all these negative energy states

1409
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:42,159
are filled orbits occupied

1410
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,960
so according to you uh

1411
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:47,279
mr paulie there's no place to go so

1412
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,240
therefore they only have to go positive

1413
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,920
sounded like a big cheat and then paulie

1414
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,598
said oh you know what

1415
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,800
we can change orbits from one orbit to

1416
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,400
another what if i take one of these

1417
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,519
negative energy orbits and put it up

1418
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,920
there

1419
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,838
then it seems to be a new particle which

1420
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,760
has opposite

1421
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:06,078
properties to the electron has positive

1422
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,119
energy but it has positive charge

1423
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,800
what is that like

1424
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,720
the iraq was a bit worried he said maybe

1425
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,280
that's proton because proton has plus

1426
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,399
charge he wasn't sure but then he said

1427
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,160
oh maybe it's proton

1428
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,760
but then they said no no no it has the

1429
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:22,159
same mass as the electron cannot be

1430
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,160
proton because proton is heavier

1431
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,598
the iraq was stuck he says well then

1432
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:27,598
maybe another part we haven't seen

1433
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,719
by that time dirac himself was getting a

1434
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:32,318
little bit

1435
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,078
worried about his own equation and his

1436
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:37,199
own crazy interpretation

1437
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,960
yes until a few years later anderson in

1438
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,318
photographic cosmic uh

1439
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,159
in the photographic place that he had

1440
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:46,000
gotten from this cosmic rays

1441
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:47,598
he discovered a particle which goes in

1442
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,838
the opposite direction that the electron

1443
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:53,440
goes when there's a magnetic field

1444
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:55,119
and with the same mass exactly like what

1445
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,599
the iraq had predicted

1446
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,640
and this was what we call now positron

1447
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,559
and in fact

1448
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,118
beginning with the work of dirac we know

1449
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,719
that every particle has an anti-particle

1450
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,559
and so this idea that there's an

1451
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,719
anti-particle came from the simple math

1452
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:12,719
you know there's a plus and a minus

1453
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:15,358
from the directs quote-unquote mistake

1454
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,679
so again trying to combine ideas

1455
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,279
sometimes the math is smarter than the

1456
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,199
person who uses it to

1457
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,040
apply it and you try to resist it and

1458
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,960
then you you kind of confront it by

1459
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,559
criticism which is the way it should be

1460
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,920
so physicist comes and said no no that's

1461
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,639
wrong and you correct it and so on so

1462
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,960
that

1463
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:32,719
is the development of the idea there's

1464
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,318
particle there's antiparticle and so on

1465
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,759
so this is the beginning of

1466
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,838
development of quantum mechanics and the

1467
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,680
connection with relativity but the thing

1468
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:41,358
was more challenging because

1469
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:42,719
we had to also describe how electric and

1470
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,039
magnetic fields

1471
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,639
work with quantum mechanics this was

1472
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,599
much more complicated because it's not

1473
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,118
just one point

1474
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,440
electric and magnetic fields were

1475
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,358
everywhere so you had to talk about

1476
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,039
fluctuating and a fuzziness of

1477
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:56,239
electrical field and magnetic fields

1478
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,119
everywhere

1479
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,559
and the math for that was was was very

1480
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,559
difficult to deal with

1481
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,000
and this led to a subject called quantum

1482
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:05,599
field theory fields

1483
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,440
like electric and magnetic field to be

1484
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,720
quantum had to be described

1485
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,599
also in a wavy way feinman in particular

1486
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:15,039
was one of the pioneers along with

1487
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,119
schwinger's and others

1488
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:18,719
to try to come up with the formalism to

1489
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,800
deal with fields

1490
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,558
like electric and magnetic fields

1491
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,400
interacting with electrons

1492
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,839
in a consistent quantum fashion and they

1493
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,240
just developed this beautiful theory

1494
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:30,318
quantum electrodynamics from that and

1495
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,078
later on that same formalism quantum

1496
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,920
field theory led to the

1497
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,920
discovery of other forces and other

1498
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,800
particles all consistent with the idea

1499
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,079
of quantum

1500
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,720
mechanics so that was how physics

1501
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,720
progressed

1502
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:45,759
and so basically we learned that all

1503
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:47,679
particles and all the forces

1504
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,599
are are in some sense related to

1505
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:51,598
particle exchanges

1506
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,880
and so for example electromagnetic

1507
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,559
forces are

1508
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,318
are mediated by a particle we call

1509
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,480
photon and

1510
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:59,838
uh and so forth and the same for other

1511
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,358
forces that they discovered strong

1512
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:02,799
forces and the weak forces so

1513
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,039
so we got the sense of what quantum

1514
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,559
field theory is is that a big leap

1515
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:12,079
of uh of an idea that uh

1516
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:14,960
particles are fluctuations in the field

1517
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,960
like the idea that everything is a field

1518
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,119
is the old einstein

1519
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,119
light is a wave both a particle and a

1520
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,559
wave kind of idea is that is that a huge

1521
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,240
leap in our understanding of conceiving

1522
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,079
the universe's fields

1523
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,598
i would say so i would say that on

1524
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,920
viewing the particles

1525
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,519
this duality that bore mentioned between

1526
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,960
particles and waves that waves can

1527
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:36,239
behave sometimes like particles

1528
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,039
sometimes like waves

1529
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,078
is one of the biggest leaps of

1530
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,800
imagination

1531
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,559
that quantum mechanics made physics do

1532
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,920
so i agree that that is

1533
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:49,359
quite remarkable is duality fundamental

1534
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,039
to

1535
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:52,719
to the universe or is it just because we

1536
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:55,759
don't understand it fully like we'll

1537
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:57,759
eventually collapse into a clean

1538
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,480
explanation that doesn't require duality

1539
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,599
like

1540
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,880
th that that a phenomenon could be two

1541
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,160
things at once and both

1542
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,720
to be true so that seems weird so in

1543
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:08,639
fact i

1544
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,159
i i was going to get to that when we get

1545
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:10,879
to string theory but maybe i can comment

1546
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,118
on that now

1547
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,318
duality turns out to be running the show

1548
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,160
today is the whole thing

1549
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,679
that we are doing in strength duality is

1550
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:19,679
the name of the game

1551
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,118
so it's the most beautiful subject i

1552
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:22,078
want to talk about let's let's talk

1553
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,599
about it in the context

1554
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,039
let's talk about the other strengths so

1555
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,559
we uh do want to take a next step into

1556
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,400
because we mentioned general relativity

1557
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,680
we mentioned quantum mechanics

1558
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,519
is there something to be said about

1559
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:34,879
quantum gravity yes that's exactly the

1560
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,719
right point to talk about

1561
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,559
so namely we have talked about quantum

1562
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,759
fields and i talked about electric

1563
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,680
forces

1564
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,400
photon being the particle carrying those

1565
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:46,799
forces so for gravity

1566
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,400
quantizing gravitational field which is

1567
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,440
this curvature of space time according

1568
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,480
to einstein

1569
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,760
you get another particle called graviton

1570
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,318
so what about gravitons should be there

1571
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,960
no problem so then you start computing

1572
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:00,800
it

1573
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,519
what do i mean by computing it well you

1574
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,200
compute scattering of one graviton off

1575
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:06,880
another graviton maybe with graviton

1576
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:07,919
with an electron and so on see what you

1577
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,039
get

1578
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,880
feynman had already mastered the this

1579
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:14,318
quantum electrodynamics you said no

1580
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,119
problem let me do it

1581
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,880
even though these are such weak forces

1582
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,519
the gravity is very weak so therefore to

1583
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,280
see them

1584
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,119
these quantum effects of gravitational

1585
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,079
waves is was impossible

1586
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,838
it's even impossible today so feynman

1587
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,119
just did it for fun

1588
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:30,318
he usually you know had this mindset

1589
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,920
that i want to do something which i will

1590
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,239
see an experiment but this one let's

1591
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,079
just see what it does

1592
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,879
and he was surprised because the same

1593
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:40,160
techniques he was using for doing

1594
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,559
the same calculations quantum

1595
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:46,159
electrodynamics when applied to gravity

1596
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,680
failed the formula seemed to make sense

1597
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,960
but he had to do some integrals and he

1598
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,960
found that when he does those integrals

1599
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,480
he got infinity

1600
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,838
and it didn't make any sense now there

1601
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,358
are similar infinities in the other

1602
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:56,880
pieces that but he had managed to make

1603
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,199
sense out of those before

1604
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,920
this was no way he could make sense out

1605
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,519
of it he just didn't know what to do

1606
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,680
he didn't feel as an urgent issue

1607
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,440
because nobody could do the experiment

1608
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:08,719
so he was kind of said okay there's this

1609
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,159
thing but okay we don't know how to

1610
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,239
exactly do it but

1611
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,000
but that's the way it is so in some

1612
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,838
sense a natural conclusion

1613
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,079
from what feynman did could have been

1614
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:19,279
like gravity cannot be consistent with

1615
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,800
quantum theory

1616
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,160
but that cannot be the case because

1617
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,280
gravity is in our universe quantum

1618
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:25,519
mechanics is our universe they both

1619
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,000
together somehow it should work

1620
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:29,599
so it's not acceptable to say you know

1621
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,280
they don't work together so

1622
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,119
so that was a puzzle how does it

1623
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,720
possibly work it was

1624
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,400
left open and then we get to the string

1625
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:40,078
theory so this is the puzzle of quantum

1626
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,358
gravity the particle description of

1627
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,079
quantum gravity fails

1628
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:45,759
so the infinity shows up what do we do

1629
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,359
what do we do with infinity

1630
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,000
let's get to the fun part let's talk

1631
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:53,199
about string theory yes

1632
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,239
uh let's uh discuss some

1633
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,679
technical basics of uh string theory

1634
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,919
what is string theory

1635
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,960
what is the string how many dimensions

1636
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,039
are we talking about

1637
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,960
what are the different states how do we

1638
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:08,000
represent the elementary particles

1639
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:12,079
and the laws of physics using this

1640
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,159
new framework so string theory

1641
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,119
is the idea that the fundamental

1642
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:17,920
entities are not

1643
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,838
particles but extended higher

1644
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,960
dimensional objects like one-dimensional

1645
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:23,599
strings

1646
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,240
like loops these loops could be open

1647
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,119
like

1648
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,078
with two ends like an interval or a

1649
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,000
circle

1650
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,640
without any ends so and they're

1651
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,920
vibrating and moving around in space

1652
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,519
so how big they are well you can of

1653
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,280
course stretch it and make it big

1654
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:41,199
or you can just let it be whatever it

1655
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,920
wants it can be as small as a point

1656
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,879
because the

1657
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,358
circle can shrink to a point and be very

1658
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,960
light

1659
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:48,480
or you can you know stretch it and

1660
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,318
becomes very massive or it could

1661
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,199
oscillate and become massive that way so

1662
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:52,558
depends on

1663
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,558
which kind of state you have in fact

1664
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,839
this string can have infinitely many

1665
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,839
modes depending on which kind of

1666
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:59,358
oscillation it's doing like a guitar

1667
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:01,199
has different harmonics string has

1668
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:02,880
different harmonics but for the string

1669
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:04,799
each harmonic is a particle

1670
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,400
so each particle will give you ah this

1671
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,359
is a more massive harmonic this is a

1672
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,200
less mass

1673
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:10,639
so the lightest harmonic so to speak is

1674
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:13,199
no harmonics which means like

1675
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,159
a string strung to a point and then it

1676
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:16,078
becomes like a

1677
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:17,358
massless particles or light particles

1678
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,400
like photon

1679
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:21,598
and graviton and so forth so when when

1680
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,000
you look at

1681
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,359
tiny strings which are strong to a point

1682
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,199
the lightest ones

1683
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:28,639
they look like the particles that we we

1684
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:29,199
think they're like particles in other

1685
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:31,118
words

1686
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:32,399
from far away they look like a point but

1687
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,838
of course if you zoom in there's this

1688
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,960
tiny little you know little circle

1689
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,199
that's there

1690
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,480
that's strong to almost a point should

1691
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,719
we be imagining

1692
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,760
this is to the visual intuition should

1693
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:43,679
we be imagining

1694
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,359
literally strings that are potentially

1695
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:49,118
connected as a loop

1696
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,558
or not when you and when somebody

1697
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,599
outside of physics

1698
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:56,400
is imagining a basic element of string

1699
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:58,079
theory which is a string

1700
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,838
should we literally be thinking about a

1701
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,480
string yes you should literally think

1702
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,039
about string

1703
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,838
but string with zero thickness with zero

1704
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,838
thickness

1705
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,599
so notice it's a it's a it's a loop of

1706
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,279
energy so to speak

1707
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,720
if you can think of it that way and so

1708
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,160
there's a tension like the regular

1709
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:13,919
string if you pull it there's you know

1710
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:15,199
you have to you have to stretch it

1711
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,559
but it's not like a thickness like

1712
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:17,679
you're made of something it's just

1713
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,359
energy

1714
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:22,159
it's not made of atoms or something like

1715
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:24,558
that but and it is very very tiny

1716
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:25,598
much smaller than uh elementary

1717
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,760
particles of physics

1718
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,960
much smaller so we think if you let the

1719
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,880
string to be

1720
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,199
by itself the lowest state they'll be

1721
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,280
like a fuzziness or a size of that tiny

1722
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:37,519
little circle which is like a point

1723
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,640
about could be anything between we don't

1724
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:40,239
know the exact size but

1725
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:41,440
in different models have different sizes

1726
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:42,000
but something of the order of 10 to the

1727
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,119
minus

1728
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,880
let's say 30 centimeters so

1729
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,400
10 to the minus 30 centimeters just to

1730
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,200
compare with the size of the atom which

1731
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,838
is 10 to the minus

1732
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,279
8 centimeters is 22 orders of magnitude

1733
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:57,039
smaller

1734
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,040
so so unimaginably small very small so

1735
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,798
we basically think from far away string

1736
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:03,199
is like a point particle

1737
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,880
and that's why a lot of the things that

1738
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,879
we learned about point particle physics

1739
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,559
carries over directly to strings

1740
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,400
so therefore there's not not much of a

1741
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,920
mystery why particle physics was

1742
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,400
successful because string is like a

1743
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,200
particle when it's not stretched

1744
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,559
but it turns out having this size being

1745
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,358
able to oscillate

1746
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,319
get bigger turned out to be resolving

1747
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,960
these puzzles

1748
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,558
that feynman was having in calculating

1749
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,639
his diagrams

1750
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,920
and it gets rid of those infinities so

1751
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:32,400
when you're trying to do those

1752
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,240
infinities the regions that give

1753
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,838
infinities to feynman

1754
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:38,078
as soon as you get to those regions then

1755
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:39,519
this string starts to oscillate and

1756
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,480
these oscillation structure of the

1757
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,239
strings

1758
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,838
resolves those infinities to finite

1759
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:45,598
answer at the end so

1760
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:48,000
the size of the string the fact is one

1761
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,559
dimensional gives a finite answer at the

1762
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
end

1763
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:54,240
resolves this paradox now

1764
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,679
perhaps it's also useful to recount of

1765
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,239
how string theory came to be

1766
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,039
yes because it wasn't like somebody said

1767
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:02,000
well let me

1768
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,838
solve the problem of einstein's solve

1769
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,358
the problem that feynman had with

1770
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,759
unifying einstein stated with quantum

1771
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:08,400
mechanics by replacing the point by a

1772
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,079
string no

1773
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,680
that's not the way the thought process

1774
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,798
the thought process was

1775
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:16,639
much more random physicist

1776
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,079
veneziano in this case was trying to

1777
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,719
describe the interactions they were

1778
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,000
seeing in

1779
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:23,519
colliders in in accelerators

1780
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,119
and they were seeing that some process

1781
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:26,400
in some process when two particles came

1782
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,318
together

1783
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,760
and joined together and went they were

1784
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,558
separately

1785
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,920
in one way and the opposite way they

1786
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,000
behaved the same way

1787
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,519
in some way there was a symmetry a

1788
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,960
duality

1789
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,318
which she didn't understand the

1790
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,760
particles didn't seem to have that

1791
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:43,199
symmetry

1792
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,880
he said i don't know what it is what's

1793
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:46,159
the reason that these colliders and

1794
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,519
experiments we're doing seems to have

1795
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,679
the symmetry but let me write a

1796
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:51,920
mathematical formula

1797
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,759
which exhibits that symmetry he used

1798
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,960
gamma functions beta functions and all

1799
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,440
that you know complete

1800
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,119
math no physics other than trying to get

1801
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,440
symmetry out of his equation

1802
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,358
he just wrote down a formula as the

1803
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,599
answer for a process

1804
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:07,199
not not a method to compute it just say

1805
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,079
wouldn't it be nice if this was the

1806
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,639
answer

1807
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,000
yes this is looked at this one that's

1808
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,838
intriguing it has the symmetry

1809
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
all right but what is this where is this

1810
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:17,279
coming from which which kind of physics

1811
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,960
gives you this

1812
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,798
so i don't know yeah a few years later

1813
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,159
people saw that oh the equation that

1814
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:26,239
you're right is the process you're

1815
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:27,759
writing in the intermediate channels

1816
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:30,558
that particles come together

1817
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,240
seems to have all the harmonics harmonic

1818
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:33,760
sounds like a string

1819
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:35,199
let me see if what you're describing has

1820
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,760
anything with the strings and people try

1821
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:36,879
to see if

1822
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,880
what he's doing has anything with the

1823
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,880
strings oh yeah indeed

1824
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,798
if i study scattering of two strings i

1825
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,760
get exactly the formula you wrote down

1826
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:47,119
that was the reinterpretation of what he

1827
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,520
had written in the formula

1828
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,960
as a string but still had nothing to do

1829
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,880
with gravity

1830
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,318
it had nothing to do with resolving the

1831
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,039
problems of gravity with quantum

1832
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:57,519
mechanics

1833
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:58,880
it was just trying to explain a process

1834
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:01,119
that people were seeing in hydronic

1835
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,440
physics collisions

1836
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:05,119
so it took a few a few more years to get

1837
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,318
to that point

1838
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:10,400
they did notice that physics notice

1839
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,838
that whenever you try to find the

1840
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,280
spectrum of strings you always get a

1841
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:14,880
massive particle

1842
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,798
which has exactly the properties that

1843
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,559
the graviton is supposed to have

1844
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:20,000
and no particle in hydronic physics that

1845
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,880
had that property

1846
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,960
you are getting a massless graviton as

1847
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,440
part of this scattering without

1848
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,199
looking for it it was forced on you

1849
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,880
people were not trying to solve quantum

1850
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:31,759
gravity quantum gravity was pushed on

1851
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,838
them

1852
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,720
i don't want this graviton get rid of it

1853
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:38,880
they couldn't get rid of it they gave up

1854
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,558
trying to get rid of it physicists said

1855
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,200
shark and shorts said you know what

1856
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:45,519
strength is theory of quantum gravity

1857
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,118
they change their perspective altogether

1858
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:49,039
we are not describing the hydronic

1859
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,480
physics we are describing this theory of

1860
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,639
quantum gravity and that's when string

1861
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,719
theory probably got

1862
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,318
like exciting that this could be the

1863
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,318
unifying theory

1864
00:58:56,318 --> 00:58:59,440
exactly it got exciting but at the same

1865
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:01,838
time not so fast

1866
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,720
namely it should have been fast but it

1867
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:04,639
wasn't

1868
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:06,558
because particle physics through quantum

1869
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:09,118
filter was so successful

1870
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,040
at that time this is mid 70s standard

1871
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,720
model of physics electromagnetism and

1872
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:13,920
unification of electromagnetic forces

1873
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:15,439
with all the other forces

1874
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,280
were beginning to take place without the

1875
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,119
gravity part

1876
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,798
everything was working beautifully for

1877
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,039
particle physics

1878
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:24,559
and so that was the shining golden age

1879
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,960
of quantum field theory and all the

1880
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,880
experiments standard model this and that

1881
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,079
unification and spontaneous symmetry

1882
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,880
breaking was taking place all of them

1883
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:32,400
was nice

1884
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,240
this was kind of like a sideshow and

1885
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,480
nobody was paying so much attention

1886
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:38,078
this exotic string is needed for quantum

1887
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,358
gravity ah maybe there's other ways

1888
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,839
maybe we should do something else

1889
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:42,400
so yeah it wasn't paid much attention to

1890
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:44,159
and

1891
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,000
this took a little bit more effort to

1892
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:48,719
try to actually connect it to

1893
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,760
to the reality there are a few more

1894
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:51,838
steps first of all

1895
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,839
there was a puzzle that you were getting

1896
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:55,838
extra dimensions

1897
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:57,679
string was not working well with three

1898
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,880
spatial dimensions on one time

1899
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:02,399
it needed extra dimension now

1900
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,000
there are different versions of strings

1901
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,639
but the version that ended up being

1902
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,880
related

1903
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:08,159
to having particles like electron what

1904
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,640
we call fermions

1905
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:12,159
needed 10 dimensions what we call super

1906
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:13,838
string

1907
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,440
now why super white the word super it

1908
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:17,599
turns out this

1909
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,559
uh this version of the string which had

1910
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,760
fermions

1911
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,839
had an extra symmetry which we call

1912
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,160
supersymmetry

1913
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:28,719
this is a symmetry between a particle

1914
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:30,239
and another particle with exactly the

1915
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,399
same properties same mass

1916
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:33,838
same charge etc the only difference is

1917
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,318
that one of them has a little different

1918
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,400
spin

1919
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:37,599
than the other one and one and one of

1920
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,440
them is the boson

1921
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,960
one of them is a fermion because of that

1922
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,400
shift of spin

1923
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,639
otherwise they're identical so there was

1924
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,880
this symmetry string theory

1925
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:48,239
had the symmetry in fact supersymmetry

1926
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,440
was discovered

1927
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,959
through string theory theoretically

1928
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,559
so theoretically the first place that

1929
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,679
this was observed when when you were

1930
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,480
describing these

1931
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:00,159
fermionic strings so that was the

1932
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,079
beginning of the study of supersymmetry

1933
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:04,879
was the via string theory

1934
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,318
and then it had remarkable properties

1935
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,160
that you know this symmetry

1936
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:10,558
meant and so forth that people began

1937
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,480
studying supersymmetry after that

1938
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,160
and that was continuation that was kind

1939
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,559
of a tangent direction at the beginning

1940
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:18,078
for string theory but people in particle

1941
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,440
physics started also thinking oh

1942
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,240
supersymmetry is great let's see if we

1943
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,079
can have

1944
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:23,919
supersymmetry in particle physics and so

1945
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,680
forth forget about strings and they

1946
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,920
developed on a different track as well

1947
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:29,118
supersymmetry in different models became

1948
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,039
a subject on its own right

1949
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,160
understanding supersymmetry and what

1950
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:34,079
does this mean

1951
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,920
because it unified bosons and fermi and

1952
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,160
unifies some ideas together

1953
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,039
so photon is a boson electron is a

1954
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:40,558
fermion

1955
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,039
could things like that be somehow

1956
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,880
related it was a kind of a natural kind

1957
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,519
of a question to try to kind of unify

1958
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,559
because

1959
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:50,239
in physics we love unification now

1960
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,920
gradually string theory was beginning to

1961
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:52,879
show signs of unification it had

1962
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,798
graviton

1963
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,400
but people found that you also have

1964
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:58,000
things like photons in them

1965
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,920
different excitations of string behave

1966
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,960
like photons another one behaves like

1967
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,079
electron

1968
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,240
so a single string was unifying all

1969
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:09,599
these particles into one object

1970
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,479
that's remarkable it's in ten dimensions

1971
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,160
though

1972
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,760
it is not our universe because we live

1973
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:15,598
in three plus one dimension how could

1974
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,119
that be possibly true

1975
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,798
so this was a conundrum it was elegant

1976
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,838
it was beautiful but it was very

1977
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:23,519
specific

1978
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,960
about which dimension you're getting

1979
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:26,960
which structure you're getting

1980
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,400
it wasn't saying oh you just put d

1981
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,920
equals to four you'll get your space

1982
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,838
time dimension that you want no

1983
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,240
it didn't like that it said i want ten

1984
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:36,400
dimensions and that's the way it is

1985
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,399
so it was very specific now so people

1986
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,280
try to reconcile this by the idea that

1987
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,079
you know

1988
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,960
maybe these extra dimensions are tiny so

1989
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,359
if you take

1990
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,318
three macroscopic spatial dimensions on

1991
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,358
one time

1992
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:52,400
and six extra tiny spatial dimensions

1993
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:55,679
like tiny spheres or tiny circles then

1994
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,960
it avoids contradiction with manifest

1995
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:58,078
fact that we haven't seen extra

1996
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,039
dimensions in

1997
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:02,000
experiments today so that was a way to

1998
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,119
avoid

1999
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,760
conflict now this was a way to avoid

2000
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,119
conflict

2001
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,799
but it was not observed in experiments

2002
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,880
a string observed in experiments no

2003
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:14,838
because it's so small

2004
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,079
so it's beginning to sound a little bit

2005
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:18,960
funny

2006
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:21,200
similar feeling to the way perhaps drag

2007
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,960
had felt about this positron plus or

2008
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:24,078
minus you know it was beginning to sound

2009
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,440
a little bit like

2010
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,960
oh yeah not only i have to have ten

2011
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,559
dimension but i also have to this i have

2012
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,639
to also listen

2013
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,839
and so you so conservative physicists

2014
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:32,960
would say um

2015
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:35,199
you know i haven't seen these

2016
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,440
experiments i don't know if they are

2017
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:39,038
really there are you pulling my leg

2018
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,599
i do you want me to imagine things that

2019
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,799
are not there so this was an attitude of

2020
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,280
some physicist

2021
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:47,119
towards string theory despite the fact

2022
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,960
that the puzzle of gravity and quantum

2023
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,039
mechanics merging together work

2024
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,318
but still was this skepticism you're

2025
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,680
putting all these things that you want

2026
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:55,920
me to imagine there are these extra

2027
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:57,199
dimensions that i cannot see uh-huh

2028
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,639
and you want me to believe that stream

2029
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:00,159
that you have not even seen experiments

2030
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:01,038
are real uh-huh okay what else do you

2031
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:02,480
want me to believe

2032
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:04,160
so it was kind of beginning to sound a

2033
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,079
little funny now

2034
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:07,598
i was i would pass forward forward a

2035
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,960
little bit further

2036
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:12,000
um a few decades later when string3

2037
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,079
became the mainstream

2038
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,838
of efforts to unify the forces and

2039
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,720
particles together

2040
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:20,719
we learned that these extra dimensions

2041
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:23,038
actually solved problems

2042
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:24,318
they weren't in nuisance the way they

2043
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,720
originally appeared

2044
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:28,000
first of all the properties of these

2045
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:29,838
extra dimensions

2046
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,358
reflected the number of particles we got

2047
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:32,880
in four dimensions

2048
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:35,119
if you took these six dimensions to have

2049
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,760
like six five holes or four holes that

2050
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,200
tend to

2051
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,359
change the number of particles that you

2052
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:41,519
see in four dimensional space time

2053
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:43,279
you get one electron and one muon if you

2054
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,119
had this but if you did the other j

2055
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,880
shape you get something else so

2056
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,119
geometrically you could get different

2057
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,079
kinds of physics so it was kind of in

2058
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:54,000
a mirroring of geometry by physics down

2059
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,720
in the macroscopic space so these extra

2060
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,838
dimensions

2061
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:59,199
were becoming useful fine but we didn't

2062
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:00,798
need the extra dimensions to just write

2063
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:01,679
an electron in three dimensions we did

2064
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:04,400
we wrote it so

2065
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:06,000
so what was there any other puzzle yes

2066
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,318
there were

2067
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,798
hawking hawking had been studying black

2068
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:12,798
holes in mid 70s

2069
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:14,400
following the work of wickenstein who

2070
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:17,838
had predicted

2071
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,760
that black holes have entropy

2072
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:21,440
so wickenstein had tried to attach the

2073
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,119
entropy to the black hole

2074
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,280
if you throw something into that black

2075
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,960
hole the entropy seems to go down

2076
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,798
because you have something entropy in

2077
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,720
outside the black hole and you throw it

2078
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:32,000
entropy was you it black was unique so

2079
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,000
the entropy did not have any

2080
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,480
blackout no entropy so you seem the

2081
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,480
entropy seem to go down and so that's

2082
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,000
against the laws of thermodynamics so

2083
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,159
beckenstein was trying to say no no

2084
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,358
therefore black must have an entropy so

2085
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:45,199
he was trying to understand that he

2086
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:47,358
found that if you assign

2087
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:49,118
entropy to the to be proportional to the

2088
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,639
area of the black hole it seems to work

2089
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,960
and then hawking

2090
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:54,558
found not only that's correct he found

2091
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,318
the correct proportionality factor of

2092
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,760
factor of one quarter of the area and

2093
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:59,920
planck units is the

2094
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,039
correct amount of entropy and he gave an

2095
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,760
argument using

2096
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:05,280
quantum semi-classical arguments which

2097
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,799
barely which means basically using a

2098
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,000
little bit of a quantum mechanics

2099
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:10,159
because he didn't have the full quantum

2100
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
mechanics of string there he could do

2101
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:12,798
some aspects of approximate quantum

2102
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,880
arguments

2103
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:15,920
so heuristic quantum arguments led to

2104
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,039
this entropy form

2105
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,639
formula but then he didn't answer the

2106
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,880
following question

2107
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:24,318
he was getting a big entropy for the

2108
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,000
black hole the black hole with the size

2109
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:27,679
of the horizon of a black hole is huge

2110
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,599
has a huge amount of entropy

2111
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:31,118
what are the microstates of this entropy

2112
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,160
when you say for example the gaseous

2113
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,079
entropy

2114
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,679
you count where the atoms are you count

2115
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,039
this this bucket or that but there's an

2116
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:38,558
information about there and so on you

2117
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,480
count them

2118
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:41,760
for the black hole the way hawking was

2119
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,039
thinking there was no degree of freedom

2120
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,440
you throw them in

2121
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:46,240
and there was just one solution so where

2122
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,679
are these

2123
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:50,000
entropy what are what are these

2124
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:52,639
microscopic states

2125
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,760
they were hidden somewhere so later in

2126
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:56,078
string theory

2127
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,520
uh the work that we did with my

2128
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,680
colleague strong manager

2129
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:02,079
in particular showed that these

2130
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:05,038
ingredients in string theory

2131
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,920
of black hole arise from the extra

2132
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,240
dimensions

2133
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,079
so the degrees of freedom are are hidden

2134
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:12,318
in terms of things like strings

2135
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,599
wrapping these extra circles in these

2136
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:15,679
hidden dimensions

2137
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,440
and then we started counting how many

2138
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:18,480
ways like the strings can wrap around

2139
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,079
this circle and the

2140
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,519
extra dimension or that circle and

2141
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,318
counted the microscopic degrees of

2142
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:24,400
freedom

2143
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,519
and lo and behold we got the microscopic

2144
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,599
degrees of freedom that

2145
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:30,079
hawking was predicting four dimensions

2146
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,599
so the extra dimensions became useful

2147
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,680
for resolving a puzzle in four

2148
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,440
dimensions the puzzle was

2149
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:37,440
where are the degrees of freedom of the

2150
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,760
black hole hidden the answer

2151
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,960
hidden in the extra dimensions the tiny

2152
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,760
extra dimensions

2153
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,039
so then by this time it was beginning to

2154
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,720
we see aspects

2155
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,640
that extra dimensions are useful for

2156
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:50,159
many things it's not a nuisance

2157
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:51,920
it wasn't to be kind of you know be

2158
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:53,519
ashamed of it was actually in the

2159
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,680
welcome features

2160
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:57,199
new feature nevertheless how do you

2161
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:00,399
intuit

2162
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:03,118
the 10-dimensional world so yes it's a

2163
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:06,318
feature for describing certain phenomena

2164
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:11,119
like the the entropy in black holes

2165
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:13,199
but what you said that to you a theory

2166
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:15,760
becomes

2167
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,119
real or becomes powerful when you can

2168
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,679
connect it to some

2169
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:20,559
deep intuition so how do we intuit yes

2170
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,600
ten dimensions

2171
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:25,920
yes um so i will i will explain uh how

2172
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,640
some of the analogies work first of all

2173
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,199
we do a lot of analogies

2174
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,119
and by analogies we build intuition so i

2175
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:35,278
will i will start with this example

2176
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:37,358
i will try to explain that if we are in

2177
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,480
10 dimensional space

2178
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:42,719
if we have a seven dimensional plane and

2179
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:44,559
eight dimensional plane

2180
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,640
we ask typically in what space do they

2181
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,480
intersect each other in what dimension

2182
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,480
that might sound like how do you

2183
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,479
possibly give an answer to this

2184
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:54,000
so we start with lower dimensions we

2185
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:55,599
start with two dimensions we say if you

2186
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
have one dimension

2187
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,359
and a point do they intersect typically

2188
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,520
on a plane the answer is no

2189
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:02,798
so a line one dimensional a point zero

2190
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,239
dimension

2191
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:06,238
on a two dimensional plane they don't

2192
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:08,000
typically meet but if you have a

2193
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:10,399
one-dimensional line and another

2194
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,079
line which is one plus one on a plane

2195
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,559
they typically intersect

2196
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:16,158
at a point typically means if you're not

2197
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,960
parallel typically they intersect at a

2198
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:19,838
point

2199
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,560
so one plus one is two and in two

2200
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:22,158
dimension

2201
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,080
they intersect at the zero dimensional

2202
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,960
point so you see two dimension

2203
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:27,759
one and one two two minus two is zero so

2204
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,239
you get point

2205
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,759
out of intersection okay let's go to

2206
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,278
three dimension

2207
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,198
you have a plane two dimensional plane

2208
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,520
and a point do they intersect no two and

2209
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:37,519
zero

2210
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,520
how about a plane and a line a plane is

2211
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,880
two dimensional and a line is one two

2212
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,679
plus one is three

2213
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,798
in three dimension a plane and a line

2214
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,560
meet at points

2215
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:50,319
which is zero dimensionals three minus

2216
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,039
three is zero okay

2217
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,320
so plane and the line intersect at the

2218
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:55,760
point in three dimensions how about the

2219
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:57,759
plane on a plane in three d

2220
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,119
well plane is two and this is two two

2221
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,039
plus two is four

2222
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:03,039
in three d four minus three is one they

2223
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:04,479
intersect on a one dimensional line

2224
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:06,158
okay we're beginning to see the pattern

2225
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:08,000
okay now come to the question we're in

2226
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:09,439
ten dimensions now we have the intuition

2227
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,439
we have a seven dimensional plane and

2228
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,279
eight dimensional plane in ten dimension

2229
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:15,359
they intersect on a plane what's the

2230
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:16,800
dimension well seven plus eight is 15

2231
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:20,158
minus 10 is 5.

2232
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,760
we draw the same picture as two planes

2233
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:23,359
and we write seven dimension eight

2234
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,280
dimension but we have gotten the

2235
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:27,839
intuition from the lower dimensional one

2236
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,559
what to expect it doesn't scare us

2237
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,600
anymore

2238
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,280
so we draw this picture we cannot see

2239
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,760
all the seven dimensions by looking at

2240
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:36,319
this

2241
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,239
two-dimensional visualization of it but

2242
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:40,000
it has all the features we want

2243
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:42,079
it has so i we draw this picture which

2244
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,439
is seven seven and they they meet at the

2245
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:45,760
five-dimensional plane

2246
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:48,399
it says five so we have we have build

2247
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,880
this intuition now

2248
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:51,759
this is an example of how we come up

2249
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,199
with intuition

2250
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,360
let me give you more examples of it

2251
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:57,039
because i think this will show you that

2252
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:58,479
people have to come up with intuitions

2253
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:01,198
to visualize that otherwise we

2254
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:01,599
will be a little bit uh lost so what you

2255
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:03,279
just

2256
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,239
described is kind of uh in these high

2257
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:08,960
dimensional spaces focus on the meeting

2258
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:10,158
place of uh two planes in high

2259
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,079
dimensional spaces

2260
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:13,599
exactly how the planes meet for example

2261
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:15,760
what's the dimension of their

2262
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,960
intersection and so on so how do we come

2263
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,520
up with the intuition we

2264
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,800
borrow examples from door dimensions

2265
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,400
build up intuition and

2266
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,920
draw the same pictures as if we are

2267
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:25,439
talking about

2268
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,800
10 dimensions but we are drawing the

2269
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,158
same as the two dimensional plane

2270
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,360
because we cannot do any better

2271
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:33,439
but our our our words change

2272
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:35,759
but not our pictures so your senses we

2273
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:39,119
can have a deep understanding

2274
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,280
of reality by looking at its at slices

2275
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,800
a lower dimensional slice exactly

2276
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,399
exactly and this this is that comes

2277
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,039
brings me to the next example i want to

2278
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:47,198
mention

2279
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:48,479
which is sphere let's think about how do

2280
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:50,158
we think about the sphere

2281
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,759
well the sphere is a sphere you know the

2282
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:55,679
round nice thing but

2283
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:57,199
sphere has a circular symmetry now

2284
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,359
i can describe the sphere in the

2285
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:02,479
following way i can describe it

2286
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:04,479
by an interval which is

2287
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:06,238
think about this going from the north of

2288
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:08,000
the sphere to the south

2289
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,359
and at each point i have a circle

2290
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,039
attached to it

2291
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:12,799
so you can think about the sphere as a

2292
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:15,439
line with a circle attached with

2293
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,719
each point the circle shrinks to a

2294
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:18,399
circle string to a point

2295
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:21,760
at endpoints of the interval so i can

2296
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:24,559
say oh one way to think about the sphere

2297
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:26,239
is an interval where at each point on

2298
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,120
that interval there's another circle i'm

2299
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:29,279
not drawing

2300
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:31,198
but if you like you can just draw it say

2301
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:33,519
okay i won't draw it so from now on

2302
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:34,799
is this mnemonic i draw an interval when

2303
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,600
i want to talk about the sphere and you

2304
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,440
remember

2305
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,199
that the end points of the interval mean

2306
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:40,799
a strong circle that's all

2307
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:42,719
and they say yeah i see that's a sphere

2308
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,159
good now we want to talk about the

2309
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,520
product of two spheres

2310
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:47,920
that's four dimensional how can i

2311
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,520
visualize it easy

2312
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,440
you just take an interval and it's

2313
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,239
another interval that's just going to be

2314
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:56,000
a square

2315
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:58,799
yeah a square is a four dimensional

2316
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,238
space yeah why is that well at each

2317
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,239
point

2318
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:04,718
on the square there's two circles one

2319
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:06,479
for each of those directions you drew

2320
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,079
and when you get to the boundaries of

2321
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:09,759
each direction one of the circles shrink

2322
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:11,279
on each edge of that square

2323
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,600
and when you get to the corners of the

2324
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:15,840
square all both circles shrink

2325
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,360
this is a sphere times a sphere i have

2326
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,560
divine interval

2327
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:20,559
i just described for you a

2328
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,960
four-dimensional space do you want the

2329
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:26,080
six-dimensional space no problem

2330
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,359
take the take a corner of a room in fact

2331
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:28,880
if you want to have a sphere times a

2332
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:30,238
stick take sphere times the sphere times

2333
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,679
the sphere

2334
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:35,678
take a cube a cube

2335
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,119
is a rendition of this six dimensional

2336
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:38,719
space this two

2337
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:40,479
sphere times another sphere times on the

2338
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,760
sphere where three of the circles i'm

2339
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:43,039
not drawing for you

2340
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,800
for each one of those directions there's

2341
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:46,000
another circle but each time you get to

2342
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,920
the boundary of the cube one

2343
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,119
circle shrinks when the boundaries meet

2344
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,319
two circuit strings when three

2345
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:52,319
boundaries meet

2346
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:54,000
all the three circles shrink so i just

2347
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:55,519
give you a picture now

2348
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,198
mathematicians come up with amazing

2349
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,280
things like you know what i want to take

2350
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:01,279
a point in space and blow it up

2351
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:03,439
you know these concepts like topology

2352
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:05,599
and geometry complicated how do you do

2353
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:07,759
in this picture it's very easy blow it

2354
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,360
up in this picture means the following

2355
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,560
you think about this cube you go to the

2356
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:14,158
corner and you chop off a corner

2357
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,400
chopping off the corner replaces the

2358
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:17,039
point yeah you raise the point by

2359
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:18,879
triangle

2360
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:20,800
yes that's called blowing up a point and

2361
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,159
then this triangle is what they call p2

2362
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,480
projective two space

2363
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,319
but these pictures are very physical and

2364
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:28,000
you feel it there's nothing amazing i'm

2365
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:29,599
not talking about six dimension

2366
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,439
four plus six is ten the dimension of

2367
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,239
string theory so we can visualize that

2368
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:34,399
no problem

2369
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:35,919
okay so that's building the intuition to

2370
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:37,599
a complicated world

2371
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,920
of string theory nevertheless these

2372
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,920
objects are really small

2373
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,600
and just like you said experimental

2374
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,239
validation is very difficult because the

2375
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,120
objects

2376
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:48,319
are way smaller than anything that we

2377
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:51,198
currently have the tools and

2378
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:54,319
accelerators and so on to uh

2379
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:56,799
to reveal through experiment so

2380
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:58,238
there's a kind of skepticism that's not

2381
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,600
just about

2382
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:01,759
the nature of the theory because of the

2383
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,760
10 dimensions as you've explained

2384
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,880
but in that we can't experimentally

2385
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,679
validate it

2386
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,960
and it doesn't necessarily to date maybe

2387
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:12,000
can correct me

2388
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:15,119
predicts something fundamentally new

2389
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
so it's it's beautiful as an explaining

2390
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:18,319
theory

2391
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
which means that it's very possible that

2392
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:22,479
it is a fundamental theory that

2393
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,520
describes reality and unifies the laws

2394
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:29,039
but there's still a kind of skepticism

2395
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:31,760
and uh me from a sort of an outside

2396
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:32,800
observer perspective have been observing

2397
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,520
a little bit of a

2398
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,199
growing cynicism about string theory in

2399
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:40,159
the recent few years

2400
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:40,479
can you describe the cynicism about sort

2401
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:43,839
of

2402
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:46,959
by cynicism i mean a cynicism about

2403
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:50,719
the hope for this theory of

2404
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:54,000
pushing theoretical physics forward yes

2405
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:56,319
can you do describe why this is cynicism

2406
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,119
and how do we reverse that trend yes

2407
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:01,039
first of all

2408
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:04,000
the criticism uh for string theory

2409
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:05,279
uh is healthy in some in a sense that in

2410
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,640
science we

2411
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:08,399
we have to have different viewpoints and

2412
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,600
that's good so i don't i welcome

2413
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:12,319
criticism

2414
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,920
uh and the the the reason for criticism

2415
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:15,439
and i think that is a valid reason is

2416
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,039
that there has been zero experimental

2417
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:20,158
evidence for string theory

2418
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:21,519
that is no experiment has been done

2419
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:24,000
to show that there's you know there's

2420
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,120
this little loop of energy moving around

2421
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,399
and so that's a valid valid uh objection

2422
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:30,158
and valid worry

2423
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:31,839
and if i were to say you know what

2424
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:33,198
string theory can never be verified or

2425
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,640
experimentally checked that's the way it

2426
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:36,319
is

2427
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,760
they would have every right to say what

2428
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:39,679
you're talking about is not science

2429
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,239
because in science we will have to have

2430
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:44,560
experimental consequences and checks

2431
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:45,759
the difference between string theory and

2432
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,520
something which is not scientific is

2433
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,039
that string 3 has predictions

2434
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,880
the problem is that the predictions we

2435
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:53,519
have today of string theory is hard to

2436
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,719
access by experiments available with the

2437
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,640
energies we can

2438
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,760
achieve with the colliders today it

2439
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,039
doesn't mean there's a problem with

2440
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,600
string theory it just means

2441
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:03,119
technologically we're not that far ahead

2442
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,360
now

2443
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,719
we can have two attitudes you say well

2444
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:07,839
if that's the case why are you studying

2445
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:09,359
this subject because you can't do

2446
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,520
experiment today

2447
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:13,279
now this is becoming a little bit more

2448
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,560
like mathematics in that sense you say

2449
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:16,000
well

2450
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,840
i want to learn i want to know how the

2451
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,399
nature works even though i cannot prove

2452
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,960
it today

2453
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:22,719
that this is it because of experiments

2454
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,079
that should not prevent my mind not to

2455
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:25,840
think about it that's right

2456
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:27,359
so that's the attitude many string tears

2457
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,360
follow that that that

2458
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:31,279
should be like this now so that's that's

2459
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:32,479
the answer to the criticism but there's

2460
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:34,000
actually a better answer to the

2461
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:36,799
criticism i would say

2462
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,319
we don't have experimental evidence for

2463
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,760
string theory but we have theoretical

2464
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:40,719
evidence for string theory and what do i

2465
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,880
mean by

2466
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:44,399
theoretical evidence for string theory

2467
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,440
string theory has connected

2468
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:50,479
different parts of physics together

2469
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:52,158
it didn't have to it has brought

2470
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:52,559
connections between part of physics

2471
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:53,599
although

2472
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,520
suppose you're just interested in

2473
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,840
particle physics suppose you're not even

2474
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,600
interested in gravity at all

2475
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,239
it turns out there are partic properties

2476
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,679
of certain particle physics models

2477
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:06,000
that string theory has been able to

2478
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:08,800
solve using gravity

2479
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,479
using ideas from string theory ideas

2480
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,159
known as holography

2481
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,759
which is relating something which has to

2482
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:15,439
do with particles to something having to

2483
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:17,840
do with gravity

2484
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:18,879
why did it have to be this rich this

2485
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,199
subject is

2486
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,880
very rich it's not something we were

2487
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:24,639
smart enough to develop

2488
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,159
it came at us as i explained to you the

2489
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,719
development of string theory came from

2490
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:30,399
accidental discovery it wasn't because

2491
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,840
we were smart enough to come up with

2492
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:34,559
idea oh yeah string of course has

2493
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:36,239
gravity no it was accident discovery so

2494
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,719
some people say it's not fair to say we

2495
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:38,718
have no

2496
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,640
evidence for string theory graviton

2497
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,198
gravity is that evidence for string

2498
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,280
theory

2499
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:45,759
it's predicted by string theory we

2500
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:48,479
didn't put it by hand we got it

2501
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,280
so there's a qualitative check okay

2502
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:51,198
gravity

2503
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:52,719
is a prediction of string theory it's a

2504
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:53,599
postdiction because we know gravity

2505
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:56,719
existed

2506
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,000
but still logically it is a prediction

2507
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,439
because

2508
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,198
really we didn't know it had that

2509
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:03,279
graviton that we later learned that oh

2510
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:04,399
that's the same as gravity so literally

2511
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:06,158
that's the way it was discovered it

2512
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:07,920
wasn't put in by hand

2513
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,359
so so there are there are many things

2514
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,359
like that that there are there are

2515
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:12,880
different facets of physics

2516
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,198
like questions in condensed matter

2517
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,800
physics questions of particle physics

2518
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:19,359
questions about this and that has have

2519
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,920
come together to find beautiful

2520
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:22,960
answers by using ideas from string

2521
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,158
theory

2522
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:28,399
at the same time as a lot of new math

2523
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:29,599
has emerged that's an aspect which i

2524
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:31,759
wouldn't emphasize

2525
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,280
as evidence to physicists necessarily

2526
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,520
because they will say okay great you got

2527
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:38,079
some math but what's to do with reality

2528
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,520
but as i explained many of the physical

2529
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:41,760
principles we know of

2530
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,560
have beautiful math underpinning them so

2531
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,320
it certainly leads further

2532
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,760
confidence that we may not be going

2533
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:49,119
astray even though that's not the food

2534
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,199
proof as we know

2535
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,238
so so there are these aspects that give

2536
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:54,479
further evidence

2537
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:56,000
for string theory connections between

2538
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:57,198
each other connection with the real

2539
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,399
world but then there are other things

2540
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:01,039
that come about

2541
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:01,599
and i can try to give examples of that

2542
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:03,198
so

2543
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,760
so these are further evidences and these

2544
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:08,479
are certain predictions of string theory

2545
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:11,760
they are not as as as detailed as we

2546
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:13,839
want but there are still predictions

2547
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,719
why is the dimension of space on time

2548
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,880
three plus one

2549
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:20,158
see i don't know just just deal with it

2550
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:23,279
three plus one

2551
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:25,920
but in physics we want to know why

2552
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:27,519
well take a random dimension from one to

2553
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,719
infinity what's your random

2554
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:33,120
dimension a random dimension from one to

2555
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:35,198
infinity would not be four

2556
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:36,960
eight would most likely be a humongous

2557
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:38,638
number if not infinity i mean

2558
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,000
there's no if you choose any any

2559
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,279
reasonable distribution which goes from

2560
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,079
one to infinity

2561
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:45,359
three or four would not be your pick the

2562
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:48,399
fact that we are in three or four

2563
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:50,079
dimension is already strange

2564
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:52,559
the fact that string says sorry i cannot

2565
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:54,479
go beyond 10 or maybe 11 or something

2566
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:56,239
the fact that they're just upper bound

2567
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:58,559
the range is not from 1 to infinities

2568
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:00,718
from 1 to 10 or 11 or what not

2569
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,239
it already brings a natural prior oh

2570
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,119
yeah three or four is you know it's just

2571
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:04,079
on the average if you

2572
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:05,599
if you pick some of the

2573
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,039
compactifications then it could easily

2574
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,120
be that so in other words

2575
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:11,519
it makes it much more possible that it

2576
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:13,439
could be theory of our universe so

2577
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,560
the fact that the dimension already is

2578
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:16,638
so small it

2579
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,880
should be surprising we don't ask that

2580
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:20,400
question we should be surprised

2581
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,319
because we could have conceived of

2582
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:23,759
universes with our predimension

2583
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:25,439
why is it that we have such a small

2584
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,159
dimension that's number one

2585
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:30,238
so oh so so good theory of the universe

2586
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:33,519
should give you an intuition of

2587
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:35,519
the why it's four or three plus one

2588
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,520
and it's not obvious that it should be

2589
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,880
that that should be explained we take

2590
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,159
that as a

2591
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,279
as an assumption but that's a thing that

2592
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:44,559
should be explained

2593
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:46,559
yeah so we haven't explained that in

2594
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,159
string here actually i did write a model

2595
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,239
within string theory to try to describe

2596
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:52,638
why we end up with three

2597
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:54,638
uh plus one space time dimensions which

2598
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:57,039
are big compared to the rest of them

2599
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:58,480
and even though this has not been uh the

2600
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:00,719
technical difficulties to prove it

2601
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:01,519
is is still not there but i will explain

2602
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,960
the idea

2603
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,199
because the idea connects to some other

2604
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,760
piece of elegant math

2605
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:08,638
which is the following consider a a

2606
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,520
universe

2607
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:12,000
made of a box three-dimensional box or

2608
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,199
in fact

2609
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,639
if we start in string theory

2610
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:17,119
nine-dimensional box because we have

2611
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:20,159
nine spatial dimensions at one time

2612
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:22,639
so imagine a nine-dimensional box

2613
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:24,000
so we should imagine the box of the

2614
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,880
typical size of the string which

2615
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,279
is small so the universe would naturally

2616
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,039
small

2617
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:30,399
start with a very tiny nine dimensional

2618
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:32,238
box

2619
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:34,479
what do strings do well strings go you

2620
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:36,399
know go around the box and move around

2621
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:38,479
and vibrate and all that but also

2622
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:40,238
they can wrap around one side of the box

2623
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:41,919
to the other because

2624
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:43,439
i'm imagining a box with periodic

2625
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,480
boundary conditions so what we call the

2626
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:46,559
torus

2627
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:48,079
so the string can go from one side to

2628
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,760
the other this is what we call a winding

2629
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:51,679
string the string can wind around the

2630
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:54,400
box

2631
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:55,039
suppose you have you now evolve the

2632
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:56,399
universe

2633
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:58,479
because there's energy the universe

2634
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:01,198
starts to expand

2635
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:02,238
but it doesn't it doesn't expand too far

2636
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:04,559
why is it

2637
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:06,319
well because there are these strings

2638
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,000
which are wrapped around from one side

2639
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:09,599
of the wall to the other

2640
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,279
when the universe the walls of the

2641
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,120
universe are growing

2642
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:15,759
it is stretching the string and the

2643
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:17,679
strings are becoming very very massive

2644
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,560
so it becomes difficult to expand it

2645
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:22,319
kind of puts a halt on it in order to

2646
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,920
not with a halt a string which is going

2647
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:25,039
this way and a thing which is going that

2648
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,279
way should

2649
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:29,279
should uh intersect each other and

2650
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:31,198
disconnect each other and unwind

2651
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:33,198
so a string which is winds this way and

2652
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:36,000
the string which finds the opposite way

2653
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:36,879
should find each other to to to

2654
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,760
reconnect

2655
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,039
and this way disappear so if they find

2656
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,199
each other and they did these

2657
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:45,119
they disappear but how can strings find

2658
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:47,839
each other well the string moves

2659
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:50,000
and another string moves a string is one

2660
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,719
dimensional one plus one is two

2661
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,600
and one plus one is two and two plus two

2662
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,600
is four

2663
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,880
in four dimensional space time they will

2664
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,880
find each other

2665
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,560
in a higher dimensional space time they

2666
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,560
typically miss each other

2667
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,239
oh interesting so if the dimensions were

2668
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,679
too big they would miss each other they

2669
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:07,678
wouldn't be able to expand

2670
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,679
so in order to expand they have to find

2671
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,440
each other and three of them can't find

2672
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:13,199
each other and those can expand and the

2673
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:14,879
other one will be stuck so that explains

2674
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:16,479
why within string theory these

2675
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,159
particular dimensions are really big

2676
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:20,399
and full of exciting stuff that could be

2677
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:21,839
an explanation that's the model we we

2678
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:23,599
we suggested with my colleague

2679
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,960
brandenburger but it turns out to be

2680
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:28,000
related to a deep piece of math

2681
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:30,399
you see for mathematicians

2682
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,479
manifolds of dimension bigger than four

2683
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,399
are simple

2684
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:36,000
four dimension is the hardest dimension

2685
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:38,079
for math

2686
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,158
it turns out and it turns out the reason

2687
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:40,880
it's difficult is the following it turns

2688
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,000
out that in

2689
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:45,600
higher dimension you use you use

2690
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,520
what's called surgery in mathematical

2691
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,039
terminology where you use these two

2692
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,520
dimensional tubes

2693
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:53,198
to maneuver them off of each other so

2694
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,800
you have two plus two

2695
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:56,399
becoming four and higher than four

2696
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,039
dimension you can pass them through each

2697
01:24:56,399 --> 01:24:59,279
other

2698
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:00,158
without them intersecting in fourth

2699
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:03,359
dimension

2700
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:04,719
two plus two doesn't allow you to pass

2701
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,158
them through each other so the same take

2702
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,600
things that work in higher dimension

2703
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:09,359
don't work in four dimension

2704
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,960
because two plus two is four the same

2705
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:13,119
reasoning i was just telling you

2706
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:15,359
about strings finding each other and

2707
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:16,960
four ends up to be the reason why four

2708
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:19,279
is much more complicated

2709
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,639
to classify for mathematicians as well

2710
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:22,800
so so there might be these

2711
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,719
these things so i cannot say that this

2712
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,079
is the reason that string theory is

2713
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:27,840
is giving you three plus one but it

2714
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:29,359
could be a model for it and so

2715
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,119
so there are these kind of ideas that

2716
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:32,559
could underlie why

2717
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:34,000
we have three extra dimensions which are

2718
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,760
large and the rest of our small but

2719
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,600
absolutely we have to have a good reason

2720
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,480
we cannot leave it like that can i ask a

2721
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:43,520
tricky human question

2722
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:44,959
so you are one of the seminal figures

2723
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,880
in string theory you got the

2724
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,079
breakthrough prize you worked with

2725
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,159
edward whitten

2726
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:53,279
there is no nobel prize that has been

2727
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:55,519
given on string theory

2728
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:57,198
you know credit assignment is tricky in

2729
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:59,040
science i've

2730
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:01,759
it makes you quite sad especially big

2731
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:02,719
like ligo big experimental projects when

2732
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,880
so many

2733
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:06,079
incredible people have been involved and

2734
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,920
yet the nobel prize

2735
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:09,840
is annoying in that it's only given to

2736
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:12,800
three people who do you think

2737
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,199
gets the nobel prize for string theory

2738
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,480
uh

2739
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:20,879
at first if it turns out that it

2740
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:24,238
um if not in full then in part

2741
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:26,079
is is a good model of

2742
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:27,359
the way the physics of the universe

2743
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:29,760
works

2744
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:30,960
who are the key figures maybe let's put

2745
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,800
nobel prize aside

2746
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,960
or the key figures i like the second

2747
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,800
version of the question because i think

2748
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,560
to try to give a prize to one person in

2749
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,639
string there doesn't do justice to the

2750
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,560
diversity of the subject that to me is

2751
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:44,400
so there was quite a lot of incredible

2752
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,840
people there in the history of quite a

2753
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:47,839
lot of people i mean starting with

2754
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,520
vanessa who wasn't talking about strings

2755
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,880
yes i mean he wrote down the the

2756
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,719
beginning of a string so we cannot

2757
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,480
ignore that for sure and so

2758
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,158
so you start with that and you go on

2759
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:57,599
with various other figures and so on so

2760
01:26:56,158 --> 01:26:58,079
there are different epochs in string

2761
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,280
theory

2762
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:01,279
yes and different people have been

2763
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:03,759
pushing it and so for example the early

2764
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:04,880
epoch we just told you people like uh

2765
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,039
like veneziano

2766
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,800
and nambu and the saskan and others were

2767
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:09,760
pushing it green and shorts were pushing

2768
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,840
it and so forth

2769
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,480
so this was or shark and so on so these

2770
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,719
were the initial periods of

2771
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,799
pioneers i would say of string theory

2772
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:21,119
and then there were there were the

2773
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,880
mid 80s that uh edward whitten was the

2774
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:23,920
major proponent of string theory and he

2775
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,679
really

2776
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,440
changed the landscape of string theory

2777
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:29,920
in terms of what people do and how

2778
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:32,000
how we view it and i think his efforts

2779
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:33,359
brought a lot of attention to the

2780
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,520
community about

2781
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:37,359
a high energy community to focus on this

2782
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,040
effort as the correct theory of

2783
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:41,119
unification of forces so he brought a

2784
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:43,039
lot of research as well as of course the

2785
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:45,519
first rate work he himself did

2786
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:47,679
to this area so that's in 80s and

2787
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,600
onwards and also in mid 90s where he

2788
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,600
was one of the proponents of the duality

2789
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:53,679
revolution in string theory

2790
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,800
and with that came a lot of these other

2791
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:57,359
ideas that you know

2792
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,320
led to breakthroughs involving for

2793
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:00,000
example

2794
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:02,319
the example i told you about black holes

2795
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,158
and holography and the work that was

2796
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,079
later done by maldasena about the

2797
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:07,119
properties of duality between particle

2798
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:09,359
physics and

2799
01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:11,119
quantum gravity and the connections the

2800
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:14,158
deeper connections of holography

2801
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,840
and it continues and there are many

2802
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:16,559
people within this range which i haven't

2803
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,400
even mentioned

2804
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,159
they have done fantastic important

2805
01:28:18,399 --> 01:28:22,079
things

2806
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:23,439
how it gets recognized i think is

2807
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:26,319
secondary in my opinion

2808
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:27,678
than the appreciation that the effort is

2809
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:29,759
collective

2810
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,119
that in fact that to me is the more

2811
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,159
important part of science that gets

2812
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:35,119
forgotten

2813
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:36,719
for some reason humanity likes heroes

2814
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:37,279
and science is no exception we like

2815
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,079
heroes

2816
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:40,479
but i i personally try to avoid that

2817
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:43,600
trap

2818
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:44,799
i i feel and in my work most of my work

2819
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,440
is with colleagues

2820
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,199
i have much more collaborations than

2821
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:51,519
soul author papers

2822
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:53,198
and i enjoy it and i think that that's

2823
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,400
to me one of the most satisfying aspects

2824
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:57,759
of science

2825
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:59,519
is to interact and learn and

2826
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:02,079
debate ideas with colleagues because

2827
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:05,600
that influx of ideas enriches it

2828
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:08,238
and that's why i i find it interesting

2829
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,840
to me science if i was in an island and

2830
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:11,359
if i was developing strength here by

2831
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,119
myself and had nothing to do with

2832
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:14,079
anybody it would be much less satisfying

2833
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:16,639
in my opinion

2834
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:17,119
even if i could take credit i did it

2835
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,199
yeah

2836
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:20,960
it won't be as satisfying sitting alone

2837
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:23,519
with the yeah with a big metal

2838
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,760
drinking champagne no i think i think to

2839
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:26,480
me the collective work is more exciting

2840
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,679
and

2841
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:29,519
you mentioned my getting the

2842
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:31,520
breakthrough when i was getting it i

2843
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,360
made sure to mention that it is because

2844
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,719
of the joint work that i've done with

2845
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:37,039
colleagues at that time it was around

2846
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:38,079
180 or so collaborators and i

2847
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,399
acknowledge them

2848
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:41,359
in the in the web page for them i write

2849
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:43,198
all of their names and the

2850
01:29:41,359 --> 01:29:45,039
collaborations that led to this so

2851
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:46,479
to me science is fun when it's

2852
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:48,719
collaboration

2853
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:51,119
and yes there are more important and

2854
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:52,719
less important figures as in any field

2855
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:54,319
and that's true that's true in strength

2856
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,079
here as well but i think that

2857
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:57,439
i would like to view this as a

2858
01:29:56,079 --> 01:30:01,920
collective effort so

2859
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:04,719
setting the heroes aside the nobel prize

2860
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,760
is a celebration of um what's the right

2861
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:09,439
way to put it

2862
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:11,760
that this idea turned out to be right

2863
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:12,960
so like you look at uh einstein didn't

2864
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,920
believe in black holes

2865
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,119
right and then black holes got their

2866
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,359
nobel prize

2867
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:20,238
right do you think string theory will

2868
01:30:19,359 --> 01:30:23,679
get

2869
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:25,839
its nobel prize nobel prizes

2870
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:27,679
if you were to bet money if this was

2871
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,560
like if this was an investment meeting

2872
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:30,719
and we had to bet

2873
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,920
all our money do you think he gets the

2874
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:33,600
nobel prizes

2875
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,119
i think it's possible that none of the

2876
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,920
living physicists will get the nobel

2877
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:40,079
prize on string theory but somebody will

2878
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,319
because because unfortunately the

2879
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:42,960
technology available today is not very

2880
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:45,679
encouraging

2881
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,880
in terms of seeing directly evidence for

2882
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:48,000
string theory do you think this

2883
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,679
ultimately boils down

2884
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,119
to the nobel prize will be given when

2885
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,760
there is some

2886
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:54,399
direct or indirect evidence there would

2887
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:55,920
be but

2888
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:58,079
uh but i think that part of this

2889
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,600
breakthrough prize was precisely the

2890
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:01,359
appreciation that when we have

2891
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,159
sufficient evidence

2892
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:05,039
theoretical as it is and not experiment

2893
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:07,279
because of this

2894
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:08,880
technology lag you appreciate what what

2895
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:10,319
you think is the correct path

2896
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:12,480
so there are many people who have been

2897
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:14,479
have been recognized precisely

2898
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:16,079
because they may not be around when it

2899
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:18,399
actually gets experimented

2900
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:19,600
even though they discovered it so so

2901
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:20,960
there are there are many things like

2902
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,039
that that's going on in

2903
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,079
in science so i think that i would i

2904
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:27,679
would want to attach

2905
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:30,079
less significance to the recognitions

2906
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:32,399
of people and i i have i have a i have a

2907
01:31:30,079 --> 01:31:34,800
second review on this which is

2908
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:36,399
there are people who you know who look

2909
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,159
at these works that people have done

2910
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:39,920
and put them together and you know make

2911
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:42,879
the next big breakthrough

2912
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:44,000
and they get identified with you know

2913
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:47,920
perhaps rightly with

2914
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,520
many of these you know new new visions

2915
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,359
but they are on the shoulders of these

2916
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:54,239
little scientists yes

2917
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:55,679
which don't get any recognition you know

2918
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:56,638
yeah you did this little work oh yeah

2919
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,079
you did this little

2920
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,440
work oh yeah yeah five of you oh yeah

2921
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,399
this showed this pattern and then

2922
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:03,119
somebody else

2923
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:04,079
it's not fair yeah to me to me those

2924
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:06,319
little guys

2925
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:07,760
which which kind of like like seem to do

2926
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:08,880
a little calculation here a little thing

2927
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,239
there which is not doesn't

2928
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,239
doesn't rise to the occasion of this

2929
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:13,599
grandiose kind of thing doesn't make it

2930
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:16,158
to the new york times

2931
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,000
headlines and so on deserve a lot of

2932
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:19,439
recognition and i think they don't get

2933
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,679
enough i would say that

2934
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:22,799
there should be this nobel prize for you

2935
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:24,480
know they have these

2936
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,920
doctors without borders a huge group

2937
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:27,359
they should do similar thing

2938
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,279
these string theories without borders

2939
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:30,000
kind of everybody is doing a lot of work

2940
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:31,840
and i think that

2941
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,439
i i would like to see that efforts

2942
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,480
recognized i think

2943
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:38,879
in the long arc of history we're all

2944
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:42,238
little guys and girls standing on the

2945
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:43,760
shoulders of each other i mean

2946
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:45,359
it's all going to look tiny in

2947
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:48,480
retrospective we celebrate

2948
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:51,920
the new york times uh

2949
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:53,039
it you know as a newspaper or the idea

2950
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,520
of a newspaper

2951
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:57,600
in a few centuries from now will be long

2952
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,719
forgotten yes

2953
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,000
especially in the countries of string

2954
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:01,840
theory we should have a very long term

2955
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,238
view yes exactly

2956
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,520
just as a tiny tangent we mentioned

2957
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:08,638
edward wooden

2958
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:11,679
and he in a bunch of walks of life for

2959
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:15,119
me as an outsider comes up as a person

2960
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:16,560
who is uh widely considered as like

2961
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:19,760
one of the most brilliant people in the

2962
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:23,600
history of physics just as a powerhouse

2963
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:26,159
uh of a human like the uh

2964
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,199
the exceptional places that a human mind

2965
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:28,960
can rise to

2966
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:30,799
yes uh you've gotten a chance to work

2967
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:33,760
with him what's he like yes

2968
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:35,840
more than that he was my advisor a phd

2969
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,600
advisor so i got to know him very well

2970
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,480
and i benefited from his insights in

2971
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,239
fact

2972
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:42,638
what you said about him is accurate he

2973
01:33:40,238 --> 01:33:43,439
is he's not only brilliant but you know

2974
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:46,079
he is

2975
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:47,759
he's also multifaceted in terms of the

2976
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:49,359
impact he has had in not only physics

2977
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,800
but also mathematics

2978
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:53,279
you know he's got in the fields medal

2979
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:56,639
because of his work in mathematics and

2980
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:58,960
rightly so you know he has used his

2981
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:59,840
knowledge of physics in a way which

2982
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,679
impacted

2983
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:03,279
deep ideas in modern mathematics and

2984
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:06,480
that's an example of

2985
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:08,000
of the power of of these ideas in modern

2986
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:08,559
high energy physics and string theory

2987
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,560
that

2988
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,600
the applicability of it to to modern

2989
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:15,280
mathematics

2990
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:17,039
so he's uh he's quite uh

2991
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:19,519
exceptional individual we don't we don't

2992
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:21,519
come across such people a lot in history

2993
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:23,199
so i think yes indeed he's one of the

2994
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,520
rare figures in this history of

2995
01:34:23,198 --> 01:34:27,119
of the subject he has had great impact

2996
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,320
on a lot of aspects of not just string

2997
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:29,359
theory a lot of different areas in

2998
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:32,960
physics

2999
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:34,238
and also yes in mathematics as well so i

3000
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,880
think what you said about him is

3001
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:36,399
accurate

3002
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,800
i had the pleasure of interacting with

3003
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:39,519
him as a student and and later on as

3004
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,679
colleagues

3005
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:44,400
writing papers together and so on what

3006
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:46,239
impact do you have on your life like

3007
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:47,759
what have you learned from him if you

3008
01:34:46,238 --> 01:34:49,439
were to look at the trajectory of your

3009
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,520
mind of the way you approached science

3010
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:54,319
and physics and mathematics

3011
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,719
how did he uh perturb that trajectory

3012
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:56,799
yes

3013
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:57,840
he did actually so i can explain because

3014
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:01,199
when i was a student i

3015
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:02,560
i i the biggest impact by him uh clearly

3016
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:03,198
as a grad student at princeton so i

3017
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,800
think

3018
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:06,559
that was the time where i was a little

3019
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:08,239
bit confused

3020
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:10,239
about the relation between math and

3021
01:35:08,238 --> 01:35:12,879
physics i got a double major in

3022
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:14,879
mathematics and physics at mit

3023
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,400
and because i really enjoyed both and i

3024
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,199
write the elegance and the

3025
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:21,359
rigor of mathematics and i like the

3026
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:23,198
power of ideas and physics and its

3027
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:24,399
applicability to reality and what it

3028
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:27,359
teaches about

3029
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:29,279
the real world around us but i saw this

3030
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,920
tension between

3031
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:33,920
rigorous thinking in mathematics and

3032
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:37,039
lack thereof in physics and this

3033
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:38,000
troubled me to no end i was troubled by

3034
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:40,639
that

3035
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,158
so i was at crossroads when i decided to

3036
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:44,239
go to graduate school in physics

3037
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:47,039
because i did not like some of the lack

3038
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:48,959
of rigors i was seeing in physics

3039
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:50,719
on the other hand to me mathematics even

3040
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,800
though it was rigorous something it it

3041
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:54,319
sometimes were i didn't see the point of

3042
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,079
it in other words

3043
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:57,439
when i see when i see you know the math

3044
01:35:56,079 --> 01:35:58,960
theorem by itself could be beautiful but

3045
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:00,559
i really wanted more than that i want to

3046
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,239
say okay what did it teach us about

3047
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,800
something else something more than just

3048
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:04,559
math

3049
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,719
so i wasn't i wasn't that enamored with

3050
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,320
just math but physics was a little bit

3051
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,679
bothersome nevertheless i decided to go

3052
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:10,799
to physics and i decided to go to

3053
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:12,880
princeton

3054
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:15,920
and i started working with edward

3055
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:19,679
whitten as my thesis advisor

3056
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:21,920
and um at that time i was trying to

3057
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:23,679
put physics in rigorous mathematical

3058
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,760
terms i took quantum fifth theory

3059
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:26,719
i tried to make rigorous out of it and

3060
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,119
so on

3061
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:29,760
and no matter how hard i was trying i

3062
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:32,559
was not

3063
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,159
being able to do that and i was falling

3064
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,880
behind from my classes i was not

3065
01:36:34,158 --> 01:36:36,479
learning

3066
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:38,079
much physics and i was not making it

3067
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:39,919
rigorous and to me

3068
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:42,158
it was this dichotomy between math and

3069
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,118
physics what am i doing i like math but

3070
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:46,799
this is not

3071
01:36:43,118 --> 01:36:48,960
exactly risk there comes ed written as

3072
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:52,000
my advisor and i see him in action

3073
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:54,239
thinking about math and physics

3074
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,079
he was amazing in math he knew all about

3075
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:58,399
the math it was no problem with him

3076
01:36:56,079 --> 01:36:59,279
but he thought about physics in a way

3077
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:02,559
which did not

3078
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:04,880
find this tension between the two

3079
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,639
it was much more harmonious for him he

3080
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,199
would draw the feynman diagrams but he

3081
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:09,279
wouldn't

3082
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:10,559
view it as a formalism he was viewed oh

3083
01:37:09,279 --> 01:37:12,000
yeah the particle goes over there and

3084
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:13,520
this is what's going on and

3085
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,800
so wait you're thinking really is this

3086
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,000
particle this virtual this is really

3087
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:18,000
electron going there right

3088
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,760
yeah it's not it's not the formula

3089
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,279
perturbation no no

3090
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,800
you just feel like the electron you're

3091
01:37:21,279 --> 01:37:24,399
moving with this guy and do that and so

3092
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,079
on and you're thinking invariantly about

3093
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:28,559
physics or the way he thought about

3094
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:30,000
relativity like you know i was thinking

3095
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,600
about you know this momentum says he was

3096
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,399
thinking invariantly about physics just

3097
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,000
like the way

3098
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:35,359
you think about invariant concepts in

3099
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,399
relativity which don't depend on the

3100
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:38,559
frame of reference

3101
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:39,679
he was thinking about the physics in in

3102
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,239
variant ways that

3103
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:43,359
the way that doesn't gives you a bigger

3104
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:47,439
perspective so

3105
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:49,279
this gradually helped me appreciate that

3106
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:51,519
interconnections between ideas and

3107
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:54,719
physics replaces

3108
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,280
mathematical rigor that the different

3109
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:57,520
facets

3110
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:59,279
reinforce each other you say oh i cannot

3111
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:00,800
rigorously define what i mean by this

3112
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:02,880
but this thing connects with this other

3113
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:06,239
physics i have seen and this other thing

3114
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:08,719
and they together form an elegant story

3115
01:38:06,238 --> 01:38:11,039
and that replaced for me what i believed

3116
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:11,920
as a solidness which i found in math as

3117
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:14,319
a rigor

3118
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,079
and was solid i found that replaced the

3119
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,158
rigor and solidness in physics

3120
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:19,118
so i found okay that's the way you can

3121
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:21,359
hang on to

3122
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:23,039
it is not wishy-washy it's not like

3123
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:24,639
somebody is just not being able to prove

3124
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:26,560
it just making up a story

3125
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,400
it was more than that and it was no

3126
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:31,039
tension with mathematics

3127
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:31,599
in fact mathematics was helping it like

3128
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:33,600
friends

3129
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:35,360
and so much more harmonious and gives

3130
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,719
insights to physics so that's i think

3131
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:38,559
one of the main things i learned from

3132
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:41,118
interactions with written

3133
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,840
and i think that now perhaps i have

3134
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:44,000
taken

3135
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:45,679
that to a far extreme maybe he wouldn't

3136
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,560
go this far as i have namely

3137
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:50,158
i use physics to define new mathematics

3138
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,639
in a way which would be far

3139
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:54,158
less rigorous than a physicist might

3140
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:55,600
necessarily believe because i take the

3141
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:58,000
physical intuition

3142
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,440
perhaps literally in many ways that

3143
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,760
could teach us the man so now i've

3144
01:38:59,439 --> 01:39:03,599
gained so much confidence in physical

3145
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,199
intuition that i make bold statements

3146
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,239
that sometimes you know

3147
01:39:05,198 --> 01:39:10,879
takes math math friends off guard

3148
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:12,479
so an example of it is mirror symmetry

3149
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,319
so

3150
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:15,919
so we were studying these compactivation

3151
01:39:14,319 --> 01:39:17,679
of string string geometries this is

3152
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:19,679
after my phd now i've

3153
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:21,279
by the time i've come to harvard we're

3154
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:22,158
studying these aspects of string compact

3155
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:24,079
education on these

3156
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:26,319
complicated manifolds six dimensional

3157
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:29,439
spaces called calabial manifolds

3158
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:31,679
very complicated and i noticed

3159
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:33,839
with a couple other colleagues that

3160
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,840
there was a symmetry

3161
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,920
in physics suggested between different

3162
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:40,880
calabias it suggested that

3163
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:42,719
you couldn't actually compute the euler

3164
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:44,159
characteristic of a calabria or the

3165
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,920
characteristic is

3166
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:47,839
counting the number of points minus the

3167
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,319
number of edges plus the number of faces

3168
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,920
minus

3169
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:51,679
so you can count the alternating

3170
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,880
sequence of properties of the space

3171
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:56,000
which is the topological

3172
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:57,840
property of a space so holy cat axis of

3173
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,279
the calabia was a property of the space

3174
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,039
and so

3175
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:03,439
we noticed that from the physics

3176
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:06,238
formalism if string moves in a calabia

3177
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:07,678
you cannot distinguish we cannot compute

3178
01:40:06,238 --> 01:40:10,238
the euler characteristic you can only

3179
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,399
compute the absolute value of it

3180
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:15,599
now this bothered us because how could

3181
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:18,879
it do not compute the actual sign

3182
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:21,039
unless the both sides were the same

3183
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,239
so i conjectured maybe for every calabia

3184
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:23,519
with the other character is positive

3185
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:26,879
there's one with negative

3186
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:30,560
i told this to my colleague yao who was

3187
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:32,079
whose namesake is calabia um

3188
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,679
that i'm making this conjecture is it

3189
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:34,840
possible that for every calabia there's

3190
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:36,560
one with the opposite euler

3191
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,400
characteristic

3192
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:39,679
sounds not reasonable i said why he said

3193
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,439
well we know more

3194
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:44,158
claudia's with negative other characters

3195
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:44,158
than positive

3196
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:47,118
i said but physics says we cannot

3197
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,679
distinguish them at least i don't see

3198
01:40:47,118 --> 01:40:50,319
how

3199
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,679
so we conjectured that for every calabia

3200
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:54,000
with one side there's the other one

3201
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:55,600
despite the mathematical evidence

3202
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,880
despite the mathematical evidence

3203
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:59,840
despite the expert

3204
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:01,520
telling us is not the right idea if a

3205
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,119
few years later this symmetric mirror

3206
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,960
symmetry between the

3207
01:41:03,118 --> 01:41:06,960
sign with the opposite sign was later

3208
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,118
confirmed by mathematicians

3209
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,439
so this is actually the opposite view

3210
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:12,559
that is physics is so sure about it

3211
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:14,238
that you're going against the

3212
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,280
mathematical wisdom telling them they

3213
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:18,000
better look for it

3214
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:19,279
so taking the uh the the physical

3215
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,439
intuition literally

3216
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:23,519
and then having that drive the the

3217
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:24,399
mathematics exactly and by now we are so

3218
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,600
confident about

3219
01:41:24,399 --> 01:41:28,879
many such examples that has affected

3220
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:31,039
modern mathematics

3221
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,560
in ways like this that we are much more

3222
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:33,840
confident about our

3223
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,600
understanding of what string theories

3224
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,400
these are another aspects other aspects

3225
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,000
of why

3226
01:41:36,399 --> 01:41:39,759
we feel string terrorists cry it's doing

3227
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,600
these kind of things

3228
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,800
i've been hearing you talk quite a bit

3229
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:46,079
about uh string

3230
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:47,760
theory landscape and the swamp what the

3231
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:49,519
heck are those two concepts

3232
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,360
okay very good question so let's go back

3233
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,760
to what i was describing about feinman

3234
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:55,679
yes feinman was trying to do these

3235
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,679
diagrams for graviton

3236
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:59,039
and electrons and all that he found that

3237
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,118
he's getting infinities he cannot

3238
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:03,279
resolve

3239
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:05,118
okay the natural conclusion is that

3240
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:06,399
field theories and gravity and quantum

3241
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:09,279
theory don't go together

3242
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:10,638
and you cannot have it so in other words

3243
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:11,920
field theories

3244
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:14,159
and gravity are inconsistent with

3245
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:17,279
quantum mechanics period

3246
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:20,000
string theory came up with

3247
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:21,198
examples but didn't address the question

3248
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,198
more broadly that

3249
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:24,638
is it true that every field theory can

3250
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:27,279
be coupled to gravity in a quantum

3251
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:29,279
mechanical way

3252
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:30,639
it turns out that final is essentially

3253
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:33,279
right

3254
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:35,359
almost all particle physics theories no

3255
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:38,238
matter what you add to it

3256
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:38,960
when you put gravity in it doesn't work

3257
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:42,238
only

3258
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:44,079
rare exceptions work so string theory

3259
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:46,158
are those rare exceptions

3260
01:42:44,079 --> 01:42:47,679
so therefore the general principle that

3261
01:42:46,158 --> 01:42:49,599
feynman found was correct

3262
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:51,840
quantum field theory and gravity and

3263
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:54,800
quantum mechanics don't go together

3264
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,319
except for jules exceptional cases there

3265
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:59,520
are exceptional cases

3266
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:00,960
okay the the total vastness of quantum

3267
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:03,600
field theories that are there

3268
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,239
we called the set of quantum field

3269
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,400
theories

3270
01:43:04,238 --> 01:43:09,759
possible things which ones can be

3271
01:43:06,399 --> 01:43:13,039
consistently coupled to gravity

3272
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:16,079
we call that subspace the landscape

3273
01:43:13,039 --> 01:43:17,439
the rest of them we call the swampland

3274
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:19,840
it doesn't mean they are bad quantum

3275
01:43:17,439 --> 01:43:21,919
field theories they are perfectly fine

3276
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,079
but when you couple them to gravity they

3277
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:26,480
don't make sense unfortunately

3278
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:28,079
and it turns out that the the ratio of

3279
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:29,839
them then the number of theories which

3280
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:31,198
are consistent with gravity the to the

3281
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,840
ones which without

3282
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:35,759
the ratio of the area of the landscape

3283
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:38,800
to the swamp land in other words

3284
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,079
is measured zero and so the swamp land

3285
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,840
is infinitely large

3286
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:43,118
the swampland's infinitely large so let

3287
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,440
me give you one example

3288
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:46,399
take a theory in four dimension with

3289
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:48,960
matter

3290
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:49,599
with maximum amount of supersymmetry can

3291
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:51,520
you get

3292
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:53,679
it turns out a theory in four dimension

3293
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:55,679
with maximum amount of supersymmetry

3294
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:58,239
is characterized just with one thing a

3295
01:43:55,679 --> 01:44:00,158
group what we call the gauge group

3296
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:01,439
once you pick a group you have to find

3297
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:05,118
your theory

3298
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:06,638
okay so does every group make sense yeah

3299
01:44:05,118 --> 01:44:07,839
as far as quantum field theory every

3300
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:09,039
group makes sense there are infinitely

3301
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,480
many groups there are infinitely many

3302
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:12,238
quantum field theories

3303
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:13,599
but it turns out there are only finite

3304
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:15,279
number of them

3305
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,719
which are consistent with gravity out of

3306
01:44:15,279 --> 01:44:18,639
that same list

3307
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:20,000
so you can take any group but only fine

3308
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:22,719
number of them the ones whose

3309
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,000
what we call the rank of the group the

3310
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:27,600
ones whose rank

3311
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,479
is less than 23. anyone bigger than rank

3312
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,760
23

3313
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:31,359
belongs to the sworn plan they're

3314
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,960
infinitely many of them they're

3315
01:44:31,359 --> 01:44:36,000
beautiful field theories

3316
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:37,840
but not when you include gravity so

3317
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,238
so then this becomes a hopeful thing so

3318
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:43,360
in other words in our universe

3319
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:45,759
we have gravity therefore we are part of

3320
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:49,439
that jewel subset

3321
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:52,960
now is this joule subset small or large

3322
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:57,279
yeah it turns out that subset is

3323
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:59,439
humongous but we believe still finite

3324
01:44:57,279 --> 01:45:00,960
the setup possibility is infinite but

3325
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:02,799
the set of

3326
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,158
consistent ones i mean the set of

3327
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,320
quantum features are infinite

3328
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:07,839
but the consistent ones are finite but

3329
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:10,639
humongous

3330
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:12,319
the fact that they're humongous is the

3331
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:13,679
problem we are facing in string theory

3332
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:16,639
because we do not know

3333
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:18,158
which one of these possibilities the

3334
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:19,760
universe we live in

3335
01:45:18,158 --> 01:45:21,679
if we knew we could make more specific

3336
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:22,320
predictions about our universe we don't

3337
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:23,679
know

3338
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:25,519
and that is one of the challenges with

3339
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:27,679
string theory which point on the

3340
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:30,800
landscape which corner of this landscape

3341
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:31,760
do we live in we don't know so what do

3342
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,400
we do

3343
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,600
well there are there are principles that

3344
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:38,079
are beginning to emerge

3345
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,600
so i will give you one example of it you

3346
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:40,639
look at the patterns of what you're

3347
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,320
getting

3348
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:43,679
in terms of these good ones the ones

3349
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:45,439
which are in the landscape compared to

3350
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:46,960
the ones which are not

3351
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:49,198
you find certain patterns i'll give you

3352
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,800
one pattern

3353
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:52,559
you find in the all the ones that you

3354
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:55,679
get from string theory

3355
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:57,039
gravitational force is always there but

3356
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:00,239
it's always

3357
01:45:57,039 --> 01:46:02,960
always the weakest force

3358
01:46:00,238 --> 01:46:03,678
however you could easily imagine field

3359
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,279
theories

3360
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:07,199
for which gravity is not the weakest

3361
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:09,840
force for example

3362
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:11,599
take our universe if you take mass of

3363
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:13,920
the electron if you increase the mass of

3364
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,440
electron by huge factor

3365
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,800
the gravitational attraction of the

3366
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:19,359
electrons will be bigger than the

3367
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,119
electric repulsion between two electrons

3368
01:46:19,359 --> 01:46:22,639
and the gravity will be stronger that's

3369
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:24,559
all

3370
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:26,000
it happens that's not the case in our

3371
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:28,800
universe because electron is

3372
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,158
very tiny in mass compared to that just

3373
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,639
like our universe

3374
01:46:30,158 --> 01:46:34,399
gravity is the weakest force we find in

3375
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:36,000
all these other ones which are part of

3376
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:39,039
the good ones

3377
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,800
the gravity is the weakest force this is

3378
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:41,600
called the weak gravity conjecture we

3379
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,760
conjectured that

3380
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:45,840
all the points in the landscape have

3381
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,600
this property

3382
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:49,360
our universe being just an example of it

3383
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,800
so there are these qualitative features

3384
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:52,559
that we are beginning to see

3385
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:54,719
but how do we argue for this just by

3386
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,760
looking patterns just by looking string

3387
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:58,880
theory has this

3388
01:46:55,760 --> 01:47:00,480
no that's not enough we need more

3389
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:02,480
more reason more better reasoning and it

3390
01:47:00,479 --> 01:47:04,079
turns out there is the reasoning for

3391
01:47:02,479 --> 01:47:05,039
this turns out to be studying black

3392
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:08,000
holes

3393
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:09,439
ideas of black holes turn out to put

3394
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,920
certain restrictions

3395
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:12,960
of what a good quantum filter should be

3396
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,359
it turns out

3397
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,520
using black hole the fact that the black

3398
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:20,079
holes evaporate

3399
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,440
the fact that the black holes evaporate

3400
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:23,920
gives you a way

3401
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:25,359
to to check the relation between the

3402
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,039
mass and the charge of elementary

3403
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:28,479
particle because what you can do

3404
01:47:27,039 --> 01:47:30,399
you can take a charged particle and

3405
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:32,799
throw it into a charged black hole

3406
01:47:30,399 --> 01:47:34,319
and wait it to evaporate and by the

3407
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:35,279
looking at the properties of evaporation

3408
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:37,920
you find that

3409
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:39,439
if it cannot evaporate particles whose

3410
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,118
mass is less than their charge

3411
01:47:39,439 --> 01:47:43,599
then it will never evaporate you'll be

3412
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:45,599
stuck and so the possibility of a black

3413
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:46,480
hole evaporation forces you to have

3414
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,880
particles

3415
01:47:46,479 --> 01:47:50,399
whose mass is sufficiently small so that

3416
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,560
the gravity is weaker

3417
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:54,238
so you connect this fact to the other

3418
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,000
fact so we begin to find

3419
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:57,439
different facts that reinforce each

3420
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,039
other so different

3421
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:00,479
parts of the physics reinforce each

3422
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:02,880
other and once they all

3423
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:04,319
kind of come together you believe that

3424
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,840
you're getting the principle correct so

3425
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:07,359
weak gravity conjecture is one of the

3426
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:09,840
principles we believe in

3427
01:48:07,359 --> 01:48:11,279
has a necessity of these conditions so

3428
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,159
these are the predictions string they

3429
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:14,559
are making

3430
01:48:12,158 --> 01:48:15,279
is that enough well it's qualitative

3431
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,960
it's a

3432
01:48:15,279 --> 01:48:19,439
semi-quantity it's just that mass of the

3433
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:22,319
electron should be less than some number

3434
01:48:19,439 --> 01:48:22,879
but that number is if i call that number

3435
01:48:22,319 --> 01:48:24,238
one

3436
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,079
the mass of the electron turns out to be

3437
01:48:24,238 --> 01:48:27,279
10 to the minus 20 actually so it's much

3438
01:48:26,079 --> 01:48:30,559
less than one it's not

3439
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:32,719
one but on the other hand there's

3440
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:33,920
a similar reasoning for a big black hole

3441
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:36,079
in our universe

3442
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,440
and if that evaporation should take

3443
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:39,198
place gives you another restriction

3444
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:41,678
tells you the mass of the electron

3445
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:43,118
is bigger than 10 to the is now in this

3446
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:44,880
case bigger than something

3447
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:46,238
it shows bigger than 10 to the minus 30

3448
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,319
in the planck unit so

3449
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:49,759
you find uh-huh the mass of the electron

3450
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:51,198
should be less than one but bigger than

3451
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:52,719
ten to the minus thirty

3452
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:54,399
in our universe the mass of the electron

3453
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,319
stands to minus twenty

3454
01:48:54,399 --> 01:48:57,920
okay now this kind of you could call

3455
01:48:56,319 --> 01:48:59,439
postdiction but i would say

3456
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:01,199
it follows from principles that we now

3457
01:48:59,439 --> 01:49:02,719
understand from string theory

3458
01:49:01,198 --> 01:49:04,319
first principle so we are making

3459
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:06,399
beginning to make

3460
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:07,840
these kinds of predictions which are

3461
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:09,839
very much

3462
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:11,039
connected to aspects of particle physics

3463
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,119
that we didn't think

3464
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:14,800
are related to gravity we thought just

3465
01:49:13,118 --> 01:49:16,639
take any electron mass you want

3466
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:20,000
what's the problem it has a problem with

3467
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:22,880
gravity and so that conjecture

3468
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,560
has also a happy consequence that it

3469
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:27,199
explains that our universe

3470
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:28,080
like why the heck is gravity so weak as

3471
01:49:27,198 --> 01:49:30,719
a force

3472
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:32,238
uh and that's not only an accident but

3473
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:34,480
almost a necessity

3474
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:35,279
if these forces are to coexist

3475
01:49:34,479 --> 01:49:37,359
effectively

3476
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:38,719
exactly so that's that's that's the

3477
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:40,880
reinforcement of

3478
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:42,239
of of what we know in our universe but

3479
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,760
we are finding that

3480
01:49:42,238 --> 01:49:45,919
as a general principle so we want to

3481
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:48,560
know what aspects of our universe

3482
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:50,319
universe is forced on us like the weak

3483
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,639
gravity conjecture and other aspects do

3484
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:52,880
we

3485
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:54,800
how much of them do we understand can we

3486
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,159
have particles lighter than neutrinos or

3487
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,760
maybe that's not possible

3488
01:49:56,158 --> 01:49:59,439
you see the neutrino mass it turns out

3489
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:02,480
to be related to dark energy

3490
01:49:59,439 --> 01:50:04,319
in a mysterious way naively

3491
01:50:02,479 --> 01:50:06,399
there's no relation between dark energy

3492
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:08,079
and a mass of a particle

3493
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:10,079
we have found arguments from within the

3494
01:50:08,079 --> 01:50:13,279
swampland kind of ideas

3495
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:14,639
why it has to be related and so

3496
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:16,559
so they're beginning to be these

3497
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:17,840
connections between graph consistency of

3498
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,719
quantum gravity

3499
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:21,679
and aspects of our universe gradually

3500
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:23,599
being

3501
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:25,599
sharpened but we're still far from a

3502
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:27,119
precise quantitative prediction like

3503
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:28,639
we have to have such and such but that's

3504
01:50:27,118 --> 01:50:29,439
the hope that we are going in that

3505
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:30,880
direction

3506
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:33,198
coming up with the theory of everything

3507
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,118
that unifies uh general relativity and

3508
01:50:33,198 --> 01:50:38,479
quantum field theories um

3509
01:50:35,118 --> 01:50:39,759
this is one of the big dreams of human

3510
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:41,759
civilization

3511
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:43,280
us descendants of apes wondering about

3512
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:46,560
how this world works

3513
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:47,679
so a lot of people dream what are your

3514
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,800
thoughts about

3515
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:51,520
sort of other out there ideas on

3516
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:54,639
theories of

3517
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:57,599
everything or unifying

3518
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:59,840
theories so there's a quantum loop

3519
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:02,719
gravity

3520
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:04,319
there's also more sort of like a friend

3521
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:06,000
of mine eric weinstein

3522
01:51:04,319 --> 01:51:07,439
beginning to propose something called

3523
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,359
geometric unity

3524
01:51:07,439 --> 01:51:11,198
so these kinds of attempts whether it's

3525
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:12,399
through mathematical physics or through

3526
01:51:11,198 --> 01:51:14,000
other avenues

3527
01:51:12,399 --> 01:51:16,079
or with stephen wolfram a more

3528
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,399
computational view of the universe

3529
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:20,399
again in his case it's these hyper

3530
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:23,598
graphs that are very tiny objects

3531
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:25,839
as well similarly string theory

3532
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:26,719
and trying to grapple with this world

3533
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:29,199
what do you think

3534
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:30,319
is there any of these uh theories that

3535
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:31,359
are compelling to you that are

3536
01:51:30,319 --> 01:51:34,000
interesting

3537
01:51:31,359 --> 01:51:35,759
that may turn out to be true or at least

3538
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,158
may turn out to contain ideas that are

3539
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:38,560
useful

3540
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:40,638
yes i think the latter i would say that

3541
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:42,639
the containing ideas that are true

3542
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:44,400
is my opinion was what these some of

3543
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:45,520
these ideas might be for example quantum

3544
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:46,799
gravity

3545
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:48,560
is to me not a complete theory of

3546
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:50,239
gravity in any sense but they have some

3547
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:53,199
nuggets of truth in them

3548
01:51:50,238 --> 01:51:53,759
and typically what i expect happen and i

3549
01:51:53,198 --> 01:51:55,678
have seen

3550
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,360
examples of this within string theory

3551
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:58,800
aspects which we didn't think are part

3552
01:51:57,359 --> 01:52:00,719
of string theory come to be part of it

3553
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:03,199
for example i'll give you one example

3554
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:04,639
string was believed to be 10 dimensional

3555
01:52:03,198 --> 01:52:05,759
and then there was this 11 dimensional

3556
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:08,239
super gravity

3557
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:09,599
and nobody know what the egg is that why

3558
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:10,718
are we getting 11 dimensional super

3559
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:12,159
gravity where a string is saying it

3560
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:13,679
should be 10 dimensional 11 was the

3561
01:52:12,158 --> 01:52:14,799
maximum dimension you can have a super

3562
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:16,560
gravity

3563
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,920
but string was saying sorry we're 10

3564
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:19,679
dimensional

3565
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,199
so for for a while we thought that

3566
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:22,239
theory is wrong because how could this

3567
01:52:21,198 --> 01:52:23,279
be because string tear is definitely

3568
01:52:22,238 --> 01:52:25,359
theory of everything

3569
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:26,880
we later learned that one of the circles

3570
01:52:25,359 --> 01:52:29,839
of string theory itself was

3571
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:31,599
tiny that we had not appreciated that

3572
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:33,039
fact and we discovered by doing thought

3573
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:34,880
experiments and string theory that

3574
01:52:33,039 --> 01:52:36,560
there's got to be an extra circle

3575
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:38,239
and that circle is connected to an

3576
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:40,000
11-dimensional perspective

3577
01:52:38,238 --> 01:52:41,359
and that's what later on god's called m

3578
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,118
theory so

3579
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:44,799
so so there are these kind of things

3580
01:52:43,118 --> 01:52:46,319
that you know we do not know what

3581
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,800
exactly string theory is we're still

3582
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:50,399
learning so we do not have a final

3583
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,920
formulation of string theory

3584
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:53,839
it very well could be that different

3585
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,440
facets of different ideas come together

3586
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:57,520
like loop quantum gravity or whatnot but

3587
01:52:55,439 --> 01:53:00,000
i wouldn't put them on par namely

3588
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:01,040
loop quantum gravity is a scatter of

3589
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,800
ideas

3590
01:53:01,039 --> 01:53:04,560
about what happens to space when they

3591
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:06,480
get very tiny for example

3592
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:08,639
you replace things by discrete data and

3593
01:53:06,479 --> 01:53:11,118
try to quantize it and so on

3594
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:13,118
and you know it sounds like a natural

3595
01:53:11,118 --> 01:53:14,719
idea to quantize space

3596
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:16,158
you know if you were naive trying to do

3597
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:17,840
quantum space you might think about

3598
01:53:16,158 --> 01:53:19,198
trying to take points and put them

3599
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:21,039
together in some

3600
01:53:19,198 --> 01:53:24,719
discrete fashion in some way that is

3601
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:26,960
reminiscent of quantum gravity

3602
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:27,840
string theory is more subtle than that

3603
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:29,198
for example

3604
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,480
i would just give you an example and

3605
01:53:29,198 --> 01:53:32,319
this is the kind of thing that we didn't

3606
01:53:30,479 --> 01:53:34,158
put in by hand we got it out

3607
01:53:32,319 --> 01:53:36,000
and so it's more subtle than so what

3608
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:37,759
happens if you squeeze the space to be

3609
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,319
smaller and smaller

3610
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,960
well you think that after a certain

3611
01:53:40,319 --> 01:53:43,759
distance

3612
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:44,239
the notion of distance should break down

3613
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:47,599
you know

3614
01:53:44,238 --> 01:53:49,519
when it goes smaller than planck scale

3615
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:51,920
should break down what happens in string

3616
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:53,440
theory we do not know the full answer to

3617
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:55,039
that but we know the following namely if

3618
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:56,799
you take a space

3619
01:53:55,039 --> 01:53:58,479
and bring it smaller and smaller if the

3620
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,400
box gets smaller than the planck scale

3621
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:03,279
by a factor of 10

3622
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:04,960
it is equivalent by the duality

3623
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:07,279
transformation to a space which is 10

3624
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:10,000
times bigger

3625
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:10,559
so there's a symmetry called a t duality

3626
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,279
which takes

3627
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:14,320
l to one over l well l is measured in

3628
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:16,479
plank units

3629
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:18,079
or more precise string units this

3630
01:54:16,479 --> 01:54:21,198
inversion

3631
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:22,399
is a very subtle effect and i would not

3632
01:54:21,198 --> 01:54:23,839
have been or any physicist would not

3633
01:54:22,399 --> 01:54:24,879
have been able to design a theory which

3634
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,199
has this property

3635
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:29,440
that when you make the space smaller it

3636
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:31,439
is as if you are making it bigger

3637
01:54:29,439 --> 01:54:33,118
that means there is no there is no

3638
01:54:31,439 --> 01:54:34,719
experiment you can do to distinguish the

3639
01:54:33,118 --> 01:54:37,279
size of the space

3640
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:38,480
this is remarkable for example einstein

3641
01:54:37,279 --> 01:54:40,238
would have said of course i can measure

3642
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:42,238
the size of the space what do i do well

3643
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:44,079
i take a flashlight i send the light

3644
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:45,678
around measure how long it takes for the

3645
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:47,039
light to go around the space and bring

3646
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:48,158
back and find the radius or

3647
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:50,960
circumference of the

3648
01:54:48,158 --> 01:54:52,479
the universe what's the problem i said

3649
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,599
well suppose you do that and you shrink

3650
01:54:52,479 --> 01:54:55,598
it and say well they get smaller and

3651
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:57,039
smaller so what i said well

3652
01:54:55,599 --> 01:55:00,400
it turns out in string theory there are

3653
01:54:57,039 --> 01:55:02,560
two different kinds of photons

3654
01:55:00,399 --> 01:55:04,638
one photon measures one over l the other

3655
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:07,440
one measures l

3656
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:08,960
and so this duality reformulates oh fast

3657
01:55:07,439 --> 01:55:10,158
and when the space gets smaller it says

3658
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,439
oh no you better use the bigger

3659
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:12,879
perspective because the smaller one is

3660
01:55:11,439 --> 01:55:15,198
harder to deal with

3661
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:16,480
so you do this one so so these examples

3662
01:55:15,198 --> 01:55:18,000
of loop quantum gravity have none of

3663
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:19,198
these features these features that i'm

3664
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,079
telling you about we have learned from

3665
01:55:19,198 --> 01:55:21,598
string theory

3666
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:23,519
but they nevertheless have some of these

3667
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:24,400
ideas like topological as gravity

3668
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:27,199
aspects

3669
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:28,879
are emphasizing the context of loop

3670
01:55:27,198 --> 01:55:30,479
quantum gravity in some form and so

3671
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,118
these ideas might be there in some

3672
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:32,799
kernel

3673
01:55:31,118 --> 01:55:34,960
in some corners of string there in fact

3674
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,639
i wrote a paper about topological string

3675
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:38,239
theory and some connections with

3676
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:39,840
potentially loop quantum gravity which

3677
01:55:38,238 --> 01:55:40,319
could be part of that so there are

3678
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:43,039
little

3679
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:44,799
facets of connections i wouldn't say

3680
01:55:43,039 --> 01:55:46,319
they're complete but i would say

3681
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:48,320
most probably what will happen to some

3682
01:55:46,319 --> 01:55:50,399
of these ideas the good ones at least

3683
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:51,679
they will be absorbed within to strength

3684
01:55:50,399 --> 01:55:54,319
theory if they are occurring

3685
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:56,000
let me ask a crazy out there question

3686
01:55:54,319 --> 01:56:01,118
can physics

3687
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:04,639
help us understand life so

3688
01:56:01,118 --> 01:56:06,639
uh we spoke so confidently

3689
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:08,079
about the laws of physics being able to

3690
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:10,800
explain reality but

3691
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:11,840
and we even said words like theory of

3692
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,760
everything

3693
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:15,760
implying that the word everything is

3694
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:18,880
actually describing everything

3695
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:20,560
is it possible that the four

3696
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:22,159
laws we've been talking about are

3697
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:23,840
actually missing

3698
01:56:22,158 --> 01:56:25,439
they are accurate in describing what

3699
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:27,840
they're describing but they're missing

3700
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:29,039
the description of a lot of other things

3701
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:32,319
like

3702
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:35,519
emergence of life uh and

3703
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:36,319
emergence of perhaps consciousness so is

3704
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,400
there

3705
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:40,158
do you ever think about this kind of

3706
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:43,439
stuff where

3707
01:56:40,158 --> 01:56:46,559
we would need to understand extra

3708
01:56:43,439 --> 01:56:50,000
physics to try to explain

3709
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:52,800
the emergence of these complex

3710
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,279
pockets of interesting weird stuff that

3711
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:56,400
we call

3712
01:56:53,279 --> 01:56:58,800
life and consciousness in this big

3713
01:56:56,399 --> 01:57:00,319
homogeneous universe that's mostly

3714
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,960
boring and nothing is happening

3715
01:57:00,319 --> 01:57:03,920
so first of all we don't claim that

3716
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,439
string theory is

3717
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:07,520
the theory of everything in the sense

3718
01:57:05,439 --> 01:57:08,799
that we know enough what this theory is

3719
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,800
we don't know enough about string theory

3720
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:12,320
itself we are learning it so i wouldn't

3721
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,320
say okay give me whatever i will tell

3722
01:57:12,319 --> 01:57:16,559
you what is how it works no

3723
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:18,639
however i would say by definition by

3724
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:20,639
definition to me physics is checking all

3725
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:22,480
reality

3726
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:24,400
any form of reality i call it physics

3727
01:57:22,479 --> 01:57:24,799
that's my definition i mean i may not

3728
01:57:24,399 --> 01:57:27,118
know

3729
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:29,119
a lot of it like maybe the origin of

3730
01:57:27,118 --> 01:57:30,799
life and so on maybe a piece of that

3731
01:57:29,118 --> 01:57:33,359
but i would call that as part of physics

3732
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:34,880
to me reality is what we're after

3733
01:57:33,359 --> 01:57:36,719
i don't claim i know everything about

3734
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,599
reality i don't claim string theory

3735
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:39,520
necessarily

3736
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:41,119
has the tools right now to describe all

3737
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:42,719
the reality either

3738
01:57:41,118 --> 01:57:44,399
but we are learning what it is so i

3739
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:45,840
would say that i would not put a border

3740
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:47,519
to say no you know from this point

3741
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,319
onwards it's not my territory somebody

3742
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,560
else's

3743
01:57:48,319 --> 01:57:52,079
but whether we need new ideas on string

3744
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:54,080
clear to describe other reality

3745
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:55,359
reality features for sure i believe as i

3746
01:57:54,079 --> 01:57:57,519
mentioned i don't believe

3747
01:57:55,359 --> 01:58:00,000
any things any of the laws we know today

3748
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:02,320
is final so therefore yes we will need

3749
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,279
new ideas this is a very tricky thing

3750
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:09,279
for us to understand

3751
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:12,719
and uh be precise about but

3752
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:16,000
just because you understand the physics

3753
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:17,920
doesn't necessarily mean that

3754
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,880
you understand the emergence of

3755
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:24,560
chemistry biology

3756
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:27,679
life intelligence consciousness so those

3757
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:28,960
are built it's like you might understand

3758
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:31,840
the way

3759
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:32,399
bricks work yes but to understand what

3760
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:35,599
it

3761
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:37,039
means to have a happy family right you

3762
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:39,119
you don't construct you don't get from

3763
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:42,319
the bricks so directly

3764
01:58:39,118 --> 01:58:45,198
you you right in theory you could uh

3765
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:45,519
if you ran the universe over again but

3766
01:58:45,198 --> 01:58:47,359
just

3767
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,880
understanding the rules of the universe

3768
01:58:47,359 --> 01:58:51,519
doesn't necessarily give you

3769
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,159
a sense of the weird beautiful things

3770
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,239
that emerge

3771
01:58:52,158 --> 01:58:55,198
right no so let me let me describe what

3772
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:56,479
you just said

3773
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:58,479
so there are two questions one is

3774
01:58:56,479 --> 01:59:00,000
whether or not the techniques are used

3775
01:58:58,479 --> 01:59:01,839
and let's say quantum field theory and

3776
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,319
so on will describe how the society

3777
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:05,279
works

3778
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:06,719
yes okay that's far distance far for

3779
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:08,158
different scales of questions that we're

3780
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:10,639
asking here

3781
01:59:08,158 --> 01:59:12,799
the question is is there a change of is

3782
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:14,880
there a new law which takes over

3783
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:16,159
that cannot be connected to the other

3784
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,000
laws that we know

3785
01:59:16,158 --> 01:59:20,238
or of more fundamental laws that we know

3786
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,599
do you need new laws to describe it

3787
01:59:20,238 --> 01:59:23,039
i don't think that's necessarily the

3788
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:25,199
case in many of these phenomena like

3789
01:59:23,039 --> 01:59:27,039
chemistry or so on you mentioned

3790
01:59:25,198 --> 01:59:28,960
so we do expect you know in principle

3791
01:59:27,039 --> 01:59:30,560
chemistry can be described by quantum

3792
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,239
mechanics we don't think there's going

3793
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:33,280
to be a magical thing but chemistry is

3794
01:59:32,238 --> 01:59:35,279
complicated yeah

3795
01:59:33,279 --> 01:59:36,639
indeed there are rules of chemistry that

3796
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:38,319
you know chemists have put down which

3797
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:40,639
has not been explained yet using quantum

3798
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:42,158
mechanics do i believe that they will be

3799
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:43,760
something described by quantum mechanics

3800
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:44,799
yes i do i don't think they are going to

3801
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:46,320
be sitting there

3802
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:48,320
in this just forever but maybe it's too

3803
01:59:46,319 --> 01:59:49,759
complicated and maybe you know we

3804
01:59:48,319 --> 01:59:51,279
will wait for very powerful quantum

3805
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,560
computers or what not to solve those

3806
01:59:51,279 --> 01:59:54,800
problems i don't know

3807
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:57,199
but i don't think in that context we

3808
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:59,920
have no principles to be added to fix

3809
01:59:57,198 --> 02:00:02,079
those so by i'm perfectly fine

3810
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,920
in the intermediate situation to have

3811
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:05,118
rules of thumb or you know principles

3812
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,679
that chemists have found which are

3813
02:00:05,118 --> 02:00:07,920
working

3814
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:09,279
which are not founded on the basis of

3815
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:11,039
quantum mechanical laws

3816
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:13,279
which does their job similarly as

3817
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:14,800
biologists do not found everything in

3818
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:15,359
terms of chemistry but they think you

3819
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:16,719
know

3820
02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:18,238
there's no reason why chemistry cannot

3821
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:19,760
they don't think necessarily they're

3822
02:00:18,238 --> 02:00:20,879
doing something amazingly not possible

3823
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,320
with chemistry

3824
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:24,239
coming back to your question does

3825
02:00:22,319 --> 02:00:27,279
consciousness for example

3826
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:28,799
bring this new ingredient if indeed it

3827
02:00:27,279 --> 02:00:30,479
needs a new ingredient i would call that

3828
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:33,199
new ingredient part of physical law

3829
02:00:30,479 --> 02:00:34,879
we have to understand it to me that so i

3830
02:00:33,198 --> 02:00:36,479
wouldn't put a line to say okay from

3831
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:37,359
this point onwards you cannot it's

3832
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:38,959
disconnected

3833
02:00:37,359 --> 02:00:41,118
it's totally disconnected from strength

3834
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:43,679
or whatever we have to do something else

3835
02:00:41,118 --> 02:00:44,639
it's not a line what i'm referring to is

3836
02:00:43,679 --> 02:00:46,719
can physics

3837
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:48,159
of a few centuries from now that doesn't

3838
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:51,599
understand consciousness

3839
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:54,079
be much bigger than the physics of today

3840
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:55,920
where the the textbook grows it

3841
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:56,639
definitely will i would say i will grow

3842
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:57,840
i would not

3843
02:00:56,639 --> 02:00:59,679
i don't know if it grows because of

3844
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,119
consciousness being part of it or we

3845
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:02,480
have different view of consciousness

3846
02:01:01,118 --> 02:01:04,479
i do not know where the consciousness

3847
02:01:02,479 --> 02:01:05,598
will fit i'm not it's going to be hard

3848
02:01:04,479 --> 02:01:08,799
for me to

3849
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:10,480
to to to guess i mean i can make random

3850
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:12,079
guesses now which probably most

3851
02:01:10,479 --> 02:01:14,319
most likely is wrong but let me just do

3852
02:01:12,079 --> 02:01:16,639
just for the sake of discussion

3853
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:18,079
you know i could say you know you know

3854
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:19,440
brain could be their quantum computer

3855
02:01:18,079 --> 02:01:20,800
classical computer their arguments

3856
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:22,000
against this being a quantum thing so

3857
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,800
it's probably classical and if it's

3858
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,920
classical

3859
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:25,520
it could be like what we are doing in

3860
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:26,079
machine learning slightly more fancy and

3861
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:27,920
so on

3862
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:29,359
okay people can go to this argument to

3863
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:30,719
no end and to know whether consciousness

3864
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:32,880
like this or not or life

3865
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:34,319
does it have any meaning or is there is

3866
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,639
there a phase transition where you can

3867
02:01:34,319 --> 02:01:36,799
say

3868
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:39,039
does electron have a life or not the at

3869
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:40,880
what level does the particle become live

3870
02:01:39,039 --> 02:01:42,639
maybe there is no definite definition of

3871
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:45,199
life in that same way that

3872
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:45,760
you know we cannot say electron if you

3873
02:01:45,198 --> 02:01:47,839
you know

3874
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:49,840
a good i like this example quite a bit

3875
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:51,760
um you know we distinguish between

3876
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:52,719
liquid and a gas phase like water is

3877
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:54,480
liquid or

3878
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:56,079
or vapor is gas we say they're different

3879
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:57,198
you can distinguish them actually that's

3880
02:01:56,079 --> 02:01:59,279
not true

3881
02:01:57,198 --> 02:02:00,559
it's not true because we know from

3882
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:02,238
physics that you can

3883
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:04,159
change temperatures and pressure to go

3884
02:02:02,238 --> 02:02:05,598
from liquid to the gas without making

3885
02:02:04,158 --> 02:02:07,359
any phase transition

3886
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:10,000
so there is no point that you can say

3887
02:02:07,359 --> 02:02:11,359
this was a liquid and this was a gas

3888
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:13,760
you can continuously change the

3889
02:02:11,359 --> 02:02:15,439
parameters to go from one to the other

3890
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:16,960
so at the end it's very different

3891
02:02:15,439 --> 02:02:18,000
looking like you know i know that water

3892
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:19,840
is different from vapor

3893
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,118
but you know there's no precise point

3894
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:23,039
this happens

3895
02:02:21,118 --> 02:02:25,198
i feel many of these things that we

3896
02:02:23,039 --> 02:02:26,719
think like consciousness clearly

3897
02:02:25,198 --> 02:02:28,000
that person is not conscious on the

3898
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:28,399
other one is so there's a difference

3899
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,359
like

3900
02:02:28,399 --> 02:02:32,879
water and vapor but there's no point you

3901
02:02:31,359 --> 02:02:33,279
could say that this is conscious there's

3902
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:35,039
no

3903
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:37,198
sharp transition so it could very well

3904
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:39,679
be that what we call

3905
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:41,598
uh heuristically in daily life

3906
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:43,039
consciousness is similar or life is

3907
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:44,400
similar to that

3908
02:02:43,039 --> 02:02:46,719
i don't know if it's like that or not

3909
02:02:44,399 --> 02:02:48,799
i'm just hypothesizing that's possible

3910
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:49,840
like there's no there's no discrete

3911
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:51,599
phases there's no

3912
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:53,520
phase transition like that yeah yeah but

3913
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,920
this you might

3914
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:57,199
there might be you know concepts of

3915
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:59,359
temperature and pressure

3916
02:02:57,198 --> 02:03:01,439
that we need to understand uh to

3917
02:02:59,359 --> 02:03:02,639
describe what the heck consciousness in

3918
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:04,879
life is

3919
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:05,760
that that we're totally missing yeah i

3920
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:08,880
think that's not

3921
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:10,639
a useless question even those questions

3922
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:13,118
is back to our original discussion of

3923
02:03:10,639 --> 02:03:16,079
philosophy i would say consciousness

3924
02:03:13,118 --> 02:03:16,880
and free will for example are topics

3925
02:03:16,079 --> 02:03:19,599
that

3926
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:21,359
are very much so in the realm of

3927
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:22,800
philosophy currently yes but i don't

3928
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:24,639
think they will always be

3929
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,960
i agree with you i agree with you and i

3930
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:28,400
think i am i'm fine with some topics

3931
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:29,679
being part of a different realm than

3932
02:03:28,399 --> 02:03:32,079
physics today

3933
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:34,000
because we don't have the right tools

3934
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:35,679
just like biology was i mean before we

3935
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,960
had dna and all that genetics and all

3936
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:39,840
that gradually began to

3937
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:40,800
take hold i mean when mandela when

3938
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:43,199
people were beginning

3939
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:44,800
with face experiments with biology and

3940
02:03:43,198 --> 02:03:45,839
chemistry and so on they gradually they

3941
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:47,920
came together

3942
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:49,360
so it wasn't like together so yeah i'll

3943
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:51,440
be perfectly understanding of a

3944
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:53,198
situation where we don't have the tools

3945
02:03:51,439 --> 02:03:54,559
so do these experiments that you think

3946
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:55,839
has defines the consciousness in

3947
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:57,119
different form and gradually we will

3948
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:59,039
build it and connect it

3949
02:03:57,118 --> 02:04:00,960
and yes we might discover new principles

3950
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:02,399
of nature that we didn't know

3951
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:04,158
i don't know but i would say that if

3952
02:04:02,399 --> 02:04:05,039
they are they will be deeply connected

3953
02:04:04,158 --> 02:04:06,960
with yes we

3954
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:08,238
we have never we have seen in physics we

3955
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,960
don't have things in isolation you

3956
02:04:08,238 --> 02:04:10,718
cannot

3957
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,639
you cannot compartmentalize you know

3958
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:13,118
this is gravity this is electricity this

3959
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:14,560
is that

3960
02:04:13,118 --> 02:04:16,559
we have learned they all talk to each

3961
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:18,400
other there's no way to

3962
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:19,920
to make them you know in one corner and

3963
02:04:18,399 --> 02:04:21,359
don't talk so same thing with

3964
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:23,118
anything anything which is real so

3965
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:25,118
consciousness is real so therefore

3966
02:04:23,118 --> 02:04:26,880
we have to connect it to everything else

3967
02:04:25,118 --> 02:04:28,238
so to me once you connect it you cannot

3968
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:29,840
say it's not reality and once this

3969
02:04:28,238 --> 02:04:31,198
reality is physics

3970
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:32,880
i call it physics it may not be the

3971
02:04:31,198 --> 02:04:33,598
physics i know today for sure it's not

3972
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:35,118
but

3973
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:36,639
but i wouldn't i would i would be

3974
02:04:35,118 --> 02:04:38,479
surprised if there's disconnected

3975
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:40,239
realities that you know you cannot

3976
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:42,319
you cannot imagine them as a part of the

3977
02:04:40,238 --> 02:04:44,559
same soup so i guess uh

3978
02:04:42,319 --> 02:04:45,840
god doesn't have a biology or chemistry

3979
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:49,360
textbook and mostly

3980
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:50,960
or maybe uh he or she reads it for fun

3981
02:04:49,359 --> 02:04:52,399
biology and chemistry but when you're

3982
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:54,480
trying to get some work done it'll be

3983
02:04:52,399 --> 02:04:58,479
going to the physics textbook

3984
02:04:54,479 --> 02:05:01,598
okay uh what advice let's put on your

3985
02:04:58,479 --> 02:05:02,319
wise visionary hat what advice do you

3986
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:04,960
have

3987
02:05:02,319 --> 02:05:06,000
for young people today you've um are

3988
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:08,639
you've dedicated your

3989
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,599
book actually to your kids to your

3990
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:11,599
family

3991
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:13,440
what advice would you give to them what

3992
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:15,199
advice would you give to young people

3993
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:16,638
today thinking about their career

3994
02:05:15,198 --> 02:05:18,638
thinking about life

3995
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:19,760
of how to live a successful life how to

3996
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:23,679
live a good life

3997
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:26,639
yes uh yes i have three sons and in fact

3998
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:28,239
to them i have uh i have tried not to

3999
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:30,719
give too much advice

4000
02:05:28,238 --> 02:05:31,839
so even though i've tried to kind of not

4001
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:33,920
give advice maybe

4002
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:35,520
indirectly it has been some impact my

4003
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:36,719
oldest one is doing biophysics for

4004
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:38,159
example and the

4005
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:39,920
the second one is doing machine learning

4006
02:05:38,158 --> 02:05:41,198
and the third one is doing theoretical

4007
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:42,880
computer science so there are

4008
02:05:41,198 --> 02:05:45,039
there are these facets of interest which

4009
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:46,159
are not too far from my area but i have

4010
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:48,399
not tried to

4011
02:05:46,158 --> 02:05:49,920
to impact them in in that way but and

4012
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:50,559
they have followed their own interests

4013
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:52,319
and i think

4014
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:54,880
that's the advice i would give to any

4015
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:56,479
young person follow your own interest

4016
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:58,480
and let it that take you wherever it

4017
02:05:56,479 --> 02:06:02,238
takes you um

4018
02:05:58,479 --> 02:06:04,638
and this i did in my own case that

4019
02:06:02,238 --> 02:06:06,078
uh i was planning to study economics and

4020
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:08,800
electrical engineering

4021
02:06:06,078 --> 02:06:09,759
when i started at mit and you know i

4022
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:11,119
discovered that

4023
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:13,360
i'm more passionate about math and

4024
02:06:11,118 --> 02:06:14,839
physics and at that time i didn't think

4025
02:06:13,359 --> 02:06:16,559
math and physics would make a good

4026
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:18,078
career and so i

4027
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:20,079
was kind of hesitant to go in that

4028
02:06:18,078 --> 02:06:22,559
direction but i did because i kind of

4029
02:06:20,078 --> 02:06:25,359
felt that that's what i'm driven to do

4030
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:27,119
so i didn't i don't regret it i'm i'm

4031
02:06:25,359 --> 02:06:28,639
lucky in the sense that you know society

4032
02:06:27,118 --> 02:06:30,399
supports people like me who are doing

4033
02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:32,000
you know these abstract stuff which

4034
02:06:30,399 --> 02:06:33,920
which may or may not be experimentally

4035
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:36,560
verified even let's not apply to the

4036
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:37,599
data technology in our lifetimes i'm

4037
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:40,639
lucky i'm doing that

4038
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:42,239
and i feel that uh if people follow

4039
02:06:40,639 --> 02:06:44,639
their interest they will find a niche

4040
02:06:42,238 --> 02:06:47,519
that they're good at and

4041
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:48,560
this coincidence of hopefully their

4042
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:52,000
interests and

4043
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:53,920
and abilities are kind of align

4044
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,118
at least to some extent to be able to

4045
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:56,158
drive them to something which is

4046
02:06:55,118 --> 02:06:58,238
successful

4047
02:06:56,158 --> 02:07:00,000
and not to be driven by things like you

4048
02:06:58,238 --> 02:07:01,598
know this doesn't make a good career or

4049
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,679
this doesn't do that and my parents

4050
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:05,599
expect that or what about this and

4051
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:07,440
i think ultimately you have to live with

4052
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:08,078
yourself and you only have one life and

4053
02:07:07,439 --> 02:07:09,519
it's short

4054
02:07:08,078 --> 02:07:11,118
very short i can tell you i'm getting

4055
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,639
yes i'm getting there so i know it's

4056
02:07:11,118 --> 02:07:14,960
short so you really

4057
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:16,480
want not to not to not to do things that

4058
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:18,158
you don't want to do so i think

4059
02:07:16,479 --> 02:07:20,078
follow your interest my strongest advice

4060
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:23,679
to young people yeah it's scary

4061
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:26,479
when your interest doesn't directly map

4062
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:28,239
to a career of the past or of today

4063
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:29,519
so you're almost anticipating future

4064
02:07:28,238 --> 02:07:32,959
careers that could be created

4065
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:34,079
is scary um but

4066
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:35,359
yeah there's something to that

4067
02:07:34,078 --> 02:07:36,799
especially when the interest and the

4068
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:39,839
ability align

4069
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:41,119
you'll pay you'll pave a path that will

4070
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:44,078
find a way to make money

4071
02:07:41,118 --> 02:07:46,158
especially in this society in the in in

4072
02:07:44,078 --> 02:07:48,319
the capitalistic united states society

4073
02:07:46,158 --> 02:07:52,839
it feels like

4074
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:56,078
um ability and passion paves the way

4075
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:56,880
yes at the very least you can sell funny

4076
02:07:56,078 --> 02:08:00,799
t-shirts

4077
02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:04,000
yes you've mentioned uh life is short

4078
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:06,320
do you think about um your mortality

4079
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:09,760
are you afraid of death uh i don't think

4080
02:08:06,319 --> 02:08:12,319
about my mortality

4081
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:13,679
i think that i don't think about my debt

4082
02:08:12,319 --> 02:08:14,559
and i don't think about death in general

4083
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:15,679
too much

4084
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:17,760
first of all it's something that i can't

4085
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:18,480
too much about and i think it's

4086
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:20,719
something that

4087
02:08:18,479 --> 02:08:21,519
doesn't it doesn't drive my everyday

4088
02:08:20,719 --> 02:08:23,599
action

4089
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:24,560
it is natural to expect that it's

4090
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:26,319
somewhat like the

4091
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:27,840
time reversal situation so we believe

4092
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:29,359
that we have this approximate symmetry

4093
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:31,199
in nature time reversal

4094
02:08:29,359 --> 02:08:33,279
going forward we die going backwards we

4095
02:08:31,198 --> 02:08:36,479
get born yeah so

4096
02:08:33,279 --> 02:08:38,078
what was it to get born it wasn't such a

4097
02:08:36,479 --> 02:08:39,598
good or bad feeling i have no feeling of

4098
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:41,039
it so

4099
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:42,960
you know who knows what the death will

4100
02:08:41,039 --> 02:08:44,479
feel like uh the moment of death or

4101
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:47,439
whatnot so i don't know

4102
02:08:44,479 --> 02:08:50,078
it is not known but uh in what form do

4103
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:52,078
we exist before or after

4104
02:08:50,078 --> 02:08:53,599
again it's something that it's uh it's

4105
02:08:52,078 --> 02:08:55,118
partly philosophical maybe

4106
02:08:53,599 --> 02:08:57,119
i like how you draw comfort from

4107
02:08:55,118 --> 02:08:58,639
symmetry it does seem that there is

4108
02:08:57,118 --> 02:09:01,519
something asymmetric here

4109
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:03,279
breaking of symmetry because there's

4110
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:06,800
there's something

4111
02:09:03,279 --> 02:09:07,840
to the uh creative force of the human

4112
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:10,960
spirit

4113
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:13,360
that goes only one way right that

4114
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:15,840
it seems the finiteness of life is the

4115
02:09:13,359 --> 02:09:18,880
thing that drives the creativity

4116
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:19,279
and so it does seem that that um at

4117
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:22,639
least

4118
02:09:19,279 --> 02:09:24,479
the contemplation of of the finiteness

4119
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:26,560
of life of mortality

4120
02:09:24,479 --> 02:09:28,238
is a thing that helps you get your stuff

4121
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:29,440
together yes i think that's true but

4122
02:09:28,238 --> 02:09:30,839
actually i have a different perspective

4123
02:09:29,439 --> 02:09:33,598
on that a little bit yes

4124
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:34,719
namely uh suppose i told you you have

4125
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:38,239
you're immortal

4126
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:39,760
yes i think your life will be totally

4127
02:09:38,238 --> 02:09:42,879
boring after that

4128
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:45,199
because you will not there's i think

4129
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:47,199
part of the reason we have enjoyment in

4130
02:09:45,198 --> 02:09:50,479
life is the finiteness of it

4131
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:53,118
yes and so i think mortality

4132
02:09:50,479 --> 02:09:54,000
might be a blessing and immortality may

4133
02:09:53,118 --> 02:09:56,158
not

4134
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
so i think that we value things because

4135
02:09:56,158 --> 02:09:59,679
we have that finite life

4136
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,560
we we appreciate things we want to do

4137
02:09:59,679 --> 02:10:01,440
this we want to do that we have

4138
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:03,039
motivation

4139
02:10:01,439 --> 02:10:04,638
if i told you no you have infinite life

4140
02:10:03,039 --> 02:10:05,920
oh i don't i don't need to do this today

4141
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:08,239
i have another

4142
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:10,000
it's a billion or trillion or infinite

4143
02:10:08,238 --> 02:10:12,319
life so why do i do now

4144
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,520
there is no motivation a lot of the

4145
02:10:12,319 --> 02:10:15,359
things that we do

4146
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:17,199
are driven by that finiteness this

4147
02:10:15,359 --> 02:10:17,598
refinedness of these resources so i

4148
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:20,399
think

4149
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:22,159
it's a blessing in disguise i don't

4150
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:25,439
regret it that we have more

4151
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:28,719
finite life and i think

4152
02:10:25,439 --> 02:10:31,279
i think that the the process

4153
02:10:28,719 --> 02:10:31,840
of uh being part of this thing that you

4154
02:10:31,279 --> 02:10:34,639
know the

4155
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:36,400
the reality to me part of what attracts

4156
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:38,800
me to science

4157
02:10:36,399 --> 02:10:39,598
is to connect to that immortality kind

4158
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:43,840
of

4159
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:46,880
namely the laws the reality is beyond us

4160
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:47,840
to me i'm i'm i'm resigned to the fact

4161
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:50,639
that not only me

4162
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:52,400
everybody is going to die so this is a

4163
02:10:50,639 --> 02:10:53,840
little bit of a consolation none of us

4164
02:10:52,399 --> 02:10:55,920
are going to be around

4165
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:57,520
so therefore okay and none of none of

4166
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:58,960
the people before me are around so

4167
02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:01,520
therefore yeah okay this is

4168
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:03,359
something everybody goes through so so

4169
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:05,840
taking that minuscule version of

4170
02:11:03,359 --> 02:11:07,439
okay how tiny we are and how short time

4171
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:10,000
it is and so on

4172
02:11:07,439 --> 02:11:11,839
to connect to the deeper truth beyond us

4173
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:15,359
the reality beyond us

4174
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:16,800
is what sense of quote-unquote

4175
02:11:15,359 --> 02:11:19,039
immortality i would get

4176
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:20,639
namely i at least i can hang on to this

4177
02:11:19,039 --> 02:11:22,639
little piece of truth

4178
02:11:20,639 --> 02:11:24,800
even though i know i know it's not

4179
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:26,480
complete i know it's going to be

4180
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:28,320
imp imperfect i know it's going to

4181
02:11:26,479 --> 02:11:30,479
change and it's going to be improved

4182
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:32,639
but having a little bit deeper insight

4183
02:11:30,479 --> 02:11:34,399
than than just the naive thing around us

4184
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:35,199
little earth year and little galaxy and

4185
02:11:34,399 --> 02:11:38,319
so on

4186
02:11:35,198 --> 02:11:39,198
makes me feel a little bit more uh more

4187
02:11:38,319 --> 02:11:40,719
pleasure to

4188
02:11:39,198 --> 02:11:43,118
to live this life so i think that's the

4189
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:46,239
way i view my my role as a scientist

4190
02:11:43,118 --> 02:11:49,279
yeah this the scarcity of this life

4191
02:11:46,238 --> 02:11:52,399
helps us appreciate the beauty of the

4192
02:11:49,279 --> 02:11:55,118
the immortal the universal truths of

4193
02:11:52,399 --> 02:11:56,000
that physics present us and maybe maybe

4194
02:11:55,118 --> 02:11:58,799
one day

4195
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,920
physics will will have something to say

4196
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:03,360
about

4197
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:05,599
that that beauty in itself

4198
02:12:03,359 --> 02:12:06,399
explaining why the heck it's so

4199
02:12:05,599 --> 02:12:08,319
beautiful

4200
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:09,519
to appreciate the laws of physics and

4201
02:12:08,319 --> 02:12:12,639
yet

4202
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:15,679
um why it's so tragic that we uh

4203
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:17,199
we would die so quickly yes we do so

4204
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:18,000
quickly so that can be a bit longer

4205
02:12:17,198 --> 02:12:20,000
that's for sure

4206
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:22,238
it would be very nice maybe physics will

4207
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:24,238
help out well karma and it was uh

4208
02:12:22,238 --> 02:12:26,000
an incredible conversation thank you so

4209
02:12:24,238 --> 02:12:26,879
much once again for painting a beautiful

4210
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,840
picture

4211
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:31,199
of the history of physics and it kind of

4212
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:34,078
presents a hopeful

4213
02:12:31,198 --> 02:12:35,678
um view of the future physics so i

4214
02:12:34,078 --> 02:12:37,359
really really appreciate that

4215
02:12:35,679 --> 02:12:39,199
it's a huge honor that you talked to me

4216
02:12:37,359 --> 02:12:40,559
waste all your valuable titles me

4217
