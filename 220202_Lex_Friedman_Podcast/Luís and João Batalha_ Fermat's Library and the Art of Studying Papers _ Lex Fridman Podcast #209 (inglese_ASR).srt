00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,399
luiz and joao batala

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,280
brothers and co-founders of firma's

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,000
library which is an incredible platform

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,638
for annotating papers as they write on

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,879
the formats library website justice

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,198
pierre de fermat scribbled his famous

last theorem in the margins professional

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,118
scientists academics and citizen

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,480
scientists can annotate equations

11
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:29,278
figures ideas and write in the margins

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,118
for mars library is also a really good

13
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,679
twitter account to follow i highly

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,320
recommend it they post little visual

15
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,479
factoids and explorations that reveal

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,920
the beauty of mathematics

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,000
i love it

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,960
quick mention of our sponsors

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,878
skiff

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,640
simply safe indeed netsuite and for

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,198
sigmatic check them out in the

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,039
description to support this podcast as a

23
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:56,000
side note let me say a few words about

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,879
the dissemination of scientific ideas

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,320
i believe that all scientific articles

26
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:01,439
should be freely accessible to the

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,439
public

28
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,920
they currently are not

29
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,000
in one analysis i saw more than 70 of

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,200
published research articles are behind a

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,040
paywall

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,280
in case you don't know the funders of

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
the research whether that's government

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,280
or industry

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
aren't the ones putting up the paywall

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,320
the journals are the ones putting up the

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,520
paywall while using unpaid labor from

38
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,919
researchers for the peer review process

39
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,039
where is all that money from the paywall

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,200
going

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,479
in this digital age the costs here

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,960
should be minimal

43
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,438
this cost can easily be covered through

44
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,559
donation advertisement or public funding

45
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,319
of science

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,719
the benefit versus the cost of all

47
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,398
papers being free to read is obvious and

48
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,560
the fact that they're not free goes

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,799
against everything science should stand

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,320
for which is the free dissemination of

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,360
ideas that educate and inspire

52
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,039
science cannot be a gated institution

53
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,438
the more people can freely learn and

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,439
collaborate on ideas the more problems

55
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,839
we can solve in the world together and

56
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,199
the faster we can drive old ideas out

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,200
and bring new

58
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,319
better ideas in

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,920
science is beautiful and powerful and

60
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,199
its dissemination in this digital age

61
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,359
should be free

62
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,839
this is the lex friedman podcast and

63
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,319
here's my conversation with luiz and

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,598
joao batala

65
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:28,159
luis you suggested an interesting idea

66
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:31,039
imagine if most papers had a

67
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,719
backstory section the same way that they

68
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,598
have an abstract

69
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,680
so

70
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,679
knowing more about how the authors ended

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,239
up working on a paper can be extremely

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,879
insightful and then you went on to give

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,239
a backstory for the feynman qed paper

74
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,159
this is all in a tweet by the way we're

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,920
doing tweet analysis today

76
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,400
how much of the human backstory do you

77
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,559
think is important in understanding

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,319
the idea itself that's presented in the

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,800
paper or in general

80
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:59,280
i think this gives way more context to

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,680
the work of of scientists i think people

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,400
a lot of people have this almost kind of

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,319
romantic misconception that

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,280
the way a lot of scientists work is

85
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,119
almost as the sum of eureka moments

86
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,280
where all of a sudden they sit down and

87
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,840
start writing two papers in a row and

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,759
the papers are usually isolated and when

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,920
you actually look at it it's the papers

90
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,399
are you know chapters of a way more

91
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,958
complex uh story

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,799
and the definement qed paper is a good

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,280
example so feynman was actually going

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,680
through a pretty dark phase before

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
writing that paper it was he lost

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,159
enthusiasm with physics and doing

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,878
physics problems and there was one time

98
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,878
when he was in the cafeteria of cornell

99
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,959
and he saw a guy that was throwing

100
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,639
flights in the air and he noticed that

101
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,719
there was when the plate was in the air

102
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,798
there were two movements there the plate

103
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,759
was wobbling but he also noticed that

104
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,360
the the cornell symbol was rotating and

105
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,598
he was able to figure out the equations

106
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,599
of motions uh the equations of motions

107
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:02,719
of those uh plates and that uh led him

108
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:05,359
to kind of think a little bit about

109
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,158
electron orbits in relativity which led

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,080
to the paper of

111
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,000
about quantum electrodynamics so that

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,040
kind of reignited

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,120
his interest in physics and and and

114
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,399
ended up publishing the paper that led

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,918
to the his nobel prize basically and i

116
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,359
think it's it's

117
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,439
there are a lot of really interesting

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,360
backstories about papers that readers

119
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,839
never get to know friends we did a

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,000
couple of months ago um

121
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:36,879
an ama around a paper a pretty famous

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,279
paper the gans paper with ian goodfellow

123
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,040
and so we did an ama where everyone was

124
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,039
could ask questions about the paper and

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,919
ian was responding to those questions

126
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,840
you also he was also telling the story

127
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,918
of how he got the idea for that paper in

128
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:54,719
a bar so there was also an interesting

129
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:56,159
and a back story i also read a book by

130
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,160
cedric villani

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,479
uh these cedric velani is this

132
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,720
mathematician the fields medalist and in

133
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,159
his book he tries to explain how he got

134
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
from like

135
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,880
a phd student to the fields metal and he

136
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
tries to be as descriptive as possible

137
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,199
every single step how we got to the

138
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,879
fields metal and it's interesting also

139
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
to see just the amount of random

140
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,279
interactions and discussions with other

141
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,038
researchers sometimes over coffee and

142
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,799
how it led to like

143
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,639
fundamental breakthroughs and some of

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,759
his most important papers so i think

145
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,400
it's super interesting to have that

146
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,000
context of of the backstory well the ian

147
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,758
goodfellow story is kind of interesting

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,439
and perhaps that's true for feynman as

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,720
well i don't know if it's romanticizing

150
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,478
the thing but

151
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,479
it seems like just

152
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,439
a few little insights and a little bit

153
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,240
of work

154
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,600
does most of the leap required

155
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,360
do you have a sense that for a lot of

156
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
the stuff you've looked at

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,600
just looking back through history

158
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,439
uh it it wasn't necessarily the grind

159
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,039
of like andrew wiles of the females last

160
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,600
theorem for example

161
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,079
it was more like a a brilliant moment of

162
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,199
insight in fact ian goodfellow has a

163
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:06,159
kind of sadness to him almost in that

164
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,160
at that time in machine learning like at

165
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
that time especially in uh

166
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,039
for gans

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,560
you could

168
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,839
code something up really quickly on a

169
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,519
single machine

170
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:19,918
and almost do the invention go from idea

171
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,560
to uh experimental validation and like a

172
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:24,240
single night a single person could do it

173
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,839
and now there's kind of a sadness that a

174
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,680
lot of the breakthroughs you might have

175
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,519
in machine learning kind of require

176
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,800
large-scale experiments

177
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,359
so it was almost like the early days

178
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,840
so i wonder how many

179
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,360
low-hanging fruit there are in science

180
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,159
and mathematics

181
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,000
and even engineering where it's like

182
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,439
you could do that little experiment

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,600
quickly like you have an insight and a

184
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,918
bar why is it always a bar but you have

185
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,039
an insight at a bar and then just

186
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:53,439
implement

187
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,038
and the world changes

188
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,959
it's it's a good point i think it also

189
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,279
depends a lot on the maturity of the

190
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,918
field when you look at a field like

191
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,559
mathematics like it's a pretty mature

192
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,959
field uh feels like machine learning um

193
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,598
it's it's growing pretty fast

194
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,359
and um it's actually pretty pretty

195
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,478
interesting i i looked up like the

196
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,639
number of

197
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,478
new papers

198
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,120
on archive with the keyword machine

199
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,279
learning and like 50 of those papers

200
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,160
have been published on in the last 12

201
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:26,318
months so you can see just the same zero

202
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,280
five zero fifty percent so you can see

203
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,080
the the the the magnitude of growth in

204
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,719
that field and so i think like as fields

205
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,079
mature like those types of moments i

206
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,639
think naturally

207
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,800
uh are less frequent um

208
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,560
it's just a consequence of

209
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,160
that the other point that is interesting

210
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,639
about the backstory is that it can

211
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,800
really make it more memorable in a way

212
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,800
and and by making it more memorable it's

213
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,598
it kind of sediments the knowledge more

214
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,759
in your mind i remember also reading the

215
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,719
sort of the backstory to

216
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,199
to dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

217
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,960
right where he came up with it uh

218
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,439
essentially while he was

219
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,839
sitting down at a at a coffee shop in

220
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,160
amsterdam and he and he came up with

221
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,000
that algorithm over 20 minutes and one

222
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,680
interesting aspect is he didn't have any

223
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,598
pen or paper at the time and so he had

224
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,439
to do it all in his mind and so

225
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,038
there's only so much complexity that you

226
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,439
can handle if you're just thinking about

227
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,000
it in your mind and that like when you

228
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,879
think about the simplicity of dijkstra's

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,199
shortest path finding algorithm it's you

230
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,439
know knowing that backstory helps

231
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,278
sediment that algorithm in your mind so

232
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,000
that you don't forget about it as easily

233
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:39,439
it might be from you that i saw

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,440
a meme about texture

235
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,039
it's like he's trying to solve it he

236
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,959
comes up with some kind of random path

237
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,199
and then it's like my parents aren't

238
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,958
home and then he does uh

239
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,600
he figures out the algorithm for the

240
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,599
shortest path

241
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,319
i strike through words to convey memes

242
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:59,039
but that's hilarious i don't know if

243
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,560
it's in post that we construct stories

244
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,679
that romanticize it apparently with

245
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,879
newton there was no apple

246
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,159
especially when you're working on

247
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,080
problems that have a physical

248
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:12,240
manifestation or a visual manifestation

249
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,480
it feels like the world

250
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,680
could be an inspiration to you

251
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,879
so it doesn't have to be completely in

252
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,799
on paper

253
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,320
like you could be sitting at a bar and

254
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,919
all of a sudden see something and a

255
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,160
pattern will

256
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,799
will spark another pattern and you can

257
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,559
visualize it and rethink a problem in a

258
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,240
particular way

259
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,000
of course you can also load the math

260
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,519
that you have on paper and always carry

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,759
that with you so when you show up to the

262
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,919
bar some little inspiration could be the

263
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,278
thing that changes it is there any other

264
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,439
people

265
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,919
almost on the human side whether it's

266
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,480
physics with feynman

267
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,120
derock einstein or computer science

268
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,879
touring anybody else any backstories

269
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,759
that you remember that jump out

270
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,278
because i'm also referring to

271
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,120
not necessarily these stories where

272
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,360
something magical happens

273
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,159
but these are personalities they have

274
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,200
big egos some of them are super friendly

275
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,919
some of them are like self-obsessed some

276
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,640
of them have anger issues some of them

277
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,838
how do i describe feynman but he appears

278
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,278
to uh

279
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
have a

280
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,838
appreciation of the beautiful in all its

281
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,480
forms it has a wit and a cleverness and

282
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,399
a humor about him so it does that come

283
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,600
into play in terms of the construction

284
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,278
of the science

285
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,440
well i think you brought up newton

286
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,120
newton is it's a good example also to

287
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
think about his backstory because you

288
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,360
know there's a certain backstory of

289
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,879
newton that people always talk about but

290
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,720
then there's a whole

291
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,559
another aspect of him

292
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,240
that is also a big part of the person

293
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,639
that he was but you know he was really

294
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,480
into alchemy right and that he spent a

295
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,399
lot of time

296
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,079
thinking about that and writing about it

297
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,720
and he took it very seriously he was

298
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,399
really into bible interpretation and

299
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,560
trying to predict things based on the

300
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,240
bible and so there's also a whole

301
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,958
backstory then and of course you need to

302
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,879
look at it in the context that and the

303
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,639
time that when newton lived um but a but

304
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,320
it adds to his personality and it's

305
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,759
important to also understand those

306
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,000
aspects then maybe

307
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,399
you know uh i'm not people people are

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,320
not as proud to teach to little kids

309
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,559
but it's important it was part of who he

310
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,640
was and and maybe without those he who

311
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,759
knows what he would have done otherwise

312
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,319
so

313
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,159
well the the cool thing about alchemy

314
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,440
i don't know how it was viewed at the

315
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,480
time

316
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,880
but it almost like to me symbolizes

317
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,360
dreaming of the impossible

318
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,958
like most of the breakthrough ideas kind

319
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,720
of seem impossible until they're

320
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,039
actually done it's like achieving human

321
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,680
flight it's not completely obvious to me

322
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,919
that alchemy is impossible or like

323
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,120
putting myself in the mindset of the

324
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,199
time

325
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,600
and perhaps even still

326
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,879
every everything that uh

327
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,639
you know some of the most incredible

328
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,559
breakthroughs are

329
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,159
would seem impossible

330
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,359
and i wonder the value of

331
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,838
believing

332
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,720
almost like focusing and dreaming of the

333
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,839
impossible such that it is actually is

334
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,399
possible in your mind and that in itself

335
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,519
manifests

336
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,278
whether the accomplishing that goal or

337
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,519
making progress in some unexpected

338
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,559
direction so alchemy almost symbolizes

339
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,919
that for me i distinctly remember having

340
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,919
the same thought of thinking you know

341
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,599
when i learned about atoms and that they

342
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,519
have protons and electrons i was like

343
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
okay to make gold you just take whatever

344
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,039
has an atomic weight below it and then

345
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,200
shove another proton in there and then

346
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,639
you have a bunch of gold so like why

347
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,320
don't people do that

348
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,320
it seemed like conceptually is like you

349
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,399
know this sounds feasible you might be

350
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,240
able to do it and you can actually it's

351
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,799
just very very expensive yeah yeah

352
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,560
exactly exactly so in a sense we do have

353
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,399
alchemy and

354
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,719
maybe even back then it wasn't as crazy

355
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,240
that he was so into it

356
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,600
but good people just don't like to talk

357
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,120
about that as much

358
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,399
yeah but newton in general is a very

359
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
interesting fellow

360
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,320
anybody else come to mind

361
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,638
in terms of

362
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,040
people that inspire you

363
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,519
in terms of people that you just

364
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,679
are happy that they have once or still

365
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,039
exist on this earth

366
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:15,359
i think i mean freeman dyson for me

367
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,519
yeah freeman dyson was was

368
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,120
i've had a chance to actually exchange a

369
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,480
couple of emails with him it was

370
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,320
probably one of the most humble

371
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,360
scientists that i've ever met and that

372
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,320
had a a big impact on me we were trying

373
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,519
we're actually trying to convince him to

374
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,879
annotate a paper on fermat's library

375
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,039
and i sent him an email asking him

376
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,519
if you could annotate a paper and his

377
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,838
response was something like i have very

378
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,519
limited knowledge i just know a couple

379
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,160
of things about certain fields i'm not

380
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,399
sure if i'm qualified to do that that

381
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,159
was his first response and

382
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,078
and this was someone that should have

383
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,399
won an opera fry's and worked on a bunch

384
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,359
of different fields um did some really

385
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,799
really

386
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,320
great work

387
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,399
and then just the interactions that i

388
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,959
had with him every time i asked him a

389
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,600
couple of questions about his papers and

390
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,838
uh he always responded saying i'm not

391
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,399
here to answer your questions i just

392
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:13,760
want to open it more questions

393
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,799
um and uh so that had a big impact on me

394
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,000
it was like just

395
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,039
an example of an extremely humble

396
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,320
yet

397
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,000
accomplished

398
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,680
uh scientist and feynman was also a big

399
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,958
big inspiration in the sense that he was

400
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,359
able to be

401
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,278
you know again extremely talented and

402
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,919
and scientists but at the same time

403
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:36,480
socially he was able to to he was also

404
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,159
really smart from a social perspective

405
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,240
and he was able to

406
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,679
interact with people it was also a

407
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,720
really good

408
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:46,958
teacher and was also to did a awesome

409
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,680
work in terms of um

410
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,359
explaining physics to to the masses and

411
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,479
motivating and getting people interested

412
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,159
in physics

413
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,759
and that for me was was also a big

414
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,600
inspiration

415
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,879
yeah i like the childlike curiosity of

416
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,278
some of those folks like you mentioned

417
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,278
freeman i have daniel kahneman i got a

418
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,120
chance to meet and interact with

419
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,399
some some of these truly special

420
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,560
scientists

421
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,399
what makes them special is that even in

422
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,518
uh older age

423
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,679
they're still

424
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,919
like there's still that fire of

425
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,559
childlike curiosity that burns

426
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,159
and uh some of that is like not taking

427
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,838
yourself so seriously that you think

428
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,159
you've figured it all out

429
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,680
but almost like thinking that you don't

430
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,480
know much of it

431
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,239
and

432
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,360
that's like step one in having a great

433
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,440
conversation or collaboration or

434
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,839
exploring a scientific question it's

435
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,399
cool how the very thing that probably

436
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,759
earned people the nobel prize or

437
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,320
or work that's seminal in some way

438
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,440
is the very thing that still burns even

439
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,839
after

440
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,759
uh they've won the prize it's cool to

441
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,759
see and they're rare humans

442
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,360
it seems and to that point i remember

443
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,120
like the last email that i sent to

444
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,360
freeman dyson was like in his last

445
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,000
birthday he was really into number

446
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,639
theory and primes so what i did is i

447
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,039
took like a photo of him a picture and

448
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,959
then i turned that into like

449
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,120
a giant prime number

450
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,958
so i converted the picture into a bunch

451
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,360
of one and eight and then i moved some

452
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,359
numbers around until it was a prime

453
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,600
um and then i sent him that

454
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,278
also the the visual like it still looked

455
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
like the picture it's made up of a

456
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,159
problem that's tricky to do it's hard to

457
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,159
do it looks harder than it actually is

458
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,559
so the the way you do it is like you

459
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,039
convert the darker regions into eights

460
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:37,119
and the lighter regions in ones

461
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:39,039
and then there's just keep flipping yeah

462
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,120
but there's like some primality tests

463
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:44,000
that are cheaper from a computational

464
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,240
standpoint yes but what it tells you is

465
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,839
it excludes numbers that are not prime

466
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
then you end up with a set of numbers

467
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,079
that you don't know if they are prime or

468
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
not and then you run the full primality

469
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,838
test on that so you just have to keep

470
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,120
iterating on that and it was it was it's

471
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,720
it's funny because when he got the

472
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,120
picture he was like how did you do that

473
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,278
it was super curious too and then we got

474
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,480
into the details and again this was he

475
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:10,000
was already 90 i think 92 or something

476
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,400
and that curiosity was still there um

477
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,160
so you could really see that in in some

478
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,038
of these scientists

479
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,120
so could we talk about vermont's library

480
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,000
yeah absolutely what

481
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,719
is it

482
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,279
what's the main goal what's the dream

483
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,519
it is a platform for annotating papers

484
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,839
in its essence right and so academic

485
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:33,038
papers can be one of the densest forms

486
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:36,480
of content out there and generally

487
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:38,000
pretty hard to understand at times and

488
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
the idea is that you can make them more

489
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,558
accessible and easier to understand by

490
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,558
adding these rich annotations to the

491
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,319
site right and so we can just imagine a

492
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,759
pdf view on your browser and then you

493
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,839
have annotations on each side and then

494
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,519
when you click on them a sidebar expands

495
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,119
and then you have

496
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,240
annotations that support latex and

497
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,759
markdown

498
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,640
and so the idea is that you can

499
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,160
say explain a tougher part of a paper

500
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,679
where there's a step that is not

501
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,640
completely obvious

502
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,200
or you can add more context to it

503
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,480
and then over time papers can become

504
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,720
easier and

505
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,599
easier to understand and can evolve in a

506
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,519
way but it really came from

507
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,319
myself luige and two other friends we've

508
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,639
been

509
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,399
we've had this this long-running habit

510
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,000
of kind of running a journal club

511
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,919
amongst us we come from different

512
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,079
backgrounds right i studied cs we

513
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,280
studied physics and so we read papers

514
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,439
and present them to each other and uh

515
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:34,558
and then we tried to bring some of that

516
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,360
online and that's that's that's when we

517
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,160
decided to to to build fermat's library

518
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,839
um

519
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,840
then over time it kind of

520
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:46,159
grew into into something uh with with a

521
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,839
broader goal uh

522
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,120
and really what we're trying to do is

523
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,119
trying to help

524
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,319
uh move science in the in the the right

525
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,239
direction

526
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,399
that's really the ultimate goal and and

527
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,558
where we want to take it now so there's

528
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,038
a lot to be said so first of all for

529
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,119
people who haven't seen it

530
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,960
the interface is exceptionally well done

531
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,879
that's like execution is really

532
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,798
important here absolutely the other

533
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,679
things just to mention

534
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:11,519
for

535
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,080
a large number of people apparently

536
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,359
which is new to me don't know what latex

537
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,319
is

538
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,479
so it's spelled like latex so be careful

539
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,159
googling it if you haven't before

540
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,960
uh it's uh

541
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,000
uh

542
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,519
sorry i don't even know the correct

543
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,359
terminology type setting it's a

544
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,319
typesetting language

545
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,959
where it's you're basically program

546
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,879
writing a program that then generates

547
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,120
something that looks

548
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,000
from a typography perspective beautiful

549
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,879
absolutely and uh so a lot of academics

550
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,960
use it to write papers i i think there's

551
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,039
like a bunch of communities that use it

552
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,160
to write papers i would say it's

553
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:52,879
mathematics physics computer science

554
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,038
yeah that's yeah that's the because i'm

555
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,520
collaborating currently on a paper with

556
00:19:55,038 --> 00:20:00,160
uh two neuroscientists from stanford and

557
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:04,319
they don't know what

558
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,000
so i'm using uh microsoft word and uh

559
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,678
mendeley

560
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,558
and like all of those kinds of things

561
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,200
and it's

562
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,759
and i'm being very zen like about about

563
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,319
the whole process but it's fascinating

564
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,079
it's a little heartbreaking actually

565
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,960
because uh

566
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,879
it actually it's it's funny to say but

567
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,240
uh and we'll talk about open science

568
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,679
actually the bigger mission behind for

569
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,759
mars libraries like

570
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,360
really opening up the world of science

571
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,440
to everybody

572
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,639
is these silly

573
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,600
two facts of like one community uses

574
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,640
latex and another uses word

575
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,399
is actually a barrier between them

576
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,240
that's like it's like boring and

577
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,240
practical in a sense but it makes it

578
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,159
very difficult to collaborate

579
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,679
just on that like i think there if there

580
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,520
are some people that should have

581
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,120
received like a nobel prize that but

582
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,599
we'll never get it and i think one of

583
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,759
those is like donald knuth because of

584
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,839
tech and latex and then

585
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,119
because it had a huge impact in terms of

586
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,599
like just

587
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,678
making it easier for uh researchers to

588
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,918
put their content out there like making

589
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,400
it uniform as much as possible oh you

590
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,960
mean like a nobel peace prize well maybe

591
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,600
maybe a couple of peace prizes

592
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,400
maybe a nobel peace prize yeah

593
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,639
i

594
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,559
i think so i mean he at a very young age

595
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,240
got the touring award for his work in

596
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,240
algorithms and so on so yeah like an

597
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,120
incredible yeah like when i i think it's

598
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,558
in

599
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,719
it might be even the 60s but i think

600
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,798
it's the 70s that so when he was really

601
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,319
young and then he went on to do like

602
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,440
incredible work

603
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,279
with his book and uh yeah with tech that

604
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,240
people don't know and and going back

605
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,918
just one

606
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,759
on the reason why we we ended up because

607
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,520
i think this is interesting the reason

608
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,558
why we ended up using the name for mars

609
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,720
library this was because of uh vermont's

610
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,720
last theorem and from us livestream is

611
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,400
actually a funny story like so pierre de

612
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,480
fermat he was like a lawyer and he

613
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,720
wrote like on a book

614
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,159
that he had a solution to fermat's last

615
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,558
theorem which um but that didn't fit the

616
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,559
margin of that book

617
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,038
and so fermat's lie stream basically

618
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,158
states that there's no solution if you

619
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,480
have uh

620
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,480
integers a b and c there's no solution

621
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,038
to a to the power of n plus b to the

622
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,759
power of n equals to c to the power of

623
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,400
n

624
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,720
if n is bigger than two so there's

625
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,159
there's there's no solutions and

626
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,960
he said that

627
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,840
and

628
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,558
that problem remained open for almost

629
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,399
300 years i believe and a lot of the

630
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,240
most famous mathematicians tried to

631
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,120
tackle that problem no one was able to

632
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,919
figure that that out until andrea wiles

633
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,678
uh i think was in in the 90s was able to

634
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,080
publish the solution which was i i

635
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,480
believe almost 300 pages long

636
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:50,000
and so it's kind of an anecdote that you

637
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,159
know there's a lot of of knowledge and

638
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,159
insights that can be trapped

639
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,760
in the margins then you and there's a

640
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,039
lot of potential energy that you can

641
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:01,119
release if you actually um spend some

642
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,359
time trying to digest

643
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,639
that and that was the the the origin

644
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,240
story for

645
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,400
for the name yes you can share the

646
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,519
contents of the margins with the world

647
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,038
exactly that could inspire a solution or

648
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,279
a communication that then leads to a

649
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,679
solution but and and if you think about

650
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,960
papers like papers are as as jean was

651
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,880
saying probably one of the densest

652
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,400
pieces of text that

653
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
any human can read and you have these

654
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,440
researchers like some of the brightest

655
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,280
minds in in these fields working on like

656
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,679
new discoveries and publishing these

657
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,279
work on journals that are imposing them

658
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,759
restrictions in terms of the number of

659
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,158
pages that they can have to explain a

660
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:41,359
new scientific breakthrough so at the

661
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,960
end of the day papers are not optimized

662
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,798
for clarity and for a proper explanation

663
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,440
of of that content because there are so

664
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,798
many restrictions so there's as i

665
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,759
mentioned there's a lot of potential

666
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:56,639
energy that can be freed if you actually

667
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,599
try to digest a lot of the contents of

668
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,360
papers

669
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,879
can you explain some of the other things

670
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,639
so margins librarian journal club

671
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,039
so journal club is what a lot of people

672
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,440
know us for uh where we every week we

673
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,960
release an annotated paper and in all

674
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,480
sorts of different fields with physics

675
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,558
cs math

676
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,319
margins is kind of the same software

677
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,639
that we use to to run the journal club

678
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,119
and to host the annotations but we've

679
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,840
made that available for free to anybody

680
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:26,319
that wants to use it and so

681
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,278
folks use it at universities and

682
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,200
and

683
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,798
for running journal clubs

684
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,440
and and so we just made that freely

685
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,119
available and then librarian is a

686
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,679
browser extension that we developed that

687
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:40,079
is sort of an overlay on top of archive

688
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,798
so it's about bringing some of the same

689
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,960
functionality around comments plus

690
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,440
adding some extra

691
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,919
niceties to to archive like being able

692
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,600
to very easily extract the references of

693
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,520
a paper that you're looking at or being

694
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,678
able to extract the bibtex in order to

695
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,440
cite that paper yourself

696
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,720
so it's an overlay on top of archive the

697
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,960
idea is that you can have that

698
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,278
commenting interface without having to

699
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,798
leave archive it's kind of incredible i

700
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,200
didn't know about it

701
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,918
and once i've learned of it

702
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,159
it's like holy [ __ ]

703
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,080
why isn't it more popular given how

704
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,679
popular archive is like everybody should

705
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,678
be using it archive sucks

706
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,519
or uh let me rephrase that it's limited

707
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,319
yeah in terms of what's interesting

708
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,519
archive is a pretty incredible project

709
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:30,000
right and it is in in a way it's

710
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:32,240
it you know it the growth has been

711
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,759
completely linear over time if you look

712
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,440
at like number of papers published on

713
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,879
archive like you know it's just been

714
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,440
it's pretty much a straight line for the

715
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,278
past 20 years especially for you know

716
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
like if you're coming from a startup

717
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,038
background and then you were trying to

718
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,679
do archive you'd probably try like all

719
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,240
sorts of growth acts and like try to

720
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,759
to then maybe like have paid features

721
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,400
and things like that and that would kind

722
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,480
of maybe ruin it and so there's

723
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,640
there's a subtle balance there yeah and

724
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,120
i don't know what what aspects you can

725
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,200
change about it and yeah for some tools

726
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,079
in science it just takes time for them

727
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,840
to to grow archive is just turned 30 i

728
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,439
believe yeah and for for people that

729
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,558
don't know archive is these kind of

730
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,400
online repository where people put

731
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,399
preprints which are versions of the

732
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,840
papers before they actually make it to

733
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,519
journals

734
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,519
a-r-x-i-v exactly for people who don't

735
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,400
know and it's actually a really vibrant

736
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,158
place to publish your papers in in the

737
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,159
aforementioned

738
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,679
uh communities of mathematics exactly in

739
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,679
computer science it started with

740
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,400
mathematics and physics and then over

741
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,080
the the last 30 years it evolved and now

742
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,320
actually computer computer science now

743
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,319
it's it's a more popular category than

744
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,399
than physics and math on archive and

745
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,839
there's also which i don't know very

746
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,080
much about like a

747
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,720
biology medical version of that bio

748
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,798
archive yeah by archive um it's recent

749
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,679
it's um it's interesting because if you

750
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,519
look at like these um platforms for

751
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,278
preprints they are

752
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,400
they actually play a super important

753
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,839
role because

754
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,720
if you look at a category like math

755
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,038
for some papers in math it might take

756
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,440
close to three years

757
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:13,200
after you click upload paper on the

758
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,519
journal website and the paper gets

759
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,159
published on the website of the journal

760
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,398
so this is literally the longest

761
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,440
upload period on the internet

762
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:25,278
um and during those three years like

763
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,000
it's it's you know

764
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,919
their content is just you know locked

765
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,159
and so this that's why it's so important

766
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,159
for people to have websites like archive

767
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,919
so that you can share that before it

768
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,000
goes to the journal with the rest of the

769
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,640
world there was actually on archive that

770
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,159
uh perumann published the the three

771
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,720
pipers that led to the proof of the

772
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,640
poincare conject conjecture and then you

773
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,720
have other fields like

774
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,880
machine learning for instance where the

775
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,278
the field is evolving at such a high

776
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,200
rate that people don't even wait before

777
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,200
the papers go to journals before they

778
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,960
start working on top of those papers so

779
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,399
they publish them on archive then other

780
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,200
people see them they start working on

781
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,439
that and archive did a really good job

782
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,519
at like building that core platform to

783
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,679
host papers but i i think there's a

784
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,359
really really big opportunity in

785
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,440
building more features on top of that

786
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,479
platform apart from just hosting paper

787
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,480
so collaboration annotations and

788
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,640
like having other things apart from from

789
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,599
papers like code um

790
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,440
and and other things because uh in the

791
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,359
field like machine learning there's a

792
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,960
really big you know as i mentioned

793
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,959
people start working on on top of

794
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,000
preprints and they are assuming that

795
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,840
that

796
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,839
that preprint is correct

797
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,359
but you really need a way for instance

798
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,199
to maybe

799
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,519
it's not peer review but

800
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,159
distinguish what is good work from bad

801
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,839
work on archive how do you do that so

802
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,760
like a commenting interface like

803
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,798
librarian it's useful for that so that

804
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,398
you can distinguish that um at

805
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,480
in the field that is growing so fast as

806
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,359
machine learning and um and then you

807
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,038
have

808
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,038
platforms that focus for instance on

809
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,200
just biology bioarchive is a good

810
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,038
example um

811
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,679
bioarchive is also super interesting

812
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:08,480
because there there's actually

813
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:12,480
an interesting experiment that was run

814
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,720
in the 60s so in the 60s the nih um

815
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,399
supported this pro this

816
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,000
this experiment called the information

817
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,319
exchange group

818
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,359
which at the time was a way for

819
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:26,319
researchers to share biology preprints

820
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:28,879
via mail or using libraries and that

821
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:31,359
project in the 1960s got cancelled six

822
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,679
years after it started and it was due to

823
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,759
intense pressure from the journals to

824
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,519
kill that project because they they were

825
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,319
fearing a competition from from the

826
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,918
uh

827
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:46,240
for in for the journal industry creek uh

828
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,919
was also uh was one of the famous

829
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,960
scientists that opposed

830
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,720
to to the uh information exchange group

831
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,399
and it's interesting because right now

832
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,000
if you analyze the number of biology

833
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,558
papers that

834
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,398
appear first as preprints it's only two

835
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:03,038
percent of the papers

836
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,798
and it this was almost 50 almost 50

837
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,558
years after that first experiment so you

838
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,798
can see like that pressure from the

839
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,200
journals to cancel that uh initial

840
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,558
version of a pre-print repo had a

841
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,480
tremendous impact on on on the number of

842
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:19,359
papers that are showing up in biology as

843
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,679
preprints so it delayed a lot that

844
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,079
that revolution and um

845
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,080
but now platforms like bioarchive are

846
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,918
doing that work but there's still a lot

847
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,119
of room for growth there and i think

848
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,559
it's super important because those are

849
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,839
the papers that are open that everyone

850
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:33,678
can read

851
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,599
okay so but if we just look at the

852
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,919
entire process of science as a big

853
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:40,000
system can we just talk about how it can

854
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,960
be revolutionized

855
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,720
so

856
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,200
you have an idea

857
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,120
uh depending on the field you want to

858
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,038
make that idea concrete you want to run

859
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,119
a few experiments in computer science

860
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,200
there might be some code

861
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,678
there'd be a data set

862
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,278
for you know some of the more sort of

863
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,278
biology

864
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:01,759
psychology

865
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:05,440
you might be collecting the data set

866
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,119
that's called you know a study right

867
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,759
so that's part of that that's part of

868
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,639
the methodology and so you are putting

869
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,000
all that into a paper form

870
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,759
and then

871
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
you have some results

872
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,200
and then you you submit that to a place

873
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,679
for

874
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,080
review through the peer review process

875
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,679
and there's a process where how would

876
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,240
you summarize the peer review process

877
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,840
but it's it's really just like a handful

878
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,399
of people look over your paper and

879
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:34,480
comment and based on that decide whether

880
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:37,359
your paper is good or not

881
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,440
so there's a whole broken nature to it

882
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:42,479
at the same time i love the peer review

883
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,880
process when i buy stuff on amazon

884
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,798
like uh

885
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,799
for like uh the commenting system

886
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,480
whatever that is so okay so there's a

887
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,558
bunch of possibilities for revolutions

888
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,640
there and then there's the other side

889
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,639
which is the collaborative aspect of the

890
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,919
science which is people annotating

891
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,240
people commenting sort of the low effort

892
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,840
collaboration which is a comment

893
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,240
sometimes as you've talked about a

894
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:09,038
comment can change everything but you

895
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,679
know or a higher effort collaboration

896
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,359
like more like maybe annotations or even

897
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,120
like contributing to the paper you can

898
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,918
think of like

899
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,959
a

900
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,080
collaborative updating of the paper over

901
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,960
time

902
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,319
so there's all these possibilities for

903
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,038
doing things

904
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,639
better than they've been done

905
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,038
can we talk about some ideas in this

906
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,200
space some ideas that you're working on

907
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:35,119
some ideas that uh you're not yet

908
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,120
working on but should be revolutionized

909
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,639
because it does seem

910
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,759
that archive and like open review for

911
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,360
example

912
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,319
are like the craigslist of science like

913
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,359
like

914
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,519
yeah okay i'm very grateful that we have

915
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,398
it but it just feels like

916
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,919
it's like 10 to 20 years like it doesn't

917
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,079
feel like that's a feature the

918
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,810
simplicity of it is a feature it feels

919
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,038
like it's a it's a bug

920
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:03,519
[Music]

921
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:06,319
but then again the the pushback there is

922
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,319
uh wikipedia has the same kind of

923
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:12,079
simplicity to it

924
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:14,000
and it seems to work exceptionally well

925
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:15,519
in the crowdsourcing aspect of it i'm

926
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
sorry this there's a bunch of stuff

927
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,159
going on on the table let's just pick

928
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,919
random things that we can talk about

929
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,000
wikipedia you know for me it's the

930
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,919
cosmological constant of the internet

931
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
it's like i think we are lucky to live

932
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,240
in the parallel universe where wikipedia

933
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,159
exists yes because if if someone had

934
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,839
pitched me wikipedia like a publicly

935
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,320
edited

936
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,319
encyclopedia like a couple of years ago

937
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,839
like it would be i don't know how many

938
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,639
people would have said that that would

939
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:41,918
have

940
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,679
survived

941
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,960
yeah i mean it makes almost no sense

942
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,559
it's like having a google doc that

943
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,798
everybody on the internet can edit and

944
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,119
like that will be like the most reliable

945
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:53,440
source for for knowledge and i don't

946
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,239
know how many but hundreds of thousands

947
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,919
of topics yeah exactly

948
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,679
it's insane it's insane and like you

949
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,080
have and then you have users like

950
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,480
there's one a single user that edited

951
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,558
one third of the articles on wikipedia

952
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,760
so you have these really really big

953
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:12,480
power users there are a substantial part

954
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,480
of like what makes wikipedia

955
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,519
successful and so

956
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,000
like

957
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,358
no one would have ever imagined that

958
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,918
that could happen

959
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,440
um and so that that's that's one thing i

960
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,918
i completely agree with what you just

961
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,679
said i also started to interrupt briefly

962
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,000
maybe let's inject that into the

963
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,838
discussion of everything else

964
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,800
i also believe i've seen that with stack

965
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:37,440
overflow that one individual or a small

966
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,800
collection of individuals contribute or

967
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,519
revolutionize

968
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,480
most of the community like if you create

969
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:46,480
a really powerful system for archive

970
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,599
or like open review it made it really

971
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,838
easy

972
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:53,039
and compelling

973
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:56,480
and exciting for one person who isn't

974
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:58,000
like a 10x contributor to do their thing

975
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,599
that's going to change everything it

976
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,358
seems like that was the mechanism that

977
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,720
changed everything for wikipedia and

978
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,279
that's the mechanism that changed

979
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:07,279
everything for stack overflow is

980
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,839
gamifying or making it exciting or just

981
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,079
making it fun or pleasant or fulfilling

982
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,440
in some way for those people who are

983
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,920
insane

984
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,000
enough to like answer thousands of

985
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,720
questions or

986
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,239
write thousands of factoids and like

987
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,078
research them and check them all those

988
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,199
kinds of things or read thousands of

989
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,599
papers yeah no stack overflow is another

990
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:32,000
great example of that and it's just

991
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,320
and and those are both to

992
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,960
incredibly productive communities that

993
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,480
generate a ton of value and and and

994
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,119
capture almost none of it right and it's

995
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,199
and you know in a way it's almost like

996
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,280
counter um

997
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,838
it's very counter-intuitive that that

998
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,320
that people that these communities would

999
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,960
exist and thrive um

1000
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,359
and and it's really hard to

1001
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,280
you there aren't that many communities

1002
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,920
like that so how do we do that for

1003
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,359
science do you have ideas there like

1004
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,519
what are the biggest problems that you

1005
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:06,880
see you're working on some of them

1006
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,239
like just on that there are a couple of

1007
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,240
really interesting experiments that

1008
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:13,598
people are running an example would be

1009
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:16,159
like the polymath projects so this is a

1010
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,079
so kind of a social experiment that was

1011
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,879
uh created by tim gowers

1012
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,440
fields fields medalist and his idea was

1013
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,358
to try to prove that is it possible to

1014
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,000
do mathematics in a massively

1015
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:30,078
collaborative collaborative way on the

1016
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,920
internet so we decided to pick a couple

1017
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,039
of problems and

1018
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,119
test that and they found out that it it

1019
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,719
actually it is possible for a specific

1020
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,320
types of problems

1021
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:42,639
namely problems that you're able to

1022
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,960
break down in in little pieces and go

1023
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,199
step by step you might need as as with

1024
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,320
open source you might need people that

1025
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:52,719
are just kind of reorganizing the the

1026
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,480
house every once in a while and then you

1027
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,159
know people throw a bunch of ideas and

1028
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,838
then you know you make some progress

1029
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,319
then you reorganize you reframe the

1030
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,480
problem you go step by step but they

1031
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,920
were actually able to prove that it is

1032
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,719
possible to to

1033
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,920
uh collaborate online and and

1034
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:12,000
do progress in terms of mathematics um

1035
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,760
and so i'm i'm confident that there are

1036
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,920
other avenues that could be explored

1037
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,800
here can we talk about peer review for

1038
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,960
example absolutely i i think like in in

1039
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,359
terms of the peer review i think we it's

1040
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,199
it's important to look at the bigger

1041
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:28,239
picture here of like

1042
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:30,960
of what this scientific the scientific

1043
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,919
publishing ecosystem looks like because

1044
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,679
for me

1045
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,400
there there are a lot of things that are

1046
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:38,559
wrong about that entire process so

1047
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,039
if you look at for instance at the what

1048
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:44,320
publishing means in like a traditional

1049
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:45,599
journal you have uh journals that pay um

1050
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,240
authors

1051
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,920
for their articles and then they might

1052
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:53,919
pay like reviewers to um review those

1053
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,480
articles and finally they pay

1054
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,159
people to um or distributors to

1055
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,880
distribute the content

1056
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:03,118
in in the scientific publishing world

1057
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,800
you have scientists that are usually

1058
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,640
backed by government grants they are

1059
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,000
giving away their work for free in the

1060
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:10,159
form of papers

1061
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,719
and then you have other scientists that

1062
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,480
are reviewing their work

1063
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,559
this process is known as the peer review

1064
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,960
process again for free

1065
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:22,480
and then finally we have um

1066
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,960
government-backed universities and

1067
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,000
libraries that are buying back

1068
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,159
all those

1069
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,639
all that work so that other scientists

1070
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,239
can we can read so this is for me it's

1071
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,159
bizarre you have the government that is

1072
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:35,838
funding the research is paying the

1073
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:37,598
salaries of the scientists it's paying

1074
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,159
the salaries of the reviewers and it's

1075
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,838
buying back all that uh the product of

1076
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,838
their work again

1077
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:45,759
um and i think the problem with this

1078
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,239
system and it's what it's why it's so

1079
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,680
difficult to to break this

1080
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:54,159
suboptimal equilibrium is because of of

1081
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:57,118
the way academia works right now and the

1082
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,000
way you can progress in in your academic

1083
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,440
life

1084
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,519
and and so

1085
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,480
in a lot of fields the the competition

1086
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:06,639
in academia is is really insane

1087
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,760
so you have hundreds of phd students

1088
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:13,199
there are um trying to get to

1089
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,520
a professor position and and it's hyper

1090
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,719
competitive and the only way for you to

1091
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,639
get there

1092
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,719
is if you publish papers ideally in

1093
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,719
journals with a

1094
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,799
high impact factor in computer science

1095
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,239
it's all it's often conferences are also

1096
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,079
very prestigious or actually more

1097
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:31,759
prestigious than journals now

1098
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,680
so interesting so that's the one

1099
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,680
discipline where i mean that has to do

1100
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:38,159
with the thing we've discussed uh in

1101
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:42,159
terms of the how quickly the field turns

1102
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:44,799
around but like uh in eurips cvpr those

1103
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,559
conferences are more prestigious or at

1104
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,920
the very least as prestigious as the

1105
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,519
journal

1106
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,159
but doesn't matter the process is what

1107
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,679
it is and and and so with the the so for

1108
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,358
people that don't know how the impact

1109
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,519
factor of a journal is basically the

1110
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,598
average number of citations that a paper

1111
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,800
would get if it gets published on that

1112
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,880
journal

1113
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,599
but so um you can really think that

1114
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,480
the problem with the the impact factor

1115
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,720
is that it's a way to turn papers into

1116
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,440
accounting units

1117
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:17,439
and and and let me unpack this because

1118
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,240
it's the impact factor is almost like a

1119
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,800
nobility title so because papers are

1120
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:25,039
born with impact even before anyone

1121
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,480
reads them so the researchers they don't

1122
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,719
have the incentive

1123
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,519
to care about if this paper is going to

1124
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:34,000
ever a long-term impact on on on the

1125
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,838
world what they care their goal their

1126
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,039
end goal is the paper to get published

1127
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,639
yes so that they get that value up front

1128
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,800
and so for me that that is one of the

1129
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:45,759
problems of of that and that really

1130
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,200
creates a tyranny of of metrics

1131
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,359
because at the end of the day if you are

1132
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,159
a dean what you want to hire is like

1133
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:54,239
people researchers that publish papers

1134
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:56,318
on journals with high impact factors

1135
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,078
because that will increase the ranking

1136
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,719
of your university and will allow you to

1137
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,400
charge more for tuition so on and so

1138
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:05,759
forth and um and and that that

1139
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,318
especially when you are in super

1140
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,319
competitive areas you know that people

1141
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:13,279
will try to gamify that system and and

1142
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,599
misconduct starts showing up

1143
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,119
um there's a a really interesting book

1144
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,599
on this topic called gaming the metrics

1145
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,480
it's a book by a researcher called mario

1146
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,599
biagioli it goes a lot into like how

1147
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,838
these

1148
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,160
the impact factor and metrics affect

1149
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,358
science negatively and it's interesting

1150
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,159
to think especially in terms of

1151
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:36,559
citations if you look at the early work

1152
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,000
of like looking at citations there was a

1153
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,960
lot of work that was done by a guy

1154
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,559
called eugene garfield and this guy

1155
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,920
the early work in terms of citation they

1156
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:45,519
wanted to use they wanted to use

1157
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,000
citations as

1158
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,800
from a descriptive point of view so what

1159
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,960
they wanted to to create was a map

1160
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,519
and and that map would create a visual

1161
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,440
representation of of influence so

1162
00:41:55,519 --> 00:42:00,000
citations would be links

1163
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,240
between papers and the ideally what they

1164
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,719
would show they would represent is that

1165
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,719
you read someone else's paper and it had

1166
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,879
an impact on your research they weren't

1167
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,358
supposed to be counted i think this

1168
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,680
inspired like larry and sergey's exactly

1169
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:14,960
worked right for google exactly i think

1170
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:16,719
they even mentioned that but what

1171
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,519
happens is like as you start counting

1172
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:21,759
citations you create a market

1173
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:24,000
and and the same way like and this was

1174
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,079
the the work of eugene garfield was a

1175
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,039
big inspiration for larry and sergey for

1176
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,200
the pagerank algorithm that um you know

1177
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,358
led to the creation of google and they

1178
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,598
even recognize that and and if you think

1179
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,000
about it's like the same way there's a

1180
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,039
gigantic market for search engine

1181
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,599
optimization uh seo where people try to

1182
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:46,559
optimize you know the the page rank and

1183
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:49,039
how i the uh of a web page will rank on

1184
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,880
google the same will happen for papers

1185
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,039
people will try to optimize like their

1186
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,760
site their the impact factors and the

1187
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,159
citations that they get and that um

1188
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,400
creates a really big problem and if it's

1189
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,719
super interesting to actually analyze

1190
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,559
them if you look at the distribution of

1191
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:07,519
the high impact the impact factors of

1192
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,960
journals you have like nature with

1193
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,599
nature i believe it's like in the low

1194
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,838
40s and then you have i believe science

1195
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,119
is high 30s and then you have a really

1196
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,759
goo

1197
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,480
a good set of good journals that

1198
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,880
will

1199
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,599
fall between 10 and 30 and then you have

1200
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,480
a gigantic tale of of journals that have

1201
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,119
impact factor below two and you can

1202
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,480
really see two economies here you see

1203
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,960
the the

1204
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,079
you know the universities that are maybe

1205
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,480
less prestigious less known that where

1206
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,560
the faculty are pressured to just

1207
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,159
publish papers regardless of the journal

1208
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,799
what i want to do is increase the

1209
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,960
ranking of my university and so they end

1210
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,880
up publishing as many papers as as they

1211
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,920
they can in like journals with low

1212
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,440
impact factor and unfortunately this is

1213
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,920
represents a lot of of the global south

1214
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,440
and then you have the luxury good

1215
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,680
economy

1216
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,358
so for instance for and there are also

1217
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:04,719
problems here in the luxury good economy

1218
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:05,598
so if you look at the journal like

1219
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,159
nature

1220
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,599
so with impact factor of like in the low

1221
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,598
40s

1222
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,079
there's no way that you're going to be

1223
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,640
able to sustain that level of impact

1224
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,920
factor by just grabbing the attention of

1225
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:20,480
scientists

1226
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,880
what what i mean by that is like

1227
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,960
for for the journals the articles that

1228
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:29,280
get published in nature they need to be

1229
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,119
new york times great so they need to

1230
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,560
make it to the you know to the to the

1231
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,480
big media they need to be captured by

1232
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,000
the big media and because that's the

1233
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,800
only way for you to capture enough

1234
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,358
attention to sustain that level of

1235
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,240
citations yes and that of course creates

1236
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:46,639
problems because people then will try to

1237
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:49,598
again gamify the system and have like

1238
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:52,639
titles or abstracts or that are

1239
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:55,440
bigger claim make claims that are bigger

1240
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:57,440
than what is actually can be um

1241
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,440
you know sustained by by the data or the

1242
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,559
the content of the paper and you'll have

1243
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,280
clickbait titles or clickbait abstracts

1244
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:08,480
and again this is all a consequence of

1245
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,119
metrics and uh scientometrics and and

1246
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,440
this is a very dangerous cycle that i

1247
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,838
think it's very hard to break

1248
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,358
but it's happening in academia in a lot

1249
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,199
of fields right now

1250
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,119
is it fundamentally the existence of

1251
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,118
metrics or the metrics just need to be

1252
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,480
significantly improved

1253
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,280
because uh

1254
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,199
like i said the metrics used for amazon

1255
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,240
for purchasing

1256
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,639
i don't know

1257
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,159
computer parts it's pretty damn good in

1258
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:35,598
terms of selecting which are the good

1259
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:40,078
ones which are not

1260
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:42,240
in that same way if if we had an amazon

1261
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,318
type of review system in the space of

1262
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,679
ideas in the space of science it feels

1263
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:47,279
like that those metrics would be a

1264
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,919
little bit better

1265
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,920
sort of when it's um

1266
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,400
when it's significantly

1267
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,599
more open to the crowd source nature of

1268
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,079
the internet

1269
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,800
of the of the scientific internet

1270
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,400
meaning as opposed to like my biggest

1271
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,920
problem with peer review

1272
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,280
has always been

1273
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,519
that it's like

1274
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,640
five six seven people

1275
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:12,800
usually even less and it's often

1276
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:14,639
nobody's incentivized to do a good job

1277
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,760
in the whole process

1278
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:17,679
meaning

1279
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,280
it's anonymous

1280
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:22,239
in a way that

1281
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,920
doesn't incentivize like doesn't gamify

1282
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,598
or incentivize

1283
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,358
great work

1284
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,800
and also

1285
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,759
it doesn't necessarily have to be

1286
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,680
anonymous like there has to be um

1287
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,079
the entire system is um

1288
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:40,960
doesn't encourage actual sort of

1289
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,440
rigorous review for example like

1290
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,199
open review

1291
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,599
does kind of incentivize that kind of

1292
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:50,318
process of collaborative review but it's

1293
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:52,240
also imperfect it just feels like

1294
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:54,880
the thing that amazon has which is like

1295
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:57,838
thousands of people contributing their

1296
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,838
reviews to a product

1297
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,839
it feels like that could be applied to

1298
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,280
science

1299
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:04,559
where

1300
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,160
the same kind of thing you're doing with

1301
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:09,039
vermont's library

1302
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:11,838
but doing at a scale that's much larger

1303
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:14,000
it feels like that should be possible

1304
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:16,239
given the number of grad students

1305
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,079
given the number of um

1306
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,039
general public that get like for example

1307
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,280
i

1308
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,599
personally as a person

1309
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,079
who got an education in mathematics and

1310
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:29,359
computer science like

1311
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,720
uh i can i can be a quote-unquote like

1312
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:34,159
reviewer

1313
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:37,358
on a lot bigger set of things than than

1314
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:40,318
is my exact uh expertise

1315
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:43,199
if i'm one of thousands of reviewers if

1316
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:45,119
i'm the only reviewer or one of five

1317
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,679
then i'd better be like an expert in the

1318
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,160
thing but if if i uh and i've learned

1319
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:52,879
this with covet which is like

1320
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,519
you can just use your basic skills as a

1321
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,119
data analyst as a and to contribute to

1322
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,358
the review process and a particular

1323
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,559
little aspect of a paper and be able to

1324
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,480
comment be able to sort of uh

1325
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,720
draw in some references that challenge

1326
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,760
the ideas presented or to enrich the

1327
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:12,799
ideas that are presented or you know and

1328
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,520
it just feels like crowdsourcing

1329
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,680
the review process would be able to

1330
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:18,960
allow you to have

1331
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:20,960
metrics

1332
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,838
in terms of how good a paper is that are

1333
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,838
much better representative of its actual

1334
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:28,639
impact in the world of its actual value

1335
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:32,318
to the world as opposed to some kind of

1336
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:34,799
arbitrary gamified

1337
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:37,119
version of its impact

1338
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,720
i agree with that i i think we there's

1339
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,720
definitely the possibility at least for

1340
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:42,318
more resilient a more resilient system

1341
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:43,279
than what we have today and that's i

1342
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:45,599
think that's kind of what you're

1343
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,079
describing alex and and i mean to an

1344
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,519
extent we we kind of have like a little

1345
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,519
bit of a

1346
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,199
heisenberg uncertainty principle when

1347
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:55,039
you pick a metric as soon as you do it

1348
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,799
then maybe it works as a good heuristic

1349
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,960
for for a short amount of time but soon

1350
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,760
enough people would start gamifying and

1351
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,599
yeah

1352
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,440
but but then you can definitely have

1353
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,280
metrics that are more resilient to

1354
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,440
gamification and they'll work as a

1355
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,720
better heuristic to to try to push you

1356
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,639
in the in

1357
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,000
the best direction

1358
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,400
but i guess the underlying problem

1359
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,800
you're saying is uh there's a shortage

1360
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,280
of positions in academia that's a big

1361
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,359
problem for me yeah and and that and so

1362
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,040
they're going to be constantly gamifying

1363
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,558
the metrics it's a bit of a zero-sum

1364
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:26,880
it's very competitive it's what it's a

1365
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,599
very competitive field and and that's

1366
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,000
what usually happens in very competitive

1367
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,680
fields yeah yeah

1368
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
but i think some of like the peer review

1369
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,279
problems like scale helps i think and

1370
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,880
and it's interesting to look at like

1371
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,280
what you're mentioning breaking it down

1372
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,119
maybe in my smaller parts and having

1373
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,800
more people jumping in

1374
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,440
um but

1375
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,960
th this is definitely a problem and and

1376
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,679
the peer review problem as i mentioned

1377
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,679
is

1378
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,078
is correlated with the problem of like

1379
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:55,919
academic career progression and it's all

1380
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,400
intertwined and it's what that's why i

1381
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,720
think it's so hard to to break it

1382
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,240
um there are like a couple of really

1383
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,358
interesting things that are being done

1384
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:05,838
right now there are a couple of for

1385
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,598
instance journals that are overlaid

1386
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:10,719
journals on top of

1387
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,240
platforms like archive and bioarchive

1388
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:14,480
that want to remove like the more

1389
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,558
traditional journals from the equation

1390
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,159
so essentially a journal is just a

1391
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:22,319
collection of links to papers and and um

1392
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,719
and what they are trying to do is like

1393
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,239
removing that middleman and trying to to

1394
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,759
make the review process a little bit

1395
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:28,558
more transparent

1396
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,040
um

1397
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,720
and and and not charging universities

1398
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,800
like uh there's there's a couple of

1399
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,639
there are a couple of more famous um

1400
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,880
ones there's one discrete analysis in

1401
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:40,719
mathematics there's one uh called the

1402
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,720
quantum journal which we are actually

1403
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,399
working with them we have a partnership

1404
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,399
with them for the purpose that get

1405
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,800
published in quantum journal they also

1406
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,079
get the annotations on formats um and

1407
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,000
they are doing pretty well they've been

1408
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,760
able to grow substantially the problem

1409
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,838
there is getting to critical mass so

1410
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,599
it's again convincing the researchers

1411
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:58,880
and especially the young researchers

1412
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,119
that need

1413
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,519
need that impact factor need those

1414
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,680
publications to have citations to not

1415
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:08,318
publish on the traditional journal and

1416
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:10,239
go on an open journal and and publish

1417
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:12,239
their work there there i think there are

1418
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,000
a couple of really high-profile

1419
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,199
scientists of people like team gowers

1420
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,960
that are trying to

1421
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:18,480
incentivize like

1422
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,960
famous scientists that already have

1423
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,960
tenure and that don't need that to

1424
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,280
publish that to increase the reputation

1425
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,280
of those journals so that other maybe

1426
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,440
younger scientists can start publishing

1427
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,000
on on those as well and so they can try

1428
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:35,119
to break that vicious cycle of

1429
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,358
of um the more traditional journals i

1430
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,960
mean another possible way to break this

1431
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,598
cycle is to

1432
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,960
like raise public awareness and just by

1433
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,039
force like ban paid journals

1434
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,720
like what exactly are they contributing

1435
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,599
to the world

1436
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,838
like basically making it illegal

1437
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,200
to uh

1438
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:57,519
forget the fact that it's mostly

1439
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:59,358
federally funded so that's that's a

1440
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:02,559
super ugly picture too

1441
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:04,799
but like why should knowledge be

1442
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,640
so expensive

1443
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,318
like where everyone is working for the

1444
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,799
public good

1445
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,558
and then there's these gatekeepers

1446
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,000
that you know most people can't read

1447
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,839
most papers

1448
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,760
without having to pay money and

1449
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:22,318
that's that doesn't make any sense

1450
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,839
that's like that that should be illegal

1451
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:25,759
i mean that's what you're saying is

1452
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:27,679
exactly right i mean for instance right

1453
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,760
i i went to school here in the us we

1454
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:31,440
studied in europe and

1455
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,040
you would sit like you'd ask me all the

1456
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,480
time to download papers and send it to

1457
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:36,000
him because he just couldn't get it and

1458
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,480
like papers that he needed for his

1459
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,318
research and so but he's a student like

1460
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,159
he's yeah he's a grad student he was a

1461
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:43,759
grad student but that you know

1462
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:47,039
i'm even referring to just regular

1463
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,079
people oh yeah okay that too yeah and i

1464
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:52,318
i think uh during 2020

1465
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,519
because of covet a lot of journals put

1466
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:55,920
down the

1467
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:57,039
walls for certain kind of coronavirus or

1468
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,440
papers

1469
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,880
but like that just gave me an indication

1470
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,119
that like

1471
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,960
this should be done for everything it's

1472
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,079
it's absurd like people should be

1473
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,039
outraged that there's these gates

1474
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,640
because

1475
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:14,480
so the moment you dissolve the journals

1476
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,078
then there will be an opportunity for

1477
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,719
startups

1478
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:20,960
to uh build stuff on top of archive it'd

1479
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,519
be an opportunity for like

1480
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,599
vermont's library to step up to scale up

1481
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:28,159
to something much even larger i mean

1482
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,519
that was the original dream of uh

1483
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:31,358
google which i

1484
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:33,679
always admired which is make the world's

1485
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:35,838
information accessible actually it's

1486
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:38,000
interesting that google hasn't maybe you

1487
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,599
guys can correct me but they uh put

1488
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,800
together google scholar which is

1489
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,800
incredible

1490
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,440
but they and they've did the scanning of

1491
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,640
books but they've haven't really

1492
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,720
tried to make science accessible

1493
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,558
in the in the in the following way like

1494
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,399
besides doing google scholar they

1495
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,960
haven't like

1496
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:59,119
delved into the papers

1497
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,720
right mm-hmm which is especially curious

1498
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,640
given what louise was saying right that

1499
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,439
it's kind of in their genesis there's

1500
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,639
this

1501
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,720
you know research that was very

1502
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,799
connected with our papers reference each

1503
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:09,919
other and like building a network out of

1504
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,359
that

1505
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,280
interesting enough like google but i

1506
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:15,519
think there was a there was not intent

1507
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,440
google plus was like the google social

1508
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,519
network that got canceled was used by a

1509
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,679
lot of researchers yes it was uh whether

1510
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,599
i think was just a you know side kind of

1511
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,279
a side effect but then a lot of people

1512
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,039
ended up migrating to twitter but it was

1513
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,400
not on purpose but yeah i agree with you

1514
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,440
like they haven't

1515
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,039
um gone past the google scholar and well

1516
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,440
you know what that said google's call is

1517
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,838
incredible people who are not familiar

1518
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,760
it's one of the best

1519
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:41,358
aggregation of all the scientific work

1520
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,280
that's out there and especially the

1521
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,679
network that connects to all of them

1522
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,920
what sites what and also trying to

1523
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:49,759
aggregate all the versions of the papers

1524
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,519
that are available there and trying to

1525
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,280
merge them in a way that uh one

1526
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:55,759
particular work even though it's

1527
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,160
available in a bunch of places counts as

1528
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,799
you know like a central hub of what that

1529
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:03,519
work is across the multiple versions but

1530
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,119
that almost seems like a fun

1531
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:08,000
project of a couple of engineers within

1532
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:10,240
within google as opposed to a serious

1533
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,559
effort to make the world's science

1534
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:13,199
accessible but but going back to just

1535
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,640
the

1536
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,519
the journals when you're talking about

1537
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:20,078
that lex i i believe that

1538
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:22,960
in that front i think we might be past

1539
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:25,440
the event horizon so i think the

1540
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,960
the the model the business model for the

1541
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,639
journals you know doesn't make sense

1542
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,400
they are a middle layer that is not

1543
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:33,279
adding a lot of value and you see a lot

1544
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,400
of motions whereas like in europe a lot

1545
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,640
of the the

1546
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,960
papers that are get

1547
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:41,279
are funded by the european union they

1548
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,440
will have to be um uh

1549
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,920
open to the public and i think there's a

1550
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,079
lot of bill gates to like the the what

1551
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,798
the gates foundation funds like they

1552
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,720
they demand that it then it that it's uh

1553
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:54,318
accessible to everybody oh interesting

1554
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,959
so i think it's it's the question of

1555
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:58,719
time before that that wall kind of falls

1556
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,798
and and that is going to open a lot of

1557
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,759
possibilities um because you know

1558
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:06,079
imagine if if you had like the layer of

1559
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,520
like that gigantic layer of papers all

1560
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,400
available online

1561
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:12,480
um you know that unlocks a lot of

1562
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,318
potential as a platform for people to

1563
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,240
build things on top of that but i think

1564
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:17,759
it's what you're saying it is weird like

1565
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:21,039
you can literally

1566
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,160
go and listen to any song that was ever

1567
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,239
made

1568
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:26,078
on your phone right you open spotify and

1569
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:27,439
you might not even pay for it you might

1570
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,280
be on the free version and you can

1571
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,480
listen to any song that has ever made

1572
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,280
pretty much

1573
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,679
but

1574
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,359
there's like you you don't have access

1575
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:39,118
to a huge percentage of academic papers

1576
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,440
which is just like this fundamental

1577
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,358
knowledge that we're all funding but you

1578
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,200
as an individual don't have access to it

1579
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,440
and and somehow you know like the

1580
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,919
problem for music got solved

1581
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,838
uh but for papers it's still like it's

1582
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,440
just not yet it could be ad supported

1583
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,199
all those kinds of things and that

1584
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,039
hopefully that would change the way we

1585
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:58,399
do science that's the most exciting

1586
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,558
thing for me

1587
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,400
is uh especially once i started like

1588
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,720
making videos in this

1589
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,400
silly podcast thing i started to realize

1590
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:08,399
like

1591
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,760
that if you want to do science one of

1592
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,960
the most effective ways is to do uh like

1593
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,920
couple

1594
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,720
the paper with a set of youtube videos

1595
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,798
like explaining it like

1596
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,719
yeah that also seems like there's a lot

1597
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:25,519
of room for disruption there what is the

1598
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:28,000
paper 2.0 gonna look like i think like

1599
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,358
latex and the pdf

1600
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,798
seems like if you

1601
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,279
it's interesting if you look at the

1602
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:34,880
first paper that got published in nature

1603
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,720
and if you look at the paper that got

1604
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,559
published in nature today look at the

1605
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,519
two side by side they are fundamentally

1606
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,559
the same

1607
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:42,159
and

1608
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,240
even though like the paper that gets

1609
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,798
published today you know

1610
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:50,318
you get even even code like right now

1611
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:51,838
people put like code like on on a pdf

1612
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:53,519
like and

1613
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:55,599
there are so many things that are

1614
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:58,159
related to papers today you know you use

1615
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:00,160
you have data you have code um you might

1616
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:03,679
need videos to to better explain the

1617
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:05,039
concepts so it's it i i think for me

1618
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:07,118
it's natural that there's going to be

1619
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,358
also an evolution there that papers are

1620
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,480
not going to be just the static pdfs or

1621
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:12,880
latex

1622
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,838
there's going to be a next uh next

1623
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,160
interface so in academia a lot of things

1624
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,400
that are judged your judge by is often

1625
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:22,879
quantity not quality

1626
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,240
i i wonder if there's a opportunity to

1627
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,240
have like

1628
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:28,959
i tend to judge people by the best work

1629
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:30,479
they've ever done as opposed to

1630
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,199
i wonder if there's a possibility for

1631
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,798
that to encourage sort of um focusing on

1632
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:36,960
the quality

1633
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:39,199
and not necessarily in paper form but

1634
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,280
maybe a subset of a paper subset of idea

1635
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,439
almost even a blog post or an experiment

1636
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,559
like why does it have to be published in

1637
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,159
a journal

1638
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,599
yeah to be

1639
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:49,199
legitimate

1640
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,119
and and it's just interesting that he

1641
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:53,919
mentioned that i also think like yeah

1642
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:56,079
it's why why why is that the only format

1643
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,159
why can't a blog post or

1644
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:00,640
uh we were even experimenting

1645
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:03,279
experimenting with these a few months

1646
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:04,400
ago or can you actually like publish

1647
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,440
something

1648
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,240
or

1649
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,159
um

1650
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:11,759
like a new scientific breakthrough or um

1651
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:14,078
or something that you've discovered in

1652
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,400
the form of like a set of tweets

1653
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,680
yeah the twitter thread why can't that

1654
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,960
be possible

1655
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,639
and um

1656
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,159
we were expanding experimenting with

1657
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:26,400
that idea uh we even um yeah we ran a

1658
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:28,318
couple of of like some people submitted

1659
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,559
a couple of those like i think the limit

1660
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:32,400
was three or four tweets yeah uh maybe

1661
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,798
it's a new way to look at a you know a

1662
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,480
proof or something but uh i think it

1663
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,639
just serves to show that there should be

1664
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,318
other ways to publish like scientific

1665
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:42,318
discoveries that don't fit the paper

1666
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,480
format well

1667
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:45,599
but so even with the twitter

1668
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,719
thread

1669
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,559
it would be

1670
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:50,959
it would be nice to have some mechanism

1671
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:54,559
of formalizing it and making it stat

1672
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,559
making it into an nft

1673
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:57,519
like

1674
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:59,599
a concrete thing that you can reference

1675
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:02,000
is a link that's unique

1676
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,200
because uh i mean everything we've been

1677
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,838
saying

1678
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,838
all of that

1679
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:10,318
while being true

1680
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,119
it's also true that

1681
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:13,679
the

1682
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:16,480
constraints and the formalism of a paper

1683
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:18,879
works well it like forces you

1684
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,639
constraints forces you to narrow down

1685
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,039
your thing and

1686
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:24,960
and uh literally put it on paper

1687
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:29,279
but you know

1688
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,920
i agree uh make concrete and that's why

1689
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,240
i mean it's not broken it's just could

1690
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,559
be better and that's the main idea i

1691
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:38,959
think there's something about writing

1692
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,119
whether it's a blog post or twitter

1693
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,079
thread or a paper

1694
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:46,079
that's really nice to to concretize a

1695
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:49,519
particular little

1696
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:52,240
idea that they can then be referenced by

1697
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:54,960
other ideas then it can be built on top

1698
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:58,639
of with other ideas

1699
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,400
so uh let me ask you've read quite a few

1700
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:03,920
papers

1701
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,838
you've uh annotated quite a few papers

1702
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,119
let's talk about the process itself how

1703
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:10,639
do you advise people read papers

1704
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,318
or maybe you want to broaden it beyond

1705
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:13,358
just papers but just

1706
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:15,039
read

1707
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:18,159
concrete pieces of information to

1708
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:20,079
understand the insights that lay within

1709
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:21,598
i would say for paper specifically i

1710
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,519
would i would bring back kind of what

1711
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,760
louise was talking about it is that it's

1712
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:28,880
important to keep in mind that papers

1713
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:31,599
are not optimized for ease of

1714
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,920
understanding and so right there's all

1715
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,240
sorts of restrictions in size

1716
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,480
and format and and language that they

1717
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:40,239
can use and so it's important to keep

1718
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:43,199
that in mind and so that if you're

1719
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:45,279
struggling to read a paper doesn't

1720
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,358
that might not mean that the underlying

1721
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,720
material is actually that hard

1722
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:50,960
and so

1723
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:53,598
so that's definitely something that that

1724
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,358
especially for us that we we read papers

1725
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,519
and most of the times the lead papers

1726
01:01:55,358 --> 01:02:00,318
are completely outside of our

1727
01:01:57,519 --> 01:02:03,119
of our comfort zone i guess and and to

1728
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:05,358
be completely new areas to us um

1729
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,640
so i always try to to keep that in mind

1730
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:09,119
so there's usually a certain kind of

1731
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:11,279
structure like abstract introductions

1732
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,680
methodology

1733
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,680
uh depending on the community and so on

1734
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,078
is there something about

1735
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:20,399
the process of like how to read it

1736
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,680
whether you want to skim it to try to

1737
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,119
find the parts that are easy to

1738
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:26,239
understand or not

1739
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:28,160
uh reading it multiple times

1740
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,798
is there any kind of hacks that you can

1741
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:32,798
comment on i remember like feynman had

1742
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:34,559
this this kind of hack when it was

1743
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:36,239
reading papers where

1744
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,519
he would basically

1745
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:39,519
um

1746
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:41,440
would i think i believe he would read

1747
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:44,880
the conclusion of the paper

1748
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:47,119
and we would try to just um see if he

1749
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,119
would be able to figure out how to get

1750
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:51,119
to the conclusion in like a couple of

1751
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,838
minutes by himself

1752
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:57,280
and um and he would read a lot of papers

1753
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:59,279
that way and i think fermi also did that

1754
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,880
almost and fermi was known for doing a

1755
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:05,039
lot of back of the envelope calculation

1756
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:07,440
so he was a master at doing that um

1757
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,680
in terms of like especially when

1758
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,440
when reading a paper i think a lot of

1759
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:13,598
times people might

1760
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,960
feel discouraged about the first time

1761
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,280
you read it

1762
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,358
you know it's very hard to grasp or you

1763
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,319
don't understand a huge fraction of the

1764
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:22,159
paper

1765
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:25,119
and i think it's having read a lot of

1766
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:27,358
papers in my life i think i've in peace

1767
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,358
with like the fact that you might spend

1768
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:31,519
hours where you're just reading a paper

1769
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:32,798
and jumping from paper to paper reading

1770
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:36,079
citations

1771
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:37,920
and um like your level of understanding

1772
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,720
of sometimes of the paper is very close

1773
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,400
to zero percent and all of a sudden you

1774
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:44,798
know everything kind of

1775
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,358
makes sense and and in your mind and

1776
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:49,759
then you know you have this quantum jump

1777
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:51,598
where all of a sudden you you you

1778
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,400
understanding the big picture of the

1779
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:56,160
paper and uh i i

1780
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,920
and and this is an exercise that i have

1781
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,159
to when reading papers and especially

1782
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,440
like more complex papers like okay you

1783
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:02,960
don't understand because you're just

1784
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,119
going through the process and just keep

1785
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,720
going and like and it

1786
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,000
might feel super chaotic especially if

1787
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,159
you are jumping from reference to

1788
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,480
reference you know you might end up with

1789
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:13,920
like 20 tabs open and you're reading a

1790
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,920
ton of other papers but it's just

1791
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,960
trusting that process

1792
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,720
that at the end like you'll find light

1793
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,838
and i think for me that's a good

1794
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:24,399
framework

1795
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,920
when reading a paper it's hard

1796
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,760
because you know you might end up

1797
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,200
spending a lot of time and you it looks

1798
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,720
like you're lost

1799
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,798
but uh but

1800
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,959
that's the process to actually um you

1801
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:36,239
know understand what they're talking

1802
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,079
about in the paper

1803
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,078
yeah i think that process

1804
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:42,960
i enjoy i've found a lot of value in the

1805
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:44,000
process especially for things outside my

1806
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,599
field

1807
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,960
of reading a lot of related work

1808
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,880
sections and kind of go going down that

1809
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,000
path of getting a big context of the

1810
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,599
field because

1811
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,798
what's especially when they're well

1812
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,200
written

1813
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:59,119
there's opinions injected into the

1814
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:01,439
related work like what work is important

1815
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,838
what is not and if you read multiple

1816
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,559
related work sections that cite or don't

1817
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:08,719
cite each other like the papers

1818
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:11,039
you get a sense of where the field where

1819
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:13,759
the tensions of the field are

1820
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:16,000
where this where the field is striving

1821
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,640
and that helps you put into context like

1822
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,119
whether the work is radical whether it's

1823
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:23,358
overselling it itself whether it's

1824
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:26,559
underselling itself all those things

1825
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:28,400
uh and on adding on top of that

1826
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,519
i find that often the related work

1827
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,280
section

1828
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:33,679
is the most

1829
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:37,200
kind of accessible and readable part of

1830
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:39,038
a paper because it's kind of uh it's

1831
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,960
brief to the point it's trying like

1832
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,240
summarizing it's almost like a wikipedia

1833
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,079
style article

1834
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:46,798
the introduction is supposed to be a

1835
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,839
compelling story or whatever but it's

1836
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:51,199
often like overselling there's like an

1837
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:53,199
agenda in the introduction

1838
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:55,358
the related work usually has the least

1839
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,439
amount of agenda except for the few

1840
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:58,960
like elements where you're trying to uh

1841
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,159
talk [ __ ] about previous work where

1842
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,480
you're trying to sell that you're doing

1843
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:04,318
much better but other than that when

1844
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,519
you're just painting where the where the

1845
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:07,038
field

1846
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:10,239
came from or where the field stands

1847
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:11,760
that's really valuable and also again

1848
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:13,919
just to agree with finding the

1849
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,760
conclusion it's like i get a lot of

1850
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,440
value from the

1851
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,640
breadth first search kind of read the

1852
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,760
conclusion

1853
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:23,440
then read the related work and then

1854
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,760
go through the references in the related

1855
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:28,798
work read the conclusion read the

1856
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:31,520
related work and just go down the tree

1857
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:33,679
until you like hit dead ends or run out

1858
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:36,079
of coffee and then through that process

1859
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:38,078
you go back up the tree and now you can

1860
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,079
see the results in their proper

1861
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,318
in their proper context unless of course

1862
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,680
the paper is truly revolutionary which

1863
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:47,119
even that process will help you

1864
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:48,639
understand that is in fact truly

1865
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,640
revolutionary

1866
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:52,400
you've also um

1867
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,798
you talked about just following your

1868
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,720
twitter thread in a

1869
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:57,838
depth first search you talked about that

1870
01:06:56,719 --> 01:06:59,598
you read uh

1871
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,000
the book on

1872
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,240
grisha pearlman go to brahman

1873
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,318
and then you would you had a really nice

1874
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:08,719
twitter thread on it and

1875
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:11,038
you were taking notes throughout so

1876
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:13,439
at a high level is there suggestions you

1877
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,880
can give on how to take good notes

1878
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,960
whether it's we're talking about

1879
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,640
annotations or just for yourself to try

1880
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,199
to

1881
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:23,038
put on paper ideas as you progress

1882
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:25,279
through the work in order to then like

1883
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,559
understand the work better for me i

1884
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,798
always try not to underestimate how much

1885
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,160
you can forget uh within six months

1886
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:33,599
right after you've read something i

1887
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:35,920
thought you're gonna say five minutes

1888
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,599
but yeah six months is good yeah or

1889
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,358
or even shorter and so

1890
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,400
that's something i always try to keep in

1891
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:43,279
mind and uh and it's and it's often i

1892
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,200
mean

1893
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,599
every once in a while i'll read back a

1894
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:50,000
paper that i annotated on vermont and

1895
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:52,559
it's and uh and i'll read through my own

1896
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,039
annotations and it's uh and i've

1897
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,760
completely forgotten what i had written

1898
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:59,839
and but it also

1899
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,920
it also it's interesting because in a

1900
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:04,798
way after you just understood something

1901
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:07,599
you're kind of the best possible teacher

1902
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:09,358
that can teach your future self

1903
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,640
uh yeah you know after you've forgotten

1904
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:12,719
it uh

1905
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:15,759
you can you're kind of your own best

1906
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:18,479
possible teacher at that moment and so

1907
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,600
it's it can be great to try to capture

1908
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,759
that

1909
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,838
it's it's brilliant it just made me kind

1910
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,399
of

1911
01:08:22,838 --> 01:08:26,640
realize

1912
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:28,879
it's really nice to to put yourself in

1913
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,798
the position of teaching an older

1914
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,319
version of yourself exactly that returns

1915
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:33,519
to this paper almost like thinking it

1916
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,120
literally

1917
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,960
that's underexplored

1918
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:39,439
but it's it's super powerful because you

1919
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,279
were the person that you can like if you

1920
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:43,039
if you look at the scale from like one

1921
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,839
not knowing anything about the topic and

1922
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:45,119
ten

1923
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:47,119
like you are the one that progressed

1924
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:49,358
from one to ten and you know which steps

1925
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:51,278
you struggled with so you're the really

1926
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,679
the best person to help yourself make

1927
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,560
that transition from one to ten

1928
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,719
and um a lot of the times like

1929
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,798
and we don't i really believe that the

1930
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:03,600
framework there we have to like just

1931
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:05,519
expose ourselves to like be talking to

1932
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,120
like us when we were an expert when we

1933
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,279
were taking that class and we knew

1934
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:10,880
everything about quantum mechanics and

1935
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,679
then six months later you don't remember

1936
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,759
half of the things how could we make it

1937
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,600
easier for a like to

1938
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:20,479
have those conversations between you and

1939
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,359
your past self past expert self

1940
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,358
um

1941
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,679
i i think there there might be you know

1942
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,838
it's an underexplored idea i think notes

1943
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,359
on paper are probably not the best way

1944
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:31,359
i'm not sure if it's a combination of

1945
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:33,759
like video

1946
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:35,920
audio where it's like you have a guided

1947
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,838
framework that you follow to extract

1948
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,000
information from yourself so that you

1949
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:43,519
can later kind of revisit

1950
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,238
to make it easier to to remember but

1951
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,799
that's i think it's an interesting idea

1952
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:50,639
worth worth exploring that not i've i

1953
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:51,838
haven't seen a lot of people kind of

1954
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,920
trying to

1955
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:55,519
uh distill that problem

1956
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,239
you know i'm creating the kind of tools

1957
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:01,199
i find if i record it it sounds weird

1958
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:02,479
but i'll take notes but if i record

1959
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:05,519
audio

1960
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:08,079
like um like little clips of thoughts

1961
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,159
like rants

1962
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:12,479
that's really effective at capturing

1963
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:14,639
something that notes can't

1964
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,599
because when i replay them for some

1965
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,400
reason

1966
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,400
it loads my brain back into where i was

1967
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:23,839
when i was reading that in a way that

1968
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:26,639
notes don't like when i read notes i'll

1969
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,480
often be like what what

1970
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,800
what was i what was i thinking there but

1971
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,399
when i listened to the audio yeah it

1972
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,679
brings you right back to that place so

1973
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:35,599
there might and

1974
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:38,079
maybe with video with visual that might

1975
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,400
be even more powerful i think so yeah

1976
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,800
and and i think just the process of

1977
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:45,039
you know verbalizing it

1978
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,279
that alone kind of makes you have to

1979
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:49,679
structure your thought and and put it in

1980
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,759
a way that somebody else could come and

1981
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:54,399
understand it and and just the process

1982
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,760
of that is useful to to organize your

1983
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:58,559
thoughts and and

1984
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:00,719
and um yeah just just that alone does

1985
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,120
the firmware's library journal club have

1986
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:05,359
a like a video component or no

1987
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:07,359
we no not natively we sometimes will

1988
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:09,679
include uh videos but it's always

1989
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:11,119
embedded do people like build videos on

1990
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,039
top of it to explain the paper because

1991
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:16,079
you're doing all the hard work of

1992
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:18,319
understanding deeply the paper

1993
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,880
not we haven't seen that happening too

1994
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:22,960
much but uh we were we were actually

1995
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,119
playing around with the idea of creating

1996
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,520
some sort of podcast version where we

1997
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:29,920
try to distill the paper

1998
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,280
on an audio format that not maybe you

1999
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:32,960
could have access

2000
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:34,158
might be trickier but you there's

2001
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,679
definitely people that could be

2002
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:38,000
interested in the paper in that topic

2003
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:40,158
but are not willing to read it but they

2004
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,238
might listen to a 30 minute episode on

2005
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,079
that paper yes you could reach more

2006
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:45,759
people and and you might even bring the

2007
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:47,439
authors to the conversation but it's

2008
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,520
tricky especially for like more

2009
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:52,639
technical papers we've we've thought

2010
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:55,679
about that doing that but we haven't uh

2011
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:58,320
like converge so if you have any

2012
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,840
uh well i'm gonna take that as a a small

2013
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:01,359
project to take one of you one of the

2014
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,719
females almost like

2015
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:04,399
half advertisement and half as a

2016
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,319
challenge for myself to take take one of

2017
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:08,399
the annotated papers and like use it as

2018
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:09,920
a basis for creating a

2019
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:13,198
quick video

2020
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,560
i i i've seen like um

2021
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:15,439
hopefully i'm saying the name correctly

2022
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,159
but

2023
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:20,319
machine learning street talk

2024
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:22,399
i think that's the name of the show the

2025
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:23,119
that i recommend highly that's the right

2026
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:25,279
thing

2027
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:27,599
but uh they they do exactly that which

2028
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:29,359
is multiple hour breakdown of a paper

2029
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,120
with video component

2030
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:33,519
sometimes with authors

2031
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:36,238
um people love it it's very effective

2032
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,400
there's there's also i've seen i haven't

2033
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:40,639
seen the entire in its entirety but i've

2034
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:43,519
seen like the the founder of comma dot

2035
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,920
ai george yeah i've seen him like just

2036
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,719
taking a paper and then

2037
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:51,119
you know distilling the paper and coding

2038
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:53,920
it coding it sometimes during 10 hours

2039
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:55,599
yeah and um he was able to you know get

2040
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,239
a lot of people interested in in that

2041
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,760
and viewing him so i'm a huge fan of

2042
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:01,119
that

2043
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,880
like uh

2044
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:04,479
george is a personality i think a lot of

2045
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,319
people like listen to this podcast for

2046
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,559
the same reason it's not necessarily the

2047
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:10,158
contents it's they they they like to

2048
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,679
listen to like a

2049
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:14,319
a silly

2050
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,560
russian who has a childlike brain and

2051
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:19,279
mumbles and all those like struggle with

2052
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,520
ideas right and george is a madman who

2053
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:23,039
people just enjoy like how is he going

2054
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,560
to struggle in implementing this

2055
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:26,319
particular paper how is he going to

2056
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,159
struggle with this idea it's fun to

2057
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:30,000
watch and that actually pulls you in the

2058
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:31,759
personality is important there true but

2059
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,238
there's lots there's you know i agree

2060
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,920
with you but they're also it's visible

2061
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:38,238
like it's

2062
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:40,480
there's an extraordinary ability that is

2063
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:41,198
there like is talented and you need to

2064
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:43,439
have

2065
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:45,439
there's a craft and this guy definitely

2066
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:47,519
has talent and he's doing something that

2067
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:49,759
is not easy and i think that also draws

2068
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,679
the attention of people oh yeah and and

2069
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,920
like the other day we were actually we

2070
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:56,480
ran into this youtube channel of this

2071
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,158
guy that was restoring art

2072
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,959
right um yeah and

2073
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:03,599
and um it was basically just a video of

2074
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:06,000
him like his the production is really uh

2075
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:09,039
like really well done and it's just him

2076
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,719
taking really old um pieces of of art

2077
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:13,198
like and then paintings and then

2078
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:15,039
restoring them but he's really good at

2079
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:17,279
that and he describes that process and

2080
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:18,960
that draws attention uh draws the

2081
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:21,759
attention of people regardless of your

2082
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,679
craft be it like annotating your paper

2083
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,840
or like responsibilities

2084
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,560
excellence yeah like george is

2085
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,480
incredibly good at programming

2086
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,640
like quick like you know those uh

2087
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:33,839
competitive programmers like top motor

2088
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,360
and all this kind of stuff he has the

2089
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,840
same kind of element where the brain

2090
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:39,679
just jumps around really quickly and

2091
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,840
that's uh yeah

2092
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:44,158
just

2093
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:46,640
like yeah it's motivating but but

2094
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:48,319
and you're right in in watching people

2095
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,679
who are good at what they do it's

2096
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:51,599
motivating even if the thing you're

2097
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,600
trying to do is not what they're doing

2098
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,520
it's just like contagious when they're

2099
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,239
really good at it and the same kind of

2100
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,239
analysis with the paper i think

2101
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:02,399
so not just like the final result but

2102
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:04,238
the process yeah struggling with it

2103
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:06,559
that's really interesting yeah i think i

2104
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:08,238
mean i think twitch proved that like

2105
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,880
you know that there's really a market

2106
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:12,639
for for that for watching people

2107
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,600
do things that they're really good at

2108
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,199
and

2109
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:18,480
and you'll just watch it you will enjoy

2110
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:21,039
that that that might even uh spike your

2111
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:23,119
interest in that specific topic and

2112
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:25,600
yeah and people people will enjoy

2113
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:27,279
watching sometimes hours on end of

2114
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,199
yeah great craftsmen

2115
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:31,519
do you mind if we talk about some of the

2116
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:32,960
papers do any papers come to mind

2117
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,560
that have been annotated on the

2118
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,560
vermont's library

2119
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,159
the papers that we annotated can be

2120
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,320
about completely random topics but

2121
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:42,079
that's part of what we enjoy as well it

2122
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:44,479
forces you to explore these topics that

2123
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:46,158
otherwise maybe you'd never run into

2124
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:48,319
uh and so

2125
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:51,439
so the ones that come to mind that to me

2126
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:52,960
are fairly random but one that i i

2127
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:57,039
really enjoyed

2128
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,880
learning more about is um a paper

2129
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:03,198
uh written by a mathematician actually

2130
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:04,560
tom apostol and uh about a

2131
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:07,759
a tunnel

2132
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,880
in uh greek island off the coast of

2133
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,360
turkey

2134
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,840
i think it's already random

2135
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:16,799
so this uh okay so what's interesting

2136
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:19,679
about this tunnel so this tunnel um was

2137
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,960
built in the sixth century bc

2138
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:22,800
and um

2139
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,840
and it was built in this

2140
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,239
in the island of samos uh which is as i

2141
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,400
said off the coast of turkey and um

2142
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:33,039
right they had the city on one side and

2143
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:35,039
the other mountain and then they had

2144
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:36,880
a bunch of springs on the other side and

2145
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:37,760
they they wanted to bring water into the

2146
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,319
city

2147
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,920
um did building an aqueduct would be

2148
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:44,079
pretty hard because of the way the

2149
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,440
mountain was shaped and it would also

2150
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:46,960
you know if they if they were under a

2151
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:49,678
siege like

2152
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,198
they could just um easily destroy that

2153
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:52,960
aqueduct and then the water wouldn't

2154
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:54,960
have any water supply the the city

2155
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:57,679
wouldn't have any water supply and so

2156
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:00,158
they decided to build a tunnel

2157
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:01,760
and they decided to try to do it quickly

2158
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:02,879
um and so

2159
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,960
the

2160
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:08,480
they started digging

2161
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,640
uh from both ends at the same time

2162
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,479
through the mountain right and so

2163
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:15,199
like when you start thinking about this

2164
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:17,839
it's it's a fairly difficult problem and

2165
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:20,479
this is like 6th century bc so

2166
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:22,719
you had very limited access

2167
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:24,158
to you know the mathematical tools that

2168
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:26,960
you had at the time were very limited

2169
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:29,759
and so what this paper is about is about

2170
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:32,800
the story of how they built it and about

2171
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:35,440
the fact that for about 2000 years kind

2172
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,760
of the accepted the accepted explanation

2173
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:39,839
of how they built it was actually wrong

2174
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,280
and so this tunnel has been famous for a

2175
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,239
while there are a number of historians

2176
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:46,238
that talked about it since ancient egypt

2177
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:49,839
and um and the method that they

2178
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:50,799
described uh for for building it um is

2179
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,520
is

2180
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:56,000
uh was just wrong and and so these these

2181
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:59,199
researchers went there and and were able

2182
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,800
to figure figure that out and so

2183
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:02,719
basically kind of the way that they

2184
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,480
thought they had built it was basically

2185
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,880
if you can imagine looking at the

2186
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:08,238
mountain from the top and you have the

2187
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,000
mountain and then you have both

2188
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:12,079
entrances um

2189
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,079
and so what they what they thought and

2190
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:16,000
what this is what the ancient historians

2191
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:19,279
described is that they

2192
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,920
effectively tried to draw a right angle

2193
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:24,559
a right angle triangle um

2194
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:27,119
with the two entrances at each end of

2195
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,039
the hypotenuse and the way they did is

2196
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:31,359
like they would go around the mountain

2197
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,600
and kind of walk in a grid fashion and

2198
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:34,880
then you can you can figure out uh the

2199
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,800
two sides

2200
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,840
of the triangle and then after you have

2201
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:42,400
that triangle you can

2202
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:44,239
effectively draw two smaller triangles

2203
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:46,960
at each entrance that are

2204
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:48,399
proportional to that big triangle

2205
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,000
and then you kind of have arrows

2206
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:52,559
pointing in each way

2207
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,800
and then you can you know at least that

2208
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,640
these that you have a line going through

2209
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,320
the the mountain that connects both

2210
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,400
entrances

2211
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:02,799
the issue with that is like once you

2212
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:05,359
once you go to this mountain and you

2213
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,880
start thinking of doing this you realize

2214
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:08,799
that especially given that the tools

2215
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:11,199
that they had at the time that your

2216
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,679
error margin would be too small

2217
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:14,559
you wouldn't be able to do it uh you you

2218
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:17,199
you

2219
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:19,360
the just the fact of of trying to to

2220
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:21,198
build this triangle in that fashion the

2221
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:22,799
error would accumulate and you would end

2222
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:24,319
up missing you'd start building these

2223
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,159
tunnels and they would miss each other

2224
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:29,039
so the task ultimately is to figure out

2225
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,319
like really perfectly as cl as close as

2226
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:32,640
possible the direction you should be

2227
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:34,880
digging first of all that it's possible

2228
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:37,119
to have a straight line through and then

2229
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,199
what that the direction would be and

2230
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:42,000
then you're trying to infer that by

2231
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:45,439
constructing a right triangle

2232
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:48,238
by doing i i'm not exactly sure about

2233
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:50,158
how to do that rigorously like by

2234
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:52,238
tracing the mountain by walking along

2235
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:54,719
the mountain how to you said grids yeah

2236
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:56,718
you kind of walk as if you were in a in

2237
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:59,039
a grid and so you just walk in right

2238
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:01,039
angles i so right but then you have to

2239
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:03,279
walk really precisely then exactly you

2240
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:05,760
have to use tools to measure this and

2241
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:08,238
then the terrain is probably yeah very

2242
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,400
messed up so this makes more sense in 2d

2243
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:13,119
and 3d gets even weirder

2244
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:16,079
so okay gotcha but so this method was

2245
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:18,800
described by like an ancient egyptian

2246
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:20,800
historian i think hero of alexandria and

2247
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,960
um and then for about like yeah for

2248
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,159
about 2000 years that's that's how like

2249
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,439
that's how we thought that they had

2250
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,719
built this this tunnel um

2251
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:30,960
and then in the end then these

2252
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:33,520
researchers went there and and found out

2253
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,760
that actually they they must have had to

2254
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,159
to use other methods and and then in

2255
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,159
this paper they describe these these

2256
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,238
other methods and of course they can't

2257
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:44,638
know for sure but there's uh they

2258
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:46,799
presented a bunch of plausible

2259
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,719
alternatives the one that for me was is

2260
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,639
the most plausible is that what they

2261
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,719
probably must have done is to use

2262
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:56,079
something that is similar to

2263
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:58,960
an iron sight on a rifle the way you can

2264
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:01,679
line up uh your rifle with the target

2265
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,639
off in the distance by by having an iron

2266
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:03,840
sight

2267
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:06,960
um

2268
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:09,279
and uh and they they they must have done

2269
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:12,079
something similar to that effectively

2270
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:13,519
with tree with three sticks and that way

2271
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:14,559
they were able to

2272
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,080
line up

2273
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,159
sticks

2274
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:20,319
along the side of the mountain that were

2275
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:21,759
all on the same height

2276
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:23,840
and so that then you could get to the

2277
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:25,440
other side and you could cut and then

2278
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,400
you could draw that line

2279
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:30,079
so this for me is the most plausible

2280
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:31,279
way that they might have done that and

2281
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:33,519
they

2282
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:35,679
but then they they they describe this in

2283
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:38,000
detail and other possible approaches in

2284
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:40,158
this paper so this is a mathematician

2285
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,880
doing this yeah this is a mathematician

2286
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:44,158
that did this um which i suppose is the

2287
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,319
right

2288
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:49,198
mindset instead of skills required to

2289
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:50,479
solve an ancient problem right yeah

2290
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:52,719
yeah there's mathematicians and

2291
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:55,519
engineers a lot of things because they

2292
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,439
didn't have uh computers or drones or

2293
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,199
lidar back then or whatever technology

2294
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,759
you would use modern day for civil

2295
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:03,039
engineering yeah and another fascinating

2296
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,560
thing is that like

2297
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,719
you know after

2298
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,800
effectively after the the downfall of

2299
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:11,198
the roman civilization people didn't

2300
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,960
build tunnels for about a thousand years

2301
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:15,039
we go a thousand years without tunnels

2302
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,880
and then like only in like in late

2303
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:19,279
middle ages that we start doing them

2304
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,440
again but uh but here is the tunnel like

2305
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:23,920
6th century bc like incredibly limited

2306
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:25,919
mathematics and they and they build it

2307
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:28,560
in this way um

2308
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,239
and and and for and it was a mystery for

2309
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,840
for a long time exactly how they did it

2310
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,919
and then these mathematicians went there

2311
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,840
and and uh

2312
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,440
and and basically with no archaeology

2313
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,159
kind of background we're able to figure

2314
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:41,919
it out how do annotations for this paper

2315
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:44,079
look like what is it uh what's a

2316
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,800
successful annotation for paper like

2317
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:46,960
this

2318
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,880
yes so sometimes you're uh for this

2319
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:51,679
paper um

2320
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,319
sometimes adding some more context uh on

2321
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:56,399
on a specific um

2322
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:57,840
part like sometimes they they mentioned

2323
01:22:56,399 --> 01:22:58,799
for instance um

2324
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,560
these

2325
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,880
instruments that were common in ancient

2326
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:06,080
greece and an ancient rome

2327
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:08,400
for for building things and uh and and

2328
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:10,000
so in some of those annotations i

2329
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:11,679
described these instruments in more

2330
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,639
detail and how they worked because

2331
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:16,880
sometimes it can be hard to to visualize

2332
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:20,560
these um

2333
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:22,960
then this paper um i forget exactly when

2334
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:26,159
when this was published uh i believe

2335
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:28,719
maybe maybe the 70s um but then there

2336
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:30,319
was further research into this tunnel

2337
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:32,560
and more interesting other interesting

2338
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:35,759
aspects about it i add those to that

2339
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:38,719
paper as well there's historical context

2340
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,480
that i also go into uh there

2341
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:42,800
for instance the fact that as a as i

2342
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:44,399
said that effectively after the downfall

2343
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,920
of the roman empire no tunnels were

2344
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,000
built like that's something that i that

2345
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,719
i go that i that i added to the paper as

2346
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,560
well

2347
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,079
yeah so so this is so when other people

2348
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,199
look at the paper

2349
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:55,439
how did they usually consume the

2350
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:58,000
annotations so they it's like is there a

2351
01:23:55,439 --> 01:23:59,039
commenting feature is uh

2352
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,119
i mean like

2353
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,039
this is a really enriching experience

2354
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,359
the way you read a paper

2355
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:07,600
what what aspects do you do people

2356
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:08,639
usually talk about that they value from

2357
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,039
this

2358
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:14,079
so yeah so anybody can just go on there

2359
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:16,079
and and either add a new annotation or

2360
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:18,719
other a comment to an existing

2361
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,719
annotation and so you can start a kind

2362
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:23,198
of a thread uh within an existing

2363
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:25,679
annotation um and that's something that

2364
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:27,599
happens relative frequency and then

2365
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,480
because i was the original author of the

2366
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,880
initial annotation i get pinged and so

2367
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:35,119
often times i'll go back and and

2368
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,960
and add on to to that thread how did you

2369
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:38,719
pick the paper that's i mean first of

2370
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,960
all this whole process is really

2371
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:42,319
exciting i'm gonna especially after this

2372
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,319
conversation i'm gonna

2373
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:45,519
make sure i participate much more

2374
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:47,519
actively

2375
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,120
on papers that i know a lot about and on

2376
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:52,480
paper i know nothing about i shouldn't

2377
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:52,479
bother when i say the paper

2378
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:58,319
i would love to i also i mean i i

2379
01:24:55,119 --> 01:25:01,119
realized that uh there's a like it's an

2380
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:04,319
opportunity for people like me

2381
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:05,119
to publicly annotate a paper

2382
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:08,000
like

2383
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:09,279
like or do an ama around the paper like

2384
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,760
yeah exactly

2385
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:13,599
but yeah but like be um

2386
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:16,000
be in the conversation about a paper

2387
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,159
it's like a place to have a conversation

2388
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,840
about an idea you could the other way to

2389
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:22,079
do it that's much more ad hoc is on

2390
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,520
twitter right but this is more like

2391
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:25,279
formal and you could actually probably

2392
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,280
integrate the two they have a

2393
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:29,359
conversation about the conversation so

2394
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:31,279
the twitter is the conversation about a

2395
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:33,439
conversation and the main conversation

2396
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:35,599
is in the space of annotations there's

2397
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:37,359
an interesting effect that we we see

2398
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,800
sometimes with the annotations on our

2399
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:41,359
papers is that a lot of people

2400
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:44,400
especially if we the annotations are

2401
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:46,960
really well done people sometimes

2402
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:48,399
are afraid of adding more annotations

2403
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,639
because they see that as a kind of a

2404
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:53,039
finished work yes and so they they don't

2405
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,719
want to pollute that or

2406
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:55,920
and especially if it's like a silly

2407
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:57,600
question this is

2408
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,560
i don't think that's good i think you

2409
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,400
know

2410
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,239
we should as much as possible try to

2411
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:04,638
lower the barrier for someone to jump in

2412
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:06,799
and ask questions i think it only like

2413
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:09,440
most of the times it adds value but it's

2414
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,119
some feedback that we got from users and

2415
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:12,000
and readers

2416
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:14,319
um

2417
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,679
i'm not exactly sure how to

2418
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:18,799
to kind of fight that but um well i

2419
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:22,158
think i

2420
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:23,600
i think if i serve as an inspiration

2421
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:25,839
in any way

2422
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,840
is by asking a lot of dumb questions and

2423
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,079
saying a bunch of dumb [ __ ] all the time

2424
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,319
and hopefully that inspires the rest of

2425
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:34,559
uh other folks to do the same because

2426
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:35,519
that's the only way to knowledge i think

2427
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,679
is to

2428
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,679
be willing to ask the dumb questions and

2429
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:41,359
and there are papers that are like um

2430
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:43,520
and we have a lot of papers on formats

2431
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:44,479
where it's just one page or really short

2432
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:47,120
papers

2433
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:49,359
and you we have like the shortest paper

2434
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:51,359
ever published in a math journal like

2435
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:52,799
with like just a couple of words

2436
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:55,279
one of my favorite papers on the

2437
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:58,079
platform is actually a paper um written

2438
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:59,920
by enrico fermi yeah and the title of

2439
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:02,079
the paper is myop's i think it's my

2440
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:04,880
observations at trinity so basically

2441
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:08,319
fermi was part of the manhattan project

2442
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:10,960
so he was in new mexico when um they

2443
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:12,960
exploded the first atomic bomb

2444
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,800
and so he was a couple of miles away

2445
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,880
from the explosion and he was probably

2446
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:19,760
one of the first persons to calculate

2447
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:22,560
the energy of the explosion and so the

2448
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,880
way he did that was he took a piece of

2449
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:27,360
paper and he tore down a piece of paper

2450
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:28,560
in little pieces and when the bomb

2451
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:30,000
exploded

2452
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,000
the trinity bomb was the name of the

2453
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,198
bomb like he waited for the blast to

2454
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,719
arrive at

2455
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:36,799
where he was

2456
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:38,960
and then he threw those pieces of paper

2457
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,360
in the air and he calculated the energy

2458
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:43,600
based on the displacement of the paper

2459
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:45,599
the pieces of paper and then he wrote a

2460
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,239
report which was classified until like a

2461
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,719
couple of years ago one page report like

2462
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:53,279
calculating the energy of the explosion

2463
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:55,840
uh it's so badass and i i we actually

2464
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:57,359
went there and kind of unpacked and like

2465
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,760
yeah i think it just mentions basically

2466
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:00,960
the energy and we we actually went and

2467
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,639
one of the annotations is like

2468
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,039
explaining how he did that

2469
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:08,079
um i wonder how accurate he was

2470
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:10,238
it was maybe i think like 20 20 or 25

2471
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:12,079
off uh then there was another person

2472
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:15,359
that actually calculated the energy

2473
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:17,600
based on uh images after the explosion

2474
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:20,238
at the rate uh and the rate that which

2475
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,920
the the the like the mushroom of the

2476
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:23,439
explosion expanded and it's more

2477
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,480
accurate to calculate the energy based

2478
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:28,399
on that um and i think it was like 20 20

2479
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:30,638
off but it's it's really interesting

2480
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:32,879
because you know fermi was known for all

2481
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,880
these being a master at this back of the

2482
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,960
envelope calculations always like the

2483
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:39,679
the fermi problems are well known for

2484
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,920
for that um and it's super interesting

2485
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,239
to see like that just one page report

2486
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:46,000
and was also actually classified and

2487
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:48,959
it's interesting because a couple months

2488
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,079
ago when the beirut explosion happened

2489
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:54,719
there was a video circulating of these a

2490
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:56,559
bride that was doing a photo shoot

2491
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,079
when the explosion in beirut happened

2492
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,760
and so you can see a video of her with

2493
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:01,679
the wedding dress and then the explosion

2494
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,440
happens and the blast arrives at where

2495
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:06,960
she was she was a couple of miles away

2496
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:09,198
from the glass and you can see like um

2497
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,639
the displacement of the dress as well

2498
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:12,319
and i actually looked and that video

2499
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:14,159
went viral on twitter and i actually

2500
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:16,799
looked at that video and based i used

2501
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:19,519
the same techniques that fermi used to

2502
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,360
calculate the energy of the explosion uh

2503
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,040
based on the displacement of the dress

2504
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:25,039
and you could actually see where where

2505
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,479
she was at the the distance from the

2506
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:27,920
explosion because there was a store

2507
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:30,238
behind her and you could look the name

2508
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:31,840
of the store and and so i calculated

2509
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:34,000
that it was the distance and then you

2510
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,319
can then based on the distance where she

2511
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,399
was from the the explosion and also on

2512
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:40,079
the the displacement of the dress like

2513
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:42,158
because you can when the blast happens

2514
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:43,760
like you can see the dress going back

2515
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:45,439
and then

2516
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,840
going back to the original position and

2517
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:50,158
like by just looking at like how much

2518
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,159
the the dress moved you can

2519
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:54,399
estimate the explo the energy of the

2520
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:56,399
explosion i assume you published this

2521
01:29:54,399 --> 01:29:58,799
on twitter it was just a a twitter

2522
01:29:56,399 --> 01:30:00,399
thread uh but it it actually like a lot

2523
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,360
of people share that and it was picked

2524
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:05,599
up by a couple of of um news outlets but

2525
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:07,599
i i was hoping it would be like a formal

2526
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:09,039
title and it would be an archive no no

2527
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,560
no no maybe you submitted it just the

2528
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:12,079
twitter the twitter thread but it was

2529
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:15,199
interesting because it was exactly the

2530
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:16,719
same method that fermi used

2531
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:19,678
is there something else that jumps to

2532
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:21,279
mind like what is there something

2533
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:24,000
i know like in terms of papers like i

2534
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:25,279
know the bitcoin paper is super popular

2535
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,439
is there something interesting to be

2536
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:29,679
said about any of the white papers in

2537
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:30,638
the cryptocurrency space

2538
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:32,719
yeah the

2539
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:36,000
the bitcoin paper was the first paper

2540
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:38,719
that we put on for mods and uh why why

2541
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,960
that why that choice as the first paper

2542
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:44,079
this was a while ago and it was one of

2543
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:46,480
the papers that i read and then

2544
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:48,238
and then kind of explained it to to

2545
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:49,839
louisiana or to other friends that do

2546
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:51,279
this journal club with us

2547
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:54,159
and um

2548
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:56,319
i did some research in cryptography uh

2549
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:58,879
as an undergrad and so it was a topic

2550
01:30:56,319 --> 01:31:00,559
that i was interested in um but even for

2551
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,400
me that i i had

2552
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:04,639
that background but

2553
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:06,638
reading the bitcoin paper

2554
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:08,719
it took me a few weeks to really kind of

2555
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:11,440
wrap my head around it it's it's right

2556
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:13,439
it's it uses very spartan precise

2557
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:15,439
language in a way it's like you feel

2558
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:17,919
like you can't take any word out of it

2559
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:19,919
without something falling apart

2560
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:23,359
and uh and it's all there i think it's a

2561
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:26,239
beautiful paper and it's it's it's

2562
01:31:23,359 --> 01:31:27,119
very well written of course but

2563
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:28,559
um

2564
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:31,359
you know we wanted to try to make it

2565
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,960
accessible so that anybody that maybe is

2566
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:36,479
an undergrad in computer science could

2567
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:38,399
go on there and then and and know that

2568
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:40,000
you have all the information

2569
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:42,000
in in that page that you're going to

2570
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,279
need to understand the mechanics of

2571
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,119
bitcoin and so like i explain you know

2572
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:49,519
the basic uh

2573
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:51,279
public key cryptography that you need to

2574
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,280
to know in order to understand it you

2575
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:55,359
can explain okay what are the properties

2576
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:58,559
of a hash function and how they are

2577
01:31:55,359 --> 01:32:01,198
useful in this context um explain what a

2578
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,719
merkle tree is so a bunch of those basic

2579
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:04,238
concepts that maybe if you're reading it

2580
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:05,840
for a first time and you're an undergrad

2581
01:32:04,238 --> 01:32:07,519
and you know you don't know those terms

2582
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,039
you're going to be you know discouraged

2583
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,120
because maybe okay now i have to go and

2584
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:13,679
google around until i understand these

2585
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:14,559
before i can make progress in the paper

2586
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,319
um

2587
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,679
and and this way it's all there you know

2588
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:18,960
so so there's a

2589
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:21,199
magic to

2590
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:23,520
also to the fact that over time more

2591
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:25,439
people went on there and and added

2592
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:28,400
further annotations so the idea that the

2593
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:30,079
paper gets easier and more accessible

2594
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:32,559
over time but that's still you're still

2595
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:33,279
looking at the original content the way

2596
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,480
the

2597
01:32:33,279 --> 01:32:36,559
the author

2598
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:39,039
intended it to be uh but there's just

2599
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,400
more context and the toughest bits have

2600
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:42,880
have

2601
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:45,439
more in-depth explanations

2602
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:48,400
okay i think like there's a there's so

2603
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:50,719
many interesting papers uh there like

2604
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:53,039
i remember reading the paper that was

2605
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:54,960
written by freeman dyson on the

2606
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:57,279
like the the first time that he

2607
01:32:54,960 --> 01:33:00,000
explained or he came up with the concept

2608
01:32:57,279 --> 01:33:02,719
of the dyson sphere and he he put that

2609
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,439
out like it's again it's one page paper

2610
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:08,880
um and he what he explained was that

2611
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:10,719
eventually if a civilization develops

2612
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,679
and and grows there's going to be a

2613
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:16,399
point where when the resources on the

2614
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:18,560
planet are not are not enough for the

2615
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:20,238
energy requirements of that civilization

2616
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,920
so if you want to go

2617
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:24,158
the next step is you need to go to the

2618
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:25,039
next star and extract energy from that

2619
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:27,039
star

2620
01:33:25,039 --> 01:33:29,679
and the way to do it is you need to

2621
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:32,399
build some sort of cap around the star

2622
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:35,840
that extracts the energy so he theorized

2623
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:37,920
this idea of the the dyson sphere and he

2624
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:40,480
went on to kind of analyze how he would

2625
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:42,319
build that the stability of that sphere

2626
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:44,319
like if something happens if there's

2627
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:46,960
like a small oscillation with that fear

2628
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:50,319
collapsing to the star or no what what

2629
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:53,039
would happen and even went on to uh kind

2630
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:55,599
of say that a good way for us to look

2631
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:58,399
for signs of intelligent life out there

2632
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:59,440
is to look for signals of these dyson

2633
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:00,960
spheres

2634
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:02,879
and because you know according to the

2635
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,480
law of second law of thermodynamics like

2636
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,079
this there's going to be some a lot of

2637
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:08,000
infrared radiation that is going to be

2638
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:10,719
emitted as a consequence of extracting

2639
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,800
energy from the star and we should be

2640
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:15,600
able to see those signals of like

2641
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,440
infrared if we look at the sky but all

2642
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,440
these like from the introduction of the

2643
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:21,119
concept like the pro how to build the

2644
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:23,599
dyson sphere the problems of like having

2645
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:24,800
a dyson sphere how to detect how that

2646
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,480
could be used as a signal for

2647
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,800
intelligence like really that's all in

2648
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:30,319
the paper all in one like one page paper

2649
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,679
and it's like it's it's for me it's

2650
01:34:30,319 --> 01:34:34,238
beautiful it's like where was this

2651
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:35,920
published i don't remember it

2652
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:37,119
it's fascinating that papers like that

2653
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,279
could be

2654
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:42,238
yeah i mean the guts it takes

2655
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:43,920
to put that all together in a paper you

2656
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:46,479
know that that kind of challenges our

2657
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:48,480
previous discussion that of paper i mean

2658
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:50,479
papers can be beautiful you can play

2659
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:52,479
with the format right it

2660
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:54,559
but there's a lot to unpack there that's

2661
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:56,479
like the the that's the the starting

2662
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:59,119
point but it's it's it's beautiful that

2663
01:34:56,479 --> 01:35:01,439
you're able to put that in one page

2664
01:34:59,118 --> 01:35:03,279
and then people can build on top of that

2665
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:04,638
and but the key ideas are there yeah

2666
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:07,279
exactly

2667
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:08,960
what about have you looked at any of the

2668
01:35:07,279 --> 01:35:10,479
the big seminal papers throughout the

2669
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:14,158
history of science like you look at

2670
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:16,000
simple like einstein papers

2671
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:18,238
have any of those been annotated yeah

2672
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,840
yeah no we we have some more seminal

2673
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:21,919
papers that

2674
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,279
that people will have heard about um you

2675
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,800
know we have the

2676
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:29,679
the dna double helix paper on there

2677
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,639
we have the higgs boson

2678
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:34,480
paper

2679
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:35,760
um yeah there's papers that that we know

2680
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,519
that it's

2681
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:40,320
they're not going to be finding out

2682
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:42,159
about them because of us but it's papers

2683
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:44,000
that we think

2684
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:46,079
should be more widely read and that

2685
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,158
folks would benefit from having some

2686
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:50,238
annotations there and so we also have a

2687
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:52,559
number of those a lot of like discovery

2688
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:54,559
papers for fundamental like particles

2689
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,480
and all that there's we have a lot of

2690
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,480
those on from us library

2691
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:00,000
um yeah we i would like to end we

2692
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:02,718
haven't annotated that one but i'd like

2693
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,279
to on the riemann hypotheses that's a

2694
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:07,279
really interesting paper as well um and

2695
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:08,880
and but we haven't annotated that one

2696
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:11,198
but there's a lot of like more

2697
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:14,319
historical landmark papers

2698
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:16,479
um on the platform have you done uh

2699
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:18,639
point correct conjecture with uh with

2700
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:20,959
perlman that's too much that's too much

2701
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,760
that's too much too much for me but it's

2702
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:23,760
uh

2703
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,360
it's it's interesting that you know and

2704
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,520
going back to our discussion like the

2705
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:29,839
the poincare paper was like published on

2706
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:31,520
archive and and it was not on a journal

2707
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,360
like the three papers and yeah what do

2708
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,960
you make of that i mean he's such a

2709
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:36,319
fascinating human being exactly i

2710
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,480
mentioned to you offline that i'm going

2711
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:42,000
to russia he's somebody i'm

2712
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:43,039
really trying to interview yeah well

2713
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,079
so

2714
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:48,880
i definitely will interview him i um and

2715
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:50,800
i believe i will i believe i can i just

2716
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,480
don't know how to

2717
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:55,039
i know where you live so

2718
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:57,759
here okay my my uh

2719
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:59,198
my hope is my conjecture is that if i

2720
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,719
just show up to the house and look

2721
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:03,279
desperate enough

2722
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:04,719
uh that uh or threatening now for some

2723
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:06,880
combination of both

2724
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:08,719
that like the only way to get rid of me

2725
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,079
is to just get the thing done that's the

2726
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:13,279
hope it's actually interesting that you

2727
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:15,359
mentioned that because i after i um so a

2728
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:17,118
couple of weeks ago i was searching for

2729
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:19,279
like stuff about paramount paramount

2730
01:37:17,118 --> 01:37:21,359
online and ended up on this twitter

2731
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:24,319
account of like this guy that claims to

2732
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:26,399
be paramount perlman's assistant

2733
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:28,319
and he is like he has been posting a

2734
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:29,839
bunch of pictures like next to paramount

2735
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:31,920
you can see like permanent in in a

2736
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:34,400
library and he's like next to him like

2737
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,319
taking a selfie or like firm and walking

2738
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:37,839
on the street and like maybe you could

2739
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:40,319
reach out to

2740
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:42,319
this assistant then i'll send you i'll

2741
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:44,639
send you this twitter account so

2742
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:46,079
maybe you're on to something no but but

2743
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:47,679
going back to like pheromone is super

2744
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:49,279
interesting because the fact that he

2745
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:51,279
published the the

2746
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:54,479
the proofs on archive is what was also

2747
01:37:51,279 --> 01:37:56,639
like a way for him to because he really

2748
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:58,158
didn't like the scientific publishing

2749
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:58,960
industry and the fact that you had to

2750
01:37:58,158 --> 01:38:00,079
pay

2751
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,039
to get

2752
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:05,118
access to to articles and that was a

2753
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:07,760
form of like protest and that's why he

2754
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:10,399
published um those papers there i mean i

2755
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:12,560
i think paramount is just a fascinating

2756
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:15,599
like character and for me it's this kind

2757
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:18,080
of ideal of a platonic ideal of what a

2758
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,920
mathematician should be you know it's

2759
01:38:18,079 --> 01:38:21,600
it's someone that is you know it just

2760
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:23,760
cares about deeply cares about

2761
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,239
mathematics you know it cares about fair

2762
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:28,960
attribution of um

2763
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:31,039
disregards money and um

2764
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:33,760
and and like the fact that he published

2765
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:35,279
like on archive was is a good example of

2766
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,960
what about the fields metal that he

2767
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:38,479
turned down the fields metal what's

2768
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,639
what's yeah

2769
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:42,479
what do you make of that yeah i mean

2770
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:44,400
if you look at like the reasons why he

2771
01:38:42,479 --> 01:38:46,879
rejected the fields medal so after so

2772
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:49,439
paramount did a post talk in the us and

2773
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,239
when he he came back to russia

2774
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:51,839
um

2775
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:53,599
do you know how good his english is i

2776
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,760
think it's very fairly good it's pretty

2777
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,760
good i think it's really good especially

2778
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,760
given lectures in american union but i

2779
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:01,679
haven't been able to listen to anything

2780
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:03,360
well certainly not listen but i haven't

2781
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:04,480
been able to get anybody because i know

2782
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:05,519
a lot of people have been to those

2783
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:08,879
lectures

2784
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:10,400
i'm not able to get a sense of like

2785
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,920
yeah but how strong is the accent what

2786
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:13,198
are we talking about here is this gonna

2787
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,960
have to be in russian is it gonna have

2788
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:16,399
to be in english it's fascinating but he

2789
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:18,319
writes the papers in english so it's

2790
01:39:16,399 --> 01:39:20,399
true like there's there's but there's so

2791
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:22,479
many like such a fascinating character

2792
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:25,279
and um there are a couple of examples

2793
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:27,198
like him like at i think 28 or 29 he

2794
01:39:25,279 --> 01:39:29,039
proved like a really famous uh

2795
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:30,799
conjecture called the sulk conjecture i

2796
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:32,639
believe it was like in a very short

2797
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,159
four-page proof of that it was a really

2798
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:37,359
big breakthrough then he went to

2799
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:38,879
princeton to give a lecture on that and

2800
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:40,799
after the lecture

2801
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,118
the the chair of the math department at

2802
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,360
princeton a guy called peter sarnock

2803
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:46,639
went up to the parliament was trying to

2804
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:48,559
recruit him

2805
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:50,960
trying to offer him a position at

2806
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:54,320
princeton and he was and at some point

2807
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:56,399
he asked for perlman's resume and

2808
01:39:54,319 --> 01:39:58,559
fellman responded saying just gave a

2809
01:39:56,399 --> 01:40:01,279
lecture on like this really tough

2810
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,880
problem why do you need my resume like

2811
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:05,279
i'm not gonna send you like i just

2812
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,039
proved like my value

2813
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:09,920
but uh but going back to the fields

2814
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:11,760
metal like when when perlman went to

2815
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:14,319
back to russia he

2816
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:17,840
he arrived at a time where the

2817
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:20,559
the salary of post docs was so much off

2818
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:22,719
in regards to inflation that they were

2819
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:25,039
not making any money like they

2820
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:26,719
people didn't even bother to pick up the

2821
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:29,439
checks at the end of the month because

2822
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:31,920
it was like ridiculous but thankfully he

2823
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:33,439
had some money that he had uh gained

2824
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:35,279
while he was doing his post talk so he

2825
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:37,599
just concentrated on like

2826
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:39,759
the poincar the the prank reconjecture

2827
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:43,199
problem which he when he when he took

2828
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:45,280
that um it took it after it was reframed

2829
01:40:43,198 --> 01:40:48,000
by this mathematician called richard

2830
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:50,399
hamilton which posed the problem in a

2831
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,800
way that it turned into this super like

2832
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:55,118
math olympiad problem with like perfect

2833
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,199
boundaries well defined and that was

2834
01:40:55,118 --> 01:40:58,960
perfect for paramount to attack and so

2835
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:01,519
he spent like seven years working on

2836
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:04,560
that and then in 2002 he started

2837
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,280
publishing those papers on archive

2838
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:07,039
and

2839
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:09,840
people started jumping on that reading

2840
01:41:07,039 --> 01:41:12,158
those papers and there was like a lot of

2841
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,760
excitement around that a couple of years

2842
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:15,839
later there were two researchers i

2843
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,639
believe was they were from harvard that

2844
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,039
but

2845
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:21,359
took paramount pearlman's work they

2846
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:23,039
sanded some of the edges and they

2847
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:24,639
republished that

2848
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:26,639
saying that you know

2849
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:28,639
based on pearlman's work they were able

2850
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,840
to figure out the the pronghorn

2851
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:32,800
conjecture

2852
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:35,119
and then there was um at the time at the

2853
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:37,400
in the international um

2854
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:39,759
conference of of mathematics in 2000

2855
01:41:37,399 --> 01:41:41,679
2006 i believe that's when they were

2856
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:44,000
going to give out the fields medal there

2857
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:46,000
was a lot of debate of like oh

2858
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,600
who's who's like we should get the

2859
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,600
credit for

2860
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,840
solving this big problem and for

2861
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,239
apparelmen it like it

2862
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:56,400
it felt really sad that people were even

2863
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:58,158
considering that he was not the person

2864
01:41:56,399 --> 01:42:00,000
that solved that

2865
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:02,000
and and the claims that

2866
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,520
those like researchers uh when they

2867
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,039
published after paramount there were

2868
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,639
false claims that they were the ones

2869
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:09,118
they just sanded a couple of edges like

2870
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:10,319
parliament did all the really hard work

2871
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:12,719
and so

2872
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:15,039
just just the fact that they doubted

2873
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:16,880
that pearman had done that like was

2874
01:42:15,039 --> 01:42:18,880
enough for him to say i'm not i'm not

2875
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,719
interested in this prize and that was

2876
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,960
one of the reasons why he rejected the

2877
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:25,920
fields medal it then you also rejected

2878
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:27,679
the clay prize so the poincare

2879
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,679
conjecture was one of the millennium

2880
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:31,679
prices there was a million dollar prize

2881
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:33,840
associated with that problem and that

2882
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:35,920
has to have to do with the fact that for

2883
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,480
them to attribute that price i think it

2884
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:40,319
had to be published on a journal yes the

2885
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:42,559
proof and again

2886
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:44,639
paramount principles of

2887
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:46,080
like interfered here and and he also

2888
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:48,800
just didn't care about the money he's

2889
01:42:46,079 --> 01:42:50,319
like um clay i think was a businessman

2890
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:52,000
and he's like doesn't have to do

2891
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:53,920
anything with with mathematics i don't

2892
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,279
care about these like um

2893
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:57,279
that's one of the reasons why we

2894
01:42:55,279 --> 01:43:00,079
rejected that yeah there's

2895
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:03,118
it's hard to convert into words but

2896
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:05,439
at mit i'm

2897
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:07,439
distinctly aware of the distinction

2898
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:09,118
between when i enter a room there's a

2899
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:10,960
certain kind of music

2900
01:43:09,118 --> 01:43:13,118
to the way people talk when we're

2901
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:14,480
talking about ideas

2902
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:16,238
versus

2903
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:18,238
what that music sounds like when we're

2904
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:21,198
talking

2905
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:23,279
when it's like bickering

2906
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:26,079
in the space of like whether it's

2907
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:28,639
politics or funding

2908
01:43:26,079 --> 01:43:31,118
or egos

2909
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:32,159
it's a different sound to it

2910
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:34,158
and i'm

2911
01:43:32,158 --> 01:43:37,198
distinctly aware of the two

2912
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:39,759
and i kind of sort of to me personally

2913
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:40,719
happiness what was just like swimming

2914
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:43,280
around

2915
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:45,679
the one that like is the political stuff

2916
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:47,759
or the money stuff and all that

2917
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:48,800
uh or egos

2918
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,000
uh

2919
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,000
and i think that's probably what

2920
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,238
prominent is as well like the moment he

2921
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,319
senses there's any as with a feels

2922
01:43:54,238 --> 01:43:59,439
matter like the moment you start

2923
01:43:56,319 --> 01:44:01,840
to have any kind of drama around credit

2924
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:03,439
assignment all those kinds of things

2925
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:05,440
it's almost not that it's important who

2926
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:06,960
gets the credit it's like the drama in

2927
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:08,719
itself gets in the way of the

2928
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:11,520
exploration of the ideas or the

2929
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:13,359
fundamental thing that makes science

2930
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,199
so damn beautiful and and you can really

2931
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:18,399
see that there's also a product of that

2932
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:20,799
russian school of like doing science

2933
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:23,118
and you can see that that um

2934
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,800
that people were you know during the

2935
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:26,880
cold war a lot of mathematicians they

2936
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:29,360
were not making any money they were

2937
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:31,199
doing math for the sake of math

2938
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:33,279
like for the intellectual

2939
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:35,519
pleasure of like solving a difficult

2940
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:37,118
problem yeah and you know even even if

2941
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:39,040
it was a flawed system and there were a

2942
01:44:37,118 --> 01:44:41,279
lot of problems with with that

2943
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:43,198
there's these they were able to to

2944
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:45,279
actually achieve these and uh there were

2945
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:47,279
a lot of imperiment for me is the

2946
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:49,920
perfect product of that it just cared

2947
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:51,439
about like working on tough problems he

2948
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,118
didn't care about anything else it was

2949
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:55,919
just math

2950
01:44:53,118 --> 01:44:58,238
you know pure math yeah there's a like

2951
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:59,840
for the broader audience i think another

2952
01:44:58,238 --> 01:45:02,799
example of that is

2953
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:05,039
like professional sports versus olympics

2954
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,800
i've especially in russia i've seen that

2955
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:10,479
clear distinction

2956
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:13,119
where because the state manages

2957
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:15,919
so much of the olympic process in russia

2958
01:45:13,118 --> 01:45:18,719
as people know the steroids yes yes yes

2959
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:22,158
but outside of the steroids thing uh is

2960
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:23,520
like the athlete can focus on

2961
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:26,399
the pure

2962
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:28,560
artistry of the sport like

2963
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:30,000
like not worry about the money not just

2964
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,840
in the way they talk about it the way

2965
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,800
they think about it the way

2966
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,840
they define excellence versus like

2967
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:38,000
in the

2968
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:39,920
perhaps a bit of a capitalist system in

2969
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
united states with

2970
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:43,440
american football with baseball

2971
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,920
basketball

2972
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:48,000
so much of the discussion

2973
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:50,000
is about money

2974
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,760
now of course at the end of the day it's

2975
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,118
about excellence and artistry and all

2976
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:56,320
that but

2977
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:59,759
when the culture is so richly grounded

2978
01:45:56,319 --> 01:46:02,639
in discussions of money and

2979
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:05,679
uh sort of this capitalistic like uh

2980
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:08,319
merch and businesses and all those kinds

2981
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:09,520
of things it changes the nature of the

2982
01:46:08,319 --> 01:46:11,279
activity

2983
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:14,080
and it's in a way that's hard again to

2984
01:46:11,279 --> 01:46:16,319
describe in words but when it's purely

2985
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:18,238
about the activity itself

2986
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:20,960
it's almost like

2987
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:22,799
you quiet down all the noise enough to

2988
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:24,880
hear the signal enough to hear the

2989
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,880
beauty like whenever you're talking

2990
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:28,639
about the money that's when

2991
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,480
the marketing people come and the

2992
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:32,159
business people the non-creators come

2993
01:46:30,479 --> 01:46:33,678
and they fill the room and there's they

2994
01:46:32,158 --> 01:46:35,839
create drama and they know how to create

2995
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:37,760
the drama and the noise as opposed to

2996
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,960
people who are truly excellent at what

2997
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:42,400
they do the

2998
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:44,639
the person in their arena right

2999
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:46,479
like when you remove all the money and

3000
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:48,880
you just let

3001
01:46:46,479 --> 01:46:51,439
that thing shine that's when true

3002
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,319
excellence can and can come out and that

3003
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:54,319
was

3004
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:56,960
of the few things that work with the

3005
01:46:54,319 --> 01:46:59,439
communist system the soviet union to me

3006
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:03,359
at least as somebody who loves sport and

3007
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:05,839
loves mathematics and uh science

3008
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:08,000
that worked well removing the money from

3009
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,279
the picture

3010
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,118
uh

3011
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:13,039
you know not that i'm um

3012
01:47:11,118 --> 01:47:14,079
not that i'm saying poverty is good for

3013
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:16,560
science

3014
01:47:14,079 --> 01:47:18,399
there's some level in which not worrying

3015
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,560
about money

3016
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:21,839
is good for science it's a weird i'm not

3017
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:23,920
exactly sure what to make of that

3018
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:25,760
because capitalism works really damn

3019
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,840
well yeah but

3020
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:30,719
it's um

3021
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:32,560
it's tricky how to find that balance one

3022
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:34,000
fields metal list that is interesting to

3023
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:36,239
look at and i think you mentioned it

3024
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,840
earlier but is cedric villani which is

3025
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:38,799
might be the only

3026
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,639
uh

3027
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:43,360
phil's medalist that is also a

3028
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:45,679
politician now but so it's this it's

3029
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:48,880
this brilliant french mathematician

3030
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:51,600
that won the fields medal and and after

3031
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:54,000
that he decided that

3032
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:55,039
one of the ways that he could have

3033
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,198
could have

3034
01:47:55,039 --> 01:47:59,198
you know the biggest leverage kind of is

3035
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:00,238
in pushing science in the direction that

3036
01:47:59,198 --> 01:48:03,279
he thinks

3037
01:48:00,238 --> 01:48:05,279
science should go would be to to try to

3038
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:06,719
go into politics and so that's what he

3039
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:08,960
did and and uh

3040
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:09,920
and the israel i'm not sure if he has

3041
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:11,920
won

3042
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,960
in any election but i think he's running

3043
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:14,880
for a mayor

3044
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:17,520
of paris or something like that but it's

3045
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:18,480
this brilliant mathematician that

3046
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,600
before

3047
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:23,599
winning the fields medal had only been

3048
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,039
just a brilliant mathematician but but

3049
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,360
after that he decided to go into

3050
01:48:25,039 --> 01:48:28,800
politics to to try to to have an impact

3051
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:31,679
and try to change some of the things

3052
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:34,639
that he he would complain about before

3053
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:36,000
so so there's that component

3054
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:37,679
as well

3055
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,319
yeah and i've always thought mathematics

3056
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:42,560
and science should be like like james

3057
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:45,118
bond

3058
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:47,920
would in my eyes i think be sexier if

3059
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:49,039
you did math like we should as a society

3060
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:50,960
put

3061
01:48:49,039 --> 01:48:52,719
excellence in mathematics

3062
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:54,239
at the same level as being able to kill

3063
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,239
a man with your bare hands like those

3064
01:48:54,238 --> 01:48:58,638
are both useful feature like

3065
01:48:56,238 --> 01:49:00,718
that's admirable it's like oh like that

3066
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:01,840
makes you like that makes the person

3067
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:03,760
interesting

3068
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:05,920
like being extremely well read about

3069
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:07,920
history or philosophy being good in

3070
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,840
mathematics being able to kill a man

3071
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:12,399
with bare hands those are all the same

3072
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,920
in my book so i think all are useful for

3073
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:15,679
action stars

3074
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:18,000
and i think the society will benefit for

3075
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:19,920
uh for giving more value to that like

3076
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,399
one of the things that bothers me about

3077
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:24,639
american culture

3078
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:26,238
is the

3079
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:28,159
i don't know the right words to use but

3080
01:49:26,238 --> 01:49:29,359
like the nerdiness associated with

3081
01:49:28,158 --> 01:49:30,638
science

3082
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:33,920
like

3083
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:38,400
like in i i don't think nerd is a good

3084
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:40,399
word in in american culture because uh

3085
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:43,759
it's seen as like weakness there's like

3086
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:46,000
images that come with that and it's fine

3087
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:48,239
you could you could be all kinds of uh

3088
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
shapes and colors and personalities but

3089
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:51,039
like

3090
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,118
to me

3091
01:49:51,039 --> 01:49:56,639
uh having sophisticated knowledge in

3092
01:49:53,118 --> 01:49:57,920
science being good at math doesn't mean

3093
01:49:56,639 --> 01:50:00,480
you're weak

3094
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:02,399
in fact it could be the very opposite

3095
01:50:00,479 --> 01:50:04,559
and so it's it's an interesting thing

3096
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:07,759
because it was very much differently

3097
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:09,360
viewed in the uh in the soviet union so

3098
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,199
i know for sure

3099
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:13,920
as an existence proof

3100
01:50:11,198 --> 01:50:15,439
that it doesn't have to be that way but

3101
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,520
it um

3102
01:50:15,439 --> 01:50:19,198
i also feel like we lack a lot of

3103
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,480
like role models in terms if you ask

3104
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:21,439
people like

3105
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:23,439
mention

3106
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:25,439
to mention one mathematician that they

3107
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:27,198
know that is alive today i think a lot

3108
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:29,759
of people would struggle

3109
01:50:27,198 --> 01:50:31,598
to answer that question um

3110
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:34,880
and i also think

3111
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:36,800
i love neil degrasse tyson okay

3112
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:38,960
but

3113
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:40,960
there is uh

3114
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:43,279
having more role models is good like

3115
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,920
different kinds of personalities he he

3116
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:47,198
has kind of fun and and it's very it's

3117
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,880
uh like

3118
01:50:47,198 --> 01:50:51,359
bill nye the science guy i don't know if

3119
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:53,920
you guys know him so like that spectrum

3120
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:56,799
that yeah but there there's not

3121
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:58,960
like feynman is no longer there

3122
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,719
uh those kinds of personalities

3123
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:04,639
even carl sagan yeah

3124
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:07,359
like a seriousness that's like not

3125
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:09,279
playful like not apologetical yeah

3126
01:51:07,359 --> 01:51:11,279
exactly not apologetic about being

3127
01:51:09,279 --> 01:51:12,238
knowledgeable like

3128
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:15,759
like

3129
01:51:12,238 --> 01:51:17,359
in fact like the kind of energy

3130
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,840
where

3131
01:51:17,359 --> 01:51:21,920
you feel

3132
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:23,840
uh self-conscious about not having

3133
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:26,480
thought about some of these questions

3134
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:28,560
right just like when i see james bond i

3135
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:30,399
feel bad about that i don't

3136
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:32,000
have never killed a man like i need to

3137
01:51:30,399 --> 01:51:33,759
make sure i fix that right that's the

3138
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
way i feel so the same way i want to

3139
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:38,159
feel like that way well carl sagan talks

3140
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
i i feel like i need to have that same

3141
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:41,759
kind of seriousness about science like

3142
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,359
if i don't know something i want to i

3143
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,119
want to know well

3144
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:47,118
what about terence tao

3145
01:51:45,118 --> 01:51:49,039
he's kind of a superstar what are your

3146
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:50,880
thoughts about him true he's probably

3147
01:51:49,039 --> 01:51:52,719
one of the most famous mathematicians

3148
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,520
alive today and problem of i mean

3149
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:59,198
regardless of like is of course uh

3150
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:01,840
he want to feel the fields medal is

3151
01:51:59,198 --> 01:52:02,719
really smart and talented mathematician

3152
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:07,199
um

3153
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:08,639
it's also like a big inspiration for us

3154
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:09,919
at least

3155
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:12,639
for some of the work that we do with

3156
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:14,960
formats library so terence style is is

3157
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:16,960
known for having you know a big blog and

3158
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:19,760
he's pretty open about

3159
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:22,239
like his research and he also

3160
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:24,000
he tries to make his work as public as

3161
01:52:22,238 --> 01:52:26,559
possible um

3162
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:29,039
through his blog posts um in fact

3163
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,639
there's a really interesting um

3164
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:34,000
problem that got solved a couple of

3165
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:36,239
years ago so tao was working with um on

3166
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,800
a problem on an erdos problem actually

3167
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:41,678
so if paul erdogan was this

3168
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:43,599
mathematician from hungary and it was

3169
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:44,800
known for like um

3170
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:45,920
the airdosh

3171
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,119
for a lot of things but one of the

3172
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,760
things that he was also known was for

3173
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:51,920
the erdos problem so he was always like

3174
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,920
um creating these problems and usually

3175
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,520
associating prizes with those problems

3176
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:57,840
and a lot of those problems are still

3177
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:00,000
open like and and there will be some of

3178
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,679
them will be open for like maybe

3179
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,439
a couple hundred years and i think

3180
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:05,118
that's actually an interesting hack for

3181
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:07,439
him to collaborate with future

3182
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:09,839
mathematicians you know his his name

3183
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:11,919
will will keep coming up in you know for

3184
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:13,599
future generations but so tao was

3185
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:16,319
working on one of these problems called

3186
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:18,239
the erdog discrepancy and he published a

3187
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:20,238
blog post on like

3188
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:23,678
about that prop about that problem and

3189
01:53:20,238 --> 01:53:25,519
he reached like a dead end and then um

3190
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:27,840
all of a sudden there was this guy from

3191
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:30,880
from germany that wrote like a comment

3192
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:32,000
on his blog post saying okay like

3193
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,239
some of the

3194
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,760
so this problem is like a sudoku like

3195
01:53:34,238 --> 01:53:38,479
flavor and some of the machinery that

3196
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:40,480
we're using to solve the sudoku could be

3197
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:42,158
used here and that was actually the key

3198
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:43,919
to solve their those discrepancy

3199
01:53:42,158 --> 01:53:46,079
problems so the there was a comment on

3200
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:48,319
his blog and i think that that that for

3201
01:53:46,079 --> 01:53:50,000
me is an example of like how to do

3202
01:53:48,319 --> 01:53:53,519
again going back to collaborative

3203
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:56,399
science online um and the power that it

3204
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:57,679
has but taw is is also like pretty

3205
01:53:56,399 --> 01:54:00,158
public about

3206
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:02,800
uh like some of the struggles and of of

3207
01:54:00,158 --> 01:54:05,118
being a a mathematician like and and

3208
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:07,639
even he wrote about some of the

3209
01:54:05,118 --> 01:54:10,719
unintended consequences of having

3210
01:54:07,639 --> 01:54:12,480
extraordinary ability in a field and

3211
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:15,198
used himself as an example when he was

3212
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:17,118
growing up he was extremely talented in

3213
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:18,079
in mathematics from a young age like

3214
01:54:17,118 --> 01:54:21,198
todd was

3215
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:22,800
a person he won an uh medal in like one

3216
01:54:21,198 --> 01:54:24,559
of the imo's at the age i think was a

3217
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,520
gold medal at the age of 10 or something

3218
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:27,520
like that

3219
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:29,360
and so he mentioned that when he was

3220
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:31,599
growing up like and especially in

3221
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:34,639
college when he was in a class that he

3222
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:36,159
enjoyed it didn't it just came very

3223
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:38,960
natural for him and he didn't have to

3224
01:54:36,158 --> 01:54:41,359
work hard to just ace the class and when

3225
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:44,158
he found that the class was boring like

3226
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:46,719
it didn't work and he barely passed

3227
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:48,960
barely passed some i think in college he

3228
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:51,118
almost failed two classes

3229
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:53,118
and and he was talking about that and

3230
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:55,839
how he brought those studying habits or

3231
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:57,759
like uh in existence of studying habits

3232
01:54:55,840 --> 01:55:00,319
when he went to prison princeton for his

3233
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:02,639
phd and in for instance when he you know

3234
01:55:00,319 --> 01:55:05,359
started kind of

3235
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:07,520
delving into more complex problems

3236
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:09,118
and classes he struggled a lot because

3237
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:11,119
he didn't have that

3238
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:13,198
those those habits like it wasn't taking

3239
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:15,359
notes and it was he wasn't studying hard

3240
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:18,238
when he when he faced problems

3241
01:55:15,359 --> 01:55:22,000
and he almost failed out of his his phd

3242
01:55:18,238 --> 01:55:23,439
he almost failed his phd exam and um

3243
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,279
it talks about like having this

3244
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:27,839
conversation with with this advisor and

3245
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:29,198
the advisor pointing out like you're not

3246
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,119
this is not working

3247
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:32,638
you might have to get out of the program

3248
01:55:31,118 --> 01:55:36,000
and like how that was a kind of a

3249
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:37,760
turning point for him and um

3250
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,238
and like it was super important in his

3251
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,239
career so i think tao is also like this

3252
01:55:40,238 --> 01:55:43,759
figure that apart from being just an

3253
01:55:42,238 --> 01:55:45,759
exceptional mathematician he's also

3254
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:47,679
pretty open about you know what what it

3255
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:49,520
takes to to to be a mathematician and

3256
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:51,279
some of the struggles of these type of

3257
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:52,560
careers and and i think it's that's

3258
01:55:51,279 --> 01:55:54,238
super important

3259
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,920
in many ways he's a contributor to open

3260
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:59,279
science and open humanity so he's being

3261
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:01,599
an open human

3262
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:03,118
through by communicating uh scott

3263
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:05,599
aaronson is another in computer science

3264
01:56:03,118 --> 01:56:07,359
world who's a very different style very

3265
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:09,279
different style but there's something

3266
01:56:07,359 --> 01:56:11,519
about a blog that

3267
01:56:09,279 --> 01:56:13,039
is authentic and real and just gives us

3268
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:15,679
a window into the

3269
01:56:13,039 --> 01:56:17,840
into the mind and soul of of of these

3270
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:19,760
brilliant folks so it's it's definitely

3271
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:22,000
a gift let me ask you about fermat's

3272
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:24,000
library on twitter

3273
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,520
which uh

3274
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,800
i mean i don't know how to describe it

3275
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:28,560
people should definitely just follow

3276
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:30,960
from ours library on twitter

3277
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:33,760
i i keep following and unfollowing for

3278
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:35,920
my library because

3279
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:39,199
because uh it's so

3280
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:42,639
it it gives when i follow it um

3281
01:56:39,198 --> 01:56:43,519
leads me on down rabbit holes often that

3282
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:44,880
um

3283
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:48,159
that

3284
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:50,719
um that are very fruitful but

3285
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:52,879
but anyway so the the the posts you do

3286
01:56:50,719 --> 01:56:54,000
with the on twitter are just these

3287
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:56,239
beautiful

3288
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,479
are things that reveal some beautiful

3289
01:56:56,238 --> 01:57:00,079
aspect of mathematics

3290
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:02,000
um is there

3291
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:04,479
um is there something you could say

3292
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,679
about the approach there yeah

3293
01:57:04,479 --> 01:57:08,000
and um

3294
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:08,000
maybe

3295
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:12,319
maybe broadly what you find beautiful

3296
01:57:10,399 --> 01:57:14,638
about mathematics and then more

3297
01:57:12,319 --> 01:57:17,118
specifically how

3298
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:19,440
you convert that into a rigorous process

3299
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:21,118
of revealing that in tweet form that's a

3300
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:23,359
good point i think there's something

3301
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:25,679
about math that you know a lot of the

3302
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:27,920
mathematical content and you know paper

3303
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:29,359
papers are like little proofs

3304
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,158
um you know

3305
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:33,118
has

3306
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:35,039
in a way sort of an infinite half-life

3307
01:57:33,118 --> 01:57:37,759
what i mean by that is that if you look

3308
01:57:35,039 --> 01:57:40,399
at like euclid's elements it's as valid

3309
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:42,880
today as it was when it was created like

3310
01:57:40,399 --> 01:57:45,279
2 000 years ago and that's not true for

3311
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,480
a lot of other scientific fields

3312
01:57:45,279 --> 01:57:47,359
um

3313
01:57:46,479 --> 01:57:49,839
and so

3314
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:53,519
in regards to twitter i think

3315
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:55,840
there's also a very it's a very undex

3316
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,360
underexplored platform from a learning

3317
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,599
perspective

3318
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:01,920
i think if you look at content on

3319
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:04,000
twitter it's very easy to consume it's

3320
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:05,199
very easy to read

3321
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,599
um

3322
01:58:05,198 --> 01:58:09,839
and especially when you're

3323
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:12,400
trying to explain something you know we

3324
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:14,000
humans get a dopamine hit if we learn

3325
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:16,879
something new

3326
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:19,439
and that's a very very powerful feeling

3327
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,039
and that's why you know people go to

3328
01:58:19,439 --> 01:58:23,279
classes when you have a really good

3329
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:25,840
professor you know it's it's looking for

3330
01:58:23,279 --> 01:58:26,880
those dopamine hits and

3331
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,560
and and

3332
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:30,639
and that's something that we try to

3333
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,639
explore when we're producing content on

3334
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:34,560
twitter imagine if we we could

3335
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:36,560
if you would on a line to a restaurant

3336
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:38,560
you could go go to your phone to learn

3337
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:39,679
something new instead of social

3338
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:42,880
going to a

3339
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:44,079
you know social network to just and so

3340
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:47,440
and i think

3341
01:58:44,079 --> 01:58:49,279
it's very hard to to sometimes to

3342
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:50,399
kind of provide that feeling because you

3343
01:58:49,279 --> 01:58:53,599
need to

3344
01:58:50,399 --> 01:58:55,839
sometimes digest content and and put it

3345
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,679
in a way you know that it feeds 280

3346
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:59,840
characters um

3347
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:02,000
and and it requires a lot of

3348
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:04,159
sometimes time to do that even though

3349
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,960
it's easy to consume it's hard to make

3350
01:59:04,158 --> 01:59:08,960
but once you are able to to provide that

3351
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:10,960
eureka moment to people

3352
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:12,880
like that's very powerful they get that

3353
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:15,039
dopamine hit and like you create this

3354
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:17,760
feedback cycle and people come back for

3355
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:19,599
for more and in twitter compared to like

3356
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,440
you know an online course for a book you

3357
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:23,520
have a zero percent dropout so people

3358
01:59:21,439 --> 01:59:26,319
will will read the content the content

3359
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:28,000
so that it's it's like it's part of the

3360
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:29,840
creators like the person that is

3361
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,158
creating the content if you're able to

3362
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:33,840
actually get that feedback cycle it's

3363
01:59:32,158 --> 01:59:36,238
super super powerful

3364
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:38,480
yeah but some of the stuff is like like

3365
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:41,279
how the heck do you find that and and i

3366
01:59:38,479 --> 01:59:42,319
don't know why it's so appealing it uh

3367
01:59:41,279 --> 01:59:45,759
like

3368
01:59:42,319 --> 01:59:47,359
uh this is from uh what is it

3369
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:49,520
a couple days ago

3370
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:51,759
i'll just read out the number two three

3371
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:53,760
four five six seven eight nine is the

3372
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:56,560
largest prime number with consecutive

3373
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:57,679
increasing digits

3374
01:59:56,560 --> 02:00:00,000
i mean

3375
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:01,840
that is so cool that's like some weird

3376
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,639
like glimpse

3377
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:06,639
into some deep universal truth

3378
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:09,599
even though it's just a number

3379
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:11,679
i mean that's like so arbitrary like why

3380
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:13,679
why is it so pleasant that that's a

3381
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:16,158
thing but it is in some way it's almost

3382
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:17,679
like it is a little glimpse at some

3383
02:00:16,158 --> 02:00:20,158
much bigger

3384
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:22,079
like um and and i think like especially

3385
02:00:20,158 --> 02:00:23,359
if we're talking about science there's

3386
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:25,679
something unique

3387
02:00:23,359 --> 02:00:27,359
about you go and with a lot of the

3388
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:28,880
tweets you go sometimes from a state of

3389
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:29,759
not knowing something to knowing

3390
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:32,159
something

3391
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:34,480
and that is very particular to science

3392
02:00:32,158 --> 02:00:36,559
science math physics and that again is

3393
02:00:34,479 --> 02:00:40,959
extra extremely addictive and that's

3394
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:42,800
that's how i i i feel about that and um

3395
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,800
that's why i think people engage so much

3396
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:46,400
with with our tweets and go into rabbit

3397
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:48,480
holes and then they you know we start

3398
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:50,719
with prime numbers and all of a sudden

3399
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:51,678
you are spending hours reading number

3400
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:54,719
theory

3401
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:56,800
things and you go into wikipedia and you

3402
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:58,158
lose a lot of time there but

3403
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:00,560
well the variety is really interesting

3404
02:00:58,158 --> 02:01:02,479
too there's human things there's uh

3405
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:05,039
there's physics things

3406
02:01:02,479 --> 02:01:06,959
there's like numeric things like like i

3407
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:09,439
just mentioned but there's also

3408
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:11,359
more rigorous mathematical things

3409
02:01:09,439 --> 02:01:13,198
there's stuff that's tied to the history

3410
02:01:11,359 --> 02:01:15,359
of math and the proofs and

3411
02:01:13,198 --> 02:01:17,118
this visual there's animations

3412
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:19,439
that are looping animations that are

3413
02:01:17,118 --> 02:01:21,039
incredible that reveal something

3414
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:23,279
there's uh

3415
02:01:21,039 --> 02:01:25,679
andrew wiles i'm being smart and this is

3416
02:01:23,279 --> 02:01:27,198
just me now like

3417
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:29,359
ignoring you guys and just going through

3418
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:30,799
oh yeah we're a bit like math drug

3419
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:32,238
dealers we're just trying to get you

3420
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,719
hooked you know we're trying to give you

3421
02:01:32,238 --> 02:01:36,718
that hit and trying to get you hooked

3422
02:01:34,719 --> 02:01:38,399
yes some people are brighter than others

3423
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,840
but i really believe that most people

3424
02:01:38,399 --> 02:01:42,079
can really get

3425
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:44,000
to to quite a good level of mathematics

3426
02:01:42,079 --> 02:01:45,840
if they're prepared to deal with these

3427
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
psychological issues of how to handle

3428
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:50,159
the situation of being stuck yeah yeah

3429
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,800
there's some truth to that that's truth

3430
02:01:50,158 --> 02:01:54,719
i feel that's like really

3431
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:57,039
it's some truth in terms of research and

3432
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:58,560
also about startups you're they're stuck

3433
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:00,238
a lot of the time

3434
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:02,000
before you you get to a breakthrough and

3435
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:04,319
and it's difficult to endure that

3436
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,319
process of like being stuck and because

3437
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:10,000
you're not trying to to be in that

3438
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:11,519
position um i feel uh yeah that's

3439
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:13,760
yeah most people are broken by the

3440
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:15,679
stuckness or like they're destroy like

3441
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:18,400
uh

3442
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:20,399
i i've i've been very cognizant of the

3443
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:22,238
fact that

3444
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:24,079
more and more social media becomes a

3445
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:26,799
thing

3446
02:02:24,079 --> 02:02:28,800
like distractions become a thing that

3447
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:31,920
that moment of being stuck

3448
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:34,639
is uh your mind wants to to go do stuff

3449
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:36,319
that's unrelated to being stuck and

3450
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:38,560
you should be stuck i'm referring to

3451
02:02:36,319 --> 02:02:39,359
small stucknesses

3452
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:40,960
like

3453
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:42,479
you're like trying to design something

3454
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:43,520
and it's a dead end basically little

3455
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:45,279
dead ends

3456
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:47,280
on dead ends and programming dead ends

3457
02:02:45,279 --> 02:02:49,759
and trying to think through something

3458
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:50,719
and then your mind wants to like

3459
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:52,560
like

3460
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:53,599
like uh this is the problem with this

3461
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:56,719
like

3462
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:59,760
work-life balance culture is like

3463
02:02:56,719 --> 02:03:01,520
take a break like as if taking a break

3464
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:03,119
will solve everything sometimes it

3465
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:04,560
solves quite a bit but like sometimes

3466
02:03:03,118 --> 02:03:06,399
you need to sit in a stuckness and

3467
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,199
suffer a little bit and then take a

3468
02:03:06,399 --> 02:03:09,839
break

3469
02:03:07,198 --> 02:03:12,238
but you you definitely need to be

3470
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:14,319
and like most people quit

3471
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:17,759
from that psychological battle of being

3472
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:21,039
stuck and so success is people who

3473
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:22,960
who who uh persevere through that yeah

3474
02:03:21,039 --> 02:03:24,880
yeah and and in the creative process

3475
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:27,599
that's also true i was the other day i

3476
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:29,359
was i think was reading about is this um

3477
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:31,039
what is his name ed sheeran like the

3478
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:33,039
musician yeah was talking a little bit

3479
02:03:31,039 --> 02:03:35,359
about the creative process and using was

3480
02:03:33,039 --> 02:03:37,439
using this analogy of a faucet like

3481
02:03:35,359 --> 02:03:39,519
where you when you turn on a faucet as

3482
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:40,479
like the dirty water coming out in the

3483
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,639
beginning

3484
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:44,959
and you just have to you know keep

3485
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:47,440
trusting that at some point your clean

3486
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:48,800
clean clear water will come out but you

3487
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:50,879
have to endure that process like in the

3488
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:53,599
beginning it's going to be dirty water

3489
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:56,000
and and and just you know

3490
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:58,319
embrace that yeah actually this uh the

3491
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,000
entirety of my youtube channel and this

3492
02:03:58,319 --> 02:04:01,920
podcast have been following that

3493
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,920
philosophy of dirty water

3494
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:06,000
like i've been you know

3495
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:07,840
i do believe that like you have to get

3496
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:10,479
all the crap out of your system first

3497
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:12,639
and uh sometimes it's it's all

3498
02:04:10,479 --> 02:04:14,238
sometimes it's all crappy work

3499
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:15,440
i mean i tend to be very self-critical

3500
02:04:14,238 --> 02:04:17,598
but i do

3501
02:04:15,439 --> 02:04:19,519
think that quantity leads to quality for

3502
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:21,599
some people it does for my the way my

3503
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:24,560
mind works is like just keep

3504
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:26,000
putting stuff out there keep creating

3505
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:28,639
and uh

3506
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,319
the quality will come as opposed to

3507
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:32,239
sitting there waiting

3508
02:04:30,319 --> 02:04:33,759
not doing anything until

3509
02:04:32,238 --> 02:04:35,839
the thing seems perfect because the

3510
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:38,880
perfect may never come

3511
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:41,199
but just just on like on on our twitter

3512
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:42,639
like profile i really and sometimes when

3513
02:04:41,198 --> 02:04:44,559
you look on some of those tweets they

3514
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:45,440
might seem like pretty

3515
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,840
kind of

3516
02:04:45,439 --> 02:04:50,879
um you know why is this interesting it's

3517
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:52,960
like so raw uh like it's just a number

3518
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,880
but i really believe that especially

3519
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:57,359
with math or physics

3520
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:59,440
it is possible to get everyone to love

3521
02:04:57,359 --> 02:05:01,920
math or physics even if you think you

3522
02:04:59,439 --> 02:05:03,359
hate it it's it's not a function of the

3523
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:05,359
student or the person that is on the

3524
02:05:03,359 --> 02:05:08,078
other side i think is just purely a

3525
02:05:05,359 --> 02:05:10,078
function of like how you explain uh

3526
02:05:08,078 --> 02:05:11,519
hidden beauty that they hadn't realized

3527
02:05:10,078 --> 02:05:13,759
before

3528
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:15,360
it's not easy but i think it's like a

3529
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:18,560
lot of the times it's on like on the

3530
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:20,559
creator's side to to be able to like

3531
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:23,039
show that beauty to the other person i

3532
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:25,039
think some of that is native to to

3533
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:27,519
humans we just have that curiosity and

3534
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:29,519
you look at small toddlers and babies

3535
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,880
and like them trying to figure things

3536
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,679
out and there's just something that is

3537
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:35,359
born with us that we we we want for that

3538
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:37,599
understanding we want to figure out the

3539
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:40,078
world around us and and so

3540
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:42,000
yeah it shouldn't be like uh whether or

3541
02:05:40,078 --> 02:05:43,920
not people are going are going to to

3542
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,560
enjoy it like

3543
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:48,800
i i i also really believe that everybody

3544
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:50,880
has that capacity to fall in love with

3545
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:53,039
with math and physics

3546
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:54,480
you mentioned startup

3547
02:05:53,039 --> 02:05:57,198
what do you think it takes to build a

3548
02:05:54,479 --> 02:06:00,959
successful startup yeah that

3549
02:05:57,198 --> 02:06:02,960
it's what what louise was saying that um

3550
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:05,520
you need to in to be able to endure

3551
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:08,319
being stuck and and i think

3552
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:09,840
the best way to put it is that startups

3553
02:06:08,319 --> 02:06:12,158
don't have

3554
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:14,560
a linear reward function

3555
02:06:12,158 --> 02:06:16,960
right you oftentimes don't get rewarded

3556
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:19,840
for effort and and

3557
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:21,520
in most of our lives we go through

3558
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:22,639
these processes that

3559
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:24,719
do

3560
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:26,560
give you those small rewards for effort

3561
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:28,078
right in school you study hard generally

3562
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,800
you'll get a good grade and then you

3563
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:32,479
good you get like good grades ever or

3564
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:34,719
you get grades every semester and so

3565
02:06:32,479 --> 02:06:36,399
you're you're slowly

3566
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:37,760
getting rewarded and pushed in the right

3567
02:06:36,399 --> 02:06:40,399
direction

3568
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:42,159
for for startups and startups are not

3569
02:06:40,399 --> 02:06:44,238
the only thing that is like this but for

3570
02:06:42,158 --> 02:06:46,238
startups it's you know you can put in a

3571
02:06:44,238 --> 02:06:48,559
ton of effort into something

3572
02:06:46,238 --> 02:06:50,959
that and then get no reward for it right

3573
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:53,199
it's like like sisyphus boulder where

3574
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:54,399
you're pushing that boulder up the

3575
02:06:53,198 --> 02:06:56,399
mountain

3576
02:06:54,399 --> 02:06:58,719
and and and you get to the top and then

3577
02:06:56,399 --> 02:07:00,479
it just rolls all the way back down

3578
02:06:58,719 --> 02:07:02,480
and and so that's something that i think

3579
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:06,158
a lot of people are not equipped to deal

3580
02:07:02,479 --> 02:07:08,399
with and can be incredibly demoralizing

3581
02:07:06,158 --> 02:07:10,000
especially if that happens more than

3582
02:07:08,399 --> 02:07:11,920
than a few times

3583
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:15,039
and so but i think it's absolutely

3584
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:17,440
essential to to power through it because

3585
02:07:15,039 --> 02:07:20,000
uh by the nature of startups it's often

3586
02:07:17,439 --> 02:07:23,039
times you know you're dealing with with

3587
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:25,920
with non-obvious ideas and things that

3588
02:07:23,039 --> 02:07:28,319
there might be contrarian and so you're

3589
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:29,679
gonna you're gonna run into into that a

3590
02:07:28,319 --> 02:07:31,840
lot you're gonna do things that are not

3591
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:34,399
gonna work out uh and you need to be

3592
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:36,400
prepared to deal with that but

3593
02:07:34,399 --> 02:07:38,238
but we're not coming out of college

3594
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:40,479
you're you're just not equipped i'm not

3595
02:07:38,238 --> 02:07:43,118
sure if there's a way to train people to

3596
02:07:40,479 --> 02:07:45,198
deal with those non-linear reward

3597
02:07:43,118 --> 02:07:47,439
functions but it's definitely i think

3598
02:07:45,198 --> 02:07:48,638
one of the most difficult things to you

3599
02:07:47,439 --> 02:07:50,879
know

3600
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:52,480
about doing a startup and also happens

3601
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:54,078
in research sometimes you know we're

3602
02:07:52,479 --> 02:07:56,638
talking about the default studies being

3603
02:07:54,078 --> 02:07:58,559
stuck you just you know you don't like

3604
02:07:56,639 --> 02:08:01,440
you try things you get zero results you

3605
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:04,320
close doors you constantly closing doors

3606
02:08:01,439 --> 02:08:06,319
until you you know find something and um

3607
02:08:04,319 --> 02:08:07,759
yeah that is a big thing

3608
02:08:06,319 --> 02:08:08,880
what about sort of this point when

3609
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:11,039
you're stuck

3610
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:12,639
there's a kind of decision whether you

3611
02:08:11,039 --> 02:08:15,118
if you have a vision

3612
02:08:12,639 --> 02:08:16,639
to persist through through with this

3613
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:18,559
direction that you've been going along

3614
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:21,279
or what a lot of startups do or

3615
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:24,239
businesses is pivot

3616
02:08:21,279 --> 02:08:25,840
how do you decide whether like

3617
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:28,559
to give up

3618
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:31,360
on a particular flavor of the way you've

3619
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:33,599
imagined the design and to like adjust

3620
02:08:31,359 --> 02:08:37,359
it or completely

3621
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:39,199
like alter it i think that's a core

3622
02:08:37,359 --> 02:08:42,158
question for startups that i've asked

3623
02:08:39,198 --> 02:08:44,000
myself exactly and like i've never been

3624
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:46,319
able to come up with a great framework

3625
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:49,039
to make those decisions um i think

3626
02:08:46,319 --> 02:08:51,599
that's really at the core of

3627
02:08:49,039 --> 02:08:52,960
uh yeah out of a lot of the the toughest

3628
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:54,800
questions that

3629
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:57,520
that people that's that started a

3630
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:59,360
company have to deal with um

3631
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:00,880
i think maybe the best framework that i

3632
02:08:59,359 --> 02:09:02,479
i

3633
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:05,440
was able to figure out like when you run

3634
02:09:02,479 --> 02:09:07,039
out of ideas you just you know you're

3635
02:09:05,439 --> 02:09:09,759
exploring something it's not working you

3636
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:11,920
try it in a different angle you know you

3637
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:14,000
try a different business model yeah when

3638
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:16,719
you run out of ideas like you don't have

3639
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,560
any more cards just

3640
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:20,239
switch and yeah

3641
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:22,239
it's not perfect

3642
02:09:20,238 --> 02:09:24,319
because you also it's you have a lot of

3643
02:09:22,238 --> 02:09:26,718
stories of startups with like

3644
02:09:24,319 --> 02:09:28,078
people kept pushing and then you know

3645
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:30,158
that paid off

3646
02:09:28,078 --> 02:09:33,679
and then you have uh philosophies

3647
02:09:30,158 --> 02:09:34,719
there's like fail fast and pivot fast um

3648
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:36,719
so it's

3649
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:38,880
you know it's hard to you know balance

3650
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:40,560
these two worlds and understand what is

3651
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:42,000
the best framework

3652
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:44,159
and i mean if you look at four miles

3653
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:46,319
library your

3654
02:09:44,158 --> 02:09:49,439
maybe you can correct me but it feels

3655
02:09:46,319 --> 02:09:51,039
like you're an operating in a space

3656
02:09:49,439 --> 02:09:52,319
where there's a lot of things that are

3657
02:09:51,039 --> 02:09:54,960
broken

3658
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:56,639
and or could be significantly improved

3659
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:59,359
so it feels like there's a lot of

3660
02:09:56,639 --> 02:10:01,599
possibilities for pivoting

3661
02:09:59,359 --> 02:10:03,279
or like how do you revolutionize science

3662
02:10:01,599 --> 02:10:05,920
how do you revolutionize

3663
02:10:03,279 --> 02:10:08,800
the aggregation the

3664
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:11,118
the annotation the commenting the

3665
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:13,039
community around information about

3666
02:10:11,118 --> 02:10:14,880
knowledge structured knowledge i mean

3667
02:10:13,039 --> 02:10:17,439
that's kind of what like stack overflow

3668
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:19,279
and stack exchange has struggled with

3669
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:21,359
to come up with a solution and they've

3670
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:23,279
come up i think with an interesting set

3671
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:24,799
of solutions that are also i think

3672
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:27,599
flawed in some ways but they're much

3673
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:29,440
much better than the alternatives

3674
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:31,119
but there's a lot of other possibilities

3675
02:10:29,439 --> 02:10:32,399
if we just look at papers as we talked

3676
02:10:31,118 --> 02:10:34,399
about there's so many possible

3677
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:36,238
revolutions and they're a lot of money

3678
02:10:34,399 --> 02:10:38,638
to be potentially made in those

3679
02:10:36,238 --> 02:10:40,559
revolutions plus coupled with that the

3680
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:42,960
benefit to humanity

3681
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:44,480
and so like you're sitting there

3682
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:46,960
like i don't know how many people are

3683
02:10:44,479 --> 02:10:48,959
legitimately from a business perspective

3684
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:51,279
playing with these ideas it feels like

3685
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:53,279
there's a lot of ideas here true there

3686
02:10:51,279 --> 02:10:55,840
is are you right now grinding in a

3687
02:10:53,279 --> 02:10:57,279
particular direction like is there a

3688
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:59,199
like a five-year vision that you're

3689
02:10:57,279 --> 02:11:02,000
thinking in your mind

3690
02:10:59,198 --> 02:11:04,638
for us it's more like a 20-year vision

3691
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:07,279
in the sense that uh we we've

3692
02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:08,639
consciously tried to make the decision

3693
02:11:07,279 --> 02:11:11,359
of

3694
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:13,359
so we so we run fermat says it's a side

3695
02:11:11,359 --> 02:11:15,598
project and it's a separate in the sense

3696
02:11:13,359 --> 02:11:17,039
like it's not what we're working on

3697
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:18,239
full-time

3698
02:11:17,039 --> 02:11:19,439
and uh

3699
02:11:18,238 --> 02:11:21,598
but

3700
02:11:19,439 --> 02:11:23,519
our thesis there is that

3701
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:25,920
we actually think that it's that's a

3702
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:28,800
good thing at least for for this stage

3703
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:30,800
of vermont's library um and also because

3704
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:32,000
some of these projects

3705
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:34,000
you just

3706
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:38,880
if you're coming from a start from a

3707
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:40,960
startup framework you probably try to

3708
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:42,319
try to fit every single idea into

3709
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:44,800
something that can change the world

3710
02:11:42,319 --> 02:11:46,639
within three to five years and there's

3711
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:48,800
just some problems that take longer than

3712
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:51,039
that right and so you know we're talking

3713
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:52,560
about archive and i'm very doubtful that

3714
02:11:51,039 --> 02:11:55,279
you could grow

3715
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:57,119
like archive into what it is today like

3716
02:11:55,279 --> 02:11:59,039
within two or three years no matter how

3717
02:11:57,118 --> 02:12:01,359
much money you throw at it there's just

3718
02:11:59,039 --> 02:12:03,519
some things that can take longer but you

3719
02:12:01,359 --> 02:12:07,118
need to be able to power through

3720
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:09,119
the the the time that it takes um but if

3721
02:12:07,118 --> 02:12:10,559
you look at it as okay this is a company

3722
02:12:09,118 --> 02:12:12,880
this is a startup we have to grow fast

3723
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:15,039
we have to raise money then uh

3724
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:17,840
then sometimes you might forgo those

3725
02:12:15,039 --> 02:12:20,719
ideas because of that um because they

3726
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:22,639
don't very well fit into the

3727
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:25,198
the typical

3728
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:27,199
startup framework and so for us formats

3729
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:29,359
it's something that we're okay with

3730
02:12:27,198 --> 02:12:32,638
growing with having it grow slowly and

3731
02:12:29,359 --> 02:12:34,880
and maybe taking many years and and and

3732
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:36,719
that's why we think it's it's not a bad

3733
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:38,480
thing that it is a side project because

3734
02:12:36,719 --> 02:12:39,760
it makes it much more

3735
02:12:38,479 --> 02:12:42,559
um

3736
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:44,719
acceptable in a way and that to to to be

3737
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:46,800
able to be okay with that that said i

3738
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:48,960
think what happens is

3739
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:51,360
if you keep pushing new little features

3740
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:53,359
new little ideas i feel like there's

3741
02:12:51,359 --> 02:12:55,039
like certain ideas will just become

3742
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:56,960
viral

3743
02:12:55,039 --> 02:12:59,118
like and then you just won't be able to

3744
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:01,359
help yourself but it'll revolutionize

3745
02:12:59,118 --> 02:13:04,479
things it feels like there needs to be

3746
02:13:01,359 --> 02:13:07,679
that needs to be but there's um

3747
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:09,439
opportunity for viral ideas to change

3748
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:11,199
science absolutely

3749
02:13:09,439 --> 02:13:13,039
and maybe we don't know what those are

3750
02:13:11,198 --> 02:13:15,039
yet it might be a very small kind of

3751
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:17,679
thing maybe you don't even know if

3752
02:13:15,039 --> 02:13:20,960
should this be a for-profit company

3753
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:23,118
that's the wikipedia question yeah um

3754
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:25,520
is that a lot of questions like really

3755
02:13:23,118 --> 02:13:27,679
fundamental questions about this space

3756
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:29,360
that we've we've talked about i mean you

3757
02:13:27,679 --> 02:13:31,118
take wikipedia and you try to run it as

3758
02:13:29,359 --> 02:13:33,519
a startup and by now we'd have a paywall

3759
02:13:31,118 --> 02:13:35,839
you'd be paying 9.99 a month to to read

3760
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:38,400
more than 24 i mean that's that's one

3761
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:40,480
view yeah the other

3762
02:13:38,399 --> 02:13:42,638
the ad driven model so they rejected the

3763
02:13:40,479 --> 02:13:44,238
ad driven model

3764
02:13:42,639 --> 02:13:46,078
i don't know if we could i mean this is

3765
02:13:44,238 --> 02:13:49,839
a difficult question

3766
02:13:46,078 --> 02:13:51,840
you know if archive was supported by ads

3767
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:53,599
i don't know if that's bad for archive

3768
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:56,239
if vermont's library was supported by

3769
02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:58,319
ads i don't know i don't

3770
02:13:56,238 --> 02:14:00,718
i'm not it's not trivial to me i'm

3771
02:13:58,319 --> 02:14:03,920
unlike i think a lot of people

3772
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:05,679
uh i'm not against advertisements i

3773
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:06,960
think as when done well are really good

3774
02:14:05,679 --> 02:14:09,359
i think the problem with facebook and

3775
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:11,118
all the social networks are the way

3776
02:14:09,359 --> 02:14:12,399
the lack of transparency around the way

3777
02:14:11,118 --> 02:14:13,198
they use data

3778
02:14:12,399 --> 02:14:15,279
and

3779
02:14:13,198 --> 02:14:16,960
the lack of control the users have over

3780
02:14:15,279 --> 02:14:18,880
their data and not the fact that data is

3781
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:20,639
being collected and used to sell

3782
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,800
advertisements it's a lack of

3783
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:24,400
transparency lack of control if you if

3784
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:26,960
you do a good job of that i feel like

3785
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:28,238
it's really nice way to make stuff free

3786
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:30,000
yeah for example it's like stack

3787
02:14:28,238 --> 02:14:31,919
overflow right yeah

3788
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,920
i think they've done an okay a good job

3789
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:35,840
with that even though as we said like

3790
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:37,760
they're capturing very little of the

3791
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:40,480
value that they're putting out there

3792
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:42,800
right but but it makes it a sustainable

3793
02:14:40,479 --> 02:14:46,000
company and and they're providing a lot

3794
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:48,159
of it's a fantastic and very productive

3795
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:50,880
community let me ask a

3796
02:14:48,158 --> 02:14:53,519
a ridiculous tangent of a question where

3797
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:56,000
he's you wrote a paper on a on game of

3798
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:58,400
thrones battle of winterfell just

3799
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:59,920
as a side little i i'm sorry i noticed

3800
02:14:58,399 --> 02:15:01,359
i'm sure you've done a lot of ridiculous

3801
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:03,118
stuff like this i just noticed that

3802
02:15:01,359 --> 02:15:04,719
particular one

3803
02:15:03,118 --> 02:15:07,198
by ridiculous i mean you're ridiculously

3804
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:08,960
awesome can you describe the the

3805
02:15:07,198 --> 02:15:11,598
approach in this work which i believe is

3806
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:14,000
a legitimate publication

3807
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:15,520
so going back to the original like uh

3808
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,359
when we were talking about the backstory

3809
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:19,920
of of papers and the importance of that

3810
02:15:17,359 --> 02:15:22,479
so this is actually you know it was

3811
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:25,760
when the last season of the the show was

3812
02:15:22,479 --> 02:15:26,638
airing uh this was a during a company

3813
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:28,880
lunch

3814
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:29,840
we there was in in the last season

3815
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:32,319
there's the

3816
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:36,078
there's a really big battle against the

3817
02:15:32,319 --> 02:15:38,000
the forces of evil and the you know

3818
02:15:36,078 --> 02:15:39,920
forces of good and this is called the

3819
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,439
battle of winterfell

3820
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:43,039
and um

3821
02:15:41,439 --> 02:15:45,678
in this battle there are like these two

3822
02:15:43,039 --> 02:15:47,039
armies and there's a very particular

3823
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:49,840
thing that they have to take into

3824
02:15:47,039 --> 02:15:51,519
account is that in the army of dead like

3825
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:54,560
if someone dies in the army of the

3826
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:57,199
living like that person is gonna you

3827
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:59,599
know be a reborn as

3828
02:15:57,198 --> 02:16:01,678
a soldier in the army of the dead yes

3829
02:15:59,599 --> 02:16:03,199
and so that was an important thing to

3830
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:05,039
take into account and the initial

3831
02:16:03,198 --> 02:16:06,879
conditions as you specify it's about a

3832
02:16:05,039 --> 02:16:08,800
hundred thousand on each side exactly so

3833
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:10,960
i was able i was able to like based on

3834
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:12,320
some images like on previous episodes to

3835
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,000
figure out what was the size of the

3836
02:16:12,319 --> 02:16:16,399
armies and so what i want what we wanted

3837
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:19,760
to do what we were theorizing was like

3838
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:23,118
how many soldiers does like a a soldier

3839
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:25,280
on the army of the living has to kill

3840
02:16:23,118 --> 02:16:27,359
in order for them to be able to this to

3841
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:28,158
destroy the army of the dead without

3842
02:16:27,359 --> 02:16:30,319
like

3843
02:16:28,158 --> 02:16:31,920
losing because every time

3844
02:16:30,319 --> 02:16:33,840
one of the good soldiers died is going

3845
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:36,478
to turn into like the other side and so

3846
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:39,120
it's so i we we were theorizing that and

3847
02:16:36,478 --> 02:16:41,119
and i wrote a couple of uh differential

3848
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,880
equations and um i was able to figure

3849
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:44,479
out that based on the size of the armies

3850
02:16:42,879 --> 02:16:48,478
i think i think was the ratio had to be

3851
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:50,239
like 1.7 so it had to kill like 1.7 um

3852
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:52,558
soldiers like the army of the dead in

3853
02:16:50,239 --> 02:16:55,359
order for them to win the battle

3854
02:16:52,558 --> 02:16:56,718
well yeah that's that's science it is

3855
02:16:55,359 --> 02:16:58,079
it's it's

3856
02:16:56,718 --> 02:17:01,678
most powerful

3857
02:16:58,079 --> 02:17:04,239
and this is also somehow a pitch

3858
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:06,159
for uh like a hiring pitch in a sense

3859
02:17:04,239 --> 02:17:08,558
like this is the kind of uh yeah before

3860
02:17:06,159 --> 02:17:11,039
the science you do it exactly yeah

3861
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:12,638
well turned out to be you know as as is

3862
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:14,719
for people that have watched these shows

3863
02:17:12,638 --> 02:17:16,239
is like they know that every time you

3864
02:17:14,718 --> 02:17:17,358
try to predict something that is going

3865
02:17:16,239 --> 02:17:19,280
to happen it's going to you're going to

3866
02:17:17,359 --> 02:17:23,120
fail miserably and that's what happened

3867
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:24,960
so it was not not at all important

3868
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:26,319
for the show but yeah we ended up like

3869
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:28,079
putting that out and there was a lot of

3870
02:17:26,318 --> 02:17:30,000
people that shared that i think was some

3871
02:17:28,079 --> 02:17:32,398
like elements of the of the show the

3872
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,398
cast of the show that actually retweeted

3873
02:17:32,398 --> 02:17:35,840
that and shared that at first so it was

3874
02:17:34,398 --> 02:17:38,558
fun i would love if this kind of

3875
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:41,439
calculation happened uh like during the

3876
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:42,638
making of the show or the you know i

3877
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:44,639
love it

3878
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:47,199
like in um

3879
02:17:44,638 --> 02:17:49,279
for example i now know um alex garland

3880
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:50,559
the director of ex machina

3881
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:52,079
and i love it

3882
02:17:50,558 --> 02:17:53,438
he doesn't seem to be

3883
02:17:52,079 --> 02:17:54,959
some

3884
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:57,280
not many people seem to do this but i

3885
02:17:54,959 --> 02:17:59,839
love it when directors

3886
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:01,359
and people who wrote the story

3887
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:02,558
really think through the technical

3888
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:04,479
details

3889
02:18:02,558 --> 02:18:06,959
like whether it's knowing like how

3890
02:18:04,478 --> 02:18:08,638
things even if it's science fiction

3891
02:18:06,959 --> 02:18:11,279
if you were to try to do this how would

3892
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:13,759
you do this like stephen wolfram and his

3893
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:15,200
son were

3894
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:18,159
were collaborating with the movie

3895
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:20,639
arrival in designing the alien language

3896
02:18:18,159 --> 02:18:22,478
how you communicate with aliens like how

3897
02:18:20,638 --> 02:18:25,679
would you really have

3898
02:18:22,478 --> 02:18:27,679
a math-based language that uh that could

3899
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:30,159
span the alien

3900
02:18:27,679 --> 02:18:32,799
and uh being and the human

3901
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:34,638
being so i i love it when they have that

3902
02:18:32,799 --> 02:18:36,159
kind of regular the martian was also big

3903
02:18:34,638 --> 02:18:39,438
on that like the book in the movie was

3904
02:18:36,159 --> 02:18:41,359
all about like can we actually

3905
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:43,040
is this plausible can these happen it

3906
02:18:41,359 --> 02:18:45,120
was all about that and that can really

3907
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:47,760
bring you in like the sometimes the

3908
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:50,399
small details uh i mean the guy that

3909
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:53,120
wrote the martian book is another book

3910
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:55,358
that is also filled with those like

3911
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:58,000
things that when you realize that okay

3912
02:18:55,359 --> 02:19:00,960
these are grounded in in science can

3913
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:03,280
just really bring you in yeah right like

3914
02:19:00,959 --> 02:19:05,039
there's a book about a colony on the

3915
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:06,800
colony on the moon and he goes about

3916
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:08,559
like all the details that would you know

3917
02:19:06,799 --> 02:19:10,478
be required about setting up a colony in

3918
02:19:08,558 --> 02:19:12,558
the moon and like things that he

3919
02:19:10,478 --> 02:19:15,358
wouldn't think about like the the fact

3920
02:19:12,558 --> 02:19:18,000
that um they would you know it's hard to

3921
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:20,318
bring like uh air to the moon say so

3922
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,318
they wouldn't like how do you make that

3923
02:19:20,318 --> 02:19:24,558
breathable that environment breathable

3924
02:19:22,318 --> 02:19:26,799
you need to bring oxygen but like you

3925
02:19:24,558 --> 02:19:28,799
you you probably wouldn't be bring

3926
02:19:26,799 --> 02:19:31,358
nitrogen so what you do is like instead

3927
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:33,279
of having a an

3928
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:35,679
atmosphere that is 100

3929
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:38,000
oxygen you like decrease the pressure so

3930
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:40,159
that you have the same ratio of oxygen

3931
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:43,040
on earth but like lowering the pressure

3932
02:19:40,159 --> 02:19:45,599
here and so like things like water boils

3933
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:47,359
at the lower temperature so people would

3934
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:49,439
would have coffee and the coffee would

3935
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:52,239
be colder like there was a problem in

3936
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:53,840
this uh environment in the moon so like

3937
02:19:52,239 --> 02:19:54,639
and these are like small things in the

3938
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,840
book

3939
02:19:54,639 --> 02:19:57,519
but

3940
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:00,880
i studied physics so like when i read

3941
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:03,760
this i that throws me into like

3942
02:20:00,879 --> 02:20:06,318
a tangents and i start researching that

3943
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:08,318
and it's like i really like to read

3944
02:20:06,318 --> 02:20:10,159
books and and watch movies when they go

3945
02:20:08,318 --> 02:20:12,559
to that level of detail

3946
02:20:10,159 --> 02:20:14,000
uh uh about science yeah i think

3947
02:20:12,559 --> 02:20:15,600
interstellar was one where they also

3948
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,680
consulted heavily with with the number

3949
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:19,280
of yeah i think even resulted in a

3950
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:22,079
couple of papers a couple papers about

3951
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:24,079
like the black hole uh visualizations

3952
02:20:22,079 --> 02:20:25,600
and um

3953
02:20:24,079 --> 02:20:27,680
yeah but there's and there's even more

3954
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:29,680
examples of interesting science around

3955
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:31,600
like these fantasy

3956
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:33,920
we were reading at some point like these

3957
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:37,439
guys that were uh trying to figure out

3958
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:41,600
if if the tolkien's middle earth if it

3959
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:44,239
was uh round if it was like a sphere if

3960
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:44,239
it was like

3961
02:20:44,639 --> 02:20:48,159
based on the map and some of the

3962
02:20:46,159 --> 02:20:50,879
references in the

3963
02:20:48,159 --> 02:20:52,639
in the books and so uh yeah we actually

3964
02:20:50,879 --> 02:20:54,079
i think we tweeted about that

3965
02:20:52,639 --> 02:20:55,599
yeah we did based on the distance

3966
02:20:54,079 --> 02:20:58,719
between the cities you can actually

3967
02:20:55,600 --> 02:21:00,800
prove that that could be like a map of a

3968
02:20:58,719 --> 02:21:02,799
sphere or like a spheroid and and you

3969
02:21:00,799 --> 02:21:04,398
can actually calculate the radius of

3970
02:21:02,799 --> 02:21:06,639
that planet

3971
02:21:04,398 --> 02:21:06,639
uh

3972
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:10,719
that's fascinating

3973
02:21:08,719 --> 02:21:14,000
i mean yeah that's fascinating but

3974
02:21:10,719 --> 02:21:15,438
there's something about like calculating

3975
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,398
the number

3976
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:18,880
like

3977
02:21:16,398 --> 02:21:21,519
exactly the calculation you did for for

3978
02:21:18,879 --> 02:21:22,879
the battle winterfell is um

3979
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:25,359
there's something fascinating about that

3980
02:21:22,879 --> 02:21:28,239
because it's not like being

3981
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:30,079
that's very mathematical versus like

3982
02:21:28,239 --> 02:21:32,159
grounded in physics

3983
02:21:30,079 --> 02:21:34,719
and that's really interesting i mean

3984
02:21:32,159 --> 02:21:36,318
that's like injecting mathematics into

3985
02:21:34,719 --> 02:21:38,478
fantasy

3986
02:21:36,318 --> 02:21:40,318
there's there's something um i see

3987
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:42,159
magical about that and and that for me

3988
02:21:40,318 --> 02:21:44,318
that's why i think it's also when you

3989
02:21:42,159 --> 02:21:46,799
look at things like

3990
02:21:44,318 --> 02:21:48,478
like uh fermat's last theorem like

3991
02:21:46,799 --> 02:21:50,639
problems that are very kind of

3992
02:21:48,478 --> 02:21:51,840
self-contained and simple to state yeah

3993
02:21:50,639 --> 02:21:53,039
i think like

3994
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:54,559
that's the same with that paper it's

3995
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:55,920
very easy to understand the boundaries

3996
02:21:54,559 --> 02:22:00,478
of the problem you know

3997
02:21:55,920 --> 02:22:02,318
um and and that for me that's why those

3998
02:22:00,478 --> 02:22:04,079
and that's why math is so appealing and

3999
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:06,239
those like problems are also so

4000
02:22:04,079 --> 02:22:08,000
appealing to the general public it's not

4001
02:22:06,239 --> 02:22:10,879
that they look simple or that people

4002
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,879
think that they're easy to like solve

4003
02:22:10,879 --> 02:22:13,679
but i feel that a lot of the times they

4004
02:22:12,879 --> 02:22:15,839
are

4005
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:16,800
almost intellectually democratic because

4006
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:18,478
everyone

4007
02:22:16,799 --> 02:22:20,318
understands the starting point you know

4008
02:22:18,478 --> 02:22:22,478
you look at fermat's last theorem

4009
02:22:20,318 --> 02:22:25,039
everyone understands like is the this is

4010
02:22:22,478 --> 02:22:26,478
the the universe of the problem and the

4011
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:28,080
same maybe with that paper everyone

4012
02:22:26,478 --> 02:22:29,599
understands okay these are the starting

4013
02:22:28,079 --> 02:22:31,200
conditions

4014
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:32,880
and um

4015
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:34,560
and and yeah that the fact that it

4016
02:22:32,879 --> 02:22:36,478
becomes intellectually democrat and i

4017
02:22:34,559 --> 02:22:37,920
think that's a huge motivation

4018
02:22:36,478 --> 02:22:39,760
for people and that's why

4019
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:41,280
so so many people gravitate towards

4020
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:42,960
these like riemann hypotheses or

4021
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:44,800
vermont's last theorem or that simple

4022
02:22:42,959 --> 02:22:46,000
paper which is like just one page it's

4023
02:22:44,799 --> 02:22:47,920
very simple

4024
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:50,079
and i just talked to somebody i don't

4025
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:51,520
know if you know who he is jaco willink

4026
02:22:50,079 --> 02:22:53,200
who is uh

4027
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:56,000
this person

4028
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:57,680
who among many things loves military

4029
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:00,398
tactics so

4030
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:01,920
he would probably either publish

4031
02:23:00,398 --> 02:23:04,000
a follow-on paper maybe you guys should

4032
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:05,680
collaborate but he would see the

4033
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:08,000
fundament the basic assumptions that he

4034
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:10,079
started that paper with is flawed

4035
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,600
because you know there's like dragons

4036
02:23:10,079 --> 02:23:13,600
too right there's like

4037
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:15,439
like you have to integrate tactics

4038
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:16,960
because not it's not it's not a

4039
02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:18,479
homogeneous system

4040
02:23:16,959 --> 02:23:20,398
it's not you i don't take into account

4041
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:21,760
the dragons and like and he would say

4042
02:23:20,398 --> 02:23:23,358
tactics fundamentally change the

4043
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:24,398
dynamics of the system

4044
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:27,120
and so like

4045
02:23:24,398 --> 02:23:27,119
that's what happened

4046
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:31,840
so uh yeah so at least from a scientific

4047
02:23:30,239 --> 02:23:33,760
perspective he was right but he never

4048
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:35,120
published so there you go

4049
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:37,120
uh let me ask the most important

4050
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:40,000
question you guys are from

4051
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:40,880
portugal both yeah

4052
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,280
so

4053
02:23:40,879 --> 02:23:45,519
who is the greatest soccer player

4054
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:47,520
footballer of all time

4055
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:49,600
yeah i think we're a little bit biased

4056
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:51,439
on this topic but uh i mean i have

4057
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:53,840
maradona

4058
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:56,559
i i have a huge i have a you know

4059
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:58,079
tremendous respect for for what um here

4060
02:23:56,559 --> 02:23:59,840
we go

4061
02:23:58,079 --> 02:24:02,318
this is the political issue

4062
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:04,159
we can convince you i i i mean i have

4063
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:06,159
tremendous respect for what ronaldo has

4064
02:24:04,159 --> 02:24:08,318
achieved in in his career and and i

4065
02:24:06,159 --> 02:24:09,840
think soccer is one of those sports

4066
02:24:08,318 --> 02:24:12,159
where i think you can get to maybe be

4067
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:12,960
one of the best players in the world

4068
02:24:12,159 --> 02:24:15,760
we

4069
02:24:12,959 --> 02:24:17,919
if you just have like natural talent and

4070
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:20,639
even if you don't put a lot of hard work

4071
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:22,559
and discipline into soccer you can be

4072
02:24:20,639 --> 02:24:24,398
one of the best players in the world and

4073
02:24:22,559 --> 02:24:28,478
i think ronaldo is kind of like of

4074
02:24:24,398 --> 02:24:28,478
course he's naturally talented but yeah

4075
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:34,640
exactly from portugal um and and not uh

4076
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:36,478
not the brazilian in this case and so um

4077
02:24:34,639 --> 02:24:38,959
and ronaldo put like came from nothing

4078
02:24:36,478 --> 02:24:41,599
he he's known from being probably one of

4079
02:24:38,959 --> 02:24:43,438
the hardest working athletes in the game

4080
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:45,520
and and i see that sometimes a lot of

4081
02:24:43,439 --> 02:24:48,079
these discussions about the best player

4082
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:50,399
a lot of people train tend to gravitate

4083
02:24:48,079 --> 02:24:52,799
towards like um you know this person is

4084
02:24:50,398 --> 02:24:56,478
naturally talented and the other person

4085
02:24:52,799 --> 02:24:58,959
has to work hard and so and so as if it

4086
02:24:56,478 --> 02:25:01,279
was bad if he had to work hard to to be

4087
02:24:58,959 --> 02:25:02,879
good at something and i think that you

4088
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:05,280
know the the

4089
02:25:02,879 --> 02:25:07,279
i think so many people fall into that

4090
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:09,600
trap and the reason why so many people

4091
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:11,680
fall into that trap is because if you

4092
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:14,479
are saying that someone

4093
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:16,559
is good and achieved a lot of success by

4094
02:25:14,478 --> 02:25:18,318
working hard as opposed to achieving

4095
02:25:16,559 --> 02:25:21,199
success because it has some sort of

4096
02:25:18,318 --> 02:25:22,719
god-given natural talent then you can't

4097
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:23,520
explain why the person was born with

4098
02:25:22,719 --> 02:25:26,159
that

4099
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:28,079
what does it tell you about you

4100
02:25:26,159 --> 02:25:29,920
it tells you that maybe if you work hard

4101
02:25:28,079 --> 02:25:31,680
on a lot of fields you could have

4102
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:33,359
could accomplish a lot of great things

4103
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:34,479
and i think that's hard to digest for a

4104
02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:36,720
lot of people

4105
02:25:34,478 --> 02:25:39,438
and and that way ronaldo's inspiring

4106
02:25:36,719 --> 02:25:41,039
that i think so you find hard work

4107
02:25:39,439 --> 02:25:42,960
that's probably but he's he's way too

4108
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:44,800
good looking that's nice

4109
02:25:42,959 --> 02:25:46,079
you know that's the yeah i don't like

4110
02:25:44,799 --> 02:25:48,879
him probably no i like the part of the

4111
02:25:46,079 --> 02:25:50,559
hard work and like of him being like one

4112
02:25:48,879 --> 02:25:51,679
of the hardest working athletes in in

4113
02:25:50,559 --> 02:25:54,000
soccer

4114
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:56,079
so he is to you the greatest of all time

4115
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:57,200
is he up there is he would be number one

4116
02:25:56,079 --> 02:25:59,039
okay

4117
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:01,520
do you agree with this thing oh hardly

4118
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:03,920
disagree well i definitely disagree i

4119
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:05,520
mean i i like him very much he works

4120
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:08,000
hard i admire

4121
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:11,359
i admire you know um

4122
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:13,439
would like he's an incredible uh

4123
02:26:11,359 --> 02:26:14,239
a goal scorer right

4124
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:15,120
um

4125
02:26:14,239 --> 02:26:17,199
but

4126
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:18,720
i

4127
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:20,560
so first of all

4128
02:26:18,719 --> 02:26:22,079
leo messi and there was some confusion

4129
02:26:20,559 --> 02:26:24,398
because i've kept saying maradona is my

4130
02:26:22,079 --> 02:26:26,559
favorite player but i i think

4131
02:26:24,398 --> 02:26:28,398
i think leo has surpassed them

4132
02:26:26,559 --> 02:26:31,359
so uh

4133
02:26:28,398 --> 02:26:36,318
um it's messy that mardonna then

4134
02:26:31,359 --> 02:26:37,600
pele for me but the the reason is is um

4135
02:26:36,318 --> 02:26:39,920
there's certain

4136
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:43,120
aesthetic definitions of beauty that i

4137
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:45,200
admire whether it came by hard work or

4138
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:46,560
through god-given talent or through

4139
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:47,920
anything and it doesn't it doesn't

4140
02:26:46,559 --> 02:26:49,359
really matter to me there's certain

4141
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:52,398
aesthetic

4142
02:26:49,359 --> 02:26:54,640
like genius when i when i see it to me

4143
02:26:52,398 --> 02:26:57,199
and uh especially it doesn't have to be

4144
02:26:54,639 --> 02:26:59,358
consistent it is in the case of messi in

4145
02:26:57,200 --> 02:27:01,280
a case in the ronaldo but just even

4146
02:26:59,359 --> 02:27:04,559
moments of genius which is where

4147
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:06,640
maradona really shines it i

4148
02:27:04,559 --> 02:27:08,639
even if that doesn't translate into like

4149
02:27:06,639 --> 02:27:10,959
results and goals being scored right

4150
02:27:08,639 --> 02:27:13,279
right and that's the challenge like they

4151
02:27:10,959 --> 02:27:15,839
did that

4152
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:18,479
because that's where people that tell me

4153
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:21,439
that leo messi's never

4154
02:27:18,478 --> 02:27:22,799
even on strong teams have led his

4155
02:27:21,439 --> 02:27:26,479
the national team people as part of the

4156
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:28,559
world cup right as really important and

4157
02:27:26,478 --> 02:27:30,478
to me no it's the moment like winning to

4158
02:27:28,559 --> 02:27:32,000
me was never important

4159
02:27:30,478 --> 02:27:34,559
what's more important is the moments of

4160
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:36,559
genius and

4161
02:27:34,559 --> 02:27:37,680
but you're you're talking to the human

4162
02:27:36,559 --> 02:27:38,799
story

4163
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:40,000
and

4164
02:27:38,799 --> 02:27:41,759
um

4165
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,439
yeah cristiano ronaldo definitely has a

4166
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:45,840
beautiful human story yeah and i think

4167
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:49,120
you can't i for me it's hard to decouple

4168
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:51,439
those two um i i don't i don't just look

4169
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:53,120
at you know the the list of achievements

4170
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:54,960
but i like how he got there and how he

4171
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:57,600
keeps pushing the boundaries at like

4172
02:27:54,959 --> 02:27:59,438
almost 40 yeah and how that sets up an

4173
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:01,920
example like maybe 10 years ago i

4174
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:03,120
wouldn't have ever imagined that like

4175
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:05,760
one of the top players in the world

4176
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:07,520
could be a top player at like 37 or but

4177
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:09,600
so and there's an interesting ten the

4178
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:12,960
human story is really important but like

4179
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:15,600
if you look at ronaldo he's like he's

4180
02:28:12,959 --> 02:28:16,959
somebody like kids could aspire to be

4181
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:20,559
but at the same time i also like

4182
02:28:16,959 --> 02:28:23,119
maradona who like is a as a tragic

4183
02:28:20,559 --> 02:28:26,478
figure in many ways it's like the you

4184
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:28,160
know the drugs the the temper all of

4185
02:28:26,478 --> 02:28:28,879
those things that's beautiful too like i

4186
02:28:28,159 --> 02:28:30,879
don't

4187
02:28:28,879 --> 02:28:33,839
necessarily think to me

4188
02:28:30,879 --> 02:28:36,478
the flaws are beautiful too in in

4189
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:39,120
athletes i don't think

4190
02:28:36,478 --> 02:28:41,760
you need to be perfect i agree uh from a

4191
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:44,160
personality perspective those flaws

4192
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:45,520
are also beautiful so but yeah there is

4193
02:28:44,159 --> 02:28:47,119
something about

4194
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:49,920
hard work

4195
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:51,920
and uh there's also something about the

4196
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:54,159
being an underdog and being able to

4197
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:55,680
carry a team

4198
02:28:54,159 --> 02:28:57,119
uh that's that's an argument from

4199
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:59,120
maradona i don't know if you can make

4200
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:01,680
that argument for messi and ronaldo

4201
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:05,040
either because they've all played on

4202
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:06,840
superstar teams for most of their lives

4203
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:09,520
so i don't know

4204
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:11,439
how it you know it's it's difficult to

4205
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:12,640
know how they would do

4206
02:29:11,439 --> 02:29:14,239
um

4207
02:29:12,639 --> 02:29:16,719
when they had to work

4208
02:29:14,239 --> 02:29:19,039
like did what mardonna had to do to

4209
02:29:16,719 --> 02:29:21,438
carry a team on his shoulders true

4210
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:23,359
and pele did as well and so depending on

4211
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:25,040
the the context yeah maybe you could

4212
02:29:23,359 --> 02:29:27,280
argue that within portuguese national

4213
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:29,760
team but they were we have a good team

4214
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:31,040
uh yeah but maybe with what maradona did

4215
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:33,600
with you know

4216
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:34,960
naples and and a couple other teams it's

4217
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:36,399
it seemed incredible this is the beauty

4218
02:29:34,959 --> 02:29:38,159
of the game that you know we're talking

4219
02:29:36,398 --> 02:29:38,799
about all these different players that

4220
02:29:38,159 --> 02:29:40,079
have

4221
02:29:38,799 --> 02:29:42,159
or especially you know if you're

4222
02:29:40,079 --> 02:29:44,559
comparing messi and ronaldo that have

4223
02:29:42,159 --> 02:29:45,920
such different you know styles of play

4224
02:29:44,559 --> 02:29:48,000
and also even

4225
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:48,960
their bodies are so different and and

4226
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:51,280
and but

4227
02:29:48,959 --> 02:29:52,959
these two

4228
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:56,319
very different players can be at the top

4229
02:29:52,959 --> 02:29:57,919
of the game and that's not that's the

4230
02:29:56,318 --> 02:29:59,840
they're not a lot of other sports where

4231
02:29:57,920 --> 02:30:02,000
you where you have that you know like

4232
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:04,880
you have kind of a mental image of a

4233
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:06,639
basketball player and like the the top

4234
02:30:04,879 --> 02:30:08,398
basketball players kind of fit that

4235
02:30:06,639 --> 02:30:09,199
mental image and and they look a certain

4236
02:30:08,398 --> 02:30:10,478
way

4237
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:13,760
and um

4238
02:30:10,478 --> 02:30:15,840
but for soccer there's so there's

4239
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:18,398
it's it's not so much like that and and

4240
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:20,239
that's i think that's that's beautiful

4241
02:30:18,398 --> 02:30:21,439
uh but that's that really adds something

4242
02:30:20,239 --> 02:30:23,680
to the sport

4243
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:25,600
well do you play soccer yourself have

4244
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:27,280
you played that in your life what do you

4245
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:29,040
find beautiful about the game yeah i

4246
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:31,520
mean it's one of the i'd say it's the

4247
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:33,680
biggest sport in portugal and so growing

4248
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:35,680
up we played a lot did you see the paper

4249
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:38,800
from deepmind i didn't look at it where

4250
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:41,680
they're like uh doing some uh analysis

4251
02:30:38,799 --> 02:30:43,840
on soccer strategy yeah interesting i

4252
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:46,960
saved that paper uh i haven't read it

4253
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:49,680
yet um it's actually i i when i was in

4254
02:30:46,959 --> 02:30:52,879
college i actually did some

4255
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:54,398
research on on applying um

4256
02:30:52,879 --> 02:30:57,119
machine learning and statistics in

4257
02:30:54,398 --> 02:30:59,519
sports and in our ca in our case we're

4258
02:30:57,120 --> 02:31:01,520
doing it for basketball

4259
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:03,200
but uh

4260
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:04,319
what they're effectively trying to do

4261
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:06,240
was

4262
02:31:04,318 --> 02:31:07,760
have you ever watched moneyball like

4263
02:31:06,239 --> 02:31:08,959
yeah so they're trying to do something

4264
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:10,639
similar to

4265
02:31:08,959 --> 02:31:12,879
taking that in this case basketball

4266
02:31:10,639 --> 02:31:15,279
taking a statistical approach to

4267
02:31:12,879 --> 02:31:17,039
to to basketball um

4268
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:19,200
the interesting thing there is that

4269
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:21,120
baseball is much more about having these

4270
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:23,200
discrete events that happen kind of in

4271
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:25,200
similar conditions and so it's easier to

4272
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:27,200
take a statistical approach to it

4273
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:28,800
whereas basketball is a much more

4274
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:30,560
dynamic game

4275
02:31:28,799 --> 02:31:31,840
it's harder to measure

4276
02:31:30,559 --> 02:31:33,439
um

4277
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:35,120
it's hard to to replicate these

4278
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:37,280
conditions and so

4279
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:39,200
you you have to think about it in a

4280
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:41,520
slightly different way and so we were

4281
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:44,079
doing work on that and working like with

4282
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:45,200
the celtics to analyze the the the data

4283
02:31:44,079 --> 02:31:46,719
that they had like they had these

4284
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:48,720
cameras in the in the arena they were

4285
02:31:46,719 --> 02:31:50,000
tracking the players and so you so they

4286
02:31:48,719 --> 02:31:51,599
have they had a ton of data but they

4287
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:54,318
didn't really know what to do with it

4288
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:57,040
and so we were doing work on that and

4289
02:31:54,318 --> 02:31:58,799
and and soccer is maybe an even a step

4290
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:00,479
further it's it's right it's a game

4291
02:31:58,799 --> 02:32:02,318
where you don't have as many

4292
02:32:00,478 --> 02:32:04,959
in in basketball you have a lot of field

4293
02:32:02,318 --> 02:32:07,039
goals and so you can measure success uh

4294
02:32:04,959 --> 02:32:09,599
soccer it's it's right it's more of a

4295
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:11,840
poisson process almost where it's like

4296
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:13,520
you have a goal like or two and again in

4297
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:15,280
terms of metrics i wonder if there's a

4298
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:17,040
way and i've actually have thought about

4299
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:19,120
this in the past never coming up with

4300
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:20,880
any good solution if there's a way to

4301
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:22,880
definitively say whether it's messier

4302
02:32:20,879 --> 02:32:24,559
and now they're the greatest of all time

4303
02:32:22,879 --> 02:32:25,599
like honestly sort of measure

4304
02:32:24,559 --> 02:32:27,680
interesting

4305
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:29,840
like convert the game of soccer into

4306
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:33,760
metrics like you said baseball but like

4307
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:35,520
those moments of genius like pat like um

4308
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:37,680
you know if it's just about goals or

4309
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:40,079
passes that led to goals that feels like

4310
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:43,280
it doesn't capture the genius of them

4311
02:32:40,079 --> 02:32:45,120
yeah they'll be like you know like

4312
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:47,359
like you kind of do you have more

4313
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:49,520
metrics for instance in chess right and

4314
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:50,800
you can try to understand how hard of a

4315
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:52,720
move

4316
02:32:50,799 --> 02:32:54,799
there was you know there's like bobby

4317
02:32:52,719 --> 02:32:56,639
fischer has this move that like

4318
02:32:54,799 --> 02:32:59,199
that it's i think it's called the move

4319
02:32:56,639 --> 02:33:01,199
of the century where uh

4320
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:02,479
you have to go so deep into the tree to

4321
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:05,520
understand that that was the right move

4322
02:33:02,478 --> 02:33:06,799
and you can quantify it how hard it was

4323
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:08,399
so it'd be interesting to try to think

4324
02:33:06,799 --> 02:33:10,398
of those type of metrics but say yeah

4325
02:33:08,398 --> 02:33:11,680
for soccer computer vision unlocks some

4326
02:33:10,398 --> 02:33:13,599
of that for us that's that's one

4327
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:15,840
possibility i have a cool idea a

4328
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:18,239
computer vision product likes that you

4329
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:19,840
could build for soccer

4330
02:33:18,239 --> 02:33:22,239
i'm taking notes

4331
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:25,120
if you could detect the ball and like

4332
02:33:22,239 --> 02:33:27,359
imagine that um this seems like totally

4333
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:29,200
doable right now but like if you could

4334
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:32,479
detect when the ball enters one of the

4335
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:34,319
goals and like just had like um you know

4336
02:33:32,478 --> 02:33:35,760
a crowd cheering for you when you're

4337
02:33:34,318 --> 02:33:37,439
playing soccer with your friends every

4338
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:39,920
time you score a goal or you had like

4339
02:33:37,439 --> 02:33:41,920
the the champions league song going on

4340
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:43,120
yeah and like having that like you go

4341
02:33:41,920 --> 02:33:44,799
play soccer with your friends you just

4342
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:46,960
turn that on and there's like a computer

4343
02:33:44,799 --> 02:33:48,159
vision like program analyzes the ball

4344
02:33:46,959 --> 02:33:50,159
detects the ball every time there's a

4345
02:33:48,159 --> 02:33:52,159
goal like if you miss like there's a you

4346
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:52,959
know the fans are reacting to that and

4347
02:33:52,159 --> 02:33:54,639
then

4348
02:33:52,959 --> 02:33:56,079
it should be pretty simple by now it's

4349
02:33:54,639 --> 02:33:58,318
like i think there's an opportunity

4350
02:33:56,079 --> 02:34:01,120
there so yeah just throwing that i would

4351
02:33:58,318 --> 02:34:02,799
go all out but by the way i did uh i've

4352
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:04,319
never released i was thinking of just

4353
02:34:02,799 --> 02:34:05,920
putting on github but i did write

4354
02:34:04,318 --> 02:34:07,119
exactly that which is the trackers for

4355
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:08,960
the players

4356
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:11,600
uh for the for the bodies of the player

4357
02:34:08,959 --> 02:34:14,159
it's this is the hard part actually

4358
02:34:11,600 --> 02:34:16,960
the detection of player bodies and the

4359
02:34:14,159 --> 02:34:20,398
ball is not hard what's hard is

4360
02:34:16,959 --> 02:34:21,759
very like robust tracking through time

4361
02:34:20,398 --> 02:34:24,000
of each of those

4362
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:26,398
so like so i wrote a track of this

4363
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,840
pretty damn good this is this is that is

4364
02:34:26,398 --> 02:34:29,199
that open source

4365
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:30,318
i know i've never released it because

4366
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:31,920
that's interesting because i thought

4367
02:34:30,318 --> 02:34:34,639
like

4368
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:36,239
i need to i would

4369
02:34:34,639 --> 02:34:38,239
this is the perfection thing because i

4370
02:34:36,239 --> 02:34:40,079
knew it was going to be like

4371
02:34:38,239 --> 02:34:42,239
it's going to pull me in and and it

4372
02:34:40,079 --> 02:34:44,159
wasn't really that done

4373
02:34:42,239 --> 02:34:46,079
and so i've never actually been part of

4374
02:34:44,159 --> 02:34:48,239
a github project where it's like really

4375
02:34:46,079 --> 02:34:50,318
active development and i didn't want to

4376
02:34:48,239 --> 02:34:52,159
make it i knew there's a non-zero

4377
02:34:50,318 --> 02:34:53,519
probability that will become my life for

4378
02:34:52,159 --> 02:34:55,680
like a half a year

4379
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:57,680
that's uh just how much i love soccer

4380
02:34:55,680 --> 02:35:00,318
and all those kinds of things and and

4381
02:34:57,680 --> 02:35:01,600
ultimately it will be all for just the

4382
02:35:00,318 --> 02:35:03,920
the joy

4383
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:05,520
of analyzing the game which i'm all for

4384
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:06,719
i remember you also like one of in one

4385
02:35:05,520 --> 02:35:08,880
of the episodes you mentioned that you

4386
02:35:06,719 --> 02:35:11,039
did also a lot of eye tracking analysis

4387
02:35:08,879 --> 02:35:13,199
like joe rogan's that was the that was

4388
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:14,880
the research side of my life interesting

4389
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:16,479
yeah and you have that library right you

4390
02:35:14,879 --> 02:35:19,679
you kind of downloaded all the episodes

4391
02:35:16,478 --> 02:35:21,358
yep allegedly i and of course i didn't

4392
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:23,359
if you're a lawyer listening to this no

4393
02:35:21,359 --> 02:35:24,640
it is i i was listening to the episode

4394
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:26,559
where you mentioned that and i was

4395
02:35:24,639 --> 02:35:28,639
actually there was something that i and

4396
02:35:26,559 --> 02:35:32,079
i might ask you for for access to that

4397
02:35:28,639 --> 02:35:34,318
to allegedly that library uh but i was

4398
02:35:32,079 --> 02:35:35,680
doing some not not regarding like eye

4399
02:35:34,318 --> 02:35:38,079
tracking but i was

4400
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:40,880
playing around with um analyzing the

4401
02:35:38,079 --> 02:35:43,439
distribution of silences on uh one of

4402
02:35:40,879 --> 02:35:45,279
the joe rogan episodes so like i did

4403
02:35:43,439 --> 02:35:47,280
that for the elon

4404
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:48,960
conversation where it's like you just

4405
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:50,640
take all the silences

4406
02:35:48,959 --> 02:35:52,879
like after joe asked the question and

4407
02:35:50,639 --> 02:35:55,920
elon responded and you plot that

4408
02:35:52,879 --> 02:35:58,000
distribution and like and see how

4409
02:35:55,920 --> 02:36:00,159
how that looks like yeah i think there's

4410
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:02,079
a huge opportunity especially long-form

4411
02:36:00,159 --> 02:36:03,920
podcasts

4412
02:36:02,079 --> 02:36:06,559
to do that kind of analysis bigger than

4413
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:09,040
joe exactly but it has to be a fairly

4414
02:36:06,559 --> 02:36:10,559
unedited podcasts so that you don't cut

4415
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:13,359
the silence so one of the benefits i

4416
02:36:10,559 --> 02:36:14,799
have like doing this podcast is like the

4417
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:15,840
the what we're recording today is

4418
02:36:14,799 --> 02:36:17,679
there's

4419
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:18,960
individual audio

4420
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:21,200
being recorded

4421
02:36:18,959 --> 02:36:22,639
like i have the raw information no it's

4422
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:24,720
when it's published it's all combined

4423
02:36:22,639 --> 02:36:26,719
together and individual video feeds so

4424
02:36:24,719 --> 02:36:28,318
even when you're listening which i

4425
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:29,438
usually don't i only show one video

4426
02:36:28,318 --> 02:36:32,318
stream

4427
02:36:29,439 --> 02:36:33,280
i i'll know i can track your blinks and

4428
02:36:32,318 --> 02:36:36,719
so on

4429
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:38,560
um but yeah but ultimately the hope is

4430
02:36:36,719 --> 02:36:39,920
you don't need that raw data because if

4431
02:36:38,559 --> 02:36:41,359
you don't need the raw data for whatever

4432
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:43,200
analysis you're doing

4433
02:36:41,359 --> 02:36:45,040
you can then do a huge number of

4434
02:36:43,200 --> 02:36:46,399
products because there's so it's quickly

4435
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:47,760
growing now the number especially

4436
02:36:46,398 --> 02:36:49,358
comedians

4437
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:51,760
there's uh quite a few comedians with

4438
02:36:49,359 --> 02:36:53,200
with long-form podcasts

4439
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:54,800
and

4440
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:56,000
they have a lot of facial expressions

4441
02:36:54,799 --> 02:36:58,398
they have a lot of fun and all those

4442
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:00,879
kinds of things and it's it's prone for

4443
02:36:58,398 --> 02:37:02,318
analysis yeah and it's there's so many

4444
02:37:00,879 --> 02:37:04,159
interesting things that

4445
02:37:02,318 --> 02:37:05,519
that that idea actually sparked because

4446
02:37:04,159 --> 02:37:06,559
i was watching a

4447
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:09,040
um

4448
02:37:06,559 --> 02:37:11,600
a q a by by steve jobs and i think was

4449
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:13,520
at mit and then like people's like he

4450
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:15,120
did a talk there and then

4451
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:17,120
the q and a started and people started

4452
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:18,880
asking questions that i was i was

4453
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:20,479
working while listening to it and like

4454
02:37:18,879 --> 02:37:23,039
someone asked the question and he goes

4455
02:37:20,478 --> 02:37:24,639
like on a 20-second silence before

4456
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:27,040
answering the question i like i had to

4457
02:37:24,639 --> 02:37:28,398
check if the if the video hadn't paused

4458
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:31,439
or something

4459
02:37:28,398 --> 02:37:33,519
and and i was thinking about like like

4460
02:37:31,439 --> 02:37:35,920
if that is a feature of a person like

4461
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:38,079
how long on average you take to respond

4462
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:39,600
to a question and if it's like that's

4463
02:37:38,079 --> 02:37:41,280
fascinating it has to do with it like

4464
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:43,840
how thoughtful you are and if that

4465
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:45,520
changes over time well but it also could

4466
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:47,359
be this really fascinating metric

4467
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:48,960
because it also could be

4468
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:51,040
it's certainly a feature of a person but

4469
02:37:48,959 --> 02:37:53,519
it's also a function of the question

4470
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:55,280
like if you normalize to the person

4471
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:57,520
you can probably infer a bunch of stuff

4472
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:59,600
about the question so it's a nice flag

4473
02:37:57,520 --> 02:38:01,280
like it's a really strong signal the

4474
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:03,600
length of that silence

4475
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:05,840
relative to the usual silence they have

4476
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:07,920
so one the silence is a measure of how

4477
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:10,079
thoughtful they are and two the

4478
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:11,520
particular sounds doesn't measure how

4479
02:38:10,079 --> 02:38:12,959
thoughtful the question was thoughtful

4480
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:16,000
the question was it's really interesting

4481
02:38:12,959 --> 02:38:17,519
i mean yeah yeah i just analyzed elon's

4482
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:19,600
uh um

4483
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:21,840
episode but i think there's like room

4484
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:23,359
for exploration there i feel like the

4485
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:24,398
average they could do for comedians

4486
02:38:23,359 --> 02:38:25,840
would be

4487
02:38:24,398 --> 02:38:27,840
like i mean the time would be so small

4488
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:29,439
because you're trained to like i would

4489
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:31,040
think you're reacting to hecklers you're

4490
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:33,840
reacting to all sorts of things you have

4491
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:35,840
to be like so quick maybe right yeah but

4492
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:37,680
some of the greatest comedians are very

4493
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:40,159
good at sitting in the silence i mean

4494
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:41,760
there there's lucy kaye

4495
02:38:40,159 --> 02:38:44,559
they played with that

4496
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:45,920
because you have a rhythm and you like

4497
02:38:44,559 --> 02:38:48,719
um

4498
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:50,719
dave chappelle a comedian who did uh

4499
02:38:48,719 --> 02:38:52,079
joe's show recently

4500
02:38:50,719 --> 02:38:53,358
he has uh

4501
02:38:52,079 --> 02:38:54,639
especially when he's just having a

4502
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:57,439
conversation

4503
02:38:54,639 --> 02:38:59,760
he does long pauses it's kind of cool

4504
02:38:57,439 --> 02:39:02,079
because it uh

4505
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:04,960
it's one of the ways to have people hang

4506
02:39:02,079 --> 02:39:07,280
in your word is to play with the pauses

4507
02:39:04,959 --> 02:39:08,478
to play with the silences and the

4508
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:10,560
emphasis

4509
02:39:08,478 --> 02:39:12,159
and like mid-sentence there's a bunch of

4510
02:39:10,559 --> 02:39:13,680
different things that uh it'd be

4511
02:39:12,159 --> 02:39:15,840
interesting to really

4512
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:17,520
really analyze but still soccer to me is

4513
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:19,040
uh that's that that one that's

4514
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:21,920
fascinating just i just want a

4515
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:25,520
conclusive definitive statement about

4516
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:27,520
it's like there are so many

4517
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:28,720
soccer highlights of both messi and

4518
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:32,960
ronaldo

4519
02:39:28,719 --> 02:39:32,959
i just feel like the raw data is there

4520
02:39:34,559 --> 02:39:39,519
um because you don't have that with pele

4521
02:39:37,760 --> 02:39:42,318
just remember yeah through but here's a

4522
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:44,000
huge amount of high def data then the

4523
02:39:42,318 --> 02:39:46,239
the annoying the difficult thing and

4524
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:49,040
this is really hard for tracking and

4525
02:39:46,239 --> 02:39:50,799
this is actually where i kind of gave up

4526
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:53,680
because i didn't really give much effort

4527
02:39:50,799 --> 02:39:56,318
but i gave up

4528
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:58,398
to the the way that highlights or

4529
02:39:56,318 --> 02:40:00,559
usually football match are filmed is

4530
02:39:58,398 --> 02:40:02,000
they switch the camera so they'll

4531
02:40:00,559 --> 02:40:04,079
they'll do a different switch

4532
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:05,280
perspective so you have to

4533
02:40:04,079 --> 02:40:06,799
it's a really interesting computer

4534
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:08,960
vision problem when the perspective is

4535
02:40:06,799 --> 02:40:11,358
switched you still have a lot of overlap

4536
02:40:08,959 --> 02:40:12,719
about the players but the perspective is

4537
02:40:11,359 --> 02:40:15,760
sufficiently different that you have to

4538
02:40:12,719 --> 02:40:17,599
like recompute everything so i

4539
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:18,639
there there's two ways to solve this so

4540
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:20,318
one

4541
02:40:18,639 --> 02:40:22,239
is doing it the full way where you're

4542
02:40:20,318 --> 02:40:24,079
constantly doing the slam problem you

4543
02:40:22,239 --> 02:40:26,079
you're doing a 3d reconstruction the

4544
02:40:24,079 --> 02:40:27,200
whole time and projecting into that 3d

4545
02:40:26,079 --> 02:40:28,559
world

4546
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:29,920
but you could also there could be some

4547
02:40:28,559 --> 02:40:32,239
hex

4548
02:40:29,920 --> 02:40:33,520
that i wonder like some trick where you

4549
02:40:32,239 --> 02:40:36,239
can hop

4550
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:39,680
like when the perspective shifts

4551
02:40:36,239 --> 02:40:43,520
do a high probability tracking hops from

4552
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:46,159
one object to another but i i thought

4553
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:46,880
especially in exciting moments when when

4554
02:40:46,159 --> 02:40:49,359
uh

4555
02:40:46,879 --> 02:40:51,839
when you're passing players like you're

4556
02:40:49,359 --> 02:40:53,359
doing a single ball dribble

4557
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:54,880
across players and you switch

4558
02:40:53,359 --> 02:40:56,720
perspective which is when they often do

4559
02:40:54,879 --> 02:40:58,318
when you're making a run on goal if you

4560
02:40:56,719 --> 02:41:00,000
switch your perspective

4561
02:40:58,318 --> 02:41:02,559
it's it feels like that's going to be

4562
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,559
really tricky to get right

4563
02:41:02,559 --> 02:41:06,639
automatically but in that case i feel

4564
02:41:04,559 --> 02:41:09,760
like if somebody released that data set

4565
02:41:06,639 --> 02:41:12,000
or it's like you just have all like

4566
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:14,079
these this data set a massive data set

4567
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:16,000
of all these games from from say ronaldo

4568
02:41:14,079 --> 02:41:18,639
and messi like and just you just add

4569
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:20,639
that in like whatever csv format and

4570
02:41:18,639 --> 02:41:23,599
some some publicly available data set

4571
02:41:20,639 --> 02:41:25,119
like that i feel like people would just

4572
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:26,399
there there would be so many cool things

4573
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:28,560
that you could do with it and you just

4574
02:41:26,398 --> 02:41:30,478
set it free and then like the world

4575
02:41:28,559 --> 02:41:32,239
would like do its thing and then like

4576
02:41:30,478 --> 02:41:33,199
interesting things would come out of it

4577
02:41:32,239 --> 02:41:35,359
by the way

4578
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:37,120
i have this data set so

4579
02:41:35,359 --> 02:41:38,159
the two things that i've did of this

4580
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:40,720
scale

4581
02:41:38,159 --> 02:41:44,559
uh is soccer so it's body pose and ball

4582
02:41:40,719 --> 02:41:45,278
tracking for soccer and then um i tr

4583
02:41:44,559 --> 02:41:47,840
it's

4584
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:49,120
pupil tracking and blink tracking for

4585
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:50,960
it was joe rogan and a few other

4586
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:52,479
podcasts that i did so those are the two

4587
02:41:50,959 --> 02:41:56,159
data sets i have

4588
02:41:52,478 --> 02:41:59,039
did you analyze any of your podcasts

4589
02:41:56,159 --> 02:42:01,039
no i i think i really started doing this

4590
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:03,840
podcast after

4591
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:06,080
after doing that work and it's difficult

4592
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:06,079
to

4593
02:42:06,559 --> 02:42:12,239
maybe i'd be afraid of what i find

4594
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:14,399
i'm already annoyed with my own voice

4595
02:42:12,239 --> 02:42:15,840
and video like editing it

4596
02:42:14,398 --> 02:42:18,318
but perhaps that's the honest thing to

4597
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:20,719
do because uh one useful thing

4598
02:42:18,318 --> 02:42:22,639
about doing computer vision about myself

4599
02:42:20,719 --> 02:42:25,199
is like i know what i was thinking at

4600
02:42:22,639 --> 02:42:27,760
the time so you can start to like

4601
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:30,720
connect the particular

4602
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:33,120
the behavioral peculiarities of like the

4603
02:42:30,719 --> 02:42:34,478
way you blink the way you squint

4604
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:36,800
the way you

4605
02:42:34,478 --> 02:42:38,879
close your eyes like

4606
02:42:36,799 --> 02:42:41,119
talking about details there's it's like

4607
02:42:38,879 --> 02:42:42,959
for example i just closed my eyes

4608
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:44,160
is that a blink or no

4609
02:42:42,959 --> 02:42:45,919
like

4610
02:42:44,159 --> 02:42:47,840
figuring that out in terms of timing in

4611
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:50,000
terms of the blink dynamics

4612
02:42:47,840 --> 02:42:52,559
is tricky it's very doable i

4613
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:54,318
i think there's universal laws

4614
02:42:52,559 --> 02:42:56,559
about what is a blink and what is a

4615
02:42:54,318 --> 02:42:59,680
closed eye and all those things plus

4616
02:42:56,559 --> 02:43:02,239
makeup and eyelashes i actually um

4617
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:03,600
have annoyingly long eyelashes so i

4618
02:43:02,239 --> 02:43:07,680
remember when i was doing a lot of this

4619
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:09,760
work i i would cut off my eyelashes

4620
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:11,040
when like especially it was funny like

4621
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:13,120
female colleagues were like what the

4622
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:15,439
[ __ ] are you doing like those no keep

4623
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:17,359
the eyelashes but because it got in the

4624
02:43:15,439 --> 02:43:19,120
way made the computer vision a lot more

4625
02:43:17,359 --> 02:43:20,800
difficult but

4626
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:22,399
super interesting topics yeah but

4627
02:43:20,799 --> 02:43:24,959
speaking about the

4628
02:43:22,398 --> 02:43:27,840
one uh still on the topic of the data

4629
02:43:24,959 --> 02:43:29,119
sets for sports there's one um one paper

4630
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:31,200
that and i actually annotated it on

4631
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:35,200
fermat and uh

4632
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:38,000
it's it was published in uh 90s 90s i

4633
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:40,240
believe 90s or 80s i forget but they're

4634
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:41,600
you the researcher was effectively

4635
02:43:40,239 --> 02:43:45,039
looking at

4636
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:47,279
the hot and phenomena in basketball

4637
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:50,880
right so whether like the fact that you

4638
02:43:47,279 --> 02:43:52,800
just made a field goal um if you know if

4639
02:43:50,879 --> 02:43:55,039
on your next attempt if you're more

4640
02:43:52,799 --> 02:43:56,639
likely to make it or not

4641
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:58,240
um

4642
02:43:56,639 --> 02:44:00,398
and it was super interesting because i

4643
02:43:58,239 --> 02:44:01,760
mean he pulled like i think 100

4644
02:44:00,398 --> 02:44:03,439
undergrads and

4645
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:05,200
i think from stanford and cornell and

4646
02:44:03,439 --> 02:44:06,880
asking people like do you

4647
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:09,200
you think that's that you have a higher

4648
02:44:06,879 --> 02:44:11,039
likelihood of making your free throw if

4649
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:13,760
you just just made one and i think it's

4650
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:16,080
like 68 68

4651
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:17,520
said yes they believe that and and then

4652
02:44:16,079 --> 02:44:19,279
he looked

4653
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:21,279
at the data

4654
02:44:19,279 --> 02:44:23,040
and this was back in as i said like a

4655
02:44:21,279 --> 02:44:24,560
few decades ago and so i think he had a

4656
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:26,800
data set of about

4657
02:44:24,559 --> 02:44:29,039
he looked at it specifically for free

4658
02:44:26,799 --> 02:44:30,799
throws and he had a data set of about 5

4659
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:32,399
000 free throws

4660
02:44:30,799 --> 02:44:35,519
and

4661
02:44:32,398 --> 02:44:38,000
and effectively what he found was that

4662
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:40,159
specifically in the case of free throws

4663
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:42,959
he didn't for the aggregate data he

4664
02:44:40,159 --> 02:44:44,799
didn't find um that

4665
02:44:42,959 --> 02:44:46,799
he couldn't really spot that correlation

4666
02:44:44,799 --> 02:44:49,679
that hot end correlation so if you made

4667
02:44:46,799 --> 02:44:52,318
the first one you weren't more likely to

4668
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:53,920
to make the second one what he did find

4669
02:44:52,318 --> 02:44:55,920
was that they were just better at the

4670
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:57,920
second one because you just got like

4671
02:44:55,920 --> 02:45:00,159
maybe a tiny practice and you just you

4672
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:01,680
attempted once and then and then you're

4673
02:45:00,159 --> 02:45:04,079
going to be better at the next one and

4674
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:07,279
then i i then i went and there's a data

4675
02:45:04,079 --> 02:45:10,318
set on kaggle that has like 600 000 free

4676
02:45:07,279 --> 02:45:12,239
throws and i reran the the same

4677
02:45:10,318 --> 02:45:14,000
computations and and

4678
02:45:12,239 --> 02:45:16,239
confirmed like you can see a very clear

4679
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:18,719
pattern that they're just better at

4680
02:45:16,239 --> 02:45:20,159
their second free throw um that's

4681
02:45:18,719 --> 02:45:21,119
interesting because i think there's

4682
02:45:20,159 --> 02:45:22,959
similar

4683
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:24,479
that kind of analysis is so awesome

4684
02:45:22,959 --> 02:45:26,799
because i think with tennis they have

4685
02:45:24,478 --> 02:45:29,199
like uh like a fault like when you serve

4686
02:45:26,799 --> 02:45:30,959
they have analysis of like are you most

4687
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:32,880
likely to miss the second serve if you

4688
02:45:30,959 --> 02:45:35,199
missed first obviously

4689
02:45:32,879 --> 02:45:37,119
um yeah i think that's the case so that

4690
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:39,040
integrates

4691
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:40,720
that's so cool when psychology is

4692
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:43,439
converted into metrics in that way and

4693
02:45:40,719 --> 02:45:45,358
in sports it's especially cool because

4694
02:45:43,439 --> 02:45:47,520
it's such a constrained system that you

4695
02:45:45,359 --> 02:45:50,239
can really study human psychology

4696
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:51,840
because it's repeated it's constrained

4697
02:45:50,239 --> 02:45:54,239
so many things are controlled which is

4698
02:45:51,840 --> 02:45:56,719
something you rarely have in

4699
02:45:54,239 --> 02:45:58,159
in the wild psychological experiment so

4700
02:45:56,719 --> 02:46:00,639
it's cool

4701
02:45:58,159 --> 02:46:02,318
uh plus everyone loves it like sports is

4702
02:46:00,639 --> 02:46:05,439
really cool to analyze

4703
02:46:02,318 --> 02:46:08,799
people actually care about the results

4704
02:46:05,439 --> 02:46:10,800
yeah um i still think well like i yeah

4705
02:46:08,799 --> 02:46:13,039
and i will definitely publish uh this

4706
02:46:10,799 --> 02:46:14,639
work on messi versus ronaldo and i'd

4707
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:17,840
love to read it objective fully

4708
02:46:14,639 --> 02:46:17,840
objective to peer review

4709
02:46:18,398 --> 02:46:22,879
um yeah this is very true this is not

4710
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:25,120
past peer review

4711
02:46:22,879 --> 02:46:27,119
um let me ask sort of um

4712
02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:29,359
an advice question

4713
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:30,880
to uh to young folks

4714
02:46:29,359 --> 02:46:32,318
you've explored a lot of fascinating

4715
02:46:30,879 --> 02:46:34,239
ideas in your life

4716
02:46:32,318 --> 02:46:36,239
you've built a startup

4717
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:37,359
worked on physics worked in computer

4718
02:46:36,239 --> 02:46:38,639
science

4719
02:46:37,359 --> 02:46:41,439
what advice would you give to young

4720
02:46:38,639 --> 02:46:45,278
people today in high school maybe early

4721
02:46:41,439 --> 02:46:48,239
college about life about career

4722
02:46:45,279 --> 02:46:50,079
about science and mathematics

4723
02:46:48,239 --> 02:46:53,840
i remember like i

4724
02:46:50,079 --> 02:46:56,639
i read like i remember reading that um

4725
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:59,120
ponkario was once asked by um

4726
02:46:56,639 --> 02:47:01,519
a french journal about his advice for

4727
02:46:59,120 --> 02:47:03,920
young people and what was his teaching

4728
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:05,600
philosophy and he said that like one of

4729
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:07,439
the most important things that parents

4730
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:08,800
should teach their kids is how to be

4731
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:09,760
enthusiastic

4732
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:11,599
um

4733
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:12,559
in regards to like the mysteries of the

4734
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:14,640
world

4735
02:47:12,559 --> 02:47:16,000
and that he said like striking that

4736
02:47:14,639 --> 02:47:17,599
balance was actually one of the most

4737
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:19,680
important things between like in

4738
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:21,200
education you know you want to

4739
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:22,318
have your kids be enthusiastic about the

4740
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:23,920
mysteries of the world but you also

4741
02:47:22,318 --> 02:47:25,680
don't want to traumatize them like if

4742
02:47:23,920 --> 02:47:28,398
you really force them into something and

4743
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:31,040
i think like especially

4744
02:47:28,398 --> 02:47:33,358
if you're young i think you

4745
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:35,439
you should be curious and i think you

4746
02:47:33,359 --> 02:47:38,399
should ex

4747
02:47:35,439 --> 02:47:40,559
explore that curiosity to the fullest to

4748
02:47:38,398 --> 02:47:43,119
the point where you even become almost

4749
02:47:40,559 --> 02:47:44,398
as an expert on that topic

4750
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:46,079
and now and

4751
02:47:44,398 --> 02:47:48,318
you might start with something that it's

4752
02:47:46,079 --> 02:47:50,000
small like you might start with you know

4753
02:47:48,318 --> 02:47:51,760
you're interested in numbers and how to

4754
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:54,159
factor numbers into primes and then all

4755
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:56,719
of a sudden you go and and you're like

4756
02:47:54,159 --> 02:47:58,239
lost in number theory and you discover

4757
02:47:56,719 --> 02:47:59,840
cryptography and then all of a sudden

4758
02:47:58,239 --> 02:48:02,879
you're buying bitcoin

4759
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:04,398
and i and i think you should do these um

4760
02:48:02,879 --> 02:48:06,000
you should really try to fulfill this

4761
02:48:04,398 --> 02:48:08,079
curiosity and you should live in a

4762
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:10,559
society that allows you to fulfill this

4763
02:48:08,079 --> 02:48:12,559
curiosity which is also important and i

4764
02:48:10,559 --> 02:48:15,199
think you should do these not to get to

4765
02:48:12,559 --> 02:48:17,359
some sort of status or fame or money but

4766
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:19,680
i think this is the way this iterative

4767
02:48:17,359 --> 02:48:20,800
process i think this is the way to find

4768
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:21,600
happiness

4769
02:48:20,799 --> 02:48:23,358
and

4770
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:26,000
and i think this is also allows you to

4771
02:48:23,359 --> 02:48:27,520
find the meaning for your life

4772
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:29,680
i think it's all about like being

4773
02:48:27,520 --> 02:48:31,680
curious and being able to fulfill that

4774
02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:34,398
curiosity and that path

4775
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:36,720
to fulfilling that uh your curiosity

4776
02:48:34,398 --> 02:48:38,639
yeah the the the start small and let the

4777
02:48:36,719 --> 02:48:40,159
fire build is kind of interesting way to

4778
02:48:38,639 --> 02:48:42,318
think about it and you never know where

4779
02:48:40,159 --> 02:48:44,478
you're gonna end up it's it's

4780
02:48:42,318 --> 02:48:46,398
like for instance from us it's just a

4781
02:48:44,478 --> 02:48:49,119
really good example we started like just

4782
02:48:46,398 --> 02:48:51,278
by doing this as an internal like thing

4783
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:52,640
that we did with in the company and then

4784
02:48:51,279 --> 02:48:54,479
we started putting out there and now a

4785
02:48:52,639 --> 02:48:56,959
lot of people follow it and know about

4786
02:48:54,478 --> 02:48:58,639
it and so um and you still don't know

4787
02:48:56,959 --> 02:49:02,239
where females libra is going to end up

4788
02:48:58,639 --> 02:49:03,439
actually true exactly so um yeah i think

4789
02:49:02,239 --> 02:49:05,119
that would be my

4790
02:49:03,439 --> 02:49:07,760
piece of advice with very limited

4791
02:49:05,120 --> 02:49:10,000
experience of course but yeah yeah i

4792
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:12,159
agree i agree

4793
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:13,279
uh i mean is there something in from

4794
02:49:12,159 --> 02:49:14,959
particular

4795
02:49:13,279 --> 02:49:16,479
journal from the computer science versus

4796
02:49:14,959 --> 02:49:19,358
physics perspective

4797
02:49:16,478 --> 02:49:21,278
uh do do you regret not doing physics do

4798
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:23,120
you regret not doing computer science

4799
02:49:21,279 --> 02:49:27,120
which one is the the wiser the better

4800
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:29,040
human being this is messy versus ronaldo

4801
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:30,640
those are very

4802
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:33,120
i i don't know if you would agree but

4803
02:49:30,639 --> 02:49:34,559
they're kind of different disciplines

4804
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:35,920
true yeah

4805
02:49:34,559 --> 02:49:38,959
very much so

4806
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:41,279
um i actually actually uh

4807
02:49:38,959 --> 02:49:43,759
i was i i had that question in my mind i

4808
02:49:41,279 --> 02:49:45,920
i took physics classes uh as an

4809
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:47,840
undergrad uh or like

4810
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:49,279
besides what i had to take

4811
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:50,318
and um

4812
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:52,079
it's definitely something that i

4813
02:49:50,318 --> 02:49:53,519
considered at some point

4814
02:49:52,079 --> 02:49:55,039
um

4815
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:57,040
and

4816
02:49:55,040 --> 02:50:00,560
and that that i

4817
02:49:57,040 --> 02:50:02,319
i i do feel like later in life that

4818
02:50:00,559 --> 02:50:04,239
might be something that

4819
02:50:02,318 --> 02:50:06,799
i'm not sure if regret is

4820
02:50:04,239 --> 02:50:08,318
is the right word but it's it's kind of

4821
02:50:06,799 --> 02:50:10,000
something that i can imagine in an

4822
02:50:08,318 --> 02:50:13,439
alternative universe what would have

4823
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:15,760
happened if i if i've gone into physics

4824
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:18,000
um

4825
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:19,359
i try to think that like well depends on

4826
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:21,520
what your

4827
02:50:19,359 --> 02:50:22,559
path ends up being but that it's it's

4828
02:50:21,520 --> 02:50:24,640
not

4829
02:50:22,559 --> 02:50:26,159
super important right like exactly what

4830
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:28,879
you decide to

4831
02:50:26,159 --> 02:50:29,840
major on like i think there's there's

4832
02:50:28,879 --> 02:50:32,079
um

4833
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:34,000
i think tim urban like the blogger had a

4834
02:50:32,079 --> 02:50:36,478
good visualization of this where it's

4835
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:37,760
like you know like he

4836
02:50:36,478 --> 02:50:39,519
he has a picture where you have all

4837
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:41,040
sorts of paths that he could pursue in

4838
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:42,880
your life and then maybe you're in the

4839
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:44,640
middle of it and so there's maybe some

4840
02:50:42,879 --> 02:50:46,478
paths that are not accessible to you but

4841
02:50:44,639 --> 02:50:47,199
like the tree that is still in front of

4842
02:50:46,478 --> 02:50:50,239
you

4843
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:51,600
gives you a lot of optionality and so um

4844
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:53,199
there's two lessons to learn from that

4845
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:54,000
like we have a huge number of options

4846
02:50:53,200 --> 02:50:56,720
now

4847
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:59,520
and probably you're just one

4848
02:50:56,719 --> 02:50:59,519
to reflect

4849
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:04,398
like to try to uh derive wisdom from the

4850
02:51:02,239 --> 02:51:05,840
one little path you've taken so far may

4851
02:51:04,398 --> 02:51:08,000
be flawed because there's all these

4852
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:09,120
other paths you could have taken yeah so

4853
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,959
it's like

4854
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:13,120
uh so one it's inspiring that you can

4855
02:51:10,959 --> 02:51:14,879
take any path now and two

4856
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:18,079
it's like you you the path you've taken

4857
02:51:14,879 --> 02:51:20,398
so far is just one of many possible ones

4858
02:51:18,079 --> 02:51:22,478
but it does seem that like

4859
02:51:20,398 --> 02:51:25,519
physics and computer science both open a

4860
02:51:22,478 --> 02:51:28,398
lot of doors in a lot of different doors

4861
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:30,560
it's very interesting it is i i like in

4862
02:51:28,398 --> 02:51:32,079
this case like and especially in in our

4863
02:51:30,559 --> 02:51:33,439
case because i could see the difference

4864
02:51:32,079 --> 02:51:36,000
i studied i

4865
02:51:33,439 --> 02:51:37,760
i did i went to college in europe and uh

4866
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:39,439
went to college here in the us so i

4867
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:41,040
could see the differences like in the

4868
02:51:39,439 --> 02:51:43,439
european system is

4869
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:45,200
um more rigid in the sense that when you

4870
02:51:43,439 --> 02:51:46,559
decide to study physics you don't have a

4871
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:49,200
lot especially in the early years you

4872
02:51:46,559 --> 02:51:51,680
don't have a lot of um you can't choose

4873
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:52,880
to take like a class from like computer

4874
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:54,000
science course or something like that

4875
02:51:52,879 --> 02:51:56,079
you don't have a lot of freedom to

4876
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:57,600
explore in that sense in university as

4877
02:51:56,079 --> 02:52:00,799
opposed to here in the us where you have

4878
02:51:57,600 --> 02:52:02,479
more freedom and i think um

4879
02:52:00,799 --> 02:52:04,719
i think that's important i think that's

4880
02:52:02,478 --> 02:52:06,799
what constitutes you know a good kind of

4881
02:52:04,719 --> 02:52:09,119
educational system is one that

4882
02:52:06,799 --> 02:52:11,679
gravitates towards the interests of a

4883
02:52:09,120 --> 02:52:13,680
student as as you progress but i think

4884
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:15,760
in order for you to do that you need to

4885
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:18,318
explore different areas and i i felt

4886
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:19,680
like if i had a chance to take say more

4887
02:52:18,318 --> 02:52:21,278
computer science class when i was in

4888
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:23,760
college i would have probably

4889
02:52:21,279 --> 02:52:25,760
have taken those classes but um yeah but

4890
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:27,760
i ended up like focusing maybe too

4891
02:52:25,760 --> 02:52:28,960
too much in physics and i think you're

4892
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:30,719
at least

4893
02:52:28,959 --> 02:52:32,559
my perception is that you can explore

4894
02:52:30,719 --> 02:52:35,760
more more

4895
02:52:32,559 --> 02:52:38,478
fields but there is a kind of it's funny

4896
02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:40,239
but physics can be difficult

4897
02:52:38,478 --> 02:52:41,358
so i don't see too many computer science

4898
02:52:40,239 --> 02:52:43,279
people than

4899
02:52:41,359 --> 02:52:44,640
exploring into physics it's only like

4900
02:52:43,279 --> 02:52:47,359
the one

4901
02:52:44,639 --> 02:52:49,199
the not the one but one of the

4902
02:52:47,359 --> 02:52:51,040
beneficial things of physics it feels

4903
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:52,079
like it

4904
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:55,680
uh

4905
02:52:52,079 --> 02:52:57,680
what was it rutherford that said like

4906
02:52:55,680 --> 02:53:00,079
like basically that physics is the hard

4907
02:52:57,680 --> 02:53:01,359
thing and everything is easy uh so like

4908
02:53:00,079 --> 02:53:04,079
there's a certain sense once you've

4909
02:53:01,359 --> 02:53:05,680
figured out some basic like physics

4910
02:53:04,079 --> 02:53:07,760
that it's not that you need the tools of

4911
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:10,079
physics to understand the other

4912
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:12,398
disciplines it's that you're empowered

4913
02:53:10,079 --> 02:53:14,318
by having done difficult [ __ ] i mean the

4914
02:53:12,398 --> 02:53:15,840
ultimate i think is probably mathematics

4915
02:53:14,318 --> 02:53:19,439
there yeah true

4916
02:53:15,840 --> 02:53:20,880
uh so maybe just doing difficult things

4917
02:53:19,439 --> 02:53:22,479
and proving to yourself that you can do

4918
02:53:20,879 --> 02:53:24,079
difficult things whatever those are

4919
02:53:22,478 --> 02:53:26,639
that's not positive i believe not

4920
02:53:24,079 --> 02:53:28,639
positive yeah and i think like i i

4921
02:53:26,639 --> 02:53:29,920
before i started a company i had like i

4922
02:53:28,639 --> 02:53:32,478
worked in

4923
02:53:29,920 --> 02:53:34,478
the financial sector for a bit and like

4924
02:53:32,478 --> 02:53:36,478
i think having a physics background i

4925
02:53:34,478 --> 02:53:39,039
was i felt i was not afraid of like

4926
02:53:36,478 --> 02:53:40,239
learning like finance things and i think

4927
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:42,319
like when you come from those

4928
02:53:40,239 --> 02:53:44,398
backgrounds you are generally not afraid

4929
02:53:42,318 --> 02:53:46,159
of stepping into other fields and

4930
02:53:44,398 --> 02:53:48,000
learning about those because

4931
02:53:46,159 --> 02:53:50,239

4932
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:54,000
difficult things and um

4933
02:53:50,239 --> 02:53:57,039
