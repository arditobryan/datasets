00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,879
frank wilceck a theoretical physicist at

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
mit

4
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,320
who won the nobel prize for the

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,400
co-discovery of

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
asymptotic freedom in the theory of

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,320
strong interaction

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,359
quick mention of our sponsors the

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,640
information

10
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:21,118
netsuite expressvpn blinkist

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,439
and a sleep check them out in the

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,278
description to support this podcast

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,800
as a side note let me say a word about

14
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,039
asymptotic freedom

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,960
protons and neutrons make up the nucleus

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,719
of an atom strong interaction

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,079
is responsible for the strong nuclear

18
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,239
force that binds them

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,600
but strong interaction also holds

20
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,919
together the quarks

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,960
that make up the protons and neutrons

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,440
frank wilcek

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,120
david gross and david pulitzer came up

24
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,119
with a theory postulating

25
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,119
that when quarks come really close to

26
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,519
one another the attraction abates

27
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,399
and they behave like free particles this

28
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,520
is called

29
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,879
asymptotic freedom this happens at

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,520
very very high energies which is also

31
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,799
where all the fun is this is the lex

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,680
friedman podcast

33
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,519
and here is my conversation with frank

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,680
wilcheck

35
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,959
what is the most beautiful idea in

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,400
physics

37
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:18,478
the most beautiful idea in physics is

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,520
that we can get a compact description of

39
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,079
the world that's

40
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:26,079
very precise and very full

41
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,280
at the level of the operating system of

42
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,078
the world

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:36,079
um that's an extraordinary gift

44
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:39,519
and we get we get worried when we

45
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,359
uh have find discrepancies between our

46
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,840
uh description of the world and and

47
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,640
what's actually observed

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
at the level even of a part in a billion

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,159
you actually have this quote

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,680
from einstein that the the most

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,759
incomprehensible thing

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,600
about the universe is it's co is that it

53
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,519
is comprehensible something like that

54
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,158
yes that's so that's the most beautiful

55
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:03,920
surprise that i think uh

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,759
that that really was the to me the

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,118
most profound result of the scientific

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,639
revolution of this

59
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,959
of the 17th century with uh

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,759
the shining example of newtonian physics

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,199
that you could

62
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,919
aspire to completeness precision

63
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,280
and a concise description of the world

64
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,079
of the operating system

65
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
and it's gotten better and better over

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
the years

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,039
and that's the continuing miracle now

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,878
there are a lot of beautiful

69
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,679
sub-miracles too

70
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,679
the form of the equations is governed by

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,000
high degrees of symmetry and

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,280
and they have a very surprising kind of

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,878
mind-expanding structure especially in

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,919
quantum mechanics

75
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,399
but if we have to say that the single

76
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,759
most

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,439
beautiful revelation is that

78
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:56,479
in fact uh the world is comprehensible

79
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,000
would you say that's a fact or hope it's

80
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,560
a fact

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,598
we can do we you can point to things

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,640
like

83
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:07,679
uh the rise of

84
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,000
uh gross

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,280
pro gross national products grow you

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,959
know per capita

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,719
around the world as a result of the

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,920
scientific revolution you can see it all

89
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,280
around you

90
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,919
uh uh uh in in recent developments with

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,479
exponents

92
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,759
so exponential production of wealth

93
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,359
control of nature

94
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:30,959
at uh a very profound level

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,040
where we do things like sense tiny tiny

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,360
tiny tiny vibrations

97
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,039
to tell that there are black holes

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,080
colliding far away

99
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:43,039
or we uh test laws as i

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,159
alluded to whether to part in a billion

101
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,199
and do

102
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,479
you know things and what appear on the

103
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,318
surface to be entirely different

104
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,959
conceptual universes i mean on the one

105
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,199
hand

106
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,000
pencil and paper or nowadays computers

107
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,000
that that

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,639
calculate abstractions and on the other

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,080
hand magnets and accelerators and

110
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,719
detectors that look at the

111
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
behavior of fundamental particles and

112
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,639
and these

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,158
different universes have to agree or

114
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,279
else we get very upset

115
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,719
and that's uh it's an amazing thing if

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,399
you think about it so

117
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:19,279
and it's telling us that we do

118
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,918
understand a lot about nature at a very

119
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,119
profound

120
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,240
level and uh

121
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,399
there are still things we don't

122
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,960
understand of course but

123
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,079
as we get better and better answers and

124
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,560
better and better

125
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,599
ability to address difficult questions

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,918
we can ask

127
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
more and more ambitious questions well i

128
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,560
guess the hope

129
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,159
part of that is because we are

130
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,720
surrounded by mystery

131
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
so we've one way to say it if you look

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,639
at the growth the

133
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,680
gdp over time that we figured out quite

134
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,240
a lot and we're

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,199
able to improve the quality of life

136
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
because of that

137
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,800
and we've figured out some fundamental

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,280
things about this universe but we still

139
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,079
don't know how much mystery there is

140
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,638
and it's also possible that there's some

141
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,279
things that are in fact

142
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:08,639
incomprehensible to both our minds

143
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,519
and the tools of science like we the

144
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,160
the sad thing is we may not know it

145
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,240
because

146
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,919
in fact they are incomprehensible and

147
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,038
that's the open question is

148
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,279
how much of the universe is

149
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:22,478
comprehensible if we figured out

150
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,359
the the everything uh what's inside the

151
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,120
black hole

152
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,720
and everything that happened at the

153
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,879
moment of the big bang

154
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,639
does that still give us the key to

155
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,800
understanding the human mind

156
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,879
and the the emergence of all the

157
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,280
beautiful complexity we see around us

158
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,000
that's not uh like when i when i see

159
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,439
these objects

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
like i don't know if you've seen them

161
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,759
like cellular automata

162
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,800
uh all these kinds of objects where the

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,280
from simple rules emerges complexity yes

164
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,439
it makes you wonder maybe it's not

165
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,079
reducible to simple beautiful

166
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,800
equations the whole thing only parts of

167
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,318
it

168
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
that's the tension i was getting at with

169
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
the hope well

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,560
when we say the universe is

171
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,360
comprehensible we have to

172
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,079
kind of draw careful distinctions about

173
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,080
or uh

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,000
definitions about what what we mean by

175
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,318
by that

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,199
uh both the university and the con and

177
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,479
the comprehensive

178
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,000
exactly right so uh the

179
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:25,279
so in certain areas

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,319
of understanding reality

181
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,959
we've made extraordinary progress i

182
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,199
would say

183
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,478
in understanding fundamental physical

184
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,879
processes

185
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,240
and getting very precise equations that

186
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,439
really work and

187
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,079
allow us to do uh the profound sculpting

188
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,319
of matter

189
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,000
you know to make computers and iphones

190
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,840
and everything else and they really work

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,319
and they're extraordinary productions

192
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,079
uh on the other but uh

193
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,680
and that's all based on the laws of

194
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,079
quantum mechanics and you know they

195
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,680
really

196
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:59,680
and they really work and then uh

197
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,800
and they give us tremendous control of

198
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,519
nature

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,759
on the other hand uh as i said as with

200
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,439
as we get better answers we can also ask

201
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,120
more ambitious questions and there are

202
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,639
certainly things that

203
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,319
have been observed even in the

204
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,800
in what would be usually called the

205
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,000
realm of physics that aren't understood

206
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,759
for instance there seems to be another

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,598
source of mass in the universe the

208
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,280
so-called dark matter

209
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,879
that we don't know what it is and it's a

210
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:32,399
very interesting question what it is

211
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,800
then uh but also as you were alluding to

212
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,359
there

213
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,639
there's it's one thing to know the basic

214
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,439
equations

215
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
it's another thing to be able to solve

216
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,199
them

217
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,679
in in important cases so we run a

218
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
we run up against the limits of that in

219
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,560
things like

220
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,240
chemistry where we'd like to be able to

221
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
design molecules and predict their

222
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,639
behavior

223
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,319
from the equations we think the

224
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,519
equations could do that

225
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,840
in principle but but uh

226
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,560
in practice it's very challenging to

227
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,159
solve them in

228
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,399
in all but very simple cases uh

229
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,080
and then there's the other thing which

230
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,719
is that a lot of what we're interested

231
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,000
in

232
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,639
is uh historically conditioned it's not

233
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,800
uh it's not a matter of the fundamental

234
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,840
equations but about

235
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,400
what has evolved or come out

236
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,478
of of the early universe and formed into

237
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,198
people and frogs and societies and

238
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,839
things

239
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,000
and the laws of physic the basic laws of

240
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,918
physics only take you so far

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,278
in the in that it kind of provides a

242
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,038
foundation but doesn't

243
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,879
really you need entirely different

244
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:42,000
concepts to deal with

245
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,000
uh those kind of uh and

246
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:47,200
all we one thing i can say about that is

247
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,759
that the laws themselves

248
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,080
point out their limitations that they

249
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,958
kind of their laws for dynamical

250
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,639
evolution so they tell you what happens

251
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,159
if you have a certain starting point but

252
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,879
they don't tell you what the starting

253
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,480
point

254
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,320
should be at least yeah and

255
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,039
uh the other the other thing that

256
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,399
emerges from the equations themselves

257
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:15,039
is the phenomena of chaos

258
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:19,679
and sensitivity to initial conditions

259
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:21,759
which tells us that you have that

260
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,679
there are intrinsic limitations on how

261
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,600
well we can spell out the

262
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,359
consequences of the laws if we try to

263
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,120
apply them see all the apple pie

264
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,278
if you want to what does it make an

265
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,959
apple pie from scratch

266
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,360
you have to build the universe or

267
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,799
something like that well

268
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
you're much better off starting with

269
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,719
apples than starting with quarks

270
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,159
let's put it that way in your uh book a

271
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,959
beautiful question you ask

272
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,199
does the world embody beautiful ideas so

273
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,958
the book is centered around this

274
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,720
very interesting question it's like

275
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,239
shakespeare you can like dig in and read

276
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
into all the different interpretations

277
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,320
of this question

278
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,000
but at the high level what to use the

279
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,800
connection between

280
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,078
beauty of the world and physics of the

281
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,799
world

282
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,519
in a sense we now have a lot of insight

283
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,759
into what the

284
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,639
the laws are the for the form they take

285
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,759
that and

286
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:13,759
allow us to understand matter in great

287
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,838
depth and control it

288
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:21,039
as we as we've discussed uh

289
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,160
it's an extraordinary thing how

290
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:27,360
mathematically ideal

291
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,919
those equations turn out to be in the

292
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,600
early days of greek philosophy

293
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:36,240
uh plato had this model of

294
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,399
atoms built out of the five perfectly

295
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,879
symmetrical platonic solids so there was

296
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,000
somehow the idea that mathematical

297
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,278
symmetry

298
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,360
uh should govern the world and uh we've

299
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,320
outplated plato by far

300
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,159
in modern physics because we have

301
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,440
symmetries that are much more extensive

302
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,559
much more powerful

303
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,480
that turn out to be uh the ingredients

304
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,039
out of which we construct our theory of

305
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,278
the world

306
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,278
and and it works and uh

307
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,519
so that's certainly beautiful so

308
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,399
the the math the idea of symmetry which

309
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,759
is

310
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:17,360
uh a driving inspiration

311
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:20,159
in much of human art uh especially a

312
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,720
decorative art or like the alhambra or

313
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,559
in

314
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,000
wallpaper designs or things you see

315
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,278
around you everywhere

316
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,799
uh also turns out to be the dominant

317
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,039
theme in

318
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,399
modern fundamental physics symmetry and

319
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,799
its manifestations

320
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,559
the laws turn out to be very to have

321
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:37,278
these tremendous amounts of symmetry you

322
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,879
can change

323
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,559
the symbols and move them around in

324
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,838
different ways and they still have

325
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:46,879
the same consequences uh

326
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:51,920
that so that's that's

327
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,919
uh beautiful and uh

328
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,720
that that uh these things uh these

329
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,278
different

330
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,480
these concepts that humans find

331
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,360
appealing

332
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,000
also turn out to be the concepts that

333
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,120
govern how the world actually works

334
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,799
and i don't think that's an accident i

335
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,679
think the humans

336
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,879
were evolved to be able to interact with

337
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:17,919
the world in

338
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,120
in ways that are advantageous and to

339
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,519
learn from it

340
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,679
and so we are naturally evolved or

341
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,000
designed to enjoy beauty and

342
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,919
and it's a symmetry and this and the

343
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,320
world has it and that's no

344
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,000
that's why we that's why we resonate

345
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,839
with it well it's interesting that the

346
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,200
ideas of symmetry emerge at

347
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:41,120
all at many levels of

348
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,200
the hierarchy of the universe so

349
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
you're talking about particles but it

350
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
also is

351
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,560
at the level of chemistry and biology

352
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,399
and

353
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:55,518
um and the fact that our

354
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,958
cognitive sort of our perception system

355
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:02,078
and whatever our cognition is also finds

356
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:04,078
it appealing or somehow our sense of

357
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,759
what is beautiful is grounded in this

358
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:06,719
idea of symmetry or the breaking of

359
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,159
symmetry

360
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
symmetry is at the core of our

361
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,679
conception of beauty whether it's the

362
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,879
breaking or the non-breaking of the

363
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:17,679
symmetry

364
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:21,519
it makes you wonder why

365
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:23,679
why like uh so i come from russia

366
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,560
in the in the question of dostoyevsky

367
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,559
he's

368
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,759
he has said that beauty will save the

369
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,439
world maybe

370
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,200
maybe as a physicist you can tell me

371
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,560
what do you think he meant by that

372
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
i don't i don't know if it saves the

373
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,559
world but it does turn out to be a

374
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,359
tremendous source of insight into the

375
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,879
world

376
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,000
when we uh investigate kind of the

377
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,879
the most fundamental interactions things

378
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,198
that are

379
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:50,078
hard to access because they occur at

380
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:52,958
very short distances between

381
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,958
very uh

382
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,159
special kinds of particles whose

383
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,639
properties are only revealed at high

384
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:00,639
energies

385
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,039
we don't have much to go on from

386
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,919
everyday life but so we have when we

387
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,679
guess what the

388
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,599
so we and then the experiments are

389
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,638
difficult to do so you can't

390
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,759
you can't really uh follow a very

391
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,039
uh holy empirical procedure to

392
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,879
sort of step in the baconian style

393
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,039
figure out the laws kind of step by step

394
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,639
just by accumulating a lot of data

395
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,198
what we actually do is guess and the

396
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,680
guesses

397
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,359
are kind of aesthetic really what what

398
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,159
would be a nice description

399
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,159
that's consistent with what we know and

400
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,719
then you try it out and see if it works

401
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,919
and then

402
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,440
and by gosh it does in in some

403
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:45,360
in many profound cases uh so

404
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,199
there's that but there's another source

405
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,720
of symmetry which i didn't

406
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:54,639
talk so much about in uh

407
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,120
in a beautiful question but does

408
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,560
uh relate to your comments and i think

409
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,399
very much relates to

410
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,518
uh the source of symmetry that we find

411
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,720
in biology

412
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,560
and uh in

413
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,759
in our in our heads you know in our

414
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,119
brain

415
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:17,198
which is that uh although i'd

416
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,560
well it is discussed a bit in in a

417
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,838
beautiful question and and

418
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:24,958
also in fundamentals is that

419
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,959
when you have

420
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,240
symmetry is also a very important means

421
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,199
of construction

422
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,480
so when you have for instance simple

423
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,599
viruses

424
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,399
that that need to construct their coat

425
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,440
their protein coat the coats often take

426
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,000
the form of platonic solids

427
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,880
and the reason is that the viruses are

428
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,879
really dumb

429
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,559
and they only know how to do one thing

430
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,000
so they make a pentagon then they make

431
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,439
another pentagon and they make another

432
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,360
pentagon and they

433
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,759
all glue together in the same way and

434
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,600
that makes a very symmetrical

435
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,919
object sort of so the rules of

436
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,560
development when you have simple rules

437
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,759
and they

438
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,838
go they work again and again you get

439
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,759
symmetrical patterns that's it's kind of

440
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,880
in in fact it's a recipe also for

441
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,720
generating

442
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:18,240
fractals you know really like uh

443
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,600
the kind of broccoli that has all this

444
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
internal structure and i

445
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,959
wish i had a picture to ship that many

446
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,560
people remember it from the

447
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:28,879
from the uh uh from the supermarket

448
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,399
and then and you say how did a vegetable

449
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,240
get so intelligent to make such a

450
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,039
beautiful object of all this

451
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,120
fractal structure and the the the secret

452
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,480
is stupidity you just do the same thing

453
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,078
over and over again

454
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:46,000
and uh in our brains also you know we've

455
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:48,958
we came out we start from single cells

456
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,360
and they reproduce and they they're each

457
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,518
one

458
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,560
does basically roughly the same thing

459
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,759
they

460
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,638
they uh the the program evolves in time

461
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,320
of course

462
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,519
different different modules get turned

463
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,278
on and off genetic

464
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,720
different regions of the genetic code

465
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,759
get turned on and off

466
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,199
but uh but basically a lot of the same

467
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,038
things are going on and they're simple

468
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,640
things and so you produce the same

469
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,480
patterns over and over again and that's

470
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,919
a recipe for producing symmetry because

471
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,838
you're getting the same thing

472
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,839
in many many places and if you look at

473
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:27,199
for instance the beautiful drawings of

474
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,840
rahman ikahal the great neuroanatomist

475
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,480
who drew the structure of different

476
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,319
organs

477
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,519
like the hippocampus you see it's very

478
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,839
regular

479
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:43,200
and very intricate and

480
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,879
it's symmetry in in this in

481
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,360
in that sense it's because it's it's

482
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,200
it's many repeated units that that

483
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,479
uh you can take from one place to the

484
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,759
other and see that they look more or

485
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,839
less the same

486
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,440
but what you're describing this kind of

487
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,798
beauty that we're talking about now

488
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,279
is a very small sample

489
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,960
in terms of space-time in a very big

490
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,000
world

491
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,960
in a very short brief

492
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,919
moment in this long history in your book

493
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,558
fundamentals

494
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,559
10 keys to reality i'd really recommend

495
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:18,319
people read it

496
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,038
you uh you say that space and time are

497
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:21,359
pretty big

498
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,558
or very big how big are we talking about

499
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,879
like what uh

500
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,599
can you draw can you tell a brief

501
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,880
history

502
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:31,119
of space and time it's easy to

503
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,919
tell a brief history but the details get

504
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,319
very

505
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,160
involved of course but uh one thing i'd

506
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,319
like to say is that

507
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,919
if if if you take a broad enough view

508
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,879
the history of the universe is simpler

509
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,559
than the history of sweden say

510
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,880
because you don't you your standards are

511
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:50,000
lower for for

512
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,600
but just to make it a a a

513
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,519
quantitative i'll just give a few

514
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,159
highlights and it's it's

515
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,879
it's a little bit easier to talk about

516
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,080
time

517
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
uh so let's start with that the big bang

518
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,519
occurred

519
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,679
we think the universe was much hotter

520
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,119
and denser and more uniform

521
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,000
about 13.8 billion years ago and that's

522
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,319
what we call the big

523
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,919
bang and it's been expanding and cooling

524
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,720
the matter in it has been expanding and

525
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,600
cooling

526
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,480
ever since so in a real sense the

527
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,959
universe is 13.8 billion years old

528
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,079
that's a big number kind of hard to

529
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,640
think about

530
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,279
a a nice way to think about it though is

531
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,400
to map

532
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,639
it on to one year so if

533
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,200
so let's say the universe just linearly

534
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,240
map the time intervals from

535
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,038
13.8 billion years on to one year so

536
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,000
the the big bang then is that on january

537
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,359
1st at

538
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,160
12 a.m and

539
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:53,839
uh you wait for quite a long time

540
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,080
before the dinosaur has emerged the

541
00:19:53,839 --> 00:20:00,079
dinosaurs emerge on christmas

542
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:03,519
it turns out almost 12 months later

543
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:06,720
getting close to the end yes

544
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:10,079
and the extinction event that uh

545
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,120
let mammals and ultimately humans

546
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:16,558
inherit the earth from from the

547
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:19,199
dinosaurs occurred on december 30th

548
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,798
and all of human history is a small part

549
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,240
of the last day

550
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:27,119
and so so yes so we

551
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,359
we're occupying only a human lifetime is

552
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,759
a

553
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:34,959
very very infinitesimal part of this uh

554
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:38,558
interval of these gigantic cosmic

555
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,279
reaches of time uh and

556
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,639
in space we can tell a very similar

557
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,678
story in fact

558
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,799
a very uh it's convenient to think

559
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,960
that the size of the universe is

560
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,960
the distance that light can travel in

561
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,480
13.8 billion years that's

562
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,960
so it's 13.8 billion light years

563
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,000
that's that's how far you can see out

564
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,600
that's how far

565
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,880
things can signals can reach us from

566
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:10,079
and um that

567
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,720
is a big distance

568
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,519
because compared to that uh the the

569
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,720
universe

570
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,079
that the earth is a fraction of a light

571
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,440
second

572
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:25,199
so again we it's really really big

573
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,840
and so we have if we want to think about

574
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,319
the universe as a whole in space and

575
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:34,000
time

576
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:34,960
we really need a different kind of

577
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,679
imagination

578
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,679
it's not it's not something you can

579
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,038
grasp in terms of psychological time in

580
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,639
a useful way you have to think

581
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,119
you know you have to use exponential

582
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,240
notation and abstract concepts

583
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:56,158
to really get any uh hold on on

584
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,000
on these vast times and spaces

585
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,520
on the other hand let me hasten to add

586
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,640
that that doesn't make us small

587
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:08,000
or make the time that

588
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,440
we have to us small because uh

589
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,319
again looking at those pictures of

590
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,880
you know what our minds are in some

591
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,279
sense of components of our minds these

592
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,120
beautiful drawings of the cellular

593
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,960
patterns inside the brain

594
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,798
you see that there are many many many

595
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,600
processing units

596
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:31,599
and if you analyze how fast they operate

597
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,359
i try to estimate how many thoughts a

598
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,119
person can have in a lifetime that's

599
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,000
kind of a fuzzy question but i'm very

600
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,439
proud that i

601
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,720
i was able to define it pretty precisely

602
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,519
and it turns out we can we have time for

603
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,000
billions

604
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,960
of meaningful thoughts you know in a

605
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
lifetime

606
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,798
so so it's a lot we shouldn't we

607
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,759
shouldn't think of ourselves as terribly

608
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,000
small

609
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,879
either in space or in time because

610
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
although we're

611
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,120
small in those dimensions compared to

612
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,319
the universe where

613
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,639
we're large compared to

614
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,519
meaningful units of processing

615
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,038
information

616
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,519
and and being able to conceptualize and

617
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,759
understand things

618
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,639
yeah but 99 of those thoughts are

619
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:18,640
probably

620
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,720
food sex or internet related but yeah

621
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,960
yeah well they're not that's right only

622
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,600
like point one is nobel prize winning

623
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,600
ideas

624
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,599
but that's true but uh you know there's

625
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,918
more to life than winning nobel prizes

626
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,519
how did you um do that calculate can you

627
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,000
maybe break that apart a little bit just

628
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,639
kind of

629
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,919
for fun sort of an intuition of how we

630
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
calculate the number of thoughts the

631
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,400
number of thoughts right there they're

632
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,918
it's necessarily imprecise because a lot

633
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,200
of things are going on in different ways

634
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,759
and what is a thought

635
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,100
but there are several things that point

636
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,319
to more or less the same

637
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:52,000
[Music]

638
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,879
uh rate of being able to have meaningful

639
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,640
thoughts

640
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,200
uh for instance i'm the one that i think

641
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
is

642
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,840
maybe the most penetrating is uh

643
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,360
how fast we can we can process visual

644
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,359
images how to how do we do that

645
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,599
if you've ever watched old movies

646
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,480
you can see that that when well any

647
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,558
movie

648
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,480
in fact that in a motion picture is

649
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,399
really not a motion picture it's

650
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,839
a series of snapshots that are playing

651
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,038
one after the other

652
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:27,759
and it's the because our brains

653
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,400
also work that way we take snapshots of

654
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,000
the world

655
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,679
integrate over a certain time and then

656
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,400
go on to the next one and then

657
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,880
by post-processing create the illusion

658
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,480
of continuity and flow

659
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:44,559
we can deal with that and uh

660
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,558
the if the flicker rate is too slow

661
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,558
then you start to see that it's not it's

662
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,319
a series of snapshots

663
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,480
and you can ask what is the what is the

664
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,519
crossover when does it change from being

665
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,759
something that

666
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,558
that is matched to our processing speed

667
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,038
versus

668
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,399
too fast and and it turns out about 40

669
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,440
per second

670
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,840
and then if you take 40 per second as

671
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,440
as how well we how fast we can process

672
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,720
visual images you get

673
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,080
to several billions of thoughts uh

674
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,079
if you similarly if you ask what

675
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,759
what are some of the fastest things that

676
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,000
people can do well you can they can play

677
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,879
video games they can play the piano very

678
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,038
fast if

679
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,480
if they're skilled at it and again you

680
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,278
get to similar

681
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,079
uh units or how fast can people talk you

682
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:29,359
get to sim

683
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,199
you know within a couple of orders of

684
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,918
magnitude you get more or less to the

685
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,200
same

686
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:38,000
idea so uh so that's how

687
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,880
you can say that that there's there's

688
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,720
billions of

689
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,000
meaning there's room for billions of

690
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,679
meaningful thoughts

691
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,480
yeah i won't argue for exactly 2 billion

692
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,200
versus 1.8 billion it's not that kind of

693
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,079
question but

694
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,720
but i think any estimate that's

695
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:57,278
reasonable will come out

696
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,079
within say a hundred billion and a

697
00:25:57,278 --> 00:25:59,829
hundred million

698
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,519
so it's a lot

699
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:04,079
[Laughter]

700
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,679
it would be interesting to map out for

701
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,319
an individual human being

702
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,720
the landscape of thoughts that they've

703
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:14,240
sort of traveled if you think of

704
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,319
thoughts as a set of trajectories uh

705
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,079
what what that landscape looks like i

706
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,918
mean

707
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,599
i've been recently really thinking about

708
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,640
uh

709
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,639
this richard dawkins idea of memes

710
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,400
and just all these ideas and the

711
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,640
evolution of ideas inside of one

712
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,960
particular human mind

713
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,919
and how there's there then changed and

714
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,558
evolved by

715
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,000
interaction with other human beings it's

716
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:41,359
interesting to think about

717
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,599
so if you think the numbers billions

718
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,599
you you think there's also social

719
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,959
interaction so these aren't

720
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,519
uh like there's interaction in the same

721
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,880
way you have

722
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,119
interaction with particles there's

723
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,278
interaction between human thoughts

724
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,199
uh that are perhaps that's that

725
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,400
interaction in itself is fundamental to

726
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,159
the process

727
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,919
of thinking like without social

728
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,240
interaction we would be

729
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,120
like stuck like walking in a circle we

730
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,278
need

731
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,239
we need the perturbation of other humans

732
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,558
to create

733
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,240
change in evolution once you bring in

734
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,639
concepts of uh

735
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,839
interactions and correlations and

736
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,520
relations

737
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,240
then you have what's called a

738
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:22,879
combinatorial explosion

739
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,038
that the number of possibilities rap

740
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,480
expands exponentially technically with

741
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,879
the number of

742
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,240
the number of things you're considering

743
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,760
and

744
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,440
uh it can easily rapidly outstrip these

745
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,119
these billions of thoughts that we're

746
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,720
talking about so

747
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,759
we we definitely uh cannot by brute

748
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,278
force

749
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,879
master complex situations and

750
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,798
or think about think of all the

751
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,360
possibilities in complex situations i

752
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:51,679
mean you know

753
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,359
even even something as relatively simple

754
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,159
as chess

755
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,000
is still something that human beings

756
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,600
can't comprehend completely even the

757
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,679
best players lose

758
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,759
still sometimes lose and they

759
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,480
consistently lose to computers these

760
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,960
days

761
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,679
uh and in computer science there's a

762
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,960
concept of

763
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,720
np complete so large classes of problems

764
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,000
when you scale them up beyond

765
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,960
a few individuals become intractable

766
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,880
and so that in that sense uh the world

767
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,960
is inexhaustible

768
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,159
but and that makes it beautiful that we

769
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,079
can make uh

770
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,480
any laws that generalize

771
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:31,278
efficiently and well can compress all of

772
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,120
that

773
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:34,798
combinatorial complexity just like a

774
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,278
simple rule that that itself is

775
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,759
beautiful

776
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,000
it's a happy situation and i i think

777
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:43,440
that that we can

778
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,480
find general principles of

779
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,120
sort of of the operating system that

780
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,759
are comprehensible simple extremely

781
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,558
powerful

782
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,278
and let us control things uh very well

783
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,960
and and ask profound questions

784
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,960
and on the other hand that the world is

785
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,038
going to be inexhaustible

786
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,399
that once we start asking about

787
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:07,759
relationships and how they evolve

788
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:09,918
and social interactions and the the

789
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,919
the we'll never have a theory of

790
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,440
everything in any meaningful sense

791
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,440
because

792
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,278
of everything everything truly

793
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,840
everything is

794
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,079
uh can i ask you about the big bang uh

795
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,240
so we talked about the space and time

796
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,359
are really big

797
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,798
but then and we humans give a lot of

798
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:33,599
meaning to the word space

799
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:36,480
and time in our in our like daily lives

800
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,199
but then can we talk about this moment

801
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,319
of beginning

802
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,319
and how we're supposed to think about it

803
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:44,000
that at the moment the big bang

804
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,879
everything was uh

805
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,519
what like infinitely small and then it

806
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,679
just

807
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,720
blew up we have to be careful here

808
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,080
because there's a

809
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,200
there's a common misconception that

810
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:59,439
the big that the big bang is like the

811
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,319
explosion of a bomb in empty space

812
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,880
that that uh fills up the surrounding

813
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,319
place

814
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,960
it is space it is yeah as we understand

815
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:11,278
it

816
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,798
it's the fact it's the the fact or the

817
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,798
hypothesis but

818
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:21,440
well supported up to a point that that

819
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,440
that everywhere in the whole universe

820
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,480
early in the history uh matter came

821
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,038
together into a very hot

822
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,839
very dense if you run it backwards in

823
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:31,519
time

824
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:35,359
matter comes together into a very hot

825
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:38,398
very dense and yet very homogeneous

826
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,918
plasma of all the different kinds of

827
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,759
elementary particles and quarks and

828
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,520
anti-quarks and gluons and photons and

829
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,119
electrons and anti-electrons everything

830
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,480
you know all of that stuff

831
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:51,359
like really hot really really

832
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,919
really hot we're talking about uh way

833
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:57,359
way hotter than the surface of the sun

834
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,480
uh you know well in fact if you

835
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,240
take the equations as we as they come

836
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,000
the the prediction is that the

837
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,599
temperature just goes to infinity but

838
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,839
then the equations

839
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,119
uh break down we don't you know we don't

840
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,519
don't really

841
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,278
with their various the equations become

842
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,679
infinity equals infinity so they don't

843
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:15,278
feel

844
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,559
that it's called a singularity we don't

845
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,240
really know uh this is running the

846
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:21,200
equations backwards so you can't really

847
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,798
get a sensible

848
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,319
idea of what happened before the big

849
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,558
bang we don't you know so

850
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,599
we need different equations to address

851
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,519
the very earliest

852
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:35,759
moments uh that uh

853
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,240
but so things were hotter and denser we

854
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,440
don't

855
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,079
really know why things started out that

856
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,159
way

857
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,158
we do we have a lot of evidence that

858
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,080
they did start out that way

859
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:53,278
uh but since most of the

860
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:56,079
uh you know we don't get to visit there

861
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,558
and do controlled experiments most most

862
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,798
of the

863
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,558
most of the record is is very very

864
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:04,079
processed and

865
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:06,158
we have to we have to use uh very

866
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,599
uh subtle techniques and powerful

867
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,960
instruments to

868
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:13,119
to get information that has survived

869
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,159
get closer and closer to the get closer

870
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,239
and closer to

871
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:22,080
the the beginning of things and

872
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,079
what's revealed there is that uh

873
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,359
as i said there what there undoubtedly

874
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,839
was a period when

875
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,519
everything in the universe that we have

876
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,480
been able to look at

877
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,359
and understand and that's consistent

878
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,880
with everything

879
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:40,558
is uh um

880
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,278
the was in a condition where it was much

881
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,200
much hotter

882
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,880
and much much denser but still obeying

883
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,080
the laws of physics as we know them

884
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,360
today

885
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:53,678
and and then you start with that so all

886
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,879
the matter is in equilibrium

887
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,360
uh and then with small quantum

888
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,080
fluctuations and run it forward

889
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:02,639
and then it produces in at least in

890
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,839
broad

891
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,399
strokes the universe we see around us

892
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,278
today

893
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,398
do you think we'll ever be able to with

894
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,960
the tools of physics

895
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:16,000
with the way sciences with the way the

896
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,159
human mind is we'll ever be able to get

897
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,038
to the moment of the big bang in our

898
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,519
understanding

899
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:23,119
or even the moment before the big bang

900
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,558
can we understand what happened before

901
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,839
the big bang i'm

902
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:31,519
i'm optimistic both that we'll

903
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:34,639
be able to uh measure more

904
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,640
so observe more and that we'll be able

905
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,120
to figure out more

906
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,640
so uh they're very very tangible

907
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,000
prospects

908
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,159
for uh observing the

909
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,440
extremely early universe so much even

910
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,240
much earlier than we can

911
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,080
observe now uh through looking at

912
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,798
gravitational waves

913
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,599
gravitational waves since they interact

914
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,720
so weakly

915
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:02,158
with ordinary matter uh

916
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,558
sort of send an un a minimally processed

917
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,200
signal from the big bang it's a very

918
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:07,200
weak

919
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,358
signal because it's traveled a long way

920
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,918
and diffused over long spaces

921
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,199
but uh but people are gearing up to try

922
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,039
to detect

923
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,039
gravitational waves that could have come

924
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:19,440
from the early universe yeah ligo's

925
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:21,279
incredible engineering project is the

926
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,559
most sensitive

927
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,879
precise yes devices on earth

928
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,320
the fact that humans can build something

929
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,639
like that is uh

930
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,079
truly awe-inspiring from an engineering

931
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,919
perspective right

932
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,399
and but these gravitational waves from

933
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:39,279
the early universe would probably be

934
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,398
of a much longer wavelength than lyco is

935
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,760
capable of

936
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:48,239
sensing so there's a beautiful

937
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:52,159
project uh that's contemplated

938
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:54,559
to put lasers in different parts

939
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,119
different locations in the solar system

940
00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:00,000
you know we really really separated by

941
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,240
uh solar system scale differences like

942
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,880
artificial planets or moons

943
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:07,039
in different places and and see the tiny

944
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,400
motions of those relative to one another

945
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,239
as a signal of

946
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,240
of radiation from the big bang we can

947
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:15,919
also maybe

948
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:17,679
indirectly see the imprint of

949
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,240
gravitational waves from the early

950
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,519
universe

951
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,639
on uh the photons the the microwave

952
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,440
background radiation

953
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,838
that that is our present way of of

954
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,599
seeing

955
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,519
into the earliest universe but those

956
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,039
those photons

957
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,960
interact much more strongly with matter

958
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:33,759
they're much more strongly processed so

959
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,679
they don't

960
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,760
give us directly such an unprocessed

961
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,039
view of the early universe of the very

962
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,000
early universe

963
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,960
but if gravitational waves leave some

964
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,079
imprint

965
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,838
on that as they move through uh

966
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,359
we could detect that too and people are

967
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:55,358
trying our

968
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:57,759
as we speak working very hard towards uh

969
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,920
towards that goal it's so exciting to

970
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,400
think about a sensor the size of a solar

971
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,358
system

972
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,280
like uh that would be a fantastic i mean

973
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,759
that would be a pinnacle

974
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,640
artifact of human endeavor to me it

975
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,680
would be

976
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:15,118
such uh such an inspiring thing

977
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:17,279
that just we want to know

978
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,240
and we go to these extraordinary lengths

979
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,079
of making

980
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,519
gigantic things that are also very

981
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,079
sophisticated because what you're trying

982
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,800
to do

983
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,320
you you have to understand how they move

984
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,560
you have to understand

985
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,800
uh the properties of light that that are

986
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,279
being used interference between light

987
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,200
and

988
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,200
you have to be able to make the light

989
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,838
with lasers and understand the quantum

990
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,078
theory and

991
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:39,440
get the timing exactly right you know

992
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,599
it's an extraordinary

993
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,880
endeavor involving all kinds of

994
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,760
knowledge from the very strong

995
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,599
very small to the very large and all in

996
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,640
the service of

997
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,838
uh curiosity and built on a grand scale

998
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:55,838
so yeah

999
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,200
if we did that i love that you're

1000
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,960
inspired both by by the power of theory

1001
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:06,480
and the power of experiments so this is

1002
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,240
the both both i think are

1003
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,400
exceptionally impressive that the human

1004
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,319
mind can come up with theories

1005
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,079
that give us a peek into how the

1006
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,119
universe works but also

1007
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,920
construct tools that are way bigger than

1008
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,160
uh

1009
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,960
the the evolutionary origins we came

1010
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,559
from right

1011
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,199
and by the way you know the fact that we

1012
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:28,000
can design those things and they work

1013
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:29,039
yeah is an extraordinary demonstration

1014
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,079
that we really do

1015
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,960
understand a lot and then

1016
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,440
in some ways and it's our ability to

1017
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,679
answer

1018
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,679
questions that also leads us to be able

1019
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,399
to address more ambitious questions

1020
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:42,879
so you mentioned that at the at the big

1021
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,519
bang

1022
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,800
in the early days things are pretty

1023
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:51,599
homogeneous

1024
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:55,039
yes but uh here we are sitting on earth

1025
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,599
to uh hairless apes you could say

1026
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,199
with microphones in talking about the

1027
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,039
brief history of things you said it's

1028
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,279
much harder to describe sweden than it

1029
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,320
is

1030
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,200
um the universe so there's a lot of

1031
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,119
complexity

1032
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,759
there's a lot of interesting details

1033
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,880
here so how does this complexity come to

1034
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,599
be do you think

1035
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,000
it seems like there's these pockets yeah

1036
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,519
we don't know how rare of like

1037
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,920
uh we're hairless apes just emerge yeah

1038
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:23,358
and then they came from the initial soup

1039
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,400
that was homogeneous

1040
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:29,039
was that uh yeah accident

1041
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,480
well we understand there we understand

1042
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,519
in broad

1043
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,280
outlines how it could happen

1044
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,599
we certainly don't understand why it

1045
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,040
happened exactly and the way it did or

1046
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,720
but but uh or you know

1047
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,199
there are certainly open questions about

1048
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,759
the origins of life and how inevitable

1049
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,799
the emergence of intelligence was and

1050
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,400
and how that happened

1051
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,680
but uh in the very broadest terms

1052
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,960
uh the universe early on

1053
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,960
was quite homogeneous but not completely

1054
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,639
homogeneous

1055
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,760
there are there were part in 10 000

1056
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:11,118
fluctuations in density within this

1057
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,359
primordial plasma and

1058
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:17,519
uh as time goes on

1059
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,199
there's an instability which causes

1060
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,119
those density contrasts

1061
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,960
to increase there's a gravitational

1062
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,640
instability where it's denser

1063
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,800
the gravitational attractions are

1064
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,480
stronger and so that brings in more

1065
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,440
matter and it gets even denser

1066
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,320
and so on and so on so so there's a

1067
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,880
natural

1068
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,119
tendency of matter to clump because of

1069
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,000
gravitational interactions

1070
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,680
and then the equations get complicated

1071
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,199
when you have lots of things

1072
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:47,199
clumping together uh then you know then

1073
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,439
then we know what the laws are but we

1074
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,960
have to to a certain extent wave our

1075
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,480
hands about what what

1076
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,880
what happens but uh the basic

1077
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,838
understanding of chemistry says that if

1078
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,320
things

1079
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,119
and and the physics of radiation tells

1080
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,880
us that if

1081
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,960
as things start to clump together they

1082
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,440
can radiate give off some

1083
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,280
energy so they don't just they slow down

1084
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,960
they as a result they lose energy they

1085
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,240
conglomerate together

1086
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,159
cool down form things like stars form

1087
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,118
things like planets

1088
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,078
and so in broad terms there's no mystery

1089
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,400
there's

1090
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,000
that that's what the scenario that's

1091
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,280
what the equations tell

1092
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,599
you should happen but because

1093
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:36,319
it's a process involving many many

1094
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,800
fundament individual units uh

1095
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:39,519
the the the application of the laws that

1096
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,680
govern

1097
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:46,000
individual units to these things is is

1098
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,159
very delicate uh you know

1099
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,519
computationally very difficult

1100
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,358
and more profoundly uh the equations

1101
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,280
have this probability of chaos or

1102
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,159
sensitivity to initial conditions which

1103
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,800
tells you

1104
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:00,559
tiny differences in the initial state

1105
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,839
can lead to enormous differences

1106
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:07,519
in the subsequent behavior so so

1107
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:08,239
physics fundamental physics at some

1108
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,119
point says

1109
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,318
okay chemists biologists this is your

1110
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,358
problem

1111
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:19,039
and and uh and then

1112
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:22,400
again in broad terms we know how

1113
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:25,199
uh it's conceivable that that the

1114
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,079
humans and things like that can can uh

1115
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:32,239
that how complex structure can emerge

1116
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,160
it's a matter of uh having

1117
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,159
the right kind of temperature and the

1118
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:40,239
right kind of stuff

1119
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:42,000
so you need you need to be able to make

1120
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:43,358
chemical bonds that are reasonably

1121
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,838
stable and

1122
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,759
be able to make complex structures and

1123
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,000
we're very fortunate that carbon has

1124
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,079
this

1125
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,318
ability to make uh backbones and

1126
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,920
elaborate branchings and things so you

1127
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:57,519
can get complex things that we call

1128
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,480
biochemistry

1129
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,318
and and yet the bonds can be broken a

1130
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,880
little bit with the help of

1131
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:05,599
energetic injections from the sun so you

1132
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,440
have to have

1133
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,640
both the possibility of changing but

1134
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,119
also the possible

1135
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,239
useful degree of stability and we know

1136
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,280
at that

1137
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,318
very very broad level

1138
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,560
physics can tell you that it's

1139
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:19,838
conceivable yeah if you want to know

1140
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,960
what actually

1141
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:25,279
what what's what what really happened

1142
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,079
what really can happen then you have to

1143
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,760
work a bit to

1144
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,680
go to chemistry if you have if you want

1145
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,280
to know what actually happened

1146
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,919
then you really have to consult the

1147
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,280
fossil record in biologists and so

1148
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,119
so uh but but it's it so these

1149
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,200
these ways of addressing the issue

1150
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,200
are complementary in a sense they but

1151
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:48,879
they uh

1152
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:50,960
they uh they use different kinds of

1153
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,280
concepts they use different

1154
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,559
uh languages and they address different

1155
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,720
kinds of questions but

1156
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:57,679
they're they're not inconsistent they're

1157
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:59,919
just

1158
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,879
complimentary it's kind of interesting

1159
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,960
to think about

1160
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:08,240
those early fluctuations as our

1161
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,720
earliest ancestors yes that's right so

1162
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:14,559
it's far it's amazing to think that uh

1163
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:18,719
you know this is

1164
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:21,759
the modern answer to the uh

1165
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:24,399
or the modern version of uh

1166
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,520
the what the hindu philosophers had that

1167
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,720
art thou

1168
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,880
if you ask what okay that those those

1169
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,919
little quantum fluctuations in the early

1170
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,318
universe

1171
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:40,318
are the seeds out of which uh complexity

1172
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:42,239
including uh plausibly humans really

1173
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,639
evolve you don't need anything else that

1174
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:47,358
brings up the question

1175
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,759
of uh asking for a friend here if

1176
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,960
there's

1177
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:56,720
uh you know other pockets of complexity

1178
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,920
commonly called as uh alien intelligent

1179
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:02,239
civilizations out there well we don't

1180
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,720
know for sure but i

1181
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,078
i have a strong suspicion that the

1182
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:09,759
answer is yes because

1183
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:13,359
the uh the one

1184
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,319
case we do have at hand to study

1185
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:18,400
here on earth uh we sort of know what

1186
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,159
the conditions were that were helpful to

1187
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,519
life the right kind of temperature the

1188
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,118
right kind of star

1189
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,800
that that keeps maintains that

1190
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,000
temperature for a long time the liquid

1191
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,000
environment of water

1192
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:34,639
and once those conditions

1193
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,318
emerged on earth which was roughly four

1194
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:37,519
and a half billion years ago it wasn't

1195
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:40,400
very long before

1196
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,440
what we call life started to leave

1197
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,720
relics

1198
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,880
so we can find the

1199
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,318
forms of life primitive forms of life

1200
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,400
that are almost

1201
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,480
as old as the earth itself in the sense

1202
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,160
that once the earth

1203
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,960
became reason was was returned from a

1204
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:01,039
a a very hot boiling thing and cooled

1205
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,440
off into a solid mass with

1206
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,318
it with water uh life emerged very very

1207
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,760
quickly so

1208
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,079
so it seems that these general

1209
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,920
conditions for life

1210
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:15,920
uh are enough to to make it happen

1211
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:19,599
uh relatively quickly now

1212
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,400
the other lesson i would i think that

1213
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,519
one can uh draw from this one example

1214
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,680
it's dangerous to

1215
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,800
the drug lessons from one example but

1216
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:30,799
that's all we've got

1217
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,720
uh and uh that that the emergence of

1218
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,160
intelligent life is a different

1219
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:38,078
issue altogether it uh that took a long

1220
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:42,799
time

1221
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:47,200
and seems to have been pretty contingent

1222
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,519
uh the you know the the for a long time

1223
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:50,480
well for most most of the history of

1224
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:53,759
life

1225
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,960
it was single-celled things

1226
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,000
you know uh yes even multicellular life

1227
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,280
only rose about 600 million years ago

1228
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,599
so much after you know so and the the

1229
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:10,079
uh and then

1230
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,440
intelligence is kind of a luxury you

1231
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,800
know if you think

1232
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:18,639
uh many more kinds of creatures

1233
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:22,000
have uh big stomachs

1234
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:24,159
than big brains and in fact uh most most

1235
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,199
most have no brains at all in any

1236
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,559
reasonable sense

1237
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:30,399
that that then uh and the dinosaurs

1238
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:31,679
ruled for a long long time and some of

1239
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,119
them were pretty smart but

1240
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,399
they they were at best bird brains

1241
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,519
because you know birds

1242
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,358
came from the dinosaurs uh and

1243
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:42,719
uh and it could have stayed that way you

1244
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:44,880
know and and

1245
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:47,679
then human and the emergence of humans

1246
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,599
was very contingent and kind of a

1247
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,759
very very recent development on

1248
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,000
evolutionary time scales

1249
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,680
and uh you can argue about the level of

1250
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,239
human intelligence but it's you know i

1251
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,318
think it's

1252
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:00,879
that that's what we're talking about and

1253
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,719
it's very it's very impressive and can

1254
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,160
ask these kinds of questions and discuss

1255
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,838
them intelligently

1256
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:11,279
uh the uh so

1257
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:16,078
i guess my my so this is a long-winded

1258
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:19,599
answer or justification of

1259
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:22,720
my feeling is that uh the

1260
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:26,960
conditions for life

1261
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:28,879
in some form are probably con

1262
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,000
satisfied many many places around the

1263
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,119
universe

1264
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,880
even and even within our galaxy uh

1265
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,880
i'm not so sure about the emergence of

1266
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,240
intelligent life

1267
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:44,079
or the emergence of technological uh

1268
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:46,799
civilizations that that that seems

1269
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,160
uh much more much more contingent and

1270
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,400
special and

1271
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,679
we might it's conceivable to me that

1272
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,039
we're the only example

1273
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:56,719
in the galaxy or although

1274
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,800
yeah i don't know one way or the other i

1275
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:00,239
i have different opinions on different

1276
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,280
days of the week well one of the things

1277
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,639
that worries me

1278
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:08,960
in in uh in the spirit of being humble

1279
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:11,759
that our particular kind of intelligence

1280
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,599
is not very special so there's all kinds

1281
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,319
of different intelligences

1282
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,519
and even more broadly there could be

1283
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:20,318
many different

1284
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,239
kinds of life yes so the basic

1285
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:24,400
definition and i just had

1286
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,759
i think somebody that you know sarah

1287
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,119
walker i just had a very long

1288
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,200
conversation with her

1289
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,800
about even just the very basic question

1290
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:34,000
of trying to define

1291
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,000
what is life from a physics perspective

1292
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,440
yeah even that question within itself i

1293
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,079
think one of the most fundamental

1294
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,200
questions

1295
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,519
in science and physics and everything is

1296
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:44,399
just

1297
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,079
trying to get a hold trying to get some

1298
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,000
universal laws around the

1299
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,318
ideas of what is life because that kind

1300
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,480
of unlocks a bunch of things around

1301
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:53,358
life intelligence consciousness all

1302
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,199
those kinds of things

1303
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:58,078
i agree with you in a sense but i think

1304
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:01,519
that's a dangerous question because

1305
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,800
the the answer can't be any more precise

1306
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:07,679
than the question

1307
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,680
and the uh the the question what is life

1308
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:11,759
kind of assumes that we have a

1309
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,599
definition of life and that it's a

1310
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,480
natural phenomena that that can be

1311
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,400
distinguished

1312
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,159
but that really there are edge cases

1313
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,599
like viruses and

1314
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:24,399
uh some people would like to say that uh

1315
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,880
electrons have consciousness and they

1316
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,760
you know

1317
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,559
so you can't if you really have fuzzy

1318
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,040
concepts

1319
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,000
it's uh it's very hard to to reach

1320
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:36,400
precise kinds of scientific answers

1321
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,280
but i think there's a very fruitful

1322
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,880
question that's

1323
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,000
adjacent to it which is has been pursued

1324
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,079
in different forms

1325
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,760
for quite a while and is now becoming

1326
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,160
very sophisticated

1327
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,960
in reaching in new directions and that

1328
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,078
is

1329
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,358
what are the states of matter that are

1330
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,720
possible you know so

1331
00:49:55,358 --> 00:50:00,799
in high school or grade school you

1332
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,519
learn about solid solids liquids and

1333
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,559
gases but that really just scratches the

1334
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:06,559
surface

1335
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,640
of different ways that are

1336
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:13,400
distinguishable that matter can

1337
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:15,598
form into uh

1338
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,280
macroscopically different meaningful

1339
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,200
patterns that we call phases

1340
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,200
and then there are precise definitions

1341
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:23,199
of what we mean by phases of matter

1342
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,480
but then uh and that have been worked

1343
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,759
out fruitful

1344
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,679
over the decades and we're discovering

1345
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,680
new states of matter all the time

1346
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:32,799
and kind of having to work at what we

1347
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,239
mean by

1348
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,839
matter we're discovering the

1349
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:39,519
capabilities of matter

1350
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:42,719
to organize in interesting ways

1351
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:45,920
and uh

1352
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:49,039
some of them like liquid crystals

1353
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,599
are important ingredients of life our

1354
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,880
cell membranes are liquid crystals

1355
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,440
and that's very important to the way

1356
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,519
they work

1357
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,440
recently there's been a development in

1358
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:02,880
where we're talking about

1359
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,838
uh states of matter that not only

1360
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,240
not that are not static but that have

1361
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:09,838
dynamics that have that uh

1362
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,358
have characteristic patterns not only in

1363
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:12,880
space but in time

1364
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,279
these are called time crystals and

1365
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,760
that's that's been a development that's

1366
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,319
just in the last decade or so it's

1367
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,680
really

1368
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:25,920
really flourishing uh and

1369
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:26,719
so uh is there a state of matter that

1370
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,000
cause or

1371
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:29,838
group of states of matter that

1372
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,760
corresponds to life

1373
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:35,519
uh maybe but but the answer can't be any

1374
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,760
more definite than the question

1375
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,639
so i mean i i got to push back on the

1376
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,040
the the quite

1377
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,639
those are just words i mean i i i

1378
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,838
disagree with you the

1379
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,920
the the question points to a direction

1380
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:50,318
the answer might be able to be to be

1381
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,200
more precise than the question

1382
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:53,679
because because uh just as you're saying

1383
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,639
there

1384
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,598
there's uh that we could be discovering

1385
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:59,920
certain

1386
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,280
characteristics and patterns that are

1387
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,480
associated with a certain

1388
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:08,640
type of matter macroscopically speaking

1389
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,760
and that that we can then uh be able to

1390
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:14,480
post facto say this is let's

1391
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,160
sign the word life well kind of matter i

1392
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,880
agree with that completely that that's

1393
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,679
that's uh but that's so it's not a

1394
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,480
disagreement

1395
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,759
it's very frequent in physics that where

1396
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,199
in science that

1397
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:30,160
uh words that are in common use gets

1398
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,919
get refined and reprocessed into

1399
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:33,279
scientific terms that's happened for

1400
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,400
things like force and

1401
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,720
energy uh and

1402
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,240
so we've in a way we we find out what

1403
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:43,838
the useful definition

1404
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:46,719
is uh or symmetry for instance

1405
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:48,400
and the common usage may be quite

1406
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,480
different from the scientific usage but

1407
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,960
the scientific usage

1408
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,480
is special and takes on a life of its

1409
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,920
own and we find out what the

1410
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:01,440
the useful version of it is

1411
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,920
uh what the the fruitful version of it

1412
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,200
is

1413
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:08,559
so i do think so in that spirit

1414
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:12,480
i think if we uh can

1415
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:15,920
identify states of matter

1416
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,719
that or linked states of matter

1417
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:22,960
that can carry on processes of uh

1418
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:28,078
self-reproduction and development

1419
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:30,639
and information processing

1420
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,000
we should say we we might be tempted to

1421
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:34,558
classify those

1422
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,800
as like things as life yeah well can i

1423
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:40,400
ask you about the craziest one

1424
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,559
which is uh the one we know

1425
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,079
maybe least about which is consciousness

1426
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,519
is it possible that there are certain

1427
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,519
kinds of matter would be able to

1428
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:51,199
classify

1429
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:53,920
as um conscious meaning

1430
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,480
like the so there's uh the pan cyclists

1431
00:53:53,920 --> 00:54:00,000
right with the philosophers who kind of

1432
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,679
try to imply that uh all matter has some

1433
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,119
degree of consciousness and yeah you can

1434
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:04,000
almost construct like a physics of

1435
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,119
consciousness

1436
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,119
yes do you um

1437
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,680
again we're in such early days of this

1438
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,960
but nevertheless it seems useful to talk

1439
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:15,199
about is

1440
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,480
is there some sense from a physical

1441
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:19,039
perspective to make sense of

1442
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,039
consciousness

1443
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,880
again consciousness is uh

1444
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,920
imprecise a very imprecise word and

1445
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,480
loaded with

1446
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,039
uh connotations that i think we should

1447
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,559
we

1448
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:32,880
don't want to start a scientific

1449
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:36,798
analysis with that i don't think

1450
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:39,039
uh it's often been

1451
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:40,480
important in science to start with

1452
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:44,239
simple cases

1453
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,639
and work up uh consciousness i think

1454
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,639
what

1455
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,039
most people think of when you talk about

1456
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:52,798
consciousness is okay

1457
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:54,239
i'm what am i doing in the in the world

1458
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:55,838
this is my experience i have a rich

1459
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,118
experience rich inner life and

1460
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,759
experience of

1461
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,559
and uh where is that in the equations

1462
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,559
and

1463
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,200
i think that's a great question a great

1464
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,760
great question and actually i think

1465
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,558
i'm gearing up to spend part of the i

1466
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,880
mean

1467
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,720
to try to address that in coming years

1468
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,318
one version of asking that question just

1469
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:17,118
as you said now

1470
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:17,679
is what is the simplest yeah formulation

1471
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,920
of

1472
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:21,519
that to study i think i think i'm much

1473
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,760
more comfortable with the idea of

1474
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,679
studying self-awareness

1475
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,319
as opposed to consciousness because that

1476
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,838
that sort of gets rid of the mystical

1477
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:35,440
aura of the thing and self-awareness

1478
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:38,880
is uh in simple you know the

1479
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:42,079
i think uh contiguous at least

1480
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,480
with ideas about feedback so

1481
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,280
if you have a system that looks at its

1482
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,679
own state

1483
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,480
and responds to it that's a kind of

1484
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:50,480
self-awareness

1485
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:55,119
and more sophisticated versions could be

1486
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,279
like

1487
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,039
in information processing things

1488
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,119
computers that look into their own

1489
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:07,119
internal state and do something about it

1490
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:09,039
and i think that could also be

1491
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,798
done in neural nets this is called

1492
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:12,880
recurrent neural nets which are hard to

1493
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:16,639
understand and kind of a frontier of

1494
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,240
the the uh uh so i think understanding

1495
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:22,159
those

1496
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:25,679
and gradually building up a kind of

1497
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:29,199
uh profound

1498
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:31,199
ability to un to uh

1499
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,118
conceptualize different levels of

1500
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:34,480
self-awareness what do you have to not

1501
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,400
know and what do you have to know

1502
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,679
and when do you know that you don't know

1503
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,760
it or when do you know what do you think

1504
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:44,000
you know that you don't really know

1505
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:46,559
the the these uh i think uh

1506
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,719
clarifying those issues when we clarify

1507
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,839
those issues and get a rich theory

1508
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:54,959
around uh self-awareness i think

1509
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:56,798
the that will illuminate

1510
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,199
the questions about consciousness in a

1511
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:02,318
way that you know scratching your chin

1512
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:03,039
and talking about qualia and blah blah

1513
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,440
blah blah

1514
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,119
is never going to do well i also have a

1515
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,200
different approach to the whole thing so

1516
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,798
there's from a robotics perspective you

1517
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:13,279
can engineer

1518
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:16,000
things that exhibit yes qualities of

1519
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:19,760
consciousness without understanding

1520
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,599
well well the how things work

1521
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:26,240
and from that perspective you uh

1522
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,920
it's like a back door like enter through

1523
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:30,798
the psychology door

1524
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,159
precisely the car yeah i think we're on

1525
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:33,199
we're on the same wavelength here i

1526
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,318
think that

1527
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:40,078
and let me just add one comment which is

1528
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:43,199
uh i think we should try to understand

1529
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:46,880
consciousness as we experience it

1530
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:50,480
uh in in as

1531
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:53,599
in evolutionary terms and ask ourselves

1532
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,318
why why does it happen this thing seems

1533
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,920
useful

1534
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:57,920
why is it useful why is it useful

1535
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,358
i think we've got a conscious eye watch

1536
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:07,519
here interesting quest thank you siri

1537
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:10,639
okay yeah

1538
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:14,639
get back i'll get back to you later uh

1539
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:17,440
yeah uh um and i think what we're gonna

1540
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,719
i'm i'm morally certain that what's

1541
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,960
going to emerge from

1542
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:25,199
analyzing recurrent neural nets and

1543
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,318
robotic design and advanced computer

1544
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,679
design

1545
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:33,838
is that having this kind of

1546
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:36,960
looking at the internal state

1547
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:38,639
in a structured way that

1548
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,039
that doesn't look at everything as guys

1549
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:42,879
has it's encapsulated looks at highly

1550
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:43,679
processed information and very selective

1551
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,358
and makes

1552
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:46,399
choices without knowing how they're made

1553
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:47,199
there's so there'll also be an

1554
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,599
unconscious

1555
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:50,719
i think that that is going to be turn

1556
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:53,200
out to be

1557
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:55,358
really essential to doing efficient

1558
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:59,199
information processing

1559
00:58:55,358 --> 00:59:02,400
and that's why it evolved

1560
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:06,879
because it's it's it's it's helpful

1561
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,798
in uh because brains come at a high cost

1562
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,240
yeah so there has to be there has to be

1563
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:14,079
a good why and there's a reason

1564
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:16,959
yeah they're rare in evolution uh

1565
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,318
you and uh big brains are rare in

1566
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,559
evolution and they

1567
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:21,838
they come at a big cost you mean if you

1568
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,880
you they

1569
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:28,159
they they have high metabolic

1570
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,838
demands uh they require

1571
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,639
you know very active lifestyle warm

1572
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:36,159
bloodedness

1573
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:38,318
and take away from the

1574
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:41,118
ability to support metabolism of

1575
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:43,039
digestion and so so it's it's uh

1576
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,160
it comes at a high cost it has to it has

1577
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,079
to pay back

1578
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,440
yeah i think it has a lot of value in

1579
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:48,880
social interaction so i

1580
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,720
actually i'm spending the rest of the

1581
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,920
day today and uh

1582
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:56,719
with uh our friends uh

1583
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,119
that are our legged friends in robotic

1584
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:02,318
form at boston dynamics

1585
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:04,079
and i think so

1586
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:05,679
my probably biggest passion is human

1587
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:08,798
robot interaction

1588
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:11,838
and it seems that consciousness from the

1589
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:14,239
perspective of the robot is very useful

1590
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:16,480
to improve the human robot interaction

1591
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:18,399
experience

1592
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,079
the first the display of consciousness

1593
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,920
but then to me there's a gray area

1594
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,519
between the display of consciousness and

1595
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,119
consciousness itself

1596
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,798
if you think of consciousness from an

1597
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,559
evolutionary perspective

1598
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:30,239
it seems like a useful tool in human

1599
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,319
communication so yes

1600
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:33,358
um it's certainly well whatever

1601
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,318
consciousness it

1602
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:37,279
will turn out to be i think uh

1603
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:40,960
addressing it

1604
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,559
through its use yes and working up from

1605
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,599
simple cases and also

1606
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:48,640
working up from engineering experience

1607
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,838
in trying to do efficient computation

1608
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:51,920
including

1609
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:53,358
efficient management of social

1610
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,358
interactions

1611
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:57,838
is going to really shed light on these

1612
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:59,920
questions as i said in a way that

1613
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:01,440
sort of musing abstractly about

1614
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,358
consciousness never would

1615
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,798
so as i mentioned i talked to sarah

1616
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:06,318
walker and

1617
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:08,838
first of all she says hi spoke very

1618
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:10,000
highly of you one of her concerns about

1619
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:13,679
physics

1620
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,798
and physicists and humans is that

1621
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:20,399
we may not fully understand the system

1622
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:23,358
that we're inside of meaning

1623
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,318
like there may be limits to the kind of

1624
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:26,798
physics we do

1625
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:27,759
in trying to understand the system of

1626
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:31,519
which we're

1627
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:35,359
part of so like the the observer

1628
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:39,519
is also the observed in in that sense

1629
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:42,558
it seems like the the um

1630
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:44,159
our tools of understanding the world

1631
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,920
i mean this is mostly centered around

1632
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,759
the questions of what is life

1633
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,559
trying to understand the patterns that

1634
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,319
uh that are characteristic of life and

1635
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,960
intelligence all those kinds of things

1636
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:55,679
um we we're not we're not using the

1637
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,000
right tools

1638
01:01:55,679 --> 01:02:00,399
because we're in the system is there is

1639
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,798
there something that resonates with you

1640
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:08,480
there almost well yeah yes we do have we

1641
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:10,798
we have limitations of course uh

1642
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,159
in the amount of information we can

1643
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:14,798
process

1644
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:16,879
uh on the other hand we can get help

1645
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:20,559
from our silicon friends

1646
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:22,480
and we uh we can get help from all kinds

1647
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,960
of instruments that make up for for our

1648
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:29,280
perceptual deficits

1649
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:31,119
and uh we have to and we can use

1650
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,359
at a conceptual level we can use

1651
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:36,000
different kinds of concepts to address

1652
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,679
different kinds of questions so i'm not

1653
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,559
sure exactly

1654
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:42,719
what problem she's talking about it's a

1655
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,440
problem akin to

1656
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:46,480
an organism living on a in a 2g plane

1657
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,318
trying to understand

1658
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,559
a three-dimensional world well we can do

1659
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:52,558
that i mean you know we

1660
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:54,559
in fact we you know for practical

1661
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,480
purposes most of our experience

1662
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,359
is two-dimensional it's hard to move

1663
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,199
vertically and yet we've produced

1664
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,558
conceptually a three-dimensional

1665
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:06,078
symmetry and in fact

1666
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:08,960
four-dimensional space-time uh so

1667
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:09,280
you know by thinking in appropriate ways

1668
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,159
and

1669
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:14,720
using instruments and demand and getting

1670
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:18,719
consistent accounts and rich accounts

1671
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:22,399
we find out what concepts are uh

1672
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:25,199
uh uh necessary and

1673
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,838
uh i don't see any end in sight of the

1674
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:30,399
process

1675
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:30,400
or any uh show stoppers because

1676
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,240
let me give you an example i mean for

1677
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,240
instance uh

1678
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:37,838
uh qcd our theory of the strong

1679
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:39,038
interaction has

1680
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:41,199
nice equations which i helped to

1681
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:43,520
discover what's qcd

1682
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:44,399
quantum chromodynamics so it's our

1683
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:47,759
theory

1684
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:50,318
of the strong interaction the

1685
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,400
interaction that is responsible for

1686
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:54,239
nuclear physics so it's the interaction

1687
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,519
that governs how quarks and gluons

1688
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:57,519
interact with each other and make

1689
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,200
make protons and neutrons and all the

1690
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:04,720
strong the

1691
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:06,078
related particles and among many things

1692
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:08,399
in physics it's one of the

1693
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,079
four basic forces of nature as we

1694
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,519
presently understand it

1695
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:15,920
uh and

1696
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:17,119
uh so we have beautiful equations which

1697
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:21,039
we can

1698
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:24,880
test in very special circumstances

1699
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:26,720
uh uh using at high high energies at

1700
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,318
accelerator so we're

1701
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:30,480
certain that these equations are correct

1702
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:32,079
you know prizes are given for it and so

1703
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,000
people try to knock it down and they

1704
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:38,000
can't and yeah they they the

1705
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:42,239
they uh uh but

1706
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,079
uh but the situations in which you can

1707
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,159
calculate the consequences of these

1708
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,760
equations are very limited

1709
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:52,798
so for instance no one has been

1710
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:56,480
able to demonstrate that

1711
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:59,358
this theory which is built on

1712
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,039
quarks and gluons which no one that

1713
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:03,199
which you don't observe

1714
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:04,720
actually produces protons and neutrons

1715
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:07,519
and the things you do observe this is

1716
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:10,000
called the problem of confinement

1717
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:12,159
so no one's been able to prove that

1718
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,358
analytically in a way that a human can

1719
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,598
understand

1720
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:16,480
on the other hand we can take these

1721
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,280
equations

1722
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,318
to a computer to gigantic computers and

1723
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,000
compute

1724
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:27,199
and by god you get the world

1725
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:31,039
from it the so these equations

1726
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:33,919
in a way that we don't

1727
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,799
understand in terms of human concepts we

1728
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,358
cut we

1729
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:38,880
we can't do the calculations but our

1730
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:42,078
machines can do them

1731
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,160
so with the help of what i like to call

1732
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:46,798
our silicon friends and

1733
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:47,679
their their descendants in the future we

1734
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:50,798
can

1735
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:52,879
understand in a different way that

1736
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:55,838
allows us to understand more

1737
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,920
but i don't think we'll ever no no human

1738
01:05:55,838 --> 01:06:01,440
is ever going to be able to calculus

1739
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:04,798
solve those equations in the same way so

1740
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:07,280
so but but i think that's you know when

1741
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:10,639
we find limitations to

1742
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,960
our natural abilities we can

1743
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:15,038
try to find works or workarounds and

1744
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,199
sometimes that's appropriate concepts

1745
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:19,680
sometimes it's appropriate instruments

1746
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,879
sometimes it's a combination of the two

1747
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:24,879
but i think

1748
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,798
uh it's premature to

1749
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,480
get defeatist about it i don't see

1750
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:31,519
anything i don't see any

1751
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:34,960
uh any logical

1752
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:37,679
contradiction or paradox or limitation

1753
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,079
that that will bring this process to a

1754
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:40,399
halt

1755
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,160
well i think the idea is to continue

1756
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,680
thinking outside the box in different

1757
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:45,838
directions meaning

1758
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:47,199
just like how the math allows us to

1759
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:50,078
think of multiple dimensions

1760
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:51,279
outside of our perception system uh sort

1761
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:55,039
of

1762
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:56,960
thinking uh um you know coming up with

1763
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,280
new tools of mathematics or computation

1764
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,400
or

1765
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:03,280
all those kinds of things to to

1766
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,079
to to take different perspectives on our

1767
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,319
universe

1768
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:08,160
well i'm all for that you know and i i

1769
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:10,558
kind of have even elevated it into a

1770
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,318
principle which is of complementarity

1771
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:16,480
following boar that you need different

1772
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:19,199
ways of thinking

1773
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,599
even about the same things in order to

1774
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:23,759
do justice to their reality and answer

1775
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:26,880
different kinds of questions about them

1776
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,680
i mean we've several times alluded to

1777
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,720
the fact that

1778
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:32,239
human beings are hard to understand and

1779
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:34,639
the concepts that

1780
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:35,838
you use to understand human beings if

1781
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:38,719
you want to

1782
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:39,920
prescribe drugs for them or see what's

1783
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:43,118
going to happen if

1784
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,519
if they move very fast or get ex

1785
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,280
or are exposed to radiation and so that

1786
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:47,838
requires one kind of thinking that's

1787
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,119
very

1788
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:53,838
physical uh based

1789
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,280
based on the fact that the materials

1790
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:56,719
that we're made out of

1791
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,720
on the other hand if you want to

1792
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:02,719
understand how a person's going to

1793
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:02,719
behave in a different kind of situation

1794
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,280
you need entirely different concepts

1795
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:08,559
from psychology and

1796
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,640
there's nothing wrong with that you can

1797
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,559
have different ways of addressing

1798
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:14,719
the same material that are useful for

1799
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,319
different purposes right

1800
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,559
can you describe this idea which is

1801
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,480
fascinating of complementarity a little

1802
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:24,640
bit sort of uh

1803
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:26,559
first of all what uh

1804
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,920
state is the principle what is it and

1805
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,600
second of all

1806
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,440
what are good examples starting from

1807
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,480
quantum mechanics you used to mention

1808
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,079
psychology

1809
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,198
let's talk about this more it's like one

1810
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:37,759
in your new book one of the most

1811
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:39,759
fascinating ideas actually

1812
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,439
i think it's a wonderful yeah it's it's

1813
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:43,279
sort of to me it's it's well it's the

1814
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:44,238
culminating chapter of the book and i

1815
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:47,679
think

1816
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:50,798
uh since the whole book is about the big

1817
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,640
lessons or big takeaways

1818
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:54,319
from profound understanding of the

1819
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,199
physical world that we've understood

1820
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,960
that we've achieved uh including that

1821
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,238
it's mysterious in some ways

1822
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:06,000
the uh this was the the

1823
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:11,039
the final overarching

1824
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,039
uh lesson complementarity and uh

1825
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:17,920
it's a

1826
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:19,439
approach it's so unlike some of these

1827
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,480
other things which are just facts about

1828
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,399
the world

1829
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,678
like the world is both big and small and

1830
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:26,000
different sessions is this

1831
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,838
and is is big but we're not small think

1832
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,759
the things we talked about earlier

1833
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:31,439
uh and the fact that the universe is

1834
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,439
comprehensible and how

1835
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,519
complexity could emerge from simplicity

1836
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:38,158
and those things are

1837
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,600
uh in some in the broad sense facts

1838
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:41,519
about the world

1839
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,120
complementarity is more an attitude

1840
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,239
towards the world

1841
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:49,838
encouraged by the facts about the world

1842
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:49,838
and uh it's

1843
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,079
the idea the concept of the approach

1844
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,120
that

1845
01:09:54,079 --> 01:10:00,479
or the realization that uh

1846
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:03,760
it can be appropriate and useful

1847
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:07,599
and inevitable and unavoidable to use

1848
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:10,560
very different descriptions of the same

1849
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,719
object or the same system or the same

1850
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,520
situation

1851
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:16,480
to answer different kinds of questions

1852
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:20,480
that

1853
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:24,079
may be very different and even

1854
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:27,119
uh mutually uninterpretable immutably

1855
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:29,279
uh incomprehensible

1856
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:30,319
uh but both correct somehow but both

1857
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:32,559
correct and

1858
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:33,920
sources of different kinds of insight

1859
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,679
which is so weird

1860
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,000
yeah well but it seems to work in so

1861
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:38,319
many cases it works in many cases and i

1862
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,158
think

1863
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:44,559
it's uh it's a deep fact about

1864
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:45,359
the world and how we should approach it

1865
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,480
its

1866
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:51,439
most rigorous form

1867
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:53,439
where it's actually a theorem if quantum

1868
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:56,960
mechanics is correct

1869
01:10:53,439 --> 01:11:00,719
occurs in quantum mechanics where

1870
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:03,679
the primary description of the world

1871
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:04,960
is in terms of wave functions but let's

1872
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,679
not talk about the world let's just talk

1873
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,960
about a

1874
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:11,359
a particle an electron okay it's it's

1875
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,560
it's the primary description of that

1876
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:15,439
electron

1877
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:17,840
is its wave function and the wave

1878
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:21,119
function can be used to

1879
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:23,119
predict where it's going to be

1880
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:24,399
with different if you observe with it'll

1881
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:25,599
be in different places with different

1882
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:28,799
probabilities

1883
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:31,520
or how fast it's moving and it will also

1884
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,119
be moving in different ways with

1885
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,120
different probabilities that's what

1886
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,920
quantum mechanics says

1887
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:39,279
and you can predict either set of

1888
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,600
probabilities if you

1889
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:42,880
what's going to happen if i make an

1890
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:47,280
observation

1891
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:50,079
of the position or the velocity

1892
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:51,519
but so the wave function gives you ways

1893
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:54,319
of doing both of those

1894
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,080
but to do it to get those predictions

1895
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:57,119
you have to process the wave function in

1896
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:59,119
different ways

1897
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:00,479
you process it one way for position and

1898
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:02,479
in a different way for

1899
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:05,359
momentum and those ways are

1900
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:07,919
mathematically incompatible

1901
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:09,439
it's like you know it's like you have a

1902
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,319
stone and you can sculpt it

1903
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:14,319
into a venus de milo or you can sculpt

1904
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:17,920
it into david but you can't do both

1905
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:20,238
you can uh and uh

1906
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,840
and that's an example of complementarity

1907
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:24,399
but to answer different kinds of

1908
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,840
questions you have to analyze the system

1909
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:29,119
in different ways

1910
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:31,600
that are mutually incompatible

1911
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:32,640
but both valid to answer different kinds

1912
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,199
of questions

1913
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,320
so in that case it's a theorem but i

1914
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:38,719
think

1915
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:40,559
it's a much more widespread phenomena

1916
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,319
that applies to many cases where we

1917
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:46,080
can't prove it as a theorem

1918
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:48,158
but uh it's a piece of wisdom if you

1919
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,079
like and then

1920
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:53,920
appears to be a a very important insight

1921
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:56,079
do you uh and if you ignore it you can

1922
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:59,679
get very

1923
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,679
confused and uh

1924
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:08,000
misguided do you think this is um

1925
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:10,719
a useful hack for

1926
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,679
ideas that we don't fully understand or

1927
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,800
is this

1928
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:18,079
somehow a fundamental property of all

1929
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:20,000
or many ideas that you can take

1930
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:23,600
multiple perspectives and they're both

1931
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,600
true well i think it's both

1932
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:27,279
those both the answer to all questions

1933
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,960
yes that's right

1934
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:31,279
it's not either or it's both it's

1935
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,198
paralyzing to think that

1936
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:34,960
that we live in a world that's

1937
01:13:33,198 --> 01:13:37,198
fundamentally

1938
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,119
like surrounded by complementary ideas

1939
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:42,158
like

1940
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:44,158
uh because it uh we want universe we

1941
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:45,599
somehow want to attach ourselves to

1942
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:47,839
absolute truths

1943
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,800
and absolute truths certainly don't like

1944
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,360
the idea of

1945
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,039
complementarity yes einstein was very

1946
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:56,000
uncomfortable with complementarity

1947
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:58,960
and in a broad sense the famous poor

1948
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,960
einstein debates

1949
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:04,479
revolves around this question of whether

1950
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:07,600
the complementarity that

1951
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:09,678
is a foundational feature of quantum

1952
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:13,120
mechanics as we have it

1953
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:16,480
was is uh

1954
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:18,960
a permanent feature of of the universe

1955
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:23,039
and that's our description of nature

1956
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:26,319
and so far quantum mechanics wins

1957
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:26,880
and it's gone from triumph to triumph

1958
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:28,880
whether

1959
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,920
complementarity is rock bottom i guess

1960
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:33,039
we're you know

1961
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,800
you can never be sure i mean but but uh

1962
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:36,079
it looks awfully good and it's been very

1963
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,640
successful and

1964
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:39,679
certainly its complementarity has been

1965
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,600
extremely

1966
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:46,960
useful and fruitful in in that domain

1967
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,840
uh including you know one of some of

1968
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,198
einstein's

1969
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:54,560
attempts to challenge it with

1970
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:56,158
like the famous einstein podolsky rosen

1971
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,239
experiment turned out to be

1972
01:14:56,158 --> 01:15:01,519
confirmations of

1973
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:03,759
that that uh have have been

1974
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,840
uh useful in themselves but so thinking

1975
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,480
about these things was fruitful but

1976
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:11,840
not in the way that einstein hoped the

1977
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:11,839
the uh

1978
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:24,719
yeah so so as i said in in the case

1979
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:27,039
of uh quantum mechanics and this

1980
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:29,119
dilemma or dichotomy between processing

1981
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:30,399
the wave function in different ways

1982
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:32,000
it's a theorem they're mutually

1983
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:34,000
incompatible and that the physical

1984
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,238
correlate of that is the heisenberg

1985
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,439
certainty principle that you can't have

1986
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:41,279
position and momentum

1987
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:41,279
determined at once uh

1988
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:47,360
but uh in other cases like

1989
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:48,799
one that i like to talk like to think

1990
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:51,119
about is or like to

1991
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,880
point out as an example is is free will

1992
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:55,920
and determinism

1993
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:59,760
it's much less

1994
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:04,319
of a theorem and more more a uh

1995
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,320
more a a kind of uh

1996
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,079
way of thinking about things that i

1997
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:11,839
think is

1998
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:15,039
uh reassuring and

1999
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,960
avoids a lot of unnecessary quarreling

2000
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:17,359
and confusion the quarreling i'm okay

2001
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,119
with

2002
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:21,439
and the confusion i'm okay with i mean

2003
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:23,519
people debate about difficult ideas

2004
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:25,198
but the the question is whether it could

2005
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,280
be almost

2006
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:28,238
a fundamental truth i think it is a

2007
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:31,439
fundamental truth

2008
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:35,039
free will is both an illusion

2009
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:37,599
and not yes i think that's correct and i

2010
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:39,119
loaded the reason why people say quantum

2011
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,159
mechanics is weird

2012
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:44,158
and complementarity is is is a big part

2013
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:46,719
of that

2014
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:48,559
you know to say that the our actual

2015
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,600
whole world is weird

2016
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,400
the whole hierarchy of the universe is

2017
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,640
weird in this

2018
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:59,279
kind of particular way and

2019
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,840
it's it's quite profound but it's also

2020
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:04,238
um

2021
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:06,159
humbling because it's like

2022
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,919
we're we're never going to be on sturdy

2023
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:10,399
ground in the way that humans

2024
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,760
like to be it's like you have to embrace

2025
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:15,759
that uh

2026
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:18,400
well this this this whole thing is is uh

2027
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,280
like unsteady mess it's one of it's one

2028
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:23,039
of many

2029
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:26,319
lessons in humility that that we

2030
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:26,880
uh run into in profound understanding of

2031
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:30,158
the world

2032
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,560
i mean uh the copernican revolution was

2033
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:33,279
one

2034
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,560
that's that the earth is not the center

2035
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:37,198
of the universe

2036
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,760
uh darwinian evolution is another that

2037
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:40,799
uh

2038
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:44,000
humans are not the pinnacle of uh

2039
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:47,279
of uh you know of of

2040
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,479
god's creation uh the the uh

2041
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:53,920
uh and the

2042
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:56,879
uh apparent result

2043
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:58,480
of uh uh deep understanding of physical

2044
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,719
reality that

2045
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:01,919
the mind emerges from matter and human

2046
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:05,439
there's you know

2047
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:09,199
there's there's no uh no call

2048
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:12,479
on special life forces or souls uh

2049
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:16,000
these are all lessons in humility and

2050
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:19,119
i actually find complementarity

2051
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,920
a uh a liberating concept

2052
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:24,158
it's it's a okay you know yeah it is in

2053
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,158
a way

2054
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:30,799
uh that is what i remember there's a

2055
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:33,039
there's a story about dr johnson

2056
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,239
and he's talking with boswell and

2057
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:36,399
boswell

2058
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:38,718
was they were discussing a sermon that

2059
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:40,960
they both both heard and the

2060
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:42,000
the sort of culmination of of the sermon

2061
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,158
was

2062
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,359
the the the speaker saying i accept the

2063
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:48,639
universe

2064
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:50,639
and dr johnson said well he damn well

2065
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:53,520
better

2066
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,600
and and there's a certain uh there's a

2067
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,679
certain joy in accepting the universe

2068
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:01,360
because it's mind expanding

2069
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,359
and uh

2070
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:10,079
you know it and to me complementarity

2071
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:13,199
also suggests tolerance

2072
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:15,760
suggests opportunities for understanding

2073
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:19,279
different different understanding things

2074
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:19,280
in different ways that add

2075
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:26,800
add to rather than detract from

2076
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:27,198
uh understanding so uh i think it's it's

2077
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,920
an up

2078
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:30,479
it's an opportunity for mind expansion

2079
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,199
and

2080
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:34,959
demanding that there's only one way to

2081
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:37,359
think about things

2082
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,600
can be very limiting and the free will

2083
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:42,559
one that's a trippy one though i think

2084
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,360
to think like i am the decider of my own

2085
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,920
actions

2086
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:51,119
and at the same time i'm not is uh

2087
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:53,039
is tricky to think about but it's there

2088
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,760
does seem to be some kind of profound

2089
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:57,119
truth in that

2090
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,560
i get well i think it is tied up it will

2091
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:00,238
turn out to be tied up when we

2092
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,960
understand things better

2093
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:03,599
with these issues of self-awareness and

2094
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,760
i think so

2095
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,600
and where we get what what we perceive

2096
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,480
as making choices what does that really

2097
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:12,000
mean and

2098
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:14,319
what's going on under the hood and

2099
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,238
but i'm i'm speculating about a future

2100
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:18,238
understanding that's not in place

2101
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:19,839
at present your sense there will always

2102
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:22,319
be uh

2103
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,600
like as you dig into the self-awareness

2104
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:25,519
thing there'll always

2105
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,520
be some places where complementarity is

2106
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,560
going to show up oh definitely

2107
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:32,239
yeah i mean it will be uh

2108
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,600
how should i say there'll be kind of a

2109
01:20:32,238 --> 01:20:37,279
god's eye view

2110
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:40,159
which sees everything that's going on

2111
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:42,158
in the computer or the the brain and

2112
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:44,960
then there's the brain's own view

2113
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:46,158
or the or the central processor or

2114
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,359
whatever it is that's the

2115
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:50,638
what we call the the the the self the

2116
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:52,559
consciousness

2117
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:54,560
that's all only aware of a very small

2118
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:58,080
part of it and those are very different

2119
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:59,600
those are the the so uh the god's eye

2120
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:04,719
view can be deterministic

2121
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:08,159
while the the the the self view

2122
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:10,000
sees free will and that's i i'm pretty

2123
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:14,000
sure that's how it's going to work out

2124
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,319
actually and but as it as it stands free

2125
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,520
will

2126
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:19,359
is a concept that we definitely at least

2127
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,440
i feel i definitely experience i can

2128
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:23,198
choose to do one thing than another

2129
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:25,198
and other people i think are

2130
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:29,839
sufficiently similar to me that i

2131
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:29,839
i trust that they feel the same way

2132
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:34,238
and it's an essential concept in

2133
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:38,880
psychology and law

2134
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:40,718
and so forth but uh

2135
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,400
at the same time i think that mind

2136
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:46,000
emerges from matter

2137
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:49,279
and that there's an alternative

2138
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,960
description of matter that's you know up

2139
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:53,279
to subtleties about quantum mechanics

2140
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:56,480
which i don't think are relevant here

2141
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:57,840
uh really is deterministic let me ask

2142
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:01,039
you about some particles

2143
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,840
okay first the absurd question almost

2144
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:05,039
like a question that like plato would

2145
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,800
ask

2146
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:08,719
what is the smallest thing in the

2147
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:12,159
universe

2148
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:14,158
as far as we know the the

2149
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:15,359
fundamental particles out of which we

2150
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:17,439
build

2151
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:18,639
our most successful description of

2152
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:21,839
nature

2153
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,400
are points they have zero they have

2154
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,679
don't have

2155
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:30,158
any internal structure that's

2156
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:33,119
they uh so that's as small as can be

2157
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:34,638
to uh so what does that mean

2158
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:38,079
operationally that means

2159
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:39,920
if you that they obey equations that

2160
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:43,479
describe

2161
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:46,719
entities that are singular

2162
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:48,399
concentrations of energy momentum

2163
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:51,760
angular momentum the things that

2164
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:55,759
particles have but localized at

2165
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:58,960
individual points now uh that

2166
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:01,280
mathematical structure is

2167
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,719
only revealed partially in the world

2168
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:04,960
because to

2169
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,158
to process the wave function in a way

2170
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,198
that that that

2171
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:10,960
accesses information about the precise

2172
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:11,919
position of things you have to apply a

2173
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,079
lot of energy

2174
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,840
and that's not you know we that's an

2175
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:17,679
idealization that you can apply infinite

2176
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,600
amount of energy to determine a

2177
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:22,639
precise position but at the mathematical

2178
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,199
level

2179
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:26,400
uh we build the world out of particles

2180
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:28,079
that are points

2181
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:29,920
so do they actually exist and what are

2182
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:32,880
we talking about so like oh they exist

2183
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,800
so let me ask sort of uh do quarks exist

2184
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:37,199
yes

2185
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,840
two electrons exist yes two photons

2186
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:39,599
exist yes

2187
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,880
but what does it mean for them to exist

2188
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:44,000
okay so well

2189
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,639
the hard answer to that the precise

2190
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,880
answer

2191
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:51,840
is that uh we construct the world

2192
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,039
out of equations that contain entities

2193
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:58,560
that

2194
01:23:53,039 --> 01:24:01,760
uh are reproducible that exist in

2195
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:05,199
vast numbers throughout the universe

2196
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:08,159
that have definite properties of

2197
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:08,158
mass spin

2198
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:11,919
and a few others that

2199
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:16,079
we call electrons and the what what an

2200
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,480
electron is is defined

2201
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:19,840
by the equations that it satisfies

2202
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:23,119
theoretically

2203
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:27,039
and we find that there are many many

2204
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:30,079
exemplars of that of that entity

2205
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:32,000
in in the physical world so intellect in

2206
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:34,639
the case of electrons we can

2207
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,560
you know isolate them and study them in

2208
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:38,960
individual ones in great detail

2209
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:40,080
and we can check that they all actually

2210
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:43,359
are

2211
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:46,719
identical and

2212
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:48,719
that's why chemistry works and yes so so

2213
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:51,760
so that in that case uh it's very

2214
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:54,079
tangible similarly with photons you can

2215
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,520
study them individually they're the

2216
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:59,760
units of light

2217
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:01,520
uh and uh nowadays it's very practical

2218
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,800
to study individual photons and

2219
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,880
determine their

2220
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,079
uh their spin and their other basic

2221
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,600
properties and

2222
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:10,960
uh uh and check out the equations in

2223
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,840
great detail

2224
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,399
for quarks and gluons which are the

2225
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,159
other

2226
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:21,839
two main ingredients of uh

2227
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:23,439
our model of matter that's so successful

2228
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,560
uh it's a little more complicated

2229
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:29,759
because the quarks and gluons

2230
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:32,080
that appear in our equations don't

2231
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,360
appear directly as particles you can

2232
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:38,559
isolate

2233
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:38,559
and study individually they always occur

2234
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:43,760
within bound to what are called bound

2235
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:47,198
states or structures like protons

2236
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:49,679
a proton roughly speaking is composed of

2237
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:51,519
three quarks and a lot of gluons but

2238
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:54,319
we can detect them in a remarkably

2239
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:57,440
direct way actually nowadays

2240
01:25:54,319 --> 01:26:00,719
whereas at relatively low energies

2241
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:03,919
uh the behavior of quarks is complicated

2242
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:06,840
at high energies they can prop they can

2243
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:08,000
propagate through space relatively

2244
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:11,600
freely

2245
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,079
for a while and we can see their tracks

2246
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,840
so ultimately they get recaptured into

2247
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:18,960
protons and other

2248
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,600
mesons and funny things but for a short

2249
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,679
time

2250
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:24,079
they propagate freely and while that

2251
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:26,039
happens we can

2252
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:27,600
take snapshots and see see their

2253
01:26:26,039 --> 01:26:30,719
manifestations

2254
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,239
uh this is the actually this kind of

2255
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,960
thing is exactly what i got the nobel

2256
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:35,198
prize for

2257
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,960
predicting that this would work and

2258
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:40,399
similarly for gluons although

2259
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:42,158
you can't uh you can't isolate them as

2260
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:43,839
individual particles and study them in

2261
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:48,000
the same way we study electrons

2262
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:51,119
say uh you can

2263
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,960
use them to as use them theoretically as

2264
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:56,559
entities out of which you

2265
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:59,520
build tangible description tangible

2266
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:00,320
things that we actually do observe uh

2267
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,280
but also

2268
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:05,279
you can uh at accelerators at high

2269
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:08,960
energy you can liberate them for brief

2270
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:11,279
periods of time and study wow

2271
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,158
and and get convincing evidence that

2272
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:14,238
they

2273
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:15,839
they they leave tracks and then you can

2274
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:16,638
get convincing evidence that they were

2275
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,480
there and

2276
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:20,159
and have the properties that that we

2277
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:22,319
wanted them to have can we talk about

2278
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:23,839
asymptotic freedom this very idea that

2279
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:26,960
you won the nobel prize for

2280
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:30,319
yeah so it describes a

2281
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:33,279
very weird effect to me uh

2282
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:33,679
the the weird in the following way so

2283
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:38,079
the

2284
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:40,560
the the you know the way i think of most

2285
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:41,760
forces or interactions the closer you

2286
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,719
are

2287
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,840
the stronger the effect the the stronger

2288
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:49,520
the force yeah

2289
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:52,480
right with with quarks uh

2290
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:53,920
the closer they are the the less so the

2291
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:57,839
strong interaction

2292
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:59,840
and in fact they basically act like free

2293
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,079
particles when they're

2294
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:04,400
very close that's right yes well but

2295
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:08,319
this requires a huge amount of energy

2296
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:11,599
like can you describe me um

2297
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:14,799
why how does this even work

2298
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:18,239
how weird it is proper description

2299
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:19,920
must bring in uh quantum mechanics and

2300
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:24,559
relativity and

2301
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:26,480
it's uh so a proper description

2302
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,080
and equations so a proper description

2303
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:30,799
really is is probably

2304
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:32,079
uh more more more than we have time for

2305
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,079
and then

2306
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:35,760
uh we require quite a bit of patience on

2307
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:37,840
your part but uh

2308
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,039
how does relativity come into play wait

2309
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,560
wait

2310
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:47,279
relativity is important because

2311
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,280
when when we talk about

2312
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,679
trying to think about short distances we

2313
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,840
have to think about

2314
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:58,079
very large momenta and very large moment

2315
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:00,239
are connected to very large energy

2316
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:01,359
in relativity and so the connection

2317
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:03,439
between

2318
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:05,759
how things behave at short distances and

2319
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:08,399
how things behave at high energy

2320
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,840
uh really is connected through

2321
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:12,879
relativity in

2322
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:16,000
sort of a slightly backhanded way

2323
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:19,440
quantum mechanics indicates that short

2324
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:22,800
to get to analyze short distances

2325
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:26,319
uh you need to bring in probes

2326
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:29,039
that carry a lot of momentum

2327
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:30,000
this again is related to uncertainty

2328
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:31,679
because

2329
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,439
uh it's the fact that you have to bring

2330
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:36,359
in a lot of momentum

2331
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:38,158
that interferes with the possibility of

2332
01:29:36,359 --> 01:29:40,079
determining

2333
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:41,839
position and momentum at the same time

2334
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:43,600
if you want to determine position

2335
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,039
you have to use instruments that bring

2336
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,920
in a lot of momentum

2337
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,840
and because of that those same

2338
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:53,199
instruments can't also measure momentum

2339
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,199
because they're disturbing the momentum

2340
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,719
and then the momentum brings in energy

2341
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:58,319
and yeah so

2342
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:00,880
so that there's also the effect that

2343
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:05,439
asymptotic freedom comes from

2344
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:10,400
uh the possibility of spontaneously

2345
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:12,479
making uh quarks and gluons

2346
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:14,479
for short amounts of time that that

2347
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:15,678
fluctuate into existence and out of

2348
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,799
existence

2349
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:22,319
uh and uh the

2350
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:23,679
fact that that can be done with a very

2351
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:26,000
little amount of energy

2352
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:27,920
and and uncertainty and energy

2353
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,079
translates into uncertainty in time so

2354
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,279
if you do that for a short time you can

2355
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:33,920
do that uh

2356
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:34,639
well it's all it comes in a package and

2357
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,279
you can

2358
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:39,359
you can so uh i told you it would take a

2359
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:42,559
while to really uh to really explain

2360
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:44,319
but the uh but but

2361
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,840
the results can be understood i mean we

2362
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:50,479
can state the results

2363
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:53,760
uh pretty simply i think so uh

2364
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:56,638
in everyday life we do encounter some

2365
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,280
forces that increase with distance and

2366
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:59,600
kind of

2367
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:01,519
turn off at short distances that's the

2368
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,039
way rubber bands work if you think about

2369
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:05,840
it or

2370
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:06,560
you if you pull them hard they they

2371
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,600
resist and

2372
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:10,719
but but they get flabby if if if the

2373
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,480
rubber band is not

2374
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:17,439
not pulled uh and so there are

2375
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:19,439
that can happen uh in the physical world

2376
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:21,279
but what's what's really difficult is to

2377
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:23,039
see how that could be a fundamental

2378
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:24,319
force that's consistent with everything

2379
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:28,158
else we know

2380
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:30,399
and that that's what asymptotic freedom

2381
01:31:28,158 --> 01:31:32,238
is it says that uh

2382
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:33,920
there are particular there's a very

2383
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:36,799
particular kind of

2384
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,639
fundamental force that involves special

2385
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,320
particles called gluons with very

2386
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:44,639
special properties

2387
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:46,559
that uh enables that kind of behavior so

2388
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:48,239
ex there were experiments at the time we

2389
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,120
did our work there were experimental

2390
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:52,479
indications

2391
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:55,279
that quarks and gluons

2392
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:56,959
did have this kind of property but uh

2393
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:58,158
there were no equations that were

2394
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:01,198
capable of

2395
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:03,039
capturing it and we found the equations

2396
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:04,559
and showed how they work and showed how

2397
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:07,359
they that they were

2398
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:08,880
basically unique and this led to a

2399
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:10,799
complete theory of how the strong

2400
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:13,039
interaction works which is

2401
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,560
the quantum chromodynamics uh we

2402
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:18,079
mentioned earlier

2403
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:20,560
and so uh

2404
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:21,439
so that's the phenomenon that that

2405
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,560
quarks

2406
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:26,399
and gluons interact very very weakly

2407
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:29,199
when they're close together

2408
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,158
that's connected through relativity with

2409
01:32:29,198 --> 01:32:32,879
the fact that they

2410
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:33,839
also interact very very weakly at high

2411
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:37,600
energies

2412
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:39,440
so if you have so at high energies

2413
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,760
the simplicity of the fundamental

2414
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:44,158
interaction gets revealed

2415
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,480
you know at the time we did our work the

2416
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:48,960
clues were very subtle

2417
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:51,039
but nowadays at hot at what are now high

2418
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,960
energy accelerators it's all obvious

2419
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:54,399
so we would have had a much well

2420
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,359
somebody would have had a much easier

2421
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:57,599
time

2422
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:59,839
20 years later looking at the data you

2423
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,520
can sort of see the quarks and gluons

2424
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,600
as i mentioned they leave these short

2425
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,880
tracks that uh it would have been much

2426
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:08,560
much easier but but

2427
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:10,159
we from fundamental from indirect clues

2428
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:13,120
we were able to piece together enough

2429
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:14,559
to make that behavior a prediction

2430
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:16,719
rather than a

2431
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,840
post-diction right so it becomes obvious

2432
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,920
at high energies

2433
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,440
it becomes very obvious when when we

2434
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,079
first did this work

2435
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:24,719
it was uh frontiers of high energy

2436
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:27,600
physics

2437
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:29,439
and at big international conferences

2438
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:32,719
there would always be sessions on

2439
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:34,399
testing qcd and whether these

2440
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:36,319
whether this proposed description of the

2441
01:33:34,399 --> 01:33:37,519
strong interaction was in fact correct

2442
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:39,679
and so forth

2443
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:40,960
and it was very exciting they were big

2444
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:44,719
but

2445
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:47,840
nowadays the same kind of work

2446
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:49,920
but much more precise with

2447
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,199
calculations to more accuracy and

2448
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,239
experiments that are much

2449
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:57,039
more uh precise

2450
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:58,959
and comparisons that are very precise uh

2451
01:33:57,039 --> 01:33:59,760
now it's called calculating backgrounds

2452
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,319
because

2453
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:04,560
it's because people take this for

2454
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:06,719
granted and one of you and want to

2455
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,239
see deviations from the theory which

2456
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:10,319
would be which would be

2457
01:34:08,238 --> 01:34:11,678
the new discoveries yeah the cutting

2458
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:13,840
edge becomes the foundation of

2459
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:17,119
foundation becomes boring yes

2460
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:19,279
uh uh is is there some

2461
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:21,198
for basic explanation purposes is there

2462
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:24,238
something to be said about

2463
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:24,799
uh strong interactions in the context of

2464
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:27,359
the

2465
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,560
the strong nuclear force for the for the

2466
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:31,198
attraction between

2467
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,239
protons yeah well the neutrons versus

2468
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:34,559
the

2469
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:35,279
the interaction between quarks within

2470
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:39,039
protons

2471
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:40,800
well quarks and gluons have the same

2472
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:44,880
relation

2473
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:48,079
basically to nuclear physics as

2474
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,679
electrons and photons have to atomic and

2475
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:54,399
molecular physics

2476
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:57,359
so atoms and photons

2477
01:34:54,399 --> 01:35:00,079
are the dynamic entities that really

2478
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:02,079
come into play in chemistry and

2479
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:04,000
atomic physics of course you have to add

2480
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:07,359
the atomic nuclei but those are

2481
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,238
small and relatively inert really the

2482
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:11,359
dynamical

2483
01:35:08,238 --> 01:35:12,559
part and you know for for most purposes

2484
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:14,719
of chemistry you just say

2485
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,679
you have this tiny little nucleus which

2486
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:17,920
this which

2487
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:19,520
qcd gives you don't worry about it it

2488
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,199
just it's there

2489
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,280
the real the real action is the

2490
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:24,158
electrons moving around and exchanging

2491
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:27,599
and things like that

2492
01:35:24,158 --> 01:35:28,000
uh the uh but okay but we wanted to

2493
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,679
understand

2494
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,719
the nucleus too and uh

2495
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:36,800
so atoms base are sort of quantum

2496
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,880
mechanical clouds of electrons

2497
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,800
held together by electrical forces which

2498
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,679
is photons and then this radiation which

2499
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,520
is also

2500
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:45,199
another aspect of photons that's where

2501
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,840
all the fun happens is the electrons and

2502
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:47,599
the photons

2503
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,199
yeah that's right and the nuclei the

2504
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:52,480
nucleus are kind of the

2505
01:35:49,198 --> 01:35:53,759
the uh well they're necessary they give

2506
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:56,879
the positive charge

2507
01:35:53,760 --> 01:36:00,079
and most of the mass of matter

2508
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:01,760
but they don't since

2509
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:03,760
since they're so heavy they don't move

2510
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:07,280
very much in chemistry

2511
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:08,639
and uh uh i'm oversimplifying

2512
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:11,840
drastically they're not contributing

2513
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:11,840
much of the interaction and

2514
01:36:12,079 --> 01:36:16,079
for most purposes in chemistry you can

2515
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:18,000
just idealize them as concentrations of

2516
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:21,439
positive mass and charge that

2517
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,000
that are uh you don't have to look

2518
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:23,599
inside

2519
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,198
but people are curious what what's

2520
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:28,400
inside what really

2521
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:30,479
and and uh that and that was a big thing

2522
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:31,599
on the agenda of 20th century physics

2523
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:34,399
starting in the

2524
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:35,119
19 well starting with the 20th century

2525
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:37,439
and

2526
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:38,158
unfolding throughout of trying to

2527
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:41,039
understand

2528
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:43,198
what forces held the atomic nucleus

2529
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:46,479
together what it was and so

2530
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:49,279
uh anyway the

2531
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:50,638
the emerge the story that emerges from

2532
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:54,639
qcd

2533
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:56,960
is that very similar to the way

2534
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:58,239
that well broadly similar to the way

2535
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:01,118
that uh

2536
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:02,718
uh clouds of electrons held together by

2537
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:06,238
electrical forces

2538
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:10,319
uh give you atoms and ultimately

2539
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:13,678
molecules uh protons

2540
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:17,279
and neutrons are like atoms

2541
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:19,118
made now out of quarks quark clouds held

2542
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:21,198
together by gluons which are

2543
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:23,359
like like like the photons that that

2544
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:25,039
will give the electric forces

2545
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:26,399
but this is giving a different force the

2546
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:30,079
strong force

2547
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:34,719
and uh and the residual forces between

2548
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:37,439
protons and neutrons that uh

2549
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:39,520
are left over from their basic binding

2550
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:41,839
are like the residual forces between

2551
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:43,440
atoms that give molecules but

2552
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,279
in the case of protons and neutrons it

2553
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:48,238
gives you atomic nuclei

2554
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:48,960
so again for definitional purposes uh

2555
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:51,678
qcd

2556
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,319
quantum chromodynamics is basically the

2557
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:55,039
physics

2558
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:56,479
of strong interaction yeah we understand

2559
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:58,560
we now would unders which

2560
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:00,799
i think most physicists would would say

2561
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:04,080
it's the theory of

2562
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:07,279
quarks and gluons and how they interact

2563
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,639
but it's a very precise and i think it's

2564
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:11,920
fair to say very beautiful

2565
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:12,719
theory based on mathematical symmetry of

2566
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,000
a high

2567
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:17,279
order uh and another thing that's

2568
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,800
beautiful about it is

2569
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:20,800
that it's kind of

2570
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:29,359
in the same family as electrodynamics

2571
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:31,599
the conceptual structure of this of the

2572
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:32,479
equations are very similar they're based

2573
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:35,440
on having

2574
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:37,039
particles that respond to charge in a

2575
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:39,759
very symmetric way

2576
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:41,920
in the case of electrodynamics it's

2577
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:43,039
photons that respond to electric charge

2578
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,880
in the case of

2579
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:47,439
quantum chromodynamics there are three

2580
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:49,359
kinds of charge that we call colors

2581
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:50,879
but they're nothing like colors they

2582
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:51,679
really are like different kinds of

2583
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,319
charge

2584
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:56,480
but they rhyme with the same kind of uh

2585
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:59,039
like it's similar kind of dynamics

2586
01:38:56,479 --> 01:39:00,718
similar kind of dynamics i call i say i

2587
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:03,760
like to say that qcd is like

2588
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:06,319
qed on steroids and instead of one

2589
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:09,039
photon you have eight gluons instead of

2590
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:13,039
one charge you have three color charges

2591
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:16,479
but there's a strong family resemblance

2592
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:17,439
but the context in which uh qcd does its

2593
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:19,759
thing is it's

2594
01:39:17,439 --> 01:39:20,719
it's much higher energies like that's

2595
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:24,239
where it comes to wealth

2596
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:27,279
it's a stronger force so that to

2597
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:29,279
access how it's works and kind of pry

2598
01:39:27,279 --> 01:39:30,238
things apart you have to inject more

2599
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:33,840
energy

2600
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:37,439
and so that that gives us um

2601
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:40,079
in some sense a hint of uh how things

2602
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:41,039
were in the earlier universe yeah well

2603
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:43,118
in that regard

2604
01:39:41,039 --> 01:39:45,519
asymptotic freedom is a tremendous

2605
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:48,319
blessing because it means

2606
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:50,000
things get simpler at high energy and

2607
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:52,639
the universe was born free

2608
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,238
born free that's very very good yes

2609
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:56,880
chris was born so

2610
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:59,359
so in atomic physics i mean a similar

2611
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:02,480
thing happens in the theory of stars

2612
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:04,799
stars are hot enough that uh the

2613
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:06,319
interactions between electrons and

2614
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,600
photons are

2615
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:09,519
they're they're liberated they don't

2616
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,960
form atoms anymore they make a plasma

2617
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,159
which in some ways is simpler to

2618
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:14,880
understand

2619
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:18,079
you don't have complicated chemistry and

2620
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:20,639
in the early universe according to qcd

2621
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:21,679
similarly atomic nuclei dissolved into

2622
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,279
the constituent

2623
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:24,880
quarks and gluons which are moving

2624
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:26,880
around very fast and

2625
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:28,239
interacting in relatively simple ways

2626
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,560
and so this

2627
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:32,079
uh this opened up the early universe to

2628
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:34,320
scientific

2629
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:36,399
calculation can i ask you about some

2630
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:37,840
other weird particles that make up our

2631
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:41,118
universe

2632
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:42,560
what are axions and what is the strong

2633
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:46,399
cp problem

2634
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:48,320
okay so uh let me start with what the

2635
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:52,079
strong cp problem is

2636
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:55,359
uh first of all well charge con

2637
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:58,559
c is charge conjugation which is the

2638
01:40:55,359 --> 01:41:00,319
transformation uh the notional

2639
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:03,280
transformation if you like that changes

2640
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:07,840
all particles into their anti-particles

2641
01:41:03,279 --> 01:41:10,880
and the concept of seek

2642
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:13,119
symmetry charge conjugation symmetry is

2643
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:16,639
that if you do that

2644
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:19,839
you find the same laws would work

2645
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:22,000
so the laws are symmetric if

2646
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,279
the behavior that particles exhibit is

2647
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
the same as the part

2648
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:27,439
as the behavior you get with all their

2649
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,279
anti-particles

2650
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:34,000
uh then p is parity

2651
01:41:31,279 --> 01:41:35,198
which is uh also called spatial

2652
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,520
inversion

2653
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:38,960
it's basically looking at a mirror

2654
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:41,760
universe

2655
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:44,079
and saying that the laws that are obeyed

2656
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,639
in a mirror universe when you look

2657
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:47,760
the the mirror images obey the same laws

2658
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:50,400
as the

2659
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,840
as the sources of their images there's

2660
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:53,679
no way of telling left

2661
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,920
right for instance that the laws don't

2662
01:41:53,679 --> 01:42:00,239
distinguish between left and right

2663
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:02,480
uh now in the mid 20th century

2664
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:04,000
people discovered that both of those are

2665
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:07,599
not quite true

2666
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,719
that really the the equation that the

2667
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:12,719
mirror universe

2668
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:16,560
this the universe that's that you see

2669
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:19,679
in a mirror is not

2670
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,000
going to obey the same laws as the as

2671
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,880
the

2672
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,279
the universe that that that we actually

2673
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,079
exhib

2674
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:27,359
uh and interpret you could you would be

2675
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:29,039
able to tell if you

2676
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:30,960
did the right kind of experiments which

2677
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:31,760
was the mirror and which was the real

2678
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:35,520
thing

2679
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:36,639
uh anyway that that's the parody and

2680
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,159
they show that

2681
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:39,760
doesn't necessarily hold it doesn't

2682
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:43,118
quite hold and that that oh

2683
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:45,520
that and examining uh

2684
01:42:43,118 --> 01:42:47,759
what the exceptions are turned out to be

2685
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:49,679
to lead to all kinds of insight about

2686
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:51,600
the nature of fundamental interactions

2687
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:53,600
especially properties of neutrinos and

2688
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,920
the weak interaction it's a long story

2689
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,800
but it's a very it's a so you just

2690
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,800
define the c

2691
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,159
and the p the conjugation the charge

2692
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,800
conjugation now that i've done that i

2693
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:02,799
want to

2694
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,840
what's the problem shove them off okay

2695
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:06,480
great

2696
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,880
because it's easier to talk about t

2697
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:12,158
which is time reversal symmetry

2698
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:15,520
we have very good reasons to think uh

2699
01:43:12,158 --> 01:43:17,920
cpt is a an accurate

2700
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:19,679
symmetry of nature it's on the same

2701
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,279
level as relativity and quantum

2702
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:24,399
mechanics basically so

2703
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:26,399
that better be true uh so it's

2704
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:27,920
symmetric when you when you do

2705
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:31,198
conjugation parity in time

2706
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:32,239
and time and space reversal if you do

2707
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:34,000
all three

2708
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:36,000
then you get the same physical

2709
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,639
consequences now

2710
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,600
so but that means that cp is equivalent

2711
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:41,760
to t

2712
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:44,719
but but what's observed in the world is

2713
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,520
that t is not quite an accurate symmetry

2714
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:48,960
of nature

2715
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:52,159
either so most phenomena

2716
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,920
uh of at the fundamental level

2717
01:43:52,158 --> 01:43:55,759
so interactions among elementary

2718
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:59,199
particles and the basic

2719
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:03,280
gravitational interaction uh

2720
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:06,319
if you ran them backwards in time

2721
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:09,519
you'd get the same laws so if

2722
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,719
ag again going unless this time we don't

2723
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,199
talk about a

2724
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:14,639
a mirror but we talk about a movie if

2725
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:18,638
you take a movie

2726
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:21,600
and then run it backwards

2727
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:22,560
that's the time reversal uh it's good to

2728
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,119
think about a mirror

2729
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,679
in time yeah it's like a mirror in time

2730
01:44:25,118 --> 01:44:28,960
if you

2731
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:30,880
uh if you run run the movie backwards

2732
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:33,520
it would look very strange if you were

2733
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:36,000
looking at complicated objects and

2734
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,960
uh you know a charlie chaplin movie or

2735
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,399
whatever

2736
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,239
they it would look very strange if you

2737
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:43,599
ran it backwards in time

2738
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:44,319
but at the level of basic interactions

2739
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:46,560
if you

2740
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:48,399
were able to look at the atoms and the

2741
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,639
and the quarks involved

2742
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:53,198
they would obey the same laws they do a

2743
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:54,880
very good approximation but not exactly

2744
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:56,799
so you this is not exactly that means

2745
01:44:54,880 --> 01:45:00,719
you could tell you could tell

2746
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:03,039
but you'd have to do very very subtle

2747
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:04,480
experiments with at high energy

2748
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:06,560
accelerators

2749
01:45:04,479 --> 01:45:08,559
to take a movie that looked different

2750
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:12,560
when you ran it backwards

2751
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:15,280
this was a discovery by uh

2752
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:16,000
two great physicists named cronin and

2753
01:45:15,279 --> 01:45:19,039
jim cronin

2754
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:21,600
and val fitch in the uh

2755
01:45:19,039 --> 01:45:23,118
in the mid-1960s previous to that over

2756
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,119
all the centuries of development of

2757
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:28,839
physics with all this precise laws

2758
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:30,000
they did seem to have this gratuitous

2759
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,920
property

2760
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,198
that they look the same if you run the

2761
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,880
equations backwards

2762
01:45:33,198 --> 01:45:36,960
it's kind of an embarrassing property

2763
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:39,279
actually because

2764
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:41,760
life isn't like that so empirical

2765
01:45:39,279 --> 01:45:44,719
reality does not have this imagery

2766
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:46,239
in any obvious way and yet the laws did

2767
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,639
it's almost like the laws of physics are

2768
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:51,279
missing something fundamental about life

2769
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:52,239
if if if it holds that property right

2770
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:54,319
well i mean that's

2771
01:45:52,238 --> 01:45:57,678
that's the embarrassing nature it's it's

2772
01:45:54,319 --> 01:46:01,039
yeah it's well people

2773
01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:04,079
worked hard and at what's

2774
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:06,399
this was a problem that's thought to

2775
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:08,158
belong to the foundations of statistical

2776
01:46:06,399 --> 01:46:10,839
mechanics or the

2777
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:12,079
foundations of thermodynamics to

2778
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:15,440
understand

2779
01:46:12,079 --> 01:46:18,639
how behavior which is

2780
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:20,319
grossly not symmetric

2781
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:22,400
with respect to reversing the direction

2782
01:46:20,319 --> 01:46:24,559
of time in large objects

2783
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:25,519
how that can emerge from equations which

2784
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:28,400
are

2785
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:29,840
symmetric with respect to changing the

2786
01:46:28,399 --> 01:46:30,960
direction of time to a very good

2787
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,560
approximation

2788
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,239
and that's that's still an interesting

2789
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,639
endeavor that's that's

2790
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:38,638
that's interesting and uh actually it's

2791
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:40,079
an exciting frontier of physics now to

2792
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:41,840
sort of explore the boundary

2793
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:44,079
between when that's true and when it's

2794
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:46,800
not true when you get to smaller objects

2795
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:47,439
uh and exceptions like time crystals or

2796
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,960
uh

2797
01:46:47,439 --> 01:46:50,638
i definitely have to ask if i'll time

2798
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:54,319
crystals in a second here but

2799
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:56,480
so the cp problem and t so there's

2800
01:46:54,319 --> 01:46:58,158
lost all of these we're in danger of

2801
01:46:56,479 --> 01:47:00,879
infinite regress but we'll

2802
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:01,920
convert soon so can't possibly be

2803
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:03,359
turtles all the way down

2804
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:06,239
we're going to get to the bottom turtle

2805
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:09,279
so so so it became

2806
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:11,039
so it it got to be a real i mean it's a

2807
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:14,238
really puzzling thing

2808
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:16,639
uh why the laws should have this very

2809
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:18,399
odd property that we don't need

2810
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,840
and in fact it's kind of an

2811
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:22,960
embarrassment

2812
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:24,000
in addressing empirical reality but it

2813
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,840
seemed to be

2814
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,920
almost it seemed to be exactly true for

2815
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:30,960
a long time and then

2816
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:33,920
uh almost true and

2817
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:36,480
and in way almost true was even is more

2818
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:38,239
disturbing than exactly true because

2819
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:39,919
exactly true it could have been just a

2820
01:47:38,238 --> 01:47:41,519
fundamental feature of the world and you

2821
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,960
know at some level you just have to take

2822
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:46,639
it as it is and if it's

2823
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:48,560
if it's a beautiful easily articulatable

2824
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:49,679
regularity you could say that okay

2825
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:51,679
that's a that's

2826
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:53,440
fine as a fundamental law of nature but

2827
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:55,359
to say that it's approximately true but

2828
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:58,638
not exactly that's that's that's right

2829
01:47:55,359 --> 01:48:01,759
that's weird so uh and then

2830
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:05,679
so there was great progress in

2831
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:09,360
uh the late part of the 20th century

2832
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:11,520
uh in getting to an understanding of

2833
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:14,719
fundamental interactions in general

2834
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:18,000
that shed light on this issue uh

2835
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:20,960
it turns out that the prince

2836
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,359
basic principles of relativity and

2837
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:26,560
quantum mechanics plus

2838
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:26,880
the kind of high degree of symmetry that

2839
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:29,600
we

2840
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:31,199
found the so-called gage symmetry that

2841
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,560
characterizes the fundamental

2842
01:48:31,198 --> 01:48:33,678
interactions when you put all that

2843
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:37,440
together

2844
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:42,239
it's a very very constraining framework

2845
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:42,238
and it has some indirect consequences

2846
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:47,118
because the possible interactions are so

2847
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,560
constrained and one of the indirect

2848
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:52,238
consequences

2849
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:55,280
is that the possibilities for

2850
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:57,759
violating the symmetry between forwards

2851
01:48:55,279 --> 01:49:00,880
and backwards in time are very limited

2852
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:04,000
there are basically only two

2853
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:05,840
and one of them occurs and leads to a

2854
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:08,000
very rich theory that explains the

2855
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,520
cronin fish experiment and a lot of

2856
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,719
things that have been done subsequently

2857
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:13,520
has been used to

2858
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:14,000
make all kinds of successful predictions

2859
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:17,440
so that's

2860
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,439
that's turned out to be a very rich

2861
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,520
interaction it's esoteric and the

2862
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,199
effects are

2863
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,800
only show up at accelerators and are

2864
01:49:23,198 --> 01:49:26,960
small and so on but they might have been

2865
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:28,960
very important in the early universe and

2866
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,279
lead to them be connected to the

2867
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,359
asymmetry between matter and anti-matter

2868
01:49:31,279 --> 01:49:36,158
in the present universe and so but

2869
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:39,839
that's a that's another digression

2870
01:49:36,158 --> 01:49:40,960
the the point is that uh that was fine

2871
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,840
that was a triumph

2872
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:46,158
to say that there was one possible kind

2873
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:47,760
of interaction that would violate

2874
01:49:46,158 --> 01:49:49,279
time reversal symmetry and sure enough

2875
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:52,320
there it is and

2876
01:49:49,279 --> 01:49:52,319
but the other kind

2877
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:56,000
doesn't occur so we still got a problem

2878
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:59,359
why

2879
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,279
doesn't it occur uh so but

2880
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:03,118
we're so we're close to really finally

2881
01:50:01,279 --> 01:50:04,559
understanding this profound gratuitous

2882
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:07,598
feature of the world

2883
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:09,679
that is almost but not quite

2884
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:12,159
symmetric under reversing the direction

2885
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:16,560
of time but but not quite there

2886
01:50:12,158 --> 01:50:21,118
and to get to understand that last

2887
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:22,719
bit is a challenging frontier of physics

2888
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:25,759
today

2889
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:27,359
and we have a promising proposal for how

2890
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:31,199
it works

2891
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:34,319
which is a kind of theory of evolution

2892
01:50:31,198 --> 01:50:37,359
so there's this possible

2893
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:38,960
interaction which we call a coupling and

2894
01:50:37,359 --> 01:50:42,158
there's a numerical quantity

2895
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:44,000
that tells us how strong that is and

2896
01:50:42,158 --> 01:50:45,519
traditionally in physics we think of

2897
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,560
these kinds of numerical

2898
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:52,639
quantities as constants of nature

2899
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:55,520
that you just have to put them in

2900
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:57,279
right from experiment uh they have a

2901
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:58,880
certain value and that that's it and you

2902
01:50:57,279 --> 01:51:01,840
know

2903
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,560
who am i to question what god do they

2904
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:06,000
just can't

2905
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:10,239
well they seem to be just constantly uh

2906
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:13,359
but in this case

2907
01:51:10,238 --> 01:51:16,479
it's been fruitful to think

2908
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:20,699
and work out a theory where

2909
01:51:16,479 --> 01:51:22,158
that strength of interaction

2910
01:51:20,699 --> 01:51:25,439
[Music]

2911
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:29,519
is actually not a constant it's a

2912
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:31,359
fun it's a field it's a uh it's a

2913
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,639
fields are the fundamental ingredients

2914
01:51:31,359 --> 01:51:34,158
of modern physics like

2915
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:35,920
there's an electron field there's a

2916
01:51:34,158 --> 01:51:37,519
photon field which is also called the

2917
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,199
electromagnetic field and so

2918
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:41,599
every all of these particles are

2919
01:51:39,198 --> 01:51:45,198
manifestations of different fields

2920
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:47,520
and uh there could be a field

2921
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:49,919
something that depends on space and time

2922
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:53,040
so a dynamical entity

2923
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:56,719
instead of just a constant here

2924
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:59,198
and if you do things in a nice

2925
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:00,319
way that's very symmetric very much

2926
01:51:59,198 --> 01:52:03,439
suggested

2927
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:05,198
aesthetically by the theory uh but but

2928
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:09,118
the theory we do have

2929
01:52:05,198 --> 01:52:12,559
then you find that you get

2930
01:52:09,118 --> 01:52:17,198
a field which

2931
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:22,159
as it evolves from the early universe

2932
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:25,439
settles down to a value

2933
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:28,839
that's just right

2934
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:32,158
to make the laws very nearly

2935
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:33,679
exact invariant or symmetric with

2936
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:35,198
respect to reversal of time it might

2937
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:37,039
appear as a constant but it's actually a

2938
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:37,839
field that evolved over time it evolved

2939
01:52:37,039 --> 01:52:40,880
over time

2940
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:44,719
okay but when you examine this proposal

2941
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:47,760
in detail you find that it hasn't quite

2942
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:48,560
settled down to exactly zero there it's

2943
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,960
still

2944
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,920
the the field is still moving around a

2945
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:55,679
little bit

2946
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:58,880
and because the motion is so

2947
01:52:55,679 --> 01:53:00,960
uh the motion is so difficult

2948
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:02,480
the the material is so rigid and this

2949
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:03,840
material that fills all the field that

2950
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:06,079
fills those spaces so rich

2951
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:08,079
even small amounts of motion can involve

2952
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:13,359
lots of energy

2953
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:15,840
and that and that energy takes the form

2954
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:17,759
of uh particles fields of fields that

2955
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:18,400
are in motion are always associated with

2956
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:21,280
particles

2957
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:22,638
and those are the axions and if you

2958
01:53:21,279 --> 01:53:26,559
calculate how much

2959
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:29,599
energy is in these residual oscillations

2960
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:31,360
these this axion gas that fills all the

2961
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:32,159
universe if this fundamental theory is

2962
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:36,319
correct

2963
01:53:32,158 --> 01:53:38,399
you get just the right amount

2964
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:40,158
to make the dark matter that astronomers

2965
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:42,559
want and it has

2966
01:53:40,158 --> 01:53:44,158
just the right properties so i'd love to

2967
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:47,520
believe that

2968
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:49,519
so that might be a thing that unlocks uh

2969
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:51,360
might be the key to understanding dark

2970
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:52,960
matter yeah i'd like to think so

2971
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:56,238
and many many physicists are coming

2972
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:58,319
around to this point of view which

2973
01:53:56,238 --> 01:53:59,759
i've been a voice in the wilderness i

2974
01:53:58,319 --> 01:54:02,238
was a voice in the wilderness

2975
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:04,480
for a long time but now now it's become

2976
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:07,678
very popular maybe even dominant

2977
01:54:04,479 --> 01:54:11,598
so almost like so this axion

2978
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:12,880
particle slash field would be the thing

2979
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:14,800
that explains

2980
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,719
dark matter it explained yeah would

2981
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:20,480
solve this fundamental question

2982
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:23,920
of finally of why the laws are

2983
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:25,598
almost but not quite exactly

2984
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:27,840
the same if you run them backwards in

2985
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:30,239
time and and then

2986
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:32,639
seemingly in a totally different

2987
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:35,519
conceptual universe

2988
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:37,840
it would also uh provide unders give us

2989
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:40,400
an understanding of of the dark matter

2990
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:42,560
that's not what it was

2991
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:45,039
designed for and the theory wasn't

2992
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:46,800
wasn't proposed with that in mind

2993
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:48,560
but when you work out the equations

2994
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,960
that's what you get that's always a good

2995
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:52,239
sign

2996
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:52,880
yeah actually uh i i think i vaguely

2997
01:54:52,238 --> 01:54:55,118
read

2998
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:56,960
uh somewhere that there may be early

2999
01:54:55,118 --> 01:55:00,479
experimental validation

3000
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:03,520
of uh uh of axion is that uh

3001
01:55:00,479 --> 01:55:05,678
am i am i reading the wrong well there

3002
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:07,199
have been quite a few false alarms and i

3003
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:09,359
think there are some of them still

3004
01:55:07,198 --> 01:55:11,198
i mean people desperately want to find

3005
01:55:09,359 --> 01:55:13,839
this thing and

3006
01:55:11,198 --> 01:55:15,919
uh but i don't think i i i don't think

3007
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:19,279
any of them are convincing at this point

3008
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:22,880
but there are very ambitious

3009
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:24,719
experiments and kind of new

3010
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,800
you have to design new kinds of antennas

3011
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:28,880
that are capable of detecting

3012
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,800
these predicted particles and it's it's

3013
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,679
very difficult they interact very very

3014
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,960
weakly if

3015
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:35,520
it were easy it would have been done

3016
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:38,319
already but

3017
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:40,800
but i think there's good hope that we

3018
01:55:38,319 --> 01:55:42,479
can get down to the required sensitivity

3019
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:43,150
and actually test whether these ideas

3020
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:44,638
are right

3021
01:55:43,149 --> 01:55:47,920
[Music]

3022
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:49,599
in coming years or maybe decades

3023
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:52,000
and then understand one of the big

3024
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:52,800
mysteries like literally big in terms of

3025
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,800
uh

3026
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,400
its fraction of the universe is dark

3027
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:57,840
matter yes

3028
01:55:56,399 --> 01:56:00,079
let me ask you about you mentioned a few

3029
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:03,679
times time crystals

3030
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:05,840
yeah um what are they these things are

3031
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:07,199
it's a very beautiful idea when we start

3032
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,400
to um

3033
01:56:07,198 --> 01:56:14,079
treat space and time as

3034
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:15,598
a similar frameworks yes

3035
01:56:14,079 --> 01:56:17,359
right physical phenomena right that's

3036
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:19,360
what motivated it what are

3037
01:56:17,359 --> 01:56:21,519
first of all what are crystals yeah and

3038
01:56:19,359 --> 01:56:24,880
what time crystals okay so

3039
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:29,360
crystals are orderly arrangements of

3040
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:33,199
uh atoms in space and

3041
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:35,679
many materials if you cool them down

3042
01:56:33,198 --> 01:56:35,678
gently

3043
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:43,760
will form crystals and so we say

3044
01:56:40,399 --> 01:56:46,799
that that's uh a spun a state of matter

3045
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:49,280
that forms spontaneously and

3046
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,159
uh an important feature of that state of

3047
01:56:49,279 --> 01:56:54,840
matter

3048
01:56:50,158 --> 01:56:58,238
is that the end result the crystal

3049
01:56:54,840 --> 01:57:01,599
uh has less

3050
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:02,959
symmetry than the equations that give

3051
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:06,719
rise to the crystal

3052
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:09,198
so the equations the basic equations of

3053
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:12,639
physics

3054
01:57:09,198 --> 01:57:15,678
are the same if you uh move a little bit

3055
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:17,520
so you can move they're homogeneous but

3056
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:18,158
crystals aren't the atoms are in

3057
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,480
particular

3058
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:22,399
place so though they have less symmetry

3059
01:57:20,479 --> 01:57:23,919
uh

3060
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:26,479
and time crystals are the same thing in

3061
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:28,319
time basically

3062
01:57:26,479 --> 01:57:30,158
you but of course it's not so it's not

3063
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:34,399
positions of atoms

3064
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:38,079
but it's ordering uh orderly behavior

3065
01:57:34,399 --> 01:57:39,759
uh that certain states of matter uh

3066
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:42,399
will arrange themselves into

3067
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:44,960
spontaneously if you do them

3068
01:57:42,399 --> 01:57:46,638
if you if you treat them gently and let

3069
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,800
them do what they want to do

3070
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:49,920
but indeed repeat in that same way

3071
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:51,920
indefinitely

3072
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:54,000
that's the crystalline form you can also

3073
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:55,840
have uh

3074
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,679
time liquids or you can have all kinds

3075
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,760
of other states of matter you don't have

3076
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:02,880
space-time crystals where

3077
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:05,199
the pattern only repeats if uh with each

3078
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:08,000
step of time you also move at a certain

3079
01:58:05,198 --> 01:58:08,879
a certain direction in space so so yeah

3080
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,719
so but it's so

3081
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:16,079
it's basically it's states of matter

3082
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:17,920
that uh oh base

3083
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:19,198
that display structure in time

3084
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:21,359
spontaneously

3085
01:58:19,198 --> 01:58:23,439
so here's here's the difference when it

3086
01:58:21,359 --> 01:58:26,639
happens in time

3087
01:58:23,439 --> 01:58:28,559
uh it sure looks a lot like

3088
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:30,639
it's motion and if it repeats

3089
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,840
indefinitely it sure looks a lot like

3090
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:36,079
perpetual motion

3091
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:38,079
yeah like uh looks like free lunch

3092
01:58:36,079 --> 01:58:39,118
i was told that there's no such thing as

3093
01:58:38,079 --> 01:58:41,920
free lunch does

3094
01:58:39,118 --> 01:58:42,399
does this violate laws of thermodynamics

3095
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,560
uh

3096
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:46,238
no but it requires a critical

3097
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:48,400
examination of the

3098
01:58:46,238 --> 01:58:50,559
laws of thermodynamics i mean let me let

3099
01:58:48,399 --> 01:58:51,519
me say on background that the laws of

3100
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:54,800
thermodynamics

3101
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:58,320
are not the not fundamental laws of

3102
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:58,320
physics there are things we prove

3103
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,880
under certain circumstances emerge from

3104
01:59:01,118 --> 01:59:05,920
the fundamental laws of physics

3105
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:07,118
right they're not we don't posit them

3106
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:08,560
separately they're

3107
01:59:07,118 --> 01:59:10,639
meant to be deduced and they can be

3108
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:12,000
deduced under limited circumstances but

3109
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:14,079
not necessarily

3110
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,599
universally and we found finding some of

3111
01:59:14,079 --> 01:59:18,559
the subtleties and

3112
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:19,199
sort of accept edge cases uh where they

3113
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:22,400
don't

3114
01:59:19,198 --> 01:59:25,519
apply in a straightforward way

3115
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:28,638
and this is one uh so

3116
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:31,119
time crystals do obey do have this

3117
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:31,840
structure in time but it's not a free

3118
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:34,960
lunch

3119
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:37,760
because although in a sense things are

3120
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:38,960
moving uh they're they're already doing

3121
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:42,159
what they want to do

3122
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:42,719
they're in there so if if you want to

3123
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:44,799
extract

3124
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:45,840
energy from it you're going to be foiled

3125
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:49,520
because there's no

3126
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:52,400
spare energy there you uh

3127
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:53,760
it's or so you you can add energy to it

3128
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:56,799
and kind of disturb it

3129
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:59,679
but but you can't extract energy

3130
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:01,760
from this motion because it's gonna it

3131
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:04,000
wants to do that's the lowest energy

3132
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:04,800
configuration that there is so you can

3133
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,560
you can't get

3134
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:09,760
further energy out of it so in theory i

3135
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:12,000
guess perpetual motion

3136
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:12,960
uh you would be able to extract energy

3137
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,039
from it yeah

3138
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:17,599
if such a thing was to be created you

3139
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:21,118
could then milk it for energy well

3140
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:23,039
what's usually meant in the literature

3141
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:27,759
of perpetual motion

3142
02:00:23,039 --> 02:00:28,479
is a kind of macroscopic motion that you

3143
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:31,760
could extract

3144
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:34,399
energy from and and somehow it would

3145
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:36,000
crank back up right that's that's not

3146
02:00:34,399 --> 02:00:39,359
the case here if you want to extract

3147
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,679
energy uh this motion is

3148
02:00:39,359 --> 02:00:43,039
is not something you can extract energy

3149
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:46,158
from if you

3150
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:48,158
intervene in the behavior you can

3151
02:00:46,158 --> 02:00:50,960
uh change it but only by injecting

3152
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:53,439
energy not not by taking away energy

3153
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:54,079
you mentioned that a theory of

3154
02:00:53,439 --> 02:00:56,399
everything

3155
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:58,319
may be quite difficult to come by a

3156
02:00:56,399 --> 02:00:59,839
theory of everything broadly defined

3157
02:00:58,319 --> 02:01:00,559
meaning like truly a theory of

3158
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,319
everything

3159
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:03,760
but let's look at a more narrow theory

3160
02:01:02,319 --> 02:01:05,920
of everything which is that

3161
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:06,960
what the way it's used in often in

3162
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:10,960
physics

3163
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:14,319
is a a theory that unifies

3164
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:17,840
our current uh

3165
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:21,198
laws of physics general relativity

3166
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:23,599
quantum field theory df thoughts

3167
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:25,198
on this dream of a of a theory of

3168
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:27,440
everything in physics

3169
02:01:25,198 --> 02:01:29,359
how close are we is there any promising

3170
02:01:27,439 --> 02:01:32,479
ideas out there in your view

3171
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:34,639
well it would be nice to have it would

3172
02:01:32,479 --> 02:01:38,399
be aesthetically pleasing

3173
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:42,079
uh will be useful no probably not

3174
02:01:38,399 --> 02:01:42,719
well i'm i shouldn't no it's dangerous

3175
02:01:42,079 --> 02:01:45,920
to say

3176
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:49,920
that but uh probably not i think we

3177
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:51,599
not not in certainly not in the uh

3178
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:54,239
foreseeable future

3179
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:54,800
uh maybe to understand black holes yeah

3180
02:01:54,238 --> 02:01:56,479
but that's

3181
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,199
that's yes maybe to understand black

3182
02:01:56,479 --> 02:02:02,559
holes but

3183
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:05,039
that's not useful and

3184
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:05,840
and well not only i mean only to

3185
02:02:05,039 --> 02:02:08,158
understand

3186
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:09,599
it's it's it's worse of course you know

3187
02:02:08,158 --> 02:02:10,319
it's not useful in the sense that we're

3188
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:12,960
not going to be

3189
02:02:10,319 --> 02:02:14,000
basing any technology any time soon on

3190
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:15,920
black holes

3191
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,520
but it's it's more severe than that i

3192
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:21,679
would say it's that

3193
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:24,560
the kinds of questions about black holes

3194
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:28,158
that we can't answer within the

3195
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:28,159
framework of existing theory

3196
02:02:28,639 --> 02:02:34,719
are ones that are not

3197
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:35,599
going to be susceptible to astronomical

3198
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:37,760
observation

3199
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:38,639
in the foreseeable future they're

3200
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:42,639
questions about

3201
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:46,159
very very small black holes when

3202
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:49,679
when quantum effects come into play or

3203
02:02:46,158 --> 02:02:51,598
uh so that black holes are

3204
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:53,920
you know not not black holes they're

3205
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,760
they're they're they're emitting hawk

3206
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:56,960
this discovery of hawking called hawking

3207
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:59,679
radiation

3208
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:00,158
which for astronomical black holes is a

3209
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:01,920
tiny

3210
02:03:00,158 --> 02:03:03,359
tiny effect that's no one have no one

3211
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,000
has ever observed it's a prediction

3212
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:05,359
that's never

3213
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,279
been changed like supermassive black

3214
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:11,118
holes that doesn't apply no

3215
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:13,599
no the the predicted rate of radiation

3216
02:03:11,118 --> 02:03:15,598
from those black holes is so tiny that

3217
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:17,119
it's absolutely unobservable and is

3218
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:18,159
overwhelmed by all kinds of other

3219
02:03:17,118 --> 02:03:21,359
effects

3220
02:03:18,158 --> 02:03:23,598
uh so uh

3221
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:25,598
so it's not practical in the sense of

3222
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:29,199
technology it's not even practical

3223
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:31,039
in the sense of uh application to

3224
02:03:29,198 --> 02:03:34,079
astronomy

3225
02:03:31,039 --> 02:03:37,679
we our existing theory of

3226
02:03:34,079 --> 02:03:40,399
uh general relativity and quantum theory

3227
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:42,800
and our theory of the the different

3228
02:03:40,399 --> 02:03:43,839
fundamental forces is perfectly adequate

3229
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:48,639
to

3230
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:48,639
all prep all problems of

3231
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:53,118
technology for sure

3232
02:03:53,359 --> 02:04:00,238
and almost all

3233
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:03,759
problems of astrophysics and

3234
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:06,799
cosmology that appear except

3235
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:07,199
with the with the notable exception of

3236
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:09,039
the

3237
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:11,039
extremely early universe if you want to

3238
02:04:09,039 --> 02:04:14,078
ask what happened before the big bang or

3239
02:04:11,039 --> 02:04:15,359
what happened right at the big bang

3240
02:04:14,078 --> 02:04:17,198
which would be a great thing to

3241
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:19,759
understand of course uh

3242
02:04:17,198 --> 02:04:21,039
yes we don't but but what about the

3243
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:24,320
engineering question

3244
02:04:21,039 --> 02:04:26,880
so if we look at space travel so

3245
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:28,559
uh i think you've spoken with him uh

3246
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:33,039
eric weinstein

3247
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:35,039
really um uh you know he says

3248
02:04:33,039 --> 02:04:37,359
things like we want to get off this

3249
02:04:35,039 --> 02:04:40,000
planet his intuition is

3250
02:04:37,359 --> 02:04:40,719
almost a motivator for the engineering

3251
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,520
project

3252
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:44,639
of space exploration in order for us to

3253
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:47,599
crack this problem

3254
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:49,440
of becoming a multi-planetary species we

3255
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:51,520
have to solve the physics problem his

3256
02:04:49,439 --> 02:04:54,238
intuition is like if we figure out this

3257
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:55,840
what he calls the source code which is

3258
02:04:54,238 --> 02:04:58,959
like

3259
02:04:55,840 --> 02:05:00,560
like like like a theory of everything

3260
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:03,439
might give us clues

3261
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:04,159
on how to start hacking the fabric of

3262
02:05:03,439 --> 02:05:06,879
reality

3263
02:05:04,158 --> 02:05:08,719
like getting shortcuts right it might i

3264
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:10,800
can't say that you know

3265
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:12,000
i can't say that it won't but i can say

3266
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:16,400
that

3267
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:19,679
in the 1970s and early 1980s

3268
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:23,759
we achieved

3269
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:26,639
huge steps in understanding matter

3270
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:28,639
qcd much better understanding of the

3271
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:30,078
weak interaction

3272
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:32,400
much under better understanding of

3273
02:05:30,078 --> 02:05:36,078
quantum mechanics in general

3274
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:37,439
and it's had minimal uh minimal impact

3275
02:05:36,078 --> 02:05:39,359
on time on rocket design

3276
02:05:37,439 --> 02:05:41,359
unprecedented on rocket design on

3277
02:05:39,359 --> 02:05:44,238
anything any technology

3278
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:46,238
whatsoever and now we're talking about

3279
02:05:44,238 --> 02:05:48,799
much more esoteric things

3280
02:05:46,238 --> 02:05:50,078
and since i don't know what they are i

3281
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,920
can't say for sure that they won't

3282
02:05:50,078 --> 02:05:52,880
affect technology but i'm very very

3283
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:56,560
skeptical that

3284
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:59,760
they would affect technology the uh uh

3285
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:00,400
the because you know to access them you

3286
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:03,039
need to

3287
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:04,559
very exotic circumstances to make new

3288
02:06:03,039 --> 02:06:06,000
kinds of particles with high energy you

3289
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:07,920
need accelerators that are

3290
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,439
you know it's very expensive and you

3291
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:10,078
don't produce many many of them and so

3292
02:06:09,439 --> 02:06:12,879
forth you know

3293
02:06:10,078 --> 02:06:14,479
it's just uh it's a pipe dream i think

3294
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:16,880
yeah about space exploration

3295
02:06:14,479 --> 02:06:18,000
yes i'm not sure exactly what he has in

3296
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:23,039
mind and

3297
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:23,039
but uh to me uh

3298
02:06:23,118 --> 02:06:26,719
it's more a problem of of

3299
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:31,840
something between biology and

3300
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:41,039
i think human bodies are not well

3301
02:06:40,078 --> 02:06:44,479
adapted

3302
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:45,920
to space even mars

3303
02:06:44,479 --> 02:06:47,839
or even you know which is the closest

3304
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:49,440
thing to a kind of

3305
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:51,199
human environment that we're going to

3306
02:06:49,439 --> 02:06:54,319
find anywhere close by

3307
02:06:51,198 --> 02:06:56,000
uh very very difficult to maintain

3308
02:06:54,319 --> 02:06:59,840
humans on mars

3309
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:00,719
uh and gonna be you know very expensive

3310
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:04,319
and very you know

3311
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:08,158
very unstable and but i think the pros

3312
02:07:04,319 --> 02:07:08,158
however uh if we

3313
02:07:08,238 --> 02:07:16,559
take a broader view of what it means to

3314
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:16,560
bring human civilization

3315
02:07:17,359 --> 02:07:20,880
outside of the earth if we're satisfied

3316
02:07:20,479 --> 02:07:23,279
with

3317
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:24,239
you know sending minds out there that we

3318
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:27,359
can

3319
02:07:24,238 --> 02:07:31,598
converse with and actuators and that

3320
02:07:27,359 --> 02:07:33,839
that we can in uh uh manipulate and

3321
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:35,920
sensors that we can get feedback from i

3322
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:38,319
think that's

3323
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:39,440
that's where it's at and for sure i

3324
02:07:38,319 --> 02:07:42,719
think that's so much

3325
02:07:39,439 --> 02:07:45,118
so much more realistic and uh

3326
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:46,719
and i think that that's the long-term

3327
02:07:45,118 --> 02:07:48,639
future of uh

3328
02:07:46,719 --> 02:07:50,480
the space exploration it's not hauling

3329
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:54,000
human bodies all over the place and

3330
02:07:50,479 --> 02:07:56,559
that's that's that's just silly but

3331
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:58,960
it's possible that it's human bodies um

3332
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:02,239
so like you said it's a biology problem

3333
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:03,439
what's possible is that um we extend

3334
02:08:02,238 --> 02:08:06,718
human lifespan

3335
02:08:03,439 --> 02:08:08,158
in some way just we have to look at a

3336
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:09,359
bigger picture it could be just like

3337
02:08:08,158 --> 02:08:12,559
you're saying

3338
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:16,319
by sending robots with actuators and

3339
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:17,920
kind of extending the the our limbs

3340
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:20,238
but it could also be extending some

3341
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:22,639
aspect of our minds of information

3342
02:08:20,238 --> 02:08:23,678
and it could be cyborgs it could be uh

3343
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:27,520
it could be

3344
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:28,719
no we're talking it could be you know it

3345
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:32,400
could

3346
02:08:28,719 --> 02:08:34,719
it could be uh human brains or

3347
02:08:32,399 --> 02:08:36,399
cells that realize something like human

3348
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:40,480
brain architecture

3349
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:42,719
uh within uh

3350
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:44,319
within artificial environments you know

3351
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:46,319
shells if you like

3352
02:08:44,319 --> 02:08:47,599
that that are more adapted to the

3353
02:08:46,319 --> 02:08:50,880
conditions of space

3354
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:53,199
and uh that yeah so that that's entirely

3355
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:56,800
man machine hybrids

3356
02:08:53,198 --> 02:08:59,118
as well as sort of remote uh

3357
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:00,880
uh outposts that we can communicate with

3358
02:08:59,118 --> 02:09:01,519
i think yeah i think those those will

3359
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:03,920
happen

3360
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:05,040
and uh yeah yeah to me there's some

3361
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:07,199
sense in which

3362
02:09:05,039 --> 02:09:09,519
as opposed to understanding the physics

3363
02:09:07,198 --> 02:09:09,519
of

3364
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:14,880
the the the the fundamental fabric of

3365
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:17,199
the universe

3366
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:19,118
i think getting to the physics of life

3367
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:20,158
the physics of intelligence the physics

3368
02:09:19,118 --> 02:09:23,598
of consciousness

3369
02:09:20,158 --> 02:09:27,759
will the physics of information uh

3370
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:30,078
that that that brings

3371
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:32,079
from which life emerges that will allow

3372
02:09:30,078 --> 02:09:34,319
us to do space exploration

3373
02:09:32,078 --> 02:09:36,799
yeah well i think physics in the larger

3374
02:09:34,319 --> 02:09:39,198
sense has a lot to contribute here

3375
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:40,719
not the physics of finding fundamental

3376
02:09:39,198 --> 02:09:46,479
new laws in the sense of

3377
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:46,480
uh you know another quark or axions even

3378
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:53,440
physics in the sense of you know physics

3379
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:56,639
has a lot of experience

3380
02:09:53,439 --> 02:09:58,158
in analyzing complex situations and

3381
02:09:56,639 --> 02:10:00,000
analyzing new states of matter and

3382
02:09:58,158 --> 02:10:03,279
devising new kinds of instruments

3383
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,439
that do clever things we you know the

3384
02:10:03,279 --> 02:10:06,880
the physics in that sense has enormous

3385
02:10:05,439 --> 02:10:10,000
amounts to contribute

3386
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:13,599
to uh this kind of endeavor

3387
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:16,800
but i don't think that looking for

3388
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:17,360
a so-called theory of any everything has

3389
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:20,079
much

3390
02:10:17,359 --> 02:10:21,198
to do with it at all what advice would

3391
02:10:20,078 --> 02:10:24,559
you give

3392
02:10:21,198 --> 02:10:26,399
to a young person today

3393
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:28,000
with a bit of fire in their eyes high

3394
02:10:26,399 --> 02:10:29,519
school student college student

3395
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,158
thinking about what to do with their

3396
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:35,520
life maybe advice about

3397
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:37,279
career or bigger advice about life in

3398
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:38,880
general

3399
02:10:37,279 --> 02:10:40,399
well first read fundamentals because

3400
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:44,159
there i've tried

3401
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:47,118
i've tried to to uh give some coherent

3402
02:10:44,158 --> 02:10:48,000
uh deep advice that's the fundamentals

3403
02:10:47,118 --> 02:10:50,399
ten keys

3404
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,599
to reality by train cool check so that's

3405
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:54,158
a good place available

3406
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:55,279
everywhere if you want to learn but i

3407
02:10:54,158 --> 02:10:58,479
can tell you

3408
02:10:55,279 --> 02:11:00,078
uh the uh is there an audiobook

3409
02:10:58,479 --> 02:11:01,919
yes there is an audio book that's

3410
02:11:00,078 --> 02:11:03,840
awesome yeah i think

3411
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:05,039
it's like i can give three pieces of

3412
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:08,400
wise advice

3413
02:11:05,039 --> 02:11:13,439
that i think are generally applicable

3414
02:11:08,399 --> 02:11:17,039
one is to cast a wide net

3415
02:11:13,439 --> 02:11:20,158
to really look around and see

3416
02:11:17,039 --> 02:11:21,599
what looks promising what catches your

3417
02:11:20,158 --> 02:11:25,039
imagination

3418
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:27,039
uh and

3419
02:11:25,039 --> 02:11:28,639
and promise yeah and those you have to

3420
02:11:27,039 --> 02:11:30,719
balance those two things you can have

3421
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:32,480
things that catch your imagination but

3422
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:33,920
don't look promising in the sense that

3423
02:11:32,479 --> 02:11:37,759
the questions aren't ripe

3424
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:40,399
or uh but and and things that you

3425
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:41,119
in part of what makes things uh

3426
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:43,198
attractive

3427
02:11:41,118 --> 02:11:44,960
is that whether you thought you liked

3428
02:11:43,198 --> 02:11:46,960
them or not is this if you can see that

3429
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:49,279
there's ferment and new ideas coming up

3430
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:52,158
that become that's attractive in itself

3431
02:11:49,279 --> 02:11:53,519
so uh when i started out i thought i was

3432
02:11:52,158 --> 02:11:55,439
and when i was an undergraduate i

3433
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:57,119
intended to study philosophy or

3434
02:11:55,439 --> 02:11:58,158
questions of how mind emerges from

3435
02:11:57,118 --> 02:12:00,158
matter but

3436
02:11:58,158 --> 02:12:01,920
i thought that wasn't really right

3437
02:12:00,158 --> 02:12:03,679
timing isn't right yeah the ripe was the

3438
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:07,000
timing wasn't right for the kind of

3439
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:09,279
mathematical thinking and

3440
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:11,920
conceptualization that i really enjoy

3441
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:11,920
and good at

3442
02:12:12,319 --> 02:12:17,519
but uh so that that's one thing cast a

3443
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:21,840
wide net look around

3444
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:21,840
uh and that's that's

3445
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:27,840
a pretty easy thing to do today because

3446
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:30,000
because of the internet you can look

3447
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:31,039
you can look at all kinds of things you

3448
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,319
have to be careful though because

3449
02:12:31,039 --> 02:12:35,279
there's a lot of crap

3450
02:12:32,319 --> 02:12:37,279
also but uh you you know you you can

3451
02:12:35,279 --> 02:12:42,319
sort of tell the difference if you

3452
02:12:37,279 --> 02:12:44,639
if you do a little digging uh the the uh

3453
02:12:42,319 --> 02:12:46,319
so don't don't don't settle on just you

3454
02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:48,000
know what your thesis advisor tells you

3455
02:12:46,319 --> 02:12:51,519
to do or what your teacher tells you to

3456
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:53,520
do look for yourself and and and

3457
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:54,560
get a sense of what what what seems

3458
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:56,960
promising

3459
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:59,039
uh not what seemed promising 10 years

3460
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:02,639
ago or

3461
02:12:59,039 --> 02:13:07,198
the uh so that's one

3462
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:07,199
uh another thing is to

3463
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:12,719
is kind of complementary to that well

3464
02:13:10,399 --> 02:13:17,519
they're all complimentary

3465
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:19,920
complementary to that uh is to read

3466
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:22,480
history and read the masters of the

3467
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:26,000
history of ideas and masters of ideas i

3468
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:30,000
benefited enormously from as

3469
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:33,039
as in early in my career from reading

3470
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:36,000
in physics einstein

3471
02:13:33,039 --> 02:13:37,599
in the original and feynman's lectures

3472
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,800
as they were coming out

3473
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:43,440
and darwin you know these

3474
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,079
you can you can learn what it in galileo

3475
02:13:43,439 --> 02:13:46,078
you can learn

3476
02:13:44,078 --> 02:13:48,078
what it is to wrestle with difficult

3477
02:13:46,078 --> 02:13:49,519
ideas and how great minds did that you

3478
02:13:48,078 --> 02:13:53,519
can learn a lot about

3479
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:54,480
uh style how how to ex write your ideas

3480
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:57,520
up and

3481
02:13:54,479 --> 02:14:00,000
express them in in clear ways

3482
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:02,159
and also just just a couple that with uh

3483
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,560
i also enjoy reading biographies

3484
02:14:02,158 --> 02:14:06,399
and biographies yes similarly right like

3485
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:08,079
so it gives you the context

3486
02:14:06,399 --> 02:14:09,439
the context of the human being that

3487
02:14:08,078 --> 02:14:11,279
created those right and

3488
02:14:09,439 --> 02:14:13,279
brings it down to earth in the sense

3489
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:14,719
that you know it was really human beings

3490
02:14:13,279 --> 02:14:18,078
who did this it's not

3491
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:21,118
uh and and they made mistakes and

3492
02:14:18,078 --> 02:14:22,960
yeah uh i also you know i also got

3493
02:14:21,118 --> 02:14:24,158
inspiration from bertrand russell who's

3494
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:27,359
a big hero and h.g

3495
02:14:24,158 --> 02:14:29,039
wells and yeah so uh read read the

3496
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:31,598
masters

3497
02:14:29,039 --> 02:14:32,158
make contact with great minds and when

3498
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:33,679
you are

3499
02:14:32,158 --> 02:14:35,359
sort of narrowing down on a subject

3500
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:36,399
learn about the history of the subject

3501
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:38,559
because

3502
02:14:36,399 --> 02:14:41,839
that really puts in context what you're

3503
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:41,840
trying to do and

3504
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,319
and also gives a sense of community and

3505
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:49,760
grandeur to the whole enterprise

3506
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:52,158
uh and then the third piece of advice is

3507
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:53,119
complementary to both those which is

3508
02:14:52,158 --> 02:14:56,319
sort of

3509
02:14:53,118 --> 02:14:59,198
to uh to get

3510
02:14:56,319 --> 02:15:00,319
the basics under control as soon as

3511
02:14:59,198 --> 02:15:02,960
possible

3512
02:15:00,319 --> 02:15:04,078
so if you want to do theoretical work in

3513
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:07,599
science

3514
02:15:04,078 --> 02:15:09,920
you know you you you have to learn

3515
02:15:07,599 --> 02:15:11,440
calculus multivariable calculus complex

3516
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:13,679
variables group theory

3517
02:15:11,439 --> 02:15:14,719
nowadays you have to be highly computer

3518
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:16,319
literate

3519
02:15:14,719 --> 02:15:17,760
uh if you want to do experimental work

3520
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:19,519
you also have to be computer literate

3521
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:20,159
then you have to learn about electronics

3522
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:22,960
and

3523
02:15:20,158 --> 02:15:23,279
optics and instruments and so so get

3524
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:26,639
that

3525
02:15:23,279 --> 02:15:29,279
under control as soon as possible

3526
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:30,239
because it's like learning a language uh

3527
02:15:29,279 --> 02:15:33,279
to do

3528
02:15:30,238 --> 02:15:36,158
to to produce great works and express

3529
02:15:33,279 --> 02:15:39,359
yourself fluently and with confidence

3530
02:15:36,158 --> 02:15:40,879
uh it should be your native language

3531
02:15:39,359 --> 02:15:42,078
these things should be like your native

3532
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:42,800
language so you're not you're not

3533
02:15:42,078 --> 02:15:46,319
wondering

3534
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:47,119
um what is a derivative this is just

3535
02:15:46,319 --> 02:15:49,759
part of your

3536
02:15:47,118 --> 02:15:51,759
you know part it's it's uh it's in your

3537
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:53,599
bones so to speak you know

3538
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:56,000
and the sooner that you can do that then

3539
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:59,599
the the better so those all those things

3540
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,599
can be done in parallel and should be

3541
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:04,880
you've accomplished some incredible

3542
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:08,719
things in your life but

3543
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:11,760
uh the sad thing about this

3544
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:13,840
thing we have is it ends uh

3545
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:15,119
do you um do you think about your

3546
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:18,880
mortality

3547
02:16:15,118 --> 02:16:21,598
are you afraid of death uh well

3548
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:23,118
well afraid is the wrong way i mean uh

3549
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:23,840
let's define things i wish it weren't

3550
02:16:23,118 --> 02:16:27,198
gonna happen

3551
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:27,920
and i'd like to but uh uh do you think

3552
02:16:27,198 --> 02:16:30,719
about it

3553
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:32,558
i say occasionally i think about well i

3554
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:33,280
think about it very operationally in the

3555
02:16:32,558 --> 02:16:37,039
sense that

3556
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:40,399
uh there's always a trade-off between

3557
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:42,479
exploration and exploitation this is a

3558
02:16:40,398 --> 02:16:44,079
classic subject in computer science

3559
02:16:42,478 --> 02:16:47,519
actually in machine learning

3560
02:16:44,079 --> 02:16:50,638
uh that when you're in an unusual

3561
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:51,280
circumstance you you want to explore to

3562
02:16:50,638 --> 02:16:53,438
see what

3563
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:54,559
what the landscape is and what the

3564
02:16:53,439 --> 02:16:56,800
gathered data

3565
02:16:54,558 --> 02:16:57,599
but then at some point you want to use

3566
02:16:56,799 --> 02:17:00,159
that

3567
02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:01,519
make decide make choices and say this is

3568
02:17:00,159 --> 02:17:03,280
what i'm going to do and exploit the

3569
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:07,120
knowledge you've accumulated

3570
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:09,439
and uh the longer

3571
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:10,319
the period of exploitation you

3572
02:17:09,439 --> 02:17:13,200
anticipate

3573
02:17:10,318 --> 02:17:14,478
the more exploration you should do in

3574
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:17,840
new directions

3575
02:17:14,478 --> 02:17:19,438
and so for me i've had to sort of adjust

3576
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:23,439
the balance of

3577
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:26,479
exploration and uh uh

3578
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:28,079
exploitation and that said you've

3579
02:17:26,478 --> 02:17:30,718
explored quite a lot

3580
02:17:28,079 --> 02:17:33,920
yeah well i i'm still i haven't shut off

3581
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:35,919
the exploitation at all i'm still hoping

3582
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:38,799
the exploration right i'm still hoping

3583
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:40,159
for 10 or 15 years of top flight

3584
02:17:38,799 --> 02:17:43,438
performance but

3585
02:17:40,159 --> 02:17:45,119
the uh

3586
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:47,280
several years ago now when i was 50

3587
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:49,040
years old

3588
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:51,200
i i was at the institute for advanced

3589
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:52,880
study and my office was right under

3590
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:54,639
freeman dyson's office and we were kind

3591
02:17:52,879 --> 02:17:57,598
of friendly and

3592
02:17:54,638 --> 02:17:59,318
uh and you know he found out it was my

3593
02:17:57,599 --> 02:18:02,239
my 50th birthday and said

3594
02:17:59,318 --> 02:18:03,439
congratulations and uh you should feel

3595
02:18:02,239 --> 02:18:06,079
liberated because

3596
02:18:03,439 --> 02:18:07,280
no one expects much of a 50 year old

3597
02:18:06,079 --> 02:18:09,359
theoretical physicist

3598
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:11,200
and he and he obviously had felt

3599
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:13,519
liberated by uh

3600
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:14,800
by by reaching a certain age and yeah

3601
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:18,800
there is something to that

3602
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:20,638
uh i fee you know i feel i don't have to

3603
02:18:18,799 --> 02:18:23,119
catch i don't have to

3604
02:18:20,638 --> 02:18:25,518
keep in touch with the latest

3605
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:27,439
hypertechnical developments in particle

3606
02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:30,800
physics or string theory or so

3607
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:31,359
like uh because i'm not gonna i'm really

3608
02:18:30,799 --> 02:18:34,558
not gonna

3609
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:35,760
be exploiting that i but i but but where

3610
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:38,000
i am exploring

3611
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:39,120
uh in these directions of machine

3612
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,799
learning and

3613
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:42,880
and things like that and and but then

3614
02:18:40,799 --> 02:18:46,239
but i'm also concentrating

3615
02:18:42,879 --> 02:18:48,079
within physics on exploiting directions

3616
02:18:46,239 --> 02:18:49,920
that i've already established and the

3617
02:18:48,079 --> 02:18:54,239
laws that we already have

3618
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:57,679
and doing things like uh

3619
02:18:54,239 --> 02:18:58,159
i'm very actively involved in trying to

3620
02:18:57,679 --> 02:19:01,519
design

3621
02:18:58,159 --> 02:19:04,558
helping people experimentalists and uh

3622
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:06,079
engineers even to design antennas that

3623
02:19:04,558 --> 02:19:10,000
are capable of

3624
02:19:06,079 --> 02:19:12,000
detecting axions so there and that's

3625
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,239
there we're deep in the exploitation

3626
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:15,359
stage it's not a matter of finding the

3627
02:19:14,239 --> 02:19:17,679
new laws but of

3628
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:18,559
really you know using the laws we have

3629
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:21,280
to to

3630
02:19:18,558 --> 02:19:23,279
to kind of finish the story off so so

3631
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:26,960
it's complicated but but but

3632
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:28,880
but i'm you know i'm very happy with my

3633
02:19:26,959 --> 02:19:30,558
life right now and uh

3634
02:19:28,879 --> 02:19:32,318
i'm enjoying it and i don't want to

3635
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:35,599
cloud that by

3636
02:19:32,318 --> 02:19:38,799
thinking too much that that it's uh

3637
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:38,799
going to come to an end

3638
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:43,679
you know it's a gift i didn't earn is

3639
02:19:42,079 --> 02:19:48,079
there a good

3640
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:50,478
thing to say about why

3641
02:19:48,079 --> 02:19:52,879
this gift that you've gotten and didn't

3642
02:19:50,478 --> 02:19:55,519
deserve is so damn enjoyable

3643
02:19:52,879 --> 02:19:57,119
so like what's the meaning of this thing

3644
02:19:55,520 --> 02:20:00,640
of life

3645
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:03,840
to me interacting with people i love

3646
02:20:00,639 --> 02:20:06,159
my family and i have a very wide circle

3647
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:08,960
of friends now and i'm

3648
02:20:06,159 --> 02:20:10,079
trying to produce some institutions that

3649
02:20:08,959 --> 02:20:14,000
will survive me

3650
02:20:10,079 --> 02:20:14,000
as well as my as the work and

3651
02:20:14,879 --> 02:20:21,759
and it's just it's how should i say

3652
02:20:18,639 --> 02:20:25,039
it's a positive feedback work

3653
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:27,359
loop when you do something and if

3654
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:28,640
people appreciate it and and then you

3655
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:31,840
want to do more and they

3656
02:20:28,639 --> 02:20:33,599
get rewarded and it's just uh how should

3657
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:35,680
i say this is another gift that i didn't

3658
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:38,800
earn and don't understand but i

3659
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:42,159
i have a dopamine system and

3660
02:20:38,799 --> 02:20:45,920
uh yeah i'm happy to use it and

3661
02:20:42,159 --> 02:20:47,920
it seems to get energized by uh

3662
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:49,600
by the creative process but yeah process

3663
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:52,639
inspiration very much so

3664
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:54,069
and all of that started from the

3665
02:20:52,639 --> 02:20:56,159
little fluctuations

3666
02:20:54,069 --> 02:20:59,680
[Laughter]

3667
02:20:56,159 --> 02:21:01,439
shortly after the big bang frank well

3668
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:03,439
whatever the those initial conditions

3669
02:21:01,439 --> 02:21:06,000
and fluctuation did that created you

3670
02:21:03,439 --> 02:21:07,439
i'm glad they did this is uh thank you

3671
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:09,280
for all the work you've done

3672
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:11,120
for the many people you've inspired for

3673
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:13,359
the many of the billion

3674
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:16,399
most of your ideas were pretty useless

3675
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:19,200
of the bill several billions

3676
02:21:16,398 --> 02:21:19,920
as it is for all humans but uh you had

3677
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:22,560
quite a few

3678
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:23,760
truly special ideas and uh thank you for

3679
02:21:22,559 --> 02:21:25,680
bringing those to the world and thank

3680
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:26,559
you for wasting your valuable time with

3681
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:28,720
me today

3682
02:21:26,559 --> 02:21:31,039
it's truly enough it's been a joy and i

3683
02:21:28,719 --> 02:21:34,000
hope people uh

3684
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:36,160
enjoy it and and and i think you know

3685
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,959
the kind of mind expansion that i've

3686
02:21:36,159 --> 02:21:40,159
enjoyed

3687
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:42,079
by interacting with physical reality

3688
02:21:40,159 --> 02:21:43,359
at this deep level i think can be

3689
02:21:42,079 --> 02:21:46,000
conveyed to and

3690
02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:49,200
enjoyed by many many people and that's i

3691
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:50,239
that's one of my missions in life

3692
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:51,920
thanks for listening to this

3693
02:21:50,239 --> 02:21:52,639
