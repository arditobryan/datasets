00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,639
ryan schiller creator of

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,918
librex an anonymous discussion feed for

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,240
college communities

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:11,519
starting at first with yale then the ivy

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,280
leagues and now

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,118
adding stanford and mit their mission

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,640
is to give students a place to explore

9
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:21,600
ideas and issues

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,240
in a positive way but with much more

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,080
personal

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,000
and intellectual freedom than has

13
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,198
defined college campuses in recent

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,278
history

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
i think this is a very difficult but

16
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,079
worthy project

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,120
quick thank you to our sponsors all form

podcast

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,159
as a side note let me say that ryan is a

22
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,718
young entrepreneur

23
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,679
and genuine human being who quickly won

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
me over

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:52,079
he's inspiring in many ways both in the

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
struggle he had to overcome

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,198
in his personal life but also in the

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,079
fact that

29
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,439
he did not know how to code but saw a

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,320
problem in this world

31
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,119
in his community that he cared about and

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,879
for that

33
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,840
he learned to code and built the

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,359
solution in the best way he knew how

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,079
that's an important reminder for us

36
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,840
humans let us not only complain about

37
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,879
the problems in the world

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,880
let us fix them i also have to say that

39
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,879
there's passion in ryan's eyes

40
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,798
for really wanting to make a difference

41
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,519
in the world his story

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,240
his effort gives me hope for the future

43
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,640
there is

44
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,839
hate in this world but i believe there's

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,840
much more love

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,079
and i believe it's possible to build

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,400
online platforms that connect us

48
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,839
through our common humanity as we

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,520
explore difficult

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,560
personal even painful ideas together

51
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,959
this is the lex friedman podcast and

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,560
here

53
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,478
is my conversation with ryan schiller

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,600
let's start with the basics what is

55
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,239
librex

56
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,599
what are its founding story and finding

57
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,519
principles

58
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,879
and looking to the future what do you

59
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,118
hope to achieve with librex

60
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,920
sure let me break that down so what is

61
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,799
librex

62
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,200
librex is an anonymous discussion feed

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,200
for

64
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,118
college campuses it's a place where

65
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,120
people can have important

66
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,318
and unfettered discussions and open

67
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
discourse about

68
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,079
topics they care about ideas that matter

69
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,039
and they can do all of that completely

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,120
anonymously

71
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,159
with verified members of their college

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
community

73
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,878
and we exist both on

74
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,479
each ivy league campus and we have an

75
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,519
inter-iv community

76
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:32,719
and actually this week we just opened to

77
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,879
mit and stanford so now no really mit

78
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,080
yes stanford so we have mit and stanford

79
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,878
communities and i expect

80
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,360
you to sign up for your mit account and

81
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,598
start

82
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
posting what are for people who are not

83
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,079
familiar like me

84
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:49,199
actually which are the ivy leagues sure

85
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,800
so we started at yale which is my

86
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,639
i don't know can you call it alma mater

87
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
because i haven't technically graduated

88
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,238
yeah um what's that called when you're

89
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,239
actually still there

90
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,319
my university oh yeah i guess very i

91
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
guess home call it home that's my home

92
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,158
educational home started at my

93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,959
educational home of yale and then

94
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,878
we moved to um and we could get into the

95
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,519
story of this eventually if you'd like

96
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,039
and then we went to dartmouth and then

97
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,200
quarantine hit

98
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,400
we opened to the rest of the ivy league

99
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,719
and now we have

100
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
and the ivy league um for those who

101
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,919
don't know is

102
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,120
harvard yale princeton dartmouth

103
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,479
columbia cornell

104
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,239
brown and penn i got it all in one

105
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,679
breath what's the youngest eye league

106
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,239
pen no

107
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,120
colombia i can't say i haven't okay on

108
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,840
camera

109
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,319
we'll edit it in post i don't know okay

110
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,680
each of

111
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,359
all all eight of them and then you can

112
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
just like

113
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,959
get it in yeah like pen carver there's

114
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,238
actually a really nice

115
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
software that people should check out

116
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,519
like a service uh

117
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,519
it's using machine learning really

118
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,640
nicely for podcast editing

119
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,920
where you can it learns

120
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,839
the voice of the speaker and it can

121
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,079
change the words you said it's like some

122
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
deep fake stuff it's deep fake but for

123
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
positive applications it's very

124
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,120
interesting it's like the only deep fake

125
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,879
positive applications i've seen i have a

126
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
friend who's obsessed with defects yeah

127
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,479
what's great about i think deep fakes is

128
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
that it's gonna do the

129
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,759
opposite of sort of what's happening

130
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,000
with our culture where everyone will

131
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,478
have

132
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,358
plausible deniability yeah exactly i

133
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,319
mean that that's the hope for me is

134
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,799
there's so many fake things out there

135
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,680
that we're going to actually be

136
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,120
much more skeptical and and think and

137
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,759
take in multiple sources

138
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,280
and actually like reason like use common

139
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,439
sense and use them like deep

140
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,559
thinking to understand like what is true

141
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,719
and what is not

142
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,759
because uh you know we used to have like

143
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,520
traditional

144
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,080
sources like the new york times and all

145
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,079
these kinds of publications that had a

146
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,839
reputation there are these institutions

147
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,439
another the social truth

148
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,039
and when you no longer can trust

149
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,719
anything as a source of truth

150
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
you start to think on your own that gets

151
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,560
part of the individual that goes

152
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,240
that takes its way back to like where i

153
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,199
came from the soviet union where you

154
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,439
can't really trust

155
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,038
any one source of news you have to think

156
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,680
on your own you have to talk to your

157
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:05,279
friends

158
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,199
tremendous amount of intellectual

159
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,198
autonomy don't you think it

160
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,478
think about the societal consequences

161
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,879
absolutely i mean

162
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,800
we see so much decentralization in all

163
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,639
aspects of our digital lives now

164
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,879
but this is like the decentralization of

165
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,400
thought you could say it's sadly

166
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,240
or i don't think it's sad is

167
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,279
decentralization of truth

168
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,038
where like truth is a clustering thing

169
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,839
where you have these like this point

170
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,240
cloud of people just swimming around

171
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,679
like billions of them and they all have

172
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,879
certain ideas

173
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,400
and what's thought of as truth is almost

174
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,759
like a clustering algorithm when you

175
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,279
just get a bunch of

176
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,199
people that believe the same thing

177
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,839
that's truth but there's also another

178
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,919
truth

179
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,198
and there might be like multiple truths

180
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,159
and it's almost it

181
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,439
be like a battle of truths maybe even

182
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,560
the idea of truth

183
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,560
will like lessen its power

184
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,319
in society that there is such a thing as

185
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
a truth because like the downside of

186
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,960
saying

187
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,120
something is true is uh it's always the

188
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,719
downside of what people like religious

189
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,519
people call scientism

190
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,039
which is like once science has declared

191
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,159
something is true

192
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:20,318
you can't no longer question it but

193
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,759
the reality is science is a moving

194
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
mechanism you're constantly questioning

195
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,800
you're constantly questioning and

196
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:30,319
maybe truth should be renamed

197
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,879
as uh as a process not a

198
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,000
not a final destination the whole point

199
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,319
is to keep questioning

200
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,399
keep questioning keep discovering kind

201
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,199
of like we're going backwards in time so

202
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,279
like

203
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,639
back when back when people were sort of

204
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,399
finding their identities and we were

205
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
less globalized right

206
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,519
like people would would get together and

207
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
they'd get together around common value

208
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,399
system

209
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,560
common morals and a common place and

210
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,399
those would be sort of these clusters of

211
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
their truth right and so we have all

212
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,679
these different like civilizations and

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,279
societies across

214
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,038
across the world that created their own

215
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,399
truths you know we talk about the jews

216
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,199
and the tom and toro

217
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,719
look at buddhist texts we can look at

218
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
all sorts of different truths and

219
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,720
how many of them get at the same things

220
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,319
but many of them have different ideas or

221
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,880
different articulations

222
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,639
yeah harare and sapiens rewinds that

223
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,079
even farther back into like caveman

224
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,560
times that's the thing that made

225
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,240
us humans special is who can develop

226
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,120
these clusters of ideas hold them in

227
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,879
their minds

228
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
through stories pass them on to each

229
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,240
other and the girls and girls and

230
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,759
finally we have bitcoin

231
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,160
so which money is another belief system

232
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
that

233
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,319
um that uh that has power

234
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,120
only because we believe in it and is

235
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,280
that truth

236
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
i don't know but it has power and it

237
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,318
it's it's carried in the minds of

238
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,839
millions

239
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,039
and thereby has power but back to

240
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,638
librex so what uh what's the founding

241
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,839
story what's the founding principles of

242
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,960
librex

243
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,439
sure so i was on campus as a freshman

244
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,159
and i was talking to my friends many of

245
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,639
them

246
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,160
felt like it was hard to raise your hand

247
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,759
in class to ask question

248
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,520
they really felt like even outside the

249
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,560
classroom it was hard to be vulnerable

250
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,719
and the thing you have to understand

251
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,280
about yells it's not that big a place

252
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,319
everyone knows someone who knows someone

253
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,918
who knows you basically

254
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,680
yeah um and people come to these schools

255
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,799
first of all they're home for people and

256
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,079
they want to be themselves they want to

257
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,439
feel like they can be authentic they

258
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,639
want to make real friendships

259
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,360
and second of all it's a place where

260
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,479
people go for intellectual vitality

261
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,839
to explore important ideas and to grow

262
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,959
as thinkers

263
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,240
and fortunately due to the culture my

264
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,079
friends expressed that

265
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,519
it was very difficult to do that and i

266
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,720
felt it too and then

267
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,399
i couldn't talk to my professors and i

268
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,519
remember talked to one specific global

269
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,360
affairs professor

270
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,879
and i was taking his class and his area

271
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,680
of expertise was in the middle eastern

272
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,838
conflict

273
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,239
and i went to him and i said professor

274
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,880
we've we're almost finished this class

275
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,159
and we haven't even gotten to sort of

276
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,759
the reason i originally wanted to take

277
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,879
the class was to hear about your

278
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,639
perspective on the middle eastern

279
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,600
conflict because something i'd learned

280
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,080
at yale and this is

281
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,959
maybe a sort of a tangent but i'll i'll

282
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,720
flush it out a bit

283
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,000
something i've learned at yale is that

284
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,879
you can learn all sorts of things from a

285
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,200
textbook

286
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,519
and what you kind of go to yell to do is

287
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,600
to get like the opinions of the experts

288
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,600
that go beyond the textbook and to have

289
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,200
those more in-depth conversations

290
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,879
and so that's sort of the added value of

291
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,160
going to a place like yale and taking a

292
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,600
course there as opposed to

293
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,679
just reading a textbook but also

294
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,680
interact with that opinion exact

295
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,120
person yeah to interact with that with

296
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,120
that opinion to hear it

297
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,240
to respond to it to push back on it and

298
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,480
to have that

299
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,000
with some great minds and there really

300
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,039
are great minds at yale don't get me

301
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,879
wrong it's a

302
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,079
place it's still a place of tremendous

303
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,399
brilliance

304
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
um so i'm talking this professor right

305
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,958
and i'm like we haven't

306
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,360
i haven't heard your area of expertise

307
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,439
and i'm like are we going to get to it

308
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,278
what's the deal any this is during

309
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
office hours mind you so we're one on

310
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,320
one

311
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,439
it says ryan to be honest i used to

312
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,040
teach this area

313
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,640
every single year in fact i would do a

314
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,399
section on it which is like a

315
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,159
small seminar like breakaway from the

316
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,919
class where he would talk to the

317
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,000
students in small groups and

318
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,599
explain his and explain his perspective

319
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,320
his research and have a real debate

320
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
about it

321
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,800
like around a harkness table and um he

322
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,000
said i used to do this and then

323
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,559
about two years ago a student reported

324
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,360
me

325
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,000
to the school and i realized my job was

326
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,759
at risk

327
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,519
and i realized the best course of action

328
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,639
was basically

329
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,320
just not to broach the topic

330
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,399
and so now i just don't even mention it

331
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
and he's like you can say whatever you

332
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,679
want but

333
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,360
i'm not i'm not gonna be a part of it

334
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,359
and it's a real shame it's a real loss

335
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,039
to all of the students who i think

336
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,800
came to the school to learn from these

337
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,719
brilliant professors

338
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:53,278
in that context of these world experts

339
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,040
the problem seems to be that reporting

340
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:57,519
mechanism

341
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,799
where there's a disproportionate power

342
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,360
to a complaint

343
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,319
of a young student a complaint that an

344
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,680
idea

345
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,959
is painful or an idea is disrespectful

346
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,078
to you know or

347
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,958
ideas creating an unsafe space

348
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,000
and the the conclusion of that i mean

349
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,479
i'm not sure what to do

350
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
with that because it's a single

351
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,200
reporting

352
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,600
maybe a couple but that has more power

353
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,640
than the idea itself and that's strange

354
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,519
i i don't know how to

355
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,799
fix that in the administration except to

356
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,480
fire everybody

357
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,639
so like this is to push back against

358
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,560
this storyline

359
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,039
that academia somehow fundamentally

360
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,199
broken i think we have to separate a lot

361
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,078
of things out

362
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,959
like one is you have to look at faculty

363
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,319
and you have to look at

364
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,919
administration and like at mit for

365
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,959
example

366
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:53,759
the administration does

367
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,838
tries to do well but they're the ones

368
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,519
that often lack courage

369
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,600
they're often the ones who are the

370
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,919
source of the problem

371
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,879
when people criticize academia and i'll

372
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,759
just speak to my

373
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,799
to myself you know i'm willing to take

374
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,958
heat for this

375
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,399
is they really are criticizing the

376
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,879
administration

377
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,240
not the faculty because the faculty

378
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,919
often times

379
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,079
are the most brilliant the the boldest

380
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,439
thinkers that you think whenever you

381
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,679
talk about we need

382
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,200
like the truth to be spoken the faculty

383
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,120
are often the ones

384
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,560
who are in the possession of the deepest

385
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,720
truths in their mind

386
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,599
and in that sense and they also have the

387
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,759
capacity to

388
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
truly educate in the way that you're

389
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,480
you're saying and so

390
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,800
it's not broken like fundamentally

391
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,240
but there's stuff that like needs that's

392
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,799
not working that well and you just kind

393
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,079
of

394
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,120
you kind of took my words that's what

395
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,319
that's what i thought you were going to

396
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,959
ask me if i think the ivy league is

397
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,200
broken

398
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,879
that's totally that's exactly it so you

399
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,480
don't think yeah so on the question do

400
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,958
you think the ivy league is broken like

401
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,360
what

402
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,278
how do you think about it academia in

403
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,360
general i suppose but ivy league

404
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,200
still i think it represents some of the

405
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,800
best qualities of academia yeah what

406
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,800
more is there to say there i think

407
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,159
the ivy league is producing tremendous

408
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,719
thinkers to this day

409
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,078
i think the culture has a lot that can

410
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,839
be improved

411
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,439
but i have a lot of faith in the people

412
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,600
who are in these institutions

413
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
i think like you said the administration

414
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,079
and i have to be a little careful

415
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,439
because

416
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,759
um you know i've been in some of these

417
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,959
committees um and i i've

418
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,120
talked to the administration about these

419
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,319
sorts of things um i think they have a

420
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,159
lot of stakeholders

421
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,920
and unfortunately it makes it difficult

422
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,559
for them to always

423
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,679
serve these brilliant faculty and the

424
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,078
students in the way that they would

425
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,519
probably

426
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,958
like to yeah okay so this is me speaking

427
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,560
right the administration

428
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,198
i know the people and they're oftentimes

429
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,159
the faculty holding positions in these

430
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,559
committees right

431
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,639
yes but it's in in the role of quote

432
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:52,879
unquote service

433
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:56,000
they they're trying to do well

434
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,799
they're trying to do good

435
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,360
but i think you could say the mechanism

436
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,958
is not working but i could also say

437
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,879
my personal opinion is

438
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:12,078
they lack courage and

439
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:16,159
want courage and two

440
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:20,399
grace when they walk through the fire

441
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:22,719
so courage is stepping into the fire

442
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,919
and grace when you walk through the fire

443
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,040
is like maintaining that like

444
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,120
like as opposed to being rude

445
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,120
and insensitive to the lived

446
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,519
quote-unquote experience of others or

447
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,240
like

448
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,360
you know just not eloquent at all like

449
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,198
as you step in

450
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,199
and take the courageous step of talking

451
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,198
and saying the difficult thing

452
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:44,639
doing it well like doing it skillfully

453
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:45,359
so both of those are important the

454
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,039
courage

455
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,360
and the skill to communicate difficult

456
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,159
ideas and they often lack them because

457
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,879
they weren't

458
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,559
trained for it i think so you can blame

459
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,519
the mechanisms that don't

460
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,078
that allow 19 20 year old students to

461
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,720
have more

462
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,719
power than the entire faculty or you

463
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,519
could just say that the faculty need to

464
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,040
step up and grow some guts and and skill

465
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,159
of graceful communication

466
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,759
really administration well yeah

467
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,360
and the administration that's right

468
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,600
that's the administration

469
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,399
okay so the faculty are sometimes some

470
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,440
of the most brave

471
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,639
outspoken people yes within the balance

472
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,000
of their career yeah so

473
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:29,360
uh so that that takes a that's like the

474
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,639
founding kind of spark of a fire

475
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,039
that uh led you to then say okay so

476
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,560
how can i help yeah and i explored a lot

477
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,198
i expert a lot of options

478
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,078
i wrote many articles to my friends

479
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:41,599
talked to them

480
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,359
and i realized it sort of needed to be a

481
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,079
cultural change sort of need to be

482
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,519
bottom-up

483
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:50,479
grassroots um something i knew

484
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,120
the energy was there because you just

485
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,120
look at

486
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,039
the most recent institutional assessment

487
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,879
from yale this was

488
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:59,278
basically the number one thing that

489
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,600
students faculty and alumni all pointed

490
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:02,240
to

491
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,079
to the administration was cultivating

492
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,000
more conversations on campus and more

493
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:10,159
difficult conversations on campus

494
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,440
so the people on campus know it um

495
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:16,958
and you look at a gallup poll 61

496
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,959
of students are on ivy league campuses

497
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,838
afraid to

498
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,399
speak their minds because of the campus

499
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,120
culture

500
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,879
the campus culture is causing a sort of

501
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
freezing effect on discourse

502
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,720
can you pause on that again so what

503
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,519
percentage of students feel afraid to

504
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,040
speak their mind

505
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,639
61 nationally and you're talking about

506
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,639
you know places

507
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,799
nothing like uh the ivy league where i'd

508
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,000
say i'd imagine it would be even worse

509
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,359
because

510
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,320
of just the way that these communities

511
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,919
kind of come about

512
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
and the sorts of people who are

513
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,679
attracted or are invited to these sorts

514
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,240
of communities

515
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,198
that's nationwide that college students

516
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,839
and it's going up

517
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,559
that college students are afraid to say

518
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,560
what they believe

519
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,679
because of their campus climate so it's

520
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,000
a maturity

521
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,359
it's not it's not a conservative thing

522
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,279
it's not a liberal thing

523
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,558
it's a group thing we're all feeling it

524
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,678
the majority of us are feeling it and

525
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,678
basically just

526
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,120
it doesn't even you don't even

527
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,759
necessarily

528
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,119
need to have anything to say you just

529
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,720
have a fear

530
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,368
that's right so when you're like

531
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,480
teaching

532
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:22,558
[Music]

533
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,599
you know metaphors a really powerful

534
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,439
thing to explain

535
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,438
you know and there's just the caution

536
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,079
that you feel that's just horrible for

537
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,320
humor

538
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,079
now comedians have the freedom to just

539
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,639
talk [ __ ] which is why i really

540
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,720
appreciate uh somebody's been a friend

541
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,640
recently tim dillon who has

542
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,038
who gives zero uh pardon my french [ __ ]

543
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,640
about anything which is very liberating

544
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,839
very important person to just

545
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,799
tear down the powerful but you know

546
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,959
inside the the academia as a as an

547
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,119
educator as a teacher as a professor

548
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,279
you don't have the same freedom so that

549
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,079
fear is felt i guess by a majority of

550
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,079
students it's

551
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,439
um you were getting at something there

552
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,599
too which is that

553
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,640
um if you're afraid to speak

554
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,439
metaphorically if you're

555
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,440
afraid to speak imprecisely it can be

556
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,400
very difficult to actually think at all

557
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,000
and to think

558
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,080
to the extremities of what you're

559
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,599
capable of because these are the these

560
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,199
are the mechanisms we use when we don't

561
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,879
have quite the precise

562
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,200
mathematical language to quite pinpoint

563
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,120
what we're talking about yet this is the

564
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,720
beginning this is the creative step that

565
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,519
leads to new knowledge

566
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,279
and so that really scares me is that if

567
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,119
i'm not allowed to sort of excavate

568
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,639
these things these ideas with people

569
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,319
in the sort of messy sloppy way that we

570
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,440
do as humans when we're first being

571
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,359
creative

572
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,558
are we how are we going to be able to

573
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,558
continue to innovate are we going to

574
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,879
continue to be able to learn

575
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,558
that's what really started to scare me

576
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,840
so you've explored a bunch of different

577
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,639
ideas you wrote a bunch of different

578
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,519
stuff

579
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
uh how did lee brooks come about it

580
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,639
basically

581
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,240
came to me that it had to be kind of a

582
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,000
grassroots movement and it had to be

583
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,720
something that changed culturally

584
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,319
and it had to be relatively personal

585
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,480
people meeting people

586
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,918
people finding out that no i'm not the

587
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,720
only one on campus

588
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,000
who feels this way i i feel alone and

589
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,640
there are a lot of other people who feel

590
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,759
alone

591
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,200
i i believe this thing and it's not as

592
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,519
unpopular as i thought

593
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,038
you know the basically creating

594
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,519
heterodoxy of thought

595
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:21,919
and it's creating that moment where you

596
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,519
realize that your politics

597
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,000
are personal and that your politics are

598
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,038
shared by a lot of people on campus

599
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,640
and so i just started coding it i i

600
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,759
didn't have much coding experience but

601
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,000
uh

602
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,960
went headfirst in and figured how hard

603
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,759
could it be

604
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,480
you know i mean this is really

605
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,000
fascinating

606
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,599
so i talked to a lot of software

607
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,558
engineers ai people

608
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,959
obviously that's where my passion my uh

609
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,678
like

610
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,360
interests are my focus has been

611
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,640
throughout my life the fascinating thing

612
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,159
about your story i think it

613
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,919
should be truly inspiring to like

614
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,679
people that want to change the world is

615
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,880
that you don't have a background

616
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,038
in programming you don't have even maybe

617
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,080
a technical background

618
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:09,119
so you saw a problem

619
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,798
you explored different ideas and then

620
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,158
you just decided you're gonna

621
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,519
learn how to build an app like without a

622
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,720
technical background

623
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,720
like you didn't try to

624
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,759
that's so bold that is so beautiful man

625
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,038
um can you take me through the journey

626
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,679
of of

627
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,839
deciding to do that of like learning to

628
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,320
program without a programming background

629
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,279
and building the app like detail like

630
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,240
what do you actually

631
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,200
like how do you start sure i mean you

632
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,720
want to uh

633
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,480
you want to buy a mac i learned you knew

634
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,240
you had to buy them i'm just going to go

635
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,880
step by step right i'll be as dumb as

636
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,599
possible because it was it was truly

637
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,280
it was truly you know yeah like leading

638
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,678
by your feet so you need a computer for

639
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
this

640
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,960
well yeah i had a pc at the time and i

641
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,639
was android at the time

642
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,558
and i realized you know i realized it

643
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,799
should be like an ios app and so

644
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,599
um you know that was a decision but you

645
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,279
know i knew

646
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,959
kids these days they're always on their

647
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,158
phone and you know i wanted you to be

648
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,079
able to

649
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,679
say a passing thought you know in class

650
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,960
make a passing like you're walking

651
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,519
around and you have a thought and you

652
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,120
can

653
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,000
express it or you're in the dining hall

654
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,439
and you have your phone out you can

655
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
express it so it was clear to me it

656
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,519
should be an ios app

657
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
by the way yeah android is great

658
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,240
definitely check out

659
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,440
we also are now available on android but

660
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,599
we'll get there

661
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,038
um for the you android users from mit

662
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,158
stanford or the ivy league

663
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,200
so back to how it happened so i realized

664
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,400
i had mac

665
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,919
so went out and got back um and i

666
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,880
realized i need an iphone

667
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,480
for testing eventually got an iphone um

668
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,440
so those are the real robot blocks to

669
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,759
start with

670
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,200
um from there i mean there's there's

671
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,079
almost too much information out there

672
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,919
about programming

673
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,519
the question is like where do you start

674
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,960
and what's going to be useful to you

675
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,558
and i

676
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,319
i my first thought was i should look at

677
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,839
some yell classes but it became very

678
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,119
clear very quickly that that was not the

679
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:59,038
right place to start

680
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,399
um that would probably be the right

681
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:00,879
place to start if i wanted to get a job

682
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,720
at

683
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,480
amazon but michael was slightly

684
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,519
different yeah and

685
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,798
i i definitely had it in mind that what

686
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,400
i was trying to make was i'm trying to

687
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:11,519
prove out an idea i'm not trying to make

688
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,919
a finished product

689
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,119
i'm just trying to get to the first step

690
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,240
because i figured

691
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,439
if i keep if i keep getting to the next

692
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,599
step

693
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,120
at least i won't die now you know like

694
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,079
at least things will move forward i'll

695
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,000
learn new things

696
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,439
maybe i'll meet new people i'll show a

697
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,159
degree of seriousness about what i'm

698
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,000
doing

699
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,320
and things will come together and that

700
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,599
is as you'll see what ends up happening

701
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,038
um so i start with swift right and

702
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,558
i find this video from the stanford

703
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:39,200
professor that had like a million views

704
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,440
that was like

705
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,279
how to make basically swift apps like

706
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,320
perfect and you just like

707
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,759
uh so you got this mac and you what like

708
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,599
go to google.com

709
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,359
and you type in download xcode and

710
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,319
that's code yeah and then i type in on

711
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,519
youtube like

712
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:58,639
stanford ios swift

713
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,079
enter first youtube video has a million

714
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,720
views i'm like it has to be good at

715
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,000
stanford

716
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,679
as a million views i got lucky

717
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,519
i mean that turned out to be a very good

718
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,080
video it's basically like

719
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,839
introductory course to swift yeah i mean

720
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,359
you say introductory i think most of the

721
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,119
people in that class

722
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,359
um probably had a much better background

723
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,199
than i did software developers probably

724
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,798
yeah computer scientists and it was slow

725
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,720
for me um

726
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,158
i i don't think i realized it fully at

727
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,519
the time just how far behind i was from

728
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,080
the rest of the class because i was like

729
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,519
wow

730
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,599
it seems like people are picking this up

731
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,038
really quickly um

732
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,798
so it took a little longer and you know

733
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,279
a lot of time on stack overflow

734
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,879
but eventually i made a truly minimal

735
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,038
viable product

736
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,278
the most minimal like we're talking you

737
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:43,759
know put text on screen

738
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,558
add text to screen comment on top of

739
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,240
text you know

740
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:50,158
make a post make a response and anyone

741
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,200
with a yell email can do this

742
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,360
and you plug it into a

743
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,720
certain a cloud server and you verify

744
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,359
people's accounts

745
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,798
and you you're off you have you have to

746
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,719
figure out how to

747
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,000
like the whole idea of like having an

748
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,000
account so

749
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,200
there's a permanence like you can create

750
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,240
an account

751
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,400
with an email verify it verify it

752
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,519
okay so that that's not you know and

753
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,278
that's literally how i thought about it

754
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,879
right like so what do i need to do

755
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,319
and i'm like well first thing i need is

756
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,720
a login page

757
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,000
and i'm like how to make a login page in

758
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,440
swift

759
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,038
i mean it's that easy if someone this

760
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,640
has been done before of course and the

761
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,079
first page that pops up was probably a

762
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,400
pretty damn good page

763
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,119
it wasn't that bad it wasn't perfect but

764
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,960
like

765
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,879
maybe it got me 80 of the way there yeah

766
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,720
and then i came into some bugs

767
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,000
and then you know i asked stack overflow

768
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,919
a few questions

769
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,759
and then i got a little further and then

770
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,799
i found some more bugs and then i'm like

771
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:44,480
maybe this isn't the right way to do

772
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,158
maybe i should do it this way and yeah

773
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,440
i'm sure my code isn't great

774
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,799
but the goal isn't to make great code

775
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,080
the great wasn't the goal wasn't to make

776
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,720
scalable code it was to

777
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,359
understand is this something my friends

778
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,038
will use

779
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,639
like what is the reaction going to be if

780
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,960
i put it in their hands and

781
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,679
am i capable of making this thing and

782
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,600
that's awesome

783
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,960
and so you're focusing on the the

784
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,959
experience like actually

785
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,038
just really driving towards that first

786
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640
step figuring out the first step and

787
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,919
really driving towards it of course you

788
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,799
have to also figure out

789
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,679
like concept of like storage like

790
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:15,440
database

791
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,600
you know something funny what's that i

792
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,840
just made the database structure with no

793
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,678
knowledge of databases whatsoever

794
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,879
and i start showing it to my friends who

795
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,360
have an experience in cs and they're

796
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,120
like

797
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,439
you used a heap that's so interesting

798
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,038
you're like why did you decide to

799
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,159
store it in this way i'm like bro i

800
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,158
don't even know what a heap is yeah

801
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,240
i just did it because it works like i'm

802
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:37,038
trying to make calls and stuff and

803
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,798
they're like

804
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,720
uh yeah they're like the hierarchy is

805
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,480
really like i'm like what

806
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,400
there's a deep profound lesson in there

807
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,919
that i don't know how much you've

808
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,960
interacted with computer science people

809
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,720
since but

810
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,640
they tend to optimize and have these

811
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,278
kind of discussions and what leads

812
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,880
what results is over optimization it's

813
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,720
like worrying is this really the right

814
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,320
way to do it and then you go

815
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,640
as opposed to doing the first thing on

816
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:03,439
stack overflow you go down this like

817
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,720
rabbit hole of what's the actual proper

818
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,640
way to do it

819
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,798
and then you're like you wake up five

820
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,679
years later working on amazon working at

821
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:11,440
amazon

822
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,159
because you've never finished the login

823
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,480
page like it's kind of hilarious but

824
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,720
that

825
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,519
that's a really deep lesson like just

826
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,880
get it done

827
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,519
and and there's like what what's a heat

828
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,240
bro

829
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,278
is is the right that should be a t-shirt

830
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,120
uh

831
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,558
that that's really the right approach to

832
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,839
building something that

833
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,319
ultimately creates an experience and

834
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,720
then you

835
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,319
iterate eventually that's how the great

836
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,759
some of the greatest software products

837
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,639
in this world have been built

838
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,759
as you create it quickly and then just

839
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,840
iterate

840
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,919
what was by the way in your mind the

841
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,918
thing that you're chasing as a

842
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,600
prototype like what what was the first

843
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,559
step that it feels like something is

844
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,158
working

845
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,158
like do you see you interacting with

846
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,919
another friend

847
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,278
yeah i think the first step was like

848
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,640
it's one thing to tell someone about an

849
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,960
idea but it's another thing to put in

850
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,720
their hands and kind of see like

851
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,960
the way their their eyes kind of look um

852
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,000
and when i'd go i'd walk around across

853
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,919
campus which is

854
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,278
part of yale and i'd literally just go

855
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,559
up to people and run up to them and be

856
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:16,880
like try this try this you got to try

857
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:18,240
this

858
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,039
this is pre-quarantined by the way of

859
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,038
course this would never

860
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,798
like what is it and i'd be like and i'll

861
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,759
explain it's like an anonymous

862
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,639
discussion feed

863
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,679
for a yale campus yeah and you see their

864
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,600
gears turning

865
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,360
and they just some people would be like

866
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,000
not interested yeah i'm like fine not

867
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,199
your target

868
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,440
demographic i get it you'll come

869
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,440
eventually um but some people

870
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,080
like you could see it they got it

871
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,159
they're like yes

872
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,558
and that's when i was like okay okay

873
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,278
there is and you don't need

874
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,240
i mean you don't need fifty percent of

875
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,480
people to like it

876
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,440
yeah you need what five percent ten

877
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,960
percent to love it

878
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,720
and then they'll tell five percent ten

879
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,079
percent yeah word of mouth yeah

880
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,720
and you're good um of course the first

881
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,879
version was

882
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,038
very very crappy but seeing people

883
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,640
trying despite all the crappiness wasn't

884
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:07,519
it was sort of enough to be the first

885
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,520
step and

886
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,798
you know since since then all of my

887
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,839
code's been stripped out

888
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,359
i now um have friends who

889
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,038
basically have told me don't bother with

890
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,319
the coding part you do you do the rest

891
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:19,599
you just make sure that we can code

892
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,759
because they want to code

893
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,959
great i mean i'm not an engineer yeah i

894
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,919
never intended to be an engineer and

895
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,640
there's a lot to do that's not

896
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,679
engineering

897
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,480
yes but the point was just to validate

898
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,360
the idea

899
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,319
so to speak when was the moment that you

900
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,278
felt like

901
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:35,918
we've created something special maybe a

902
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,558
moment

903
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,960
where you're proud of that this is a

904
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,879
this is this has the potential to

905
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,440
actually be the very

906
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,120
uh implementation of the idea that i

907
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,880
initially had

908
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,158
there's so many there's so many little

909
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,320
moments it's like

910
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,159
and i bet there'll still be moments in

911
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:57,200
the future that make that make it hard

912
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,760
to like

913
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,240
totally say like yeah we should say this

914
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,798
is a

915
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,278
this is still very early years of libre

916
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,359
yeah

917
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,558
it's literally it's only been a year

918
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,240
since we've had like

919
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,759
actual like a lot of people on the app

920
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,000
yeah about a year oh wow

921
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,960
okay i mean there's some crazy moments i

922
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,480
could talk about

923
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,558
sort of going to dartmouth because it's

924
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,200
one thing to like get some traction at

925
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,839
your school

926
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,360
yeah people know you and you know it's

927
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,639
it's your school you know

928
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,278
it's another thing to go to another

929
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,159
school and where no one knows you and

930
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,200
sign up 90

931
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,000
of the campus overnight wow so tell me

932
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,000
that story

933
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,599
you're invading another territory it was

934
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,960
literally like that

935
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,278
did you buy it like a dartmouth

936
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,720
sweatshirt

937
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,480
purposefully i didn't want to defraud

938
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,600
any fraud anyone but i was purposefully

939
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,000
non-descript in my

940
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,918
clothing yeah no yell stuff no dartmouth

941
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,038
stuff um just blend in

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,278
um i'll get i'll go back there so what

943
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:54,398
happened was

944
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:58,319
this was like march of last year um

945
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:59,918
so almost almost a year ago today and

946
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:04,000
i really wanted to see if we could go

947
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:06,000
from sort of one campus to two campuses

948
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,200
so i didn't know anyone at dartmouth

949
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,679
campus but i

950
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:15,038
kind of i had some cold emails some

951
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,720
warm-ish emails um and i went to people

952
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:17,919
and i was like basically can i sleep on

953
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,159
your floor for two days

954
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,840
during finals period yeah i had a lot of

955
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,278
people who said this is crazy like no

956
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,879
one's gonna no one wants to download an

957
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:26,960
app during finals period a social

958
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,760
afternoon's period

959
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,120
but i emailed a few people i was like

960
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,679
you know can i sleep on your floor and

961
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,599
one of them

962
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,798
was crazy enough to say sure come to my

963
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:38,480
come to my door

964
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,839
i have a nice floor um and he ended up

965
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,240
today he's still really close he's a

966
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,158
really close friend but anyway

967
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,278
i take a train knowing nothing about

968
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:50,960
this guy besides his first and last name

969
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:54,079
and i arrive and dartmouth is

970
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,759
really really remote way more remote

971
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,319
than you think to the point where

972
00:30:55,759 --> 00:31:00,319
i'm like he's like he warned me he's a

973
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,678
really hospitable guy he warned me like

974
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,119
it's gonna be hard to get to campus from

975
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,880
the train station because it's really

976
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,319
remote and i'm like i'm sure it's fine

977
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,440
i'll just get an uber

978
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,359
there are no ubers in hanovers

979
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,960
what do you think this is new hampshire

980
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,199
so uh connecticut

981
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,200
i mean uh yale is pretty remote as well

982
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,360
no yeah yell is um

983
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,600
well i mean yells in new haven which is

984
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,079
a real city it has ubers it has

985
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,798
food it has a culture it has a nightclub

986
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,480
even yeah

987
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,158
like we're talking about real city like

988
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,720
it's not new york it's not philadelphia

989
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,880
where i'm from but it's a city

990
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,759
uh new hampshire is something very

991
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,679
different yeah

992
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,960
beautiful campus i'm sure beautiful oh

993
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,278
my gosh i could tell

994
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,159
i could talk so much about i was blown

995
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,319
away by

996
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,399
dartmouth i i started wondering like why

997
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,798
i didn't apply

998
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:47,839
legitimately um between the people and

999
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:49,679
the culture it was

1000
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,678
it was a it was a beautiful vacation so

1001
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,600
i arrived there no uber

1002
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,038
but eventually i call this guy who's

1003
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,480
like the only guy who can get you to

1004
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,359
dartmouth and it takes a couple hours

1005
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,399
but we got there

1006
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,839
i sleep on this guy's floor i wake up i

1007
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,359
ask him if there's any printing he's

1008
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,959
like oh dartmouth happens to have free

1009
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,398
printing in the copy room

1010
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,240
um i print out like 2 000 posters

1011
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:11,759
until the guy in the copy room literally

1012
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,038
goes to he's like kid i don't know what

1013
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,079
you're doing but you need to get out of

1014
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:16,480
here

1015
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,720
i'm like all right i'm going i'm going

1016
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,200
um on the limits i knew yeah i found the

1017
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,038
limit

1018
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,640
um and i think a lot of startup is about

1019
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,398
finding the limits

1020
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,320
that's a little piece of advice um

1021
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:27,119
socially yeah he's like you gotta get

1022
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,359
out of here and

1023
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:33,678
i um i then go to every single dorm door

1024
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,599
i put a poster under every single dorm

1025
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,320
door advertising the app with a with a

1026
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:39,599
qr code

1027
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,200
yeah i walk around campus saying hi to

1028
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,558
everyone and telling them about the app

1029
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,519
i go from table to table in the

1030
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,599
cafeteria

1031
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,960
introduce myself say hi and tell them

1032
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,119
download the app

1033
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,600
it's exhausting day so many steps so

1034
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,918
much crouching down to slip the poster

1035
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,639
into the dorm door my legs were burning

1036
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,679
um but by the end of it you know 24

1037
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,399
hours later i'm

1038
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,880
sitting on a i'm sitting in a bus and

1039
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:02,558
i'm

1040
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,159
just pressing the refresh button on the

1041
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,480
account creation panel

1042
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,640
it's like going up by hundreds yeah and

1043
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,839
i'm like oh my gosh

1044
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,320
this in a sense i mean certainly your

1045
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,359
like

1046
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:17,278
initial seed is powerful just a piece

1047
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,398
yeah but then the word of mouth is what

1048
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,480
carries it forward

1049
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:21,439
and what was the explanation you gave to

1050
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,319
the app

1051
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,360
it's uh anonymity a fundamental part of

1052
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,319
it like saying

1053
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,278
this is a chance for you to speak your

1054
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,480
mind

1055
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,278
about your experiences on campus yeah i

1056
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,519
think

1057
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,880
people get it you don't need to what

1058
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,359
i've realized is you don't need to tell

1059
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,880
people

1060
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:43,519
why to try it yeah they know yeah it it

1061
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,919
there's a hunger for this exactly yeah

1062
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,558
so

1063
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,840
i all i do is i'm very factual i said

1064
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,879
and this is where i kind of

1065
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:52,079
ended up coining the kind of the line

1066
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,679
that i now use to say

1067
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,759
it because i said it so many times in

1068
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,640
those 24 hours i just said it's an

1069
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,049
anonymous discussion feed for dartmouth

1070
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,399
and they're like yes

1071
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:03,678
[Laughter]

1072
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,359
like they've been waiting for it you

1073
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,880
know some people are more skeptical but

1074
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,878
a lot of people were like

1075
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,679
great i'm excited to try this i'm

1076
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,118
excited to meet people and connect and

1077
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,838
i mean the way dartmouth's taken to is

1078
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,919
incredible everything from

1079
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,519
professors writing poems during finals

1080
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,440
period to be like

1081
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,519
um good luck in finals period you're

1082
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,878
gonna rise like a phoenix or whatever

1083
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:29,599
so like yeah it's crazy to i heard about

1084
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,039
uh two women meeting on librex and

1085
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,720
starting a finance club

1086
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:37,918
um at dartmouth to significant others

1087
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,439
um meaning there's an article recently

1088
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,598
written up at yale as well about

1089
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,440
two queer women who met on librex and

1090
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,280
started a relationship which was pretty

1091
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,599
it was pretty interesting to see people

1092
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,519
throwing parties pre-covet

1093
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,200
um yeah it was just amazing to see how

1094
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:52,000
when you allow people to be vulnerable

1095
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,598
and social

1096
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,599
they connect they people have this

1097
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,760
natural desire to connect

1098
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,880
yeah when when you have whatever natural

1099
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,640
desire to have a voice

1100
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,838
and then when that voice is

1101
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,519
is uh paired with freedom

1102
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:09,358
that you could truly express yourself

1103
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:11,599
and there's something liberating about

1104
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,519
that and in that sense uh

1105
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,240
you're like you're connecting is your

1106
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,838
true self whatever that is

1107
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,039
what are the most powerful conversation

1108
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:20,880
you've seen on the app you mentioned

1109
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,639
like people connecting

1110
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,920
the hard part about that is the sorting

1111
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,598
you know figuring out what's going on

1112
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,119
which one am i going to put at the top

1113
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,800
mental sorting out just something to

1114
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,640
stand out to you sorry i don't mean to

1115
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,119
do like the top 10 conversations

1116
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,480
ever of all time ever on the app i just

1117
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,358
mean like stuff that you remember that

1118
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,079
stands out to you

1119
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:38,639
i remember this one really amazing

1120
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,079
comment

1121
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:45,358
from this he was a mexican

1122
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,880
international student who spoke out

1123
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:51,440
and this this this post was super edgy

1124
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,880
but yet it got hundreds and hundreds of

1125
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,559
upvotes within the yale community it was

1126
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,160
a yale community specific post and we

1127
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,078
should point out that there's

1128
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,319
a school specific community now and

1129
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,599
there's an all-ivy community

1130
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,680
so this was specifically in the yale

1131
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,320
community and this was a little while

1132
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,919
ago

1133
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,720
but it stuck with me this mexican

1134
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,000
international student comes to yale and

1135
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,439
he starts talking about his

1136
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,159
experience in the um la casa which is

1137
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,480
the mexican

1138
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,838
latinx as they would say cultural center

1139
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,079
at yale and how

1140
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:22,880
he doesn't feel welcome there because

1141
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,440
he's

1142
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,720
roman catholic basically and

1143
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,559
international

1144
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,159
and how he doesn't feel like he fits

1145
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,679
with their agenda

1146
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,598
and as a result this place that's

1147
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,319
supposed to be home for him he feels

1148
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,680
outcasted

1149
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,599
and feels more alone than he does

1150
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,919
anywhere else on campus

1151
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,519
that's powerful that was powerful to me

1152
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,240
yeah it's hearing someone

1153
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:45,358
someone who should be feeling supported

1154
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:49,039
by this culture

1155
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,519
say actually this is not doing anything

1156
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,480
for me

1157
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:55,119
like this is not helping me yeah this is

1158
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,519
this is not where i feel at home

1159
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,838
so what do you make of anonymity

1160
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,639
because it seems to be a fundamental

1161
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,679
aspect

1162
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,920
of the power of the app right but

1163
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,679
at the same time anonymity on the

1164
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,838
internet

1165
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,000
so it protects us right it gives us

1166
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:16,480
freedom to have a voice

1167
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,920
but it can also bring out the dark sides

1168
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,400
of human nature

1169
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,119
like trolls or people who want to be

1170
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,000
malicious

1171
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,519
want to hurt others purely for the joy

1172
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,960
of hurting others

1173
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:31,280
being cruel for fun and

1174
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,280
going to the dark places so like what do

1175
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,040
you make of anonymity as a fundamental

1176
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,599
feature of social interaction

1177
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,960
like the pros and the cons yeah just to

1178
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,400
break that down a bit

1179
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,920
i would say a lot of those same things

1180
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,480
about a place like twitter where people

1181
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,000
are very

1182
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,559
unanimous um having said that of course

1183
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
there's a different sort of capacity

1184
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,320
people have when they're anonymous

1185
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,679
right well in all different sorts of

1186
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,440
ways

1187
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,879
so what do i make of anonymity i think

1188
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,639
it can be incredibly liberating and

1189
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,119
allow people to be incredibly vulnerable

1190
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,639
and to connect in different ways both on

1191
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,960
politics and there was a lot to talk

1192
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,519
about this year regarding politics

1193
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,039
and you know personally vulnerable being

1194
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,960
vulnerable talking about relationships

1195
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,239
and mental health

1196
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,800
i think it allows people to have a

1197
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,479
community that's not performative

1198
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,039
and of course there's this other side

1199
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,440
where you know people

1200
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:22,239
can sometimes break rules or say things

1201
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,679
that they

1202
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,199
wouldn't otherwise say that people don't

1203
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,799
always agree with or that people might

1204
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:29,679
find repugnant

1205
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,039
and to an extent these can facilitate

1206
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,559
great conversations

1207
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,320
and on the other hand we have to have

1208
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:35,440
moderation in place and we have to have

1209
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,920
community guidelines

1210
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,440
to make sure that the anonymity doesn't

1211
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,079
overwhelm the purpose

1212
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,358
which is that anonymity first of all

1213
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,280
anime is a tool

1214
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,559
in librex it was not the purpose of

1215
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,560
librex it is

1216
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,719
a way that we get towards these

1217
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,159
authentic conversations given our campus

1218
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:55,118
climate

1219
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,559
and second of all i would say it's a

1220
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,119
spectrum

1221
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,799
it's not just it's not just librex is

1222
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,079
anonymous right

1223
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,800
um because librex isn't totally

1224
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,800
anonymous

1225
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,240
everyone's a verified ivy league student

1226
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,119
you know exactly what school everyone

1227
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:11,679
goes to

1228
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,400
you only have one account per person at

1229
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,000
yale

1230
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,079
meaning if um meaning that

1231
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,039
i mean what that amounts to is people

1232
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,680
have more of an ownership in the

1233
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,880
community

1234
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,039
and people know that they're connected

1235
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,200
and they have a common vernacular

1236
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,358
so the anonymity is a scale and it's a

1237
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,879
tool but you can also trust i mean this

1238
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:31,358
is the difference between

1239
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,920
reddit anonymity where you can easily

1240
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:36,000
create multiple accounts

1241
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,440
when you have only one account per

1242
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,119
person

1243
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,039
or at least it's very difficult to

1244
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,960
create multiple accounts

1245
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,239
then you can trust that the anonymous

1246
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,358
person you're talking to

1247
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,078
is a human being not a bot i try to be

1248
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,519
completely

1249
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,519
unanimous uh now in my all public

1250
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:56,079
interactions i try to be as real in

1251
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,039
every way possible like zero gap between

1252
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,480
private

1253
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:01,838
me and public me why exactly did you it

1254
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,400
seems like this is an intentional

1255
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,119
mission

1256
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,800
what made you want to sort of bridge

1257
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,079
that gap between the private sphere and

1258
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,760
public sphere

1259
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,359
because that's that's unique i know a

1260
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,359
lot of intellectuals who would

1261
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:14,639
make a different decision yeah

1262
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,639
interesting i had a

1263
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:18,559
discussion about with naval about this

1264
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:21,679
actually with a few others

1265
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:24,239
that have a very clear distinction

1266
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:26,078
between public and private

1267
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:29,838
something i'm struggling with by the way

1268
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,839
personally i'm thinking about

1269
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,599
so one on the very basic surface level

1270
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,519
is

1271
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:43,119
uh if you carry with yourself lies

1272
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:44,159
small lies or big lies it's extra mental

1273
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,680
effort

1274
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:50,078
to remember what you uh

1275
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,000
like to remember what you're supposed to

1276
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,560
say not supposed to say

1277
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,440
so that's on a very surface level of

1278
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,920
like it's just

1279
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,760
easier to live life when you're have the

1280
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,760
smaller the gap between the private you

1281
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,200
and the public you

1282
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,520
and the second is

1283
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:09,199
i think for me from an engineering

1284
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:12,800
perspective

1285
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:15,358
like if i'm dishonest with others

1286
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,880
i will too quickly become dishonest with

1287
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:19,920
myself

1288
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,760
and in so doing i will not truly be able

1289
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,079
to think deeply about the world and come

1290
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,560
up

1291
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,119
and build revolutionary ideas there's

1292
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,799
something about honesty that feels like

1293
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,640
it's that first principles thinking

1294
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,519
that's almost like overused as a term

1295
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,199
but

1296
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:36,639
it feels like that requires radical

1297
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:38,960
honesty not radical asshole-ishness

1298
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:39,920
but radical honesty with yourself with

1299
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,280
yourself

1300
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,880
and i feels like it's difficult to be

1301
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,640
radically honest with yourself

1302
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,079
when you're being dishonest with the

1303
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:52,078
public and also

1304
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,160
i have a nice feature honestly that um

1305
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,640
in this current social context so we can

1306
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:59,358
talk about race and gender

1307
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,920
and uh what what are the other topics

1308
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:03,838
that are

1309
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,760
touchy city and um nationality

1310
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,039
all those things i mean like family

1311
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,960
structure i

1312
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,880
maybe i'm ineloquent in the way i speak

1313
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,119
about them but

1314
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,920
i honestly when i look in the mirror

1315
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,599
like

1316
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,240
i'm not deeply hateful of a particular

1317
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,720
race

1318
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,479
or even just hateful particular race um

1319
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,318
i'm sure i'm biased and i try to like

1320
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,480
think about those biases and so on

1321
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,639
and also i don't have any creepy [ __ ] in

1322
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,039
my closet

1323
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,078
i haven't done it seems like everybody

1324
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,920
uh

1325
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,720
it seems like a lot of people got like

1326
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,680
did a lot of creepy stuff in their life

1327
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,318
and i i just feel like that's uh really

1328
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:42,559
nice

1329
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:43,920
and deliberating and especially now you

1330
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,440
know it's funny because i've gotten a

1331
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,440
bit of a platform

1332
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,480
and uh i think it all started when i

1333
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,480
went this is a

1334
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,000
fame miss community female comedian

1335
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,639
whitney cummings

1336
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
and you know i've gotten a lot of

1337
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:57,440
amazing

1338
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,079
women writing me throughout but when

1339
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,240
when i went on whitney

1340
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,920
it was like the number of dm's i get on

1341
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:07,838
instagram

1342
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,599
for women is just ridiculous and

1343
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,440
i think that was a really important

1344
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,400
moment for me is like

1345
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,440
i speak and i feel you know i really

1346
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,039
value love

1347
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:22,318
long-term monogamy with like one person

1348
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:23,199
and it's like i could see where a lot of

1349
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,759
guys

1350
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:26,399
would now continue that message in

1351
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,079
public

1352
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,838
and in private just starts sleeping

1353
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,599
around and so like that's an

1354
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:33,119
important statement for me mentally he's

1355
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,960
like nope

1356
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,720
the straight narrow you just go straight

1357
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,800
and not out of fear but out of like

1358
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,519
principle and just like

1359
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,318
live life honestly i just i feel like

1360
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:45,920
that's

1361
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:48,239
truly liberating uh as a human being

1362
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,480
forget public all that because then i

1363
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:54,159
feel like i'm on sturdy ground

1364
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,559
when i say uh difficult things

1365
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,440
and at the same time sorry i'm ranting

1366
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,838
on this i apologize

1367
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:06,720
i'm interested personally so keep going

1368
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:09,199
i i honestly believe in the internet

1369
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:10,879
in people on the internet that when they

1370
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:13,519
hear me speak

1371
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,920
they can see if i'm full of [ __ ] or not

1372
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,800
like

1373
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,280
i won't be able to fake it you know like

1374
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,560
they'll

1375
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:24,160
see it through uh yeah i

1376
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:26,000
so like i feel like if you're not lying

1377
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,759
about stuff you have the freedom to

1378
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,800
truly be yourself and the

1379
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,880
and the internet will figure it out

1380
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,839
like we'll figure who you are people

1381
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,680
have a natural

1382
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,880
tendency to be able to tell [ __ ] and

1383
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:38,159
it makes sense from an evolutionary

1384
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,200
standpoint right exactly

1385
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,199
like why why wouldn't why like

1386
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,598
of all the things that we could evolve

1387
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,519
to be good at

1388
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,519
being able to detect honesty seems like

1389
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,119
one that would be particularly valuable

1390
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,119
especially in the sorts of societies we

1391
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,960
developed into and then also from a

1392
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,480
selfish perspective like a success

1393
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,000
perspective

1394
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,760
i think there's a lot of folks that have

1395
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,519
inspired me uh

1396
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,079
like the elon is one of them that shows

1397
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,440
that

1398
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,560
there's a hunger for genuineness like

1399
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,358
you can build a business as a ceo

1400
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,039
and be genuine and like real and do

1401
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:16,639
stupid [ __ ] every once in a while

1402
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,239
as long as it's coming from the same

1403
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,000
place of who you truly are

1404
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,679
like elon's inspiration with that and

1405
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,119
then there's a lot of other people i

1406
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:25,279
admire

1407
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,280
that are counter inspirations in the

1408
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,720
sense like they're very

1409
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,880
formal they hold back

1410
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,480
a lot of themselves and it's like i know

1411
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,160
how brilliant those people are

1412
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,679
and i think they're not being as

1413
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:40,879
effective of leaders

1414
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,838
public faces of companies as they could

1415
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,039
be i mean

1416
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:47,199
to be honest like not to throw shade

1417
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,400
but i will it's like mark zuckerberg is

1418
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:51,598
an example of that

1419
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,280
uh jack dorsey's also a bit of an

1420
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,119
example that i like jack a lot

1421
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,200
i've talked to him a lot i will talk to

1422
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,119
him more i think he's a

1423
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:04,159
much more amazing person then he conveys

1424
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,400
through his public presentation

1425
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,318
i think a lot of that has to do with pr

1426
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,838
and marketing people having an effect

1427
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,519
listen it's difficult i think it's

1428
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,679
really difficult it's probably many of

1429
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,880
the same difficulties you will face

1430
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:19,199
is the pressures but it's

1431
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,119
it's hard to know what to do but i think

1432
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,480
as much as possible as an individual you

1433
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,599
should try to be honest

1434
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,480
in the face of the world

1435
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,760
and the company that wants you to be

1436
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,159
more polished

1437
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,200
and that being more polished turns into

1438
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,118
a politician

1439
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,879
and politician eventually turns into

1440
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,480
being dishonest

1441
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,240
dishonest with the world and dishonest

1442
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,639
with yourself something i noticed which

1443
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,639
was

1444
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,759
the people of the people you mentioned

1445
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,000
those things have had

1446
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,119
ramifications in terms of letting things

1447
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,480
go too far

1448
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,720
get out of hand and you wonder like

1449
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,920
it's an aspect of lying right you say

1450
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:56,000
one lie

1451
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,599
goes to another lie you push it down

1452
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,800
does it doesn't matter you can talk

1453
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,838
it figure it out later you can figure

1454
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,519
out later pretty soon

1455
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,039
you've stuck a pretty big hole and i

1456
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:08,000
think if we look at twitter

1457
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,599
and we look at facebook i think it goes

1458
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
without saying what sorts of holes have

1459
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,720
been

1460
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,318
dug because of perhaps because of a lack

1461
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:15,279
of honesty that goes all the way up to

1462
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:17,440
the leaders

1463
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,400
so yeah there's two problems within the

1464
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,240
company

1465
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,000
it it doesn't make you as effective of

1466
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,959
an a leader i think

1467
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,719
that's one and two for social media

1468
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,960
companies

1469
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,719
i think people need to trust like it

1470
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,679
doesn't have to be the ceo but it has to

1471
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:33,838
be one

1472
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,440
like this is how humans work we want to

1473
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:38,799
look to somebody

1474
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,119
where like i trust you

1475
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,240
if you're going to use this social media

1476
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,519
platform

1477
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:47,358
i think you have to trust the set of

1478
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:47,838
individuals working at the top of that

1479
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:49,759
social

1480
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,679
uh social person something i realized

1481
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,160
really quickly one of the lessons

1482
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:55,919
throughout the startup was that people

1483
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:57,358
don't totally connect to

1484
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,119
products as much as they connect to

1485
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:02,558
people yeah and

1486
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,880
beautifully but i mean i i don't know if

1487
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,079
you've

1488
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,519
how much you've spent on librex you've

1489
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,000
only been here the last couple weeks

1490
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,679
like

1491
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,719
last week but i mean i love the product

1492
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,159
and one of the

1493
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:13,838
one of the aspects of me loving the

1494
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:15,440
product is that i was super active and

1495
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:18,318
i've been super active

1496
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,920
throughout the entire time and the

1497
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,199
amount of support i've received has made

1498
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,280
that very easy to do

1499
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,639
yeah um from the community and the fact

1500
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,000
that i could

1501
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,879
i mean so i came to boston for this

1502
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,440
interview right yeah i came to boston

1503
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,240
i got off the train yeah it's around 5

1504
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,280
30 p.m

1505
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:36,799
i checked librex someone is writing hey

1506
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,200
i'm in boston does anyone want to get

1507
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,039
dinner

1508
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:41,118
yeah 30 minutes later i'm getting dinner

1509
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:44,400
with them that's amazing and

1510
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:47,119
i mean it's incredible first of all

1511
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,880
as an entrepreneur the amount of stuff i

1512
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,358
learned from these people

1513
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,640
and when they reiterate and i hear that

1514
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:53,838
they got the message

1515
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,480
through the product i mean that's

1516
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:58,239
incredibly validating but also

1517
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,679
i mean i think it's just important to be

1518
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,118
able to put a face to

1519
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,960
a brand and especially a brand that's

1520
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,358
built on trust

1521
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,480
because fundamentally the users are

1522
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,519
trusting us with some

1523
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,559
really important discussions and some

1524
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:14,239
really um and a movement to some degree

1525
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,079
it's a community and a movement i'll

1526
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,118
tell you actually why i didn't use the

1527
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,160
app very much

1528
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,920
uh so far is uh

1529
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,078
there's something really powerful about

1530
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,838
the way it's constructed which

1531
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,280
i felt like a bit of an outside because

1532
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:29,599
i don't know

1533
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,519
the communities it felt like it's like

1534
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,559
it's a really strong community around

1535
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:37,119
each of these places yeah and

1536
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,280
so i felt like i was it made me really

1537
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,039
wish there was an mit one

1538
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,480
and so there's both discussions about

1539
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,199
the deep like

1540
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,559
community issues within colombia or yale

1541
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:50,639
or so on

1542
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:52,720
dartmouth and there's also the broader

1543
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,480
community of the ivy leagues that people

1544
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,879
are discussing but i could see that

1545
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,199
actually

1546
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,599
expanding more and more and more but

1547
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:02,000
which is it's a powerful coupling

1548
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,440
which is the feeling of like this little

1549
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,639
village this little community we're

1550
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,358
building together

1551
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,318
but also the broader issues yeah so you

1552
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:10,318
could do both

1553
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:11,679
discussions one thing that was important

1554
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,318
to me is

1555
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:16,399
talking about social media as a concept

1556
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,880
right

1557
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,880
i think the way people socialize is very

1558
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,440
much context dependent

1559
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,400
so we're talking about people

1560
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,440
understanding each other

1561
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,720
through language through english yes and

1562
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:34,240
these languages are constructed

1563
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:37,679
very in a very nuanced way in a very

1564
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:39,439
sort of temperamental way right and

1565
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:41,919
you kind of need a similar context to be

1566
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,838
able to have productive conversations

1567
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,680
so to me it's really important that

1568
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,759
these these groups

1569
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,440
they share people something in common a

1570
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,240
really big lived experience the ivy

1571
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,800
league

1572
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,318
or their school community and they have

1573
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,920
a similar vocabulary they have a similar

1574
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:57,039
background they know what's happening in

1575
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,639
their community

1576
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,400
and so having social media that is

1577
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:02,960
community connected to me was

1578
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,680
fundamental like you talk about

1579
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,000
anonymity

1580
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:08,318
to me community is the is the thing that

1581
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,920
when i think about librex i think

1582
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,838
what makes it different it's the fact

1583
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,760
that everyone

1584
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,199
everyone knows what's going on everyone

1585
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,480
comes from a similar context and people

1586
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:18,799
can socialize

1587
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,318
in a way where they're they understand

1588
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,000
each other because they're

1589
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:23,279
been through use the word lift

1590
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,760
experience i've been through so many of

1591
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,839
the sim

1592
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,440
same lived experiences uh one like

1593
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:31,199
clarification

1594
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,760
is there an easy way if you choose

1595
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,519
to then connect and meet space in

1596
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,880
physical space

1597
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:41,440
so the i guess the sort of magic of it

1598
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,039
and i was talking to a bunch of harvard

1599
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,159
leapfrogsters who i met off the app

1600
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,318
while i was in boston

1601
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,838
and um every time they told me this is

1602
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:49,199
the my favorite part of the app this is

1603
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,799
what i love about the app

1604
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:52,558
we have this matching system which is an

1605
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,240
anonymous direct message that you can

1606
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,680
send to any poster

1607
00:51:54,239 --> 00:52:00,639
so like i was talking to this guy

1608
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,679
who um he was really into coin

1609
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,239
collection

1610
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,519
and he met other people who were really

1611
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:06,799
into coin collection through a post and

1612
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,599
what they he would make a post about

1613
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,039
coin collection um and then someone

1614
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,318
would come to him and they'd be like and

1615
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:13,358
they they could direct message him

1616
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:15,039
anonymously

1617
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:16,799
and it would just show them that his he

1618
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:19,039
would just show him their school

1619
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,800
and then they could just text chat

1620
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,838
totally anonymously direct message if he

1621
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,519
accepted the

1622
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,358
anonymous request do they see the

1623
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,519
usernames right um there are no

1624
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:30,318
usernames on librex

1625
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:33,119
it's all just schools names so he made

1626
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:35,358
this post about coin collection

1627
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,880
and he got a direct message yeah i guess

1628
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:39,519
so right

1629
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,880
i didn't know he's because i was just

1630
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,599
looking at the text

1631
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,519
yeah that's interesting that's right and

1632
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,838
i can tell you i can go into why

1633
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:49,599
um that's really interesting yeah i can

1634
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:52,000
go into it truly is anonymous

1635
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,440
it's well i mean but you're not by

1636
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,480
anonymous exactly

1637
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,280
very different kind of anonymous and the

1638
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,199
reason

1639
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,880
the reason that we made that decision

1640
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,318
yeah it's because we want people to

1641
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,079
connect to ideas

1642
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,159
we want people to connect to things in

1643
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,400
the moment we don't want people to go

1644
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:09,279
oh i know this guy he said this other

1645
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,559
thing

1646
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,720
and we didn't want people to feel like

1647
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,240
they were at risk of being doxed so

1648
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:15,838
it's these are small communities right

1649
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:16,799
yeah we talked about this everyone knows

1650
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,239
someone who knows you

1651
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,559
yeah and um in 2021 it

1652
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:23,679
would not take much to be able to figure

1653
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,720
out who someone might be

1654
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:28,879
just through a couple of posts um so

1655
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:31,759
it's both safety and about the ideas

1656
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,119
in terms of not adding usernames anyway

1657
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,599
we have this anonymous direct message

1658
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,200
system

1659
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,519
where you can direct message the

1660
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:40,960
original poster of any post the op

1661
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:42,639
if you're a redditer of any post and

1662
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,800
you that that makes it really easy to

1663
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:46,719
meet up because once you guys are

1664
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,480
one-on-one you can exchange a number you

1665
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:51,759
can exchange a snapchat

1666
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,440
you can exchange a email probably not

1667
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,520
very often but you could

1668
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,559
and then that's how people meet up

1669
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:58,079
matching

1670
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,920
and then a lot of people connect in this

1671
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,079
way uh let me let me just

1672
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,838
take a small step into the technical i

1673
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,440
read somewhere enough it's true

1674
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,759
that uh one of the reasons you were

1675
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,720
rejected from ycy combinator

1676
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,839
in the final rounds is because one of

1677
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:14,959
the principles

1678
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:17,679
is to refuse to sell user data

1679
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,039
uh can you speak to that what's uh what

1680
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:20,960
why

1681
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:22,318
do you think it's important not to sell

1682
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,079
user data

1683
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:28,960
and sort of which draws a clear

1684
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,680
contrast between other basically any

1685
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,639
other service on the internet

1686
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,279
i mean to be honest it's quite simple i

1687
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:37,039
mean

1688
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,798
we talk about this platform people are

1689
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:40,400
talking about their most

1690
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,318
intimate secrets their political

1691
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,798
opinions you know what how

1692
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,920
how are they feeling about what's going

1693
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:48,559
on in their city

1694
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,240
you know during the summer um how how

1695
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,920
are they feeling about

1696
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:57,279
um the the political cycle and also

1697
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,358
their mental health their relationships

1698
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,200
these are some of the like most intimate

1699
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:03,920
thoughts that people were having

1700
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,199
point blank i don't think it was ethical

1701
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,838
to

1702
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,879
pawn them off for a profit i didn't

1703
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:10,400
think it was

1704
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,000
moral i don't think i could sleep at

1705
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,039
night if that was what i was doing is

1706
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,798
turning these people's

1707
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:20,318
most intimate beliefs and secrets into

1708
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:23,358
a currency that i bought and sold

1709
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:25,759
there's something very off about that

1710
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,519
i tend to believe that there is uh some

1711
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,359
room

1712
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,519
so like like facebook would just take

1713
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:34,078
that data and sell it right

1714
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:35,440
but there's some room in transparency

1715
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:38,240
giving people the choice

1716
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,000
on which parts they can i wouldn't even

1717
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,318
see it as sell

1718
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,679
but like share with advertisers are you

1719
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:45,838
going to give them a profit

1720
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,199
um so right you have to monetize you

1721
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:49,039
have to create an entire system you have

1722
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:52,078
to rethink this whole

1723
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:54,480
thing right but if as long as you

1724
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,519
give people control and are transparent

1725
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,880
and make it easy

1726
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,639
like i think it's really difficult to

1727
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,680
delete a facebook account or like delete

1728
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:03,279
all your data

1729
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:06,159
or deduct it's very difficult

1730
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,760
so like just make it easy and trust in

1731
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,279
that if you create a great product

1732
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,359
people are not going to do it

1733
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,640
and if if they do it then they're not

1734
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:14,400
actually something

1735
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:16,480
a deep loving member of the community

1736
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,760
what's that

1737
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,440
so we very quickly realized that user

1738
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,760
privacy was something that

1739
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,760
um was not only a core value but was

1740
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,240
something that users really cared about

1741
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,240
and we added we added this functionality

1742
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:32,798
it's just a button that says forget me

1743
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:33,598
yeah um you press it yeah like two

1744
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:35,920
clicks

1745
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,599
um it's not that hard we just remove

1746
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,039
your email from the database

1747
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:44,079
um yeah you're good beautiful

1748
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:47,199
i think facebook should have that

1749
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:49,760
i i honestly so call me crazy but

1750
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:51,519
maybe you can actually speak to this but

1751
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,599
i don't think facebook

1752
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:56,480
well now they would but if they did it

1753
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:59,359
earlier they would lose that much money

1754
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,599
if they allow like transparently tell

1755
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:05,039
people you could just delete everything

1756
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:07,200
they also explained that like in ways

1757
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:10,318
that's going to

1758
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:13,279
potentially like lessen your experience

1759
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:16,558
in the short term like i'll explain that

1760
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,559
but then there shouldn't be like

1761
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:19,759
multiple clicks of a button that don't

1762
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,639
make any sense

1763
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,760
uh i i'm uh trying to hold back from

1764
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,440
ranting about

1765
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,040
instagram because let me just say real

1766
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,639
quick because i've been locked out of

1767
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,960
instagram for a month

1768
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,719
uh and there's a whole group inside

1769
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,000
facebook they're like supporters

1770
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:38,239
of like lex helplex relax

1771
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,920
freelance uh i wasn't blocked it was

1772
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:41,358
just like a bug in the system somebody

1773
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,200
was hammering the api

1774
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,639
with my account and so they kept

1775
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:46,480
thinking i'm a bot

1776
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:47,920
anyway it's a bug it happens to a lot of

1777
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,358
people but like

1778
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,280
first of all i appreciate the love from

1779
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:52,400
all the amazing engineers on instagram

1780
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,798
or facebook

1781
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,400
love those folks the entire mechanism

1782
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:58,318
though is somehow broken

1783
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,240
i mean that i i put that on the

1784
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:02,719
leadership but it's also difficult to

1785
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,639
operate a large company wants the scales

1786
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:08,558
all those kinds of things but it should

1787
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:11,679
not be that difficult to do some basic

1788
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:15,519
basic things that you want to do

1789
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:19,358
which is in the case of facebook

1790
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:21,440
that's verify your identity to the app

1791
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:23,039
and also in the case of facebook in the

1792
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,559
case of librex

1793
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:28,480
like beco like disappear

1794
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,319
it if you if you choose there's

1795
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,960
downsides to disappearing

1796
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,400
but it should not be a difficult process

1797
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,720
and

1798
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,559
yeah i think i think people are waking

1799
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:39,838
up to that i think there's a lot of room

1800
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:43,440
for

1801
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:45,759
an app like librex with its

1802
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,519
the with with its foundational ideas to

1803
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,160
redefine what social media should look

1804
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:49,759
like

1805
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:51,838
you know and like you said i think

1806
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,799
beautifully anonymity is not the core

1807
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:56,000
value

1808
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:58,400
it's just the tool you use and

1809
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,159
who knows maybe anonymity will not

1810
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,920
always be the tool you use

1811
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:03,679
like if you give people the choice who

1812
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,358
knows what this evolves

1813
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:07,358
from the login page you initially

1814
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:08,078
created the key thing is the founding

1815
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:10,400
principles

1816
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,160
and again who knows if you give people a

1817
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,798
really nice way to monetize their data

1818
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:17,118
maybe they'll no longer be a thing that

1819
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,239
you say do not sell user data yeah all

1820
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,640
those kinds of things but

1821
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:21,439
the the basic principles should be there

1822
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,719
and

1823
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:28,159
also a good simple interface design

1824
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:30,639
um is goes it goes a really long way

1825
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,078
like simplicity and elegance which

1826
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:34,480
librex currently is

1827
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,240
clubhouse i'm a lot better by the way i

1828
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,760
don't i don't mean to uh

1829
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,838
i don't mean to go too deep into the

1830
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,119
history but the um it was bad

1831
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:43,199
it was i didn't look at the early

1832
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,119
pictures oh thank goodness

1833
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:46,639
i i read somewhere that it was like a

1834
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,599
white screen

1835
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:51,519
like with black like those html bases

1836
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:55,280
and download buttons were like these

1837
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:58,400
big these big freaking boxes and like

1838
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:02,079
i don't i i could go on but um it was my

1839
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:04,079
it was my genius design skills um

1840
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,000
i almost failed art class when i was

1841
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,519
like in first grade and i think uh i

1842
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,440
still have similar skills to

1843
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:10,639
my first grade self but it's gotten a

1844
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,639
lot better and thanks

1845
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,239
to a lot of my friends who have you know

1846
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,318
sort of chipped in here and there

1847
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:17,358
oh i love the idea of a button that just

1848
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:20,000
like forget me

1849
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,759
um yeah i don't know that's that's

1850
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,039
really moving actually

1851
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,680
that uh that's actually all people want

1852
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:28,159
is they they want i think okay i'll

1853
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:30,798
speak

1854
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:31,199
to my experience like i would give so

1855
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:34,079
much

1856
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,358
more uh if i could just like disappear

1857
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,760
if i needed to

1858
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:38,798
and i trusted the the community i

1859
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,599
trusted like

1860
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:43,440
the the founders and the principals

1861
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,960
that's really that's really powerful man

1862
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:50,000
like trust and ease of escape

1863
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,760
yeah uh you've also

1864
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,119
kind of mentioned moderation which is

1865
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,599
really interesting

1866
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,680
so with this anonymity and this

1867
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,798
community

1868
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:00,480
i don't know if you've heard of the

1869
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:01,199
internet but there's trolls on the

1870
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,318
internet

1871
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:07,838
so i've heard and uh even if they go to

1872
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:08,239
yale and dartmouth there's still people

1873
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:12,000
that

1874
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:15,919
probably enjoy uh the

1875
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,920
sort of being the the guerrilla warfare

1876
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,519
contra revolutionary and just like

1877
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,480
creating chaos

1878
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:23,039
in a place of uh love so how do you

1879
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,559
prevent

1880
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:28,239
chaos from and hatred uh breaking out in

1881
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,798
librex

1882
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:31,279
so the way i think about it is we have

1883
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:34,480
these

1884
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,880
principles um they're pretty simple and

1885
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,480
they're pretty easy to enforce and then

1886
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,240
beyond the principles we have

1887
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,599
a set of moderators moderate from every

1888
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:43,439
single ivy league school

1889
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,880
scheme of diverse moderators to enforce

1890
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,679
these principles but not only enforce

1891
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,760
the principles

1892
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:49,279
but kind of clue us in to what's

1893
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,280
happening in their community

1894
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,200
and how the real-life context of their

1895
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,640
community translates to the

1896
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:58,798
librex context of their community and

1897
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:59,679
beyond that we have conversation with

1898
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:02,480
them

1899
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,519
about the standards of the community and

1900
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,798
we're constantly

1901
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,639
talking about what needs to be further

1902
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:08,480
elucidated and what needs to be

1903
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,400
tweaked and we're in constant

1904
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,079
communication with the community

1905
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,920
now if you want me to get into the

1906
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,039
principles that underlie librex's

1907
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,639
moderation policy

1908
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,559
yeah please maybe you can explain that

1909
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,159
there's moderators what does that mean

1910
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,480
how are they chosen and what are the

1911
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:25,199
principles under which they operate

1912
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,880
sure so how are the moderators chosen

1913
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,598
the moderators are all volunteers

1914
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,000
they're lead brexiters who reach out to

1915
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,440
me

1916
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,358
and respond to the opportunity to

1917
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,280
become moderator and the way they're

1918
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:38,798
chosen um

1919
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,798
is basically we want to make sure that

1920
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:42,000
they're in tune with their community we

1921
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,280
want to make sure they come from diverse

1922
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,480
backgrounds and we want to make sure

1923
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,440
that they're

1924
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,000
they sort of understand what the

1925
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,519
community is about and then we

1926
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,358
ask them some questions about how they

1927
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:53,519
would deal with certain scenarios

1928
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,558
ones that we've had in the past and we

1929
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,599
feel strongly about

1930
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,200
and then also ones that are a little

1931
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,480
more murky where we want to see that

1932
01:02:57,199 --> 01:02:59,838
they're sort of thinking about these

1933
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,880
things in a critical way

1934
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:05,920
yeah um and from there we

1935
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,798
choose a set and uh they have the power

1936
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,599
to

1937
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,559
um take down posts of course everything

1938
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,359
at the end of the day

1939
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,280
pens my review but they can take them

1940
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:17,440
down and we can reinstate them if it's

1941
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,720
if it's a problem but they can take down

1942
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,480
posts and they can

1943
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:22,000
advocate for you know different

1944
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,599
moderation standards and different

1945
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,679
moderation policies

1946
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,240
so for now you're the lioness torvald of

1947
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:31,118
this community and

1948
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:33,519
so meaning like you're able to like

1949
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:36,640
people are actually able to like

1950
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:39,280
email you or like text you

1951
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:41,199
contact you and get a response like you

1952
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,440
respond to basically everybody

1953
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:44,318
and then you're you're like really you

1954
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,240
know

1955
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:47,599
you're you're living that live on

1956
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:50,719
people's floor life

1957
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:53,359
currently that's not necessarily this is

1958
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:55,598
the early days folks

1959
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:56,719
i knew right now he was a billionaire

1960
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,960
and he was cool

1961
01:03:56,719 --> 01:03:59,838
and then he was in a mansion uh making

1962
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,440
uh meets

1963
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:03,440
on his barbecue no okay

1964
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,960
but you know how does it scale um like

1965
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,959
what

1966
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:12,798
i suppose how does the scale is the

1967
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,200
question i mean

1968
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:16,318
with linus uh i don't know if you're

1969
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:18,239
familiar with the linux

1970
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:19,759
open source community but he still

1971
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:21,598
stayed at the top for a while it was

1972
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,039
really important like leadership there

1973
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,440
was really important to drive

1974
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,039
that large scale really productive open

1975
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,119
source community

1976
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,400
what do you see your your role as

1977
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:33,440
libraries grows

1978
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,838
and in general what are the mechanisms

1979
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,240
of scaling here for moderation

1980
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,519
so i see it open discourse is

1981
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:42,959
fundamental to

1982
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:45,358
the purpose of the app right so as the

1983
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,119
i guess you could say founder ceo what

1984
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:50,318
have you

1985
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:51,039
part of my purpose has to be to enforce

1986
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:52,719
the

1987
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,720
vision right and part of the vision is

1988
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:57,679
open discourse and that does come down

1989
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,639
in part to reasonable moderation and

1990
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:01,199
community-guided

1991
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,960
reasonable moderation so i imagine that

1992
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:05,679
will always be something that i'm

1993
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,000
intimately involved with to some degree

1994
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:08,960
now

1995
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,079
the degree to which the way in which

1996
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,559
that

1997
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,599
manifests i imagine will have to change

1998
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,640
right

1999
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:19,119
um and hopefully i'll be able to

2000
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,400
just like you can hire a cto hopefully

2001
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,559
i'll be able to be

2002
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,318
in integrated and hiring people who are

2003
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:27,200
who understand

2004
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:28,159
the the way that we are sort of

2005
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:30,239
operating and the

2006
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:31,759
and the reasonable standards of

2007
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:33,598
moderation and there can be a sort of

2008
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,240
hierarchical structure

2009
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,798
but i think when you have a product

2010
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,199
whose

2011
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:40,880
key purpose is to allow people to have

2012
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,239
these difficult conversations on campus

2013
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,559
that need to be had

2014
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,358
yeah i can never record to that yeah i

2015
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,319
can never

2016
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:50,400
fully i don't think i can fully ever

2017
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:51,838
abdicate that responsibility i think it

2018
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,680
that would be like

2019
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:55,358
i mean that would be like bezos

2020
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:57,358
abdicating e-commerce

2021
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:58,719
right right like that is that's part of

2022
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,558
the job

2023
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:02,000
yeah of course you can run companies in

2024
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,760
different ways i think that

2025
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,239
because he might have abdicated quite a

2026
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,720
bit of the details there hard for me to

2027
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:08,798
say

2028
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,159
because the amazon does so many things i

2029
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,239
think the probably the better examples

2030
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:14,798
like elon with rock is he's still

2031
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:16,318
at the core of the engineering he's at

2032
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:18,079
the core of the engineering there's

2033
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:20,159
some fundamental questions he probably

2034
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,880
does way too much of the engineering

2035
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:24,480
like he's like the lowest level detail

2036
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,640
but you're saying like the core

2037
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,240
things that are that make the app work

2038
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:29,519
is

2039
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:31,598
is the moderation of difficult

2040
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:34,000
conversations and by the way

2041
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,880
i'm 21 years old let's remind us

2042
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
everyone of that

2043
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:40,880
um if this thing

2044
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,239
does scale and if this thing continues

2045
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,119
to be a positive force in

2046
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:47,118
a lot of people's lives who knows what

2047
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,920
what will happen in the next what i'll

2048
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,079
learn

2049
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,159
um i'm still growing definitely as a

2050
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:55,119
leader still growing as a thinker

2051
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:56,639
still growing as a person i don't i

2052
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:00,079
can't pretend that i know

2053
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:02,078
how to run a business that is worth

2054
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,599
you know up ten billion dollars whatever

2055
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,039
yeah i can't pretend i know how to run a

2056
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,400
business that's you know going to have

2057
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,160
millions and millions of users

2058
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,559
i expect that there are going to be a

2059
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:12,318
lot of amazing people who will teach me

2060
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,680
and a lot of people who have already

2061
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:16,960
kind of stepped into my life

2062
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,879
and helped me out and taught me things

2063
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,880
and i imagine that i'll learn so much

2064
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,160
more i just know that

2065
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,559
moderation is always going to be

2066
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,798
important to me because i don't think

2067
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,960
librex is librex unless we have open

2068
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:32,880
discourse and moderation

2069
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:35,920
reasonable open light touch moderation

2070
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,760
is at the heart of creating that right

2071
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,680
so as a creator of this kind of

2072
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,720
community in place with anonymity and

2073
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:45,838
difficult conversations what

2074
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,439
what do you think about this touchy

2075
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:49,358
three words that people have been

2076
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,200
tossing around and politicizing i would

2077
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:52,798
say but as at the core of the founding

2078
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:54,798
of this country which is the freedom of

2079
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:56,798
speech

2080
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:58,079
how do you think about the freedom of

2081
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:00,000
speech

2082
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,519
this particular kind of freedom of

2083
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,358
expression

2084
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:04,559
and uh do you think it's a fundamental

2085
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:06,798
human right

2086
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,640
how do you define it to yourself when

2087
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:10,960
you when you're thinking about it

2088
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:12,480
i've i went down especially preparing

2089
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,880
for this conversation down the rabbit

2090
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,119
hole

2091
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,480
of like just how unclear it is

2092
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:20,399
philosophically what is meant by this

2093
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:24,479
kind of freedom

2094
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:26,399
uh it's not as easy as people think but

2095
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,759
it's interesting pragmatically speaking

2096
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:31,119
to hear what how you

2097
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:33,600
think about it in the context of librex

2098
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:34,559
yeah it's a tough one right there's a

2099
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,120
lot there

2100
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:39,039
so i come from the background of being a

2101
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:40,719
math major

2102
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:43,600
maybe it's important to start with that

2103
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,719
yeah and i found myself um

2104
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,798
in the middle of this question of

2105
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:49,039
freedom of speech

2106
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:50,079
one of the wonderful things is that the

2107
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:53,519
library's community is

2108
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:54,399
filled with phds and governance majors

2109
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,279
who have

2110
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,039
taught me a ton about this sort of thing

2111
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:02,480
and i'm still learning i'm still growing

2112
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:02,479
i'm still probably going to

2113
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,000
modify my perspective to some degree

2114
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:08,719
hopefully

2115
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,920
don't worry i imagine i'll always um

2116
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,198
support free discourse

2117
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,838
like learning yeah how to speak about

2118
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,278
stuff

2119
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:19,278
is is critical here because it's like

2120
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,440
i'm i'm learning that this is like a

2121
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:24,560
minefield of conversations

2122
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:26,238
because the moment you say like even

2123
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,239
saying freedom of speech is a

2124
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:30,718
complicated concept

2125
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:31,759
people will be like oh we spotted a

2126
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,000
communist

2127
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,520
yeah like they'll say there's nothing

2128
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,119
complicated about freedom freedom is

2129
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,000
freedom bro

2130
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:40,798
it's it it is complicated first of all

2131
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,319
if you talk about

2132
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:44,079
there's there's different definitions of

2133
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,600
freedom of speech uh if

2134
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:46,960
you if you want to go constitutional if

2135
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,960
you want to talk about the united states

2136
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:52,640
specifically and what's legal

2137
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:54,800
it's actually not as exciting and not as

2138
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,400
beautiful as people think of complicated

2139
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,360
it's complicated

2140
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:00,238
i think there's ideals behind it that we

2141
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:01,839
want to see

2142
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,799
what does that actually materialize

2143
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:07,119
itself in the digital world

2144
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,800
where we're trying to communicate in

2145
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:11,519
ways that

2146
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,400
allows for difficult conversations and

2147
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,280
also

2148
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:16,000
at the same time doesn't result in the

2149
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:19,198
silencing

2150
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,319
of voices not through

2151
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:25,839
like censorship but through like just

2152
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:28,559
[ __ ] being rude spam spam

2153
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,920
so it could be just bots racism uh

2154
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,560
racism

2155
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,960
going back to the name of the app librex

2156
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,239
yes

2157
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:39,439
libre free um x

2158
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:41,759
was support montu for free exchange

2159
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:43,439
and the free exchange of what my purpose

2160
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,480
was to create as many

2161
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:49,039
as much inner communication of ideas

2162
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:50,399
be them repugnant or otherwise as

2163
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:52,319
possible

2164
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:54,960
and of course to do that within legal

2165
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:57,359
bounds and to do that without

2166
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,198
causing anyone to be harassed or doxxed

2167
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:03,839
so to keep things focused on

2168
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:07,039
the ideas not the people and then

2169
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:10,319
no bs crap you know stuff

2170
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:11,039
and so to me the easiest way to moderate

2171
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:13,279
around that

2172
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:14,560
because as you said figuring out what is

2173
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:15,359
hateful and what is hate speech is

2174
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,520
really hard

2175
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:21,039
was to say no sweeping statements

2176
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,040
against core identity groups

2177
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:24,640
and that seems to work on the whole

2178
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,520
pretty well to be pretty light

2179
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,199
touch and hard to do though it's

2180
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,000
difficult we like to generalize

2181
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:32,960
with humans it's difficult but what it

2182
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
comes down to is

2183
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,399
be specific yeah um and when you think

2184
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,760
about

2185
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:39,439
what are sweeping statements against

2186
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,440
coordinating groups right

2187
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:42,799
oftentimes these are these are sort of

2188
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:43,279
hackneyed subjects these are things that

2189
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,159
have been

2190
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:47,359
broached and we've heard them before

2191
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:48,559
they don't really lead anywhere

2192
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:50,880
productive

2193
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,320
so we so it goes under this principle of

2194
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,760
be specific in the ideas you're

2195
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,158
discussing

2196
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,800
so even for like positive and humorous

2197
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:59,599
stuff

2198
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,440
you try to avoid generalizations against

2199
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,880
core identity core identity groups

2200
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:04,639
sorry what are core identity groups

2201
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:09,119
we're talking about you know

2202
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:12,719
race religion okay

2203
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:16,000
got it even positive stuff well against

2204
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:18,800
negative against sorry against against

2205
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,158
okay very very we've learned to be very

2206
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,880
specific

2207
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:23,279
very few words but the community gets it

2208
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,119
you know

2209
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:26,719
yeah they get it i mean this the thing

2210
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:29,840
they they um

2211
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:31,760
the the trouble with rules is uh

2212
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,920
as the community grows they'll figure

2213
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,360
out ways to manipulate the rules

2214
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,119
absolutely it's human nature it's

2215
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:39,679
creativity yeah

2216
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,119
something beautiful about it of course

2217
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,719
unlike and from an evolutionary

2218
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:43,439
perspective yes yeah the fact that

2219
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:46,239
people are

2220
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:48,158
so creative and so looking to and

2221
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:49,519
because people are genuinely interested

2222
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:51,679
in figuring out these things about

2223
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,600
social media and so they'll

2224
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:55,600
100 percent like see like where's the

2225
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,280
edge and i mean part of that's

2226
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,600
maintaining some level of vagueness in

2227
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:01,519
your role set yeah which has its own

2228
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,440
set of questions and something we could

2229
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,400
think about and i'm not implying i have

2230
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:05,279
all the answers

2231
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:06,719
but there is something really

2232
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,599
interesting about people being so

2233
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,600
engaged

2234
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,600
that they're looking to figure out where

2235
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,560
those edges and what does that mean

2236
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,360
what does that edge mean you know so one

2237
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,239
of the things i'm

2238
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:20,000
kind of thinking about like from an

2239
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:22,718
individual user of librex

2240
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,640
or an individual user of the internet i

2241
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:27,198
think about like that one person

2242
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:29,440
that is on reddit saying hateful stuff

2243
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:31,839
or positive stuff doesn't matter

2244
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:33,678
or funny stuff one of the things i think

2245
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,360
about is the trajectory of that

2246
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:39,279
individual through life

2247
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:40,639
and how uh social media can help that

2248
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:42,079
person become the best version of

2249
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,400
themselves

2250
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:46,000
i don't mean from like an orwellian

2251
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:48,559
sense like educate them

2252
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,920
properly or something i just mean like

2253
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,400
we're all i believe

2254
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,760
we're all fundamentally good and i also

2255
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:57,359
believe

2256
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:59,920
we all have the capacity to do

2257
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:01,198
to create some amazing stuff in this

2258
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,600
world

2259
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:05,119
whether that's ideas or art or

2260
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,840
engineering all those kinds of things

2261
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:09,039
just to be

2262
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,079
amazing people and i kind of think about

2263
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:11,519
like

2264
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:14,319
you know a lot of social media

2265
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:18,640
mechanisms bring out the worse than us

2266
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:22,238
and i try to think like in the long term

2267
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,719
how can as the social media or how can a

2268
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:24,959
website

2269
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,239
how cut to you that you create can make

2270
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,079
the best

2271
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:29,759
like you take a trajectory that makes

2272
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:31,439
you a better better and better and like

2273
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,840
the best version of yourself

2274
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:35,039
so i think about that because like you

2275
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,880
know twitter can

2276
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:39,119
really take you down some dark

2277
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,800
trajectories i've seen people just not

2278
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:42,399
being the best version of themselves

2279
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,840
forget the cancer culture and all that

2280
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:46,238
kind of stuff it's just like they're not

2281
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,840
developing intellectually

2282
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:50,559
in the way that's going to make the best

2283
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,319
version of themselves i think reddit

2284
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,320
i'm not sure what i think about ready

2285
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:56,479
yet because one

2286
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:58,000
positive side is all the [ __ ] posting i

2287
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:00,959
read it could be just like a

2288
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,439
release valve for for some stress in

2289
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,359
life

2290
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:05,599
and you almost have like a parallel life

2291
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:07,198
where you're in meat space

2292
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,960
you might be actually becoming

2293
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:10,559
successful and so on and growing and so

2294
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,239
on but you just need sometimes to be

2295
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:15,280
angry at somebody

2296
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:16,718
but i tend to not think that's possible

2297
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:19,519
i think

2298
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:21,119
if you're [ __ ] posting you're probably

2299
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,480
not spending your time

2300
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:25,679
the best way you could i don't know i am

2301
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:27,599
i'm torn on that

2302
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,239
but do you think about that with librex

2303
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,000
of creating a trajectory for the

2304
01:15:30,238 --> 01:15:33,759
for the yale for the dartmouth the

2305
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,479
students to where they grow

2306
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,600
intellectually one thing that i think

2307
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:39,919
about a lot

2308
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,360
is how do you incentivize positive

2309
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,359
content creation

2310
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:46,158
how do you incentivize well but yeah

2311
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:49,920
really intellectual content creation

2312
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:53,198
it's something that frankly you know

2313
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:56,239
i think about every single day and

2314
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:57,678
i think there are ways that

2315
01:15:56,238 --> 01:15:59,198
i mean one thing that's great about

2316
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,158
humans is that they can be incentivized

2317
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:01,759
right

2318
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:03,439
and i think there are ways that you can

2319
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,039
incentivize people to make the right

2320
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:07,359
kind of content

2321
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:08,479
if that's your goal do you think such

2322
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:11,279
mechanisms exist

2323
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,799
for such incentivization i do i don't

2324
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:14,559
want to let the cat out of the bag

2325
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,480
sure so to speak so you have already

2326
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,400
idea like concrete ideas in your mind

2327
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:19,678
and i have about three concrete ideas

2328
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:22,559
that i'm very very

2329
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:23,199
optimistic about yeah and you don't even

2330
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,600
need to share

2331
01:16:23,198 --> 01:16:26,960
them the the fact i understand totally

2332
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,400
but like the fact that you have them

2333
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,158
that's really good

2334
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:31,920
because i feel like sometimes the

2335
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:35,439
downfall of the

2336
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,600
social media is that there's literally

2337
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:39,000
not even a thinking or a discussion

2338
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:43,679
about the

2339
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:46,560
incentivization of positive long-term

2340
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,079
content creation i mean twitter i really

2341
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,480
was excited about this when they said

2342
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:52,399
like when jack has talked about like

2343
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:54,158
creating healthy conversations

2344
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,519
he does seem to care i've listened to

2345
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:57,519
him i mean

2346
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,719
he's very he has a very particular way

2347
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,239
of saying things

2348
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:01,679
but you get the impression that he's

2349
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:03,519
someone who actually cares about these

2350
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,679
things within the limits of his power

2351
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,040
yeah and that's the question the limits

2352
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:10,158
of the power

2353
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,600
librex is growing not just in the number

2354
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:16,479
of communities

2355
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:18,640
but also in the way you're incentivizing

2356
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,399
positive conversations like coupled with

2357
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,000
the moderation and so on so you think

2358
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:24,079
there's a lot of innovation to be had in

2359
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,640
that area there's a tremendous amount

2360
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:27,920
i think when you think about the reasons

2361
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:31,199
people post

2362
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,399
fundamentally people want to

2363
01:17:31,198 --> 01:17:34,319
make a positive impact on their

2364
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,479
community to some degree

2365
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:37,920
now there are always be bad actors and

2366
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:39,359
part of the benefit of

2367
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,199
sort of our moderation structure is that

2368
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:45,119
we can limit some of those bad actors

2369
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:47,279
you know no bot accounts no brigading

2370
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:48,719
at the same time the more you

2371
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:50,399
incentivize a certain type of behavior

2372
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:54,158
the better it's going to be

2373
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:57,679
and it's we don't see it as our role as

2374
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:59,599
the platform to force the communion

2375
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:01,039
in a direction and frankly i don't think

2376
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,760
it would be good for anyone the

2377
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:03,840
community

2378
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,800
or the conversations if we forced a

2379
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,199
specific type of

2380
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:09,199
conversations uh conversation we just

2381
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:10,799
need to make the tools to allow

2382
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:12,479
people to be good yeah and to

2383
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,079
incentivize good behavior yeah i believe

2384
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,839
that like if you

2385
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,479
you don't nee you will not need to

2386
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,880
censor if you allow people

2387
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:22,479
at scale to be good the good will

2388
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,400
overpower the [ __ ]

2389
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:27,198
that's that's my fundamental belief i

2390
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:29,920
i'm very optimistic about that

2391
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:31,439
but currently librex is small in the

2392
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,960
sense that it's just

2393
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:35,439
it's a small set of communities that i

2394
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:39,039
believe and you mentioned to me offline

2395
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:43,279
that by design you're scaling slowly

2396
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:44,238
carefully so how does librex scale is it

2397
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:47,039
possible

2398
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:48,559
you know facebook also started with a

2399
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,359
small set of communities

2400
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,080
that were schools and then now grew to

2401
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:54,960
be

2402
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:57,679
basically the if not one of the largest

2403
01:18:54,960 --> 01:19:00,239
social networks in the world

2404
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:02,000
do you see librex as potentially scaling

2405
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:05,279
to be

2406
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:08,238
beyond even college campuses uh but

2407
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:11,119
encompassing the whole world it's a it's

2408
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:13,759
a long timeline

2409
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:15,359
i'll say this let's get step back to

2410
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,600
like

2411
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:19,039
where did facebook go wrong because

2412
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,960
clearly they did a lot right

2413
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:24,800
and we can only we can only speculate

2414
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,239
about what the objectives were of the

2415
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,239
founders of facebook

2416
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:29,519
um you know i'm sure they've said some

2417
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,678
things but

2418
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,960
it's always interesting to know what the

2419
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,279
what the uh

2420
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,480
mythology is versus what the truth is of

2421
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:38,238
the matter

2422
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:39,519
so perhaps they and they've been very

2423
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:41,599
successful i mean

2424
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,840
they they've taken over the world to

2425
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,239
some extent

2426
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,360
at the same time the goals of librex are

2427
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:49,678
to create

2428
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:50,399
these positive communities and these

2429
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,880
open

2430
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:54,158
conversations where people can have real

2431
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,279
conversation and connection in their

2432
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:56,639
communities in a vulnerable and

2433
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,920
authentic way

2434
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:02,960
and so to that end which

2435
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,000
i imagine might be different than the

2436
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,319
goals of a facebook

2437
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,279
for example one thing that we want to do

2438
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:08,639
is keep things intimate and

2439
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:12,639
community-based

2440
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:14,480
so each school is its own community

2441
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,920
and perhaps you could have a slightly

2442
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:18,479
broader community

2443
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:20,239
maybe you could have a i know uh the

2444
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:22,319
california system is an obvious one

2445
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:24,879
pac-10 might be an obvious one

2446
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:26,880
and we can think about that um but

2447
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,960
fundamentally the unit

2448
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,079
the unit of community is your school or

2449
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,279
your school

2450
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:34,800
community so that that that's one

2451
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:35,920
difference that i think will help us the

2452
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,719
other thing is that

2453
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,079
we're scaling intentionally meaning that

2454
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,880
when we expand to a school

2455
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:44,800
we have moderators in place we have

2456
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,639
moderators who understand that school's

2457
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,600
environment in a very personal

2458
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:51,119
level and we're growing responsibly

2459
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,679
we're growing as we're ready

2460
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:54,399
both technologically but also socially

2461
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,560
you know

2462
01:20:54,399 --> 01:21:00,238
but as we think we have the tools to um

2463
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,600
preserve the community and to encourage

2464
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:04,718
the community to create this sort of

2465
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,560
content that we want them to create

2466
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:07,840
and you know there's a lot of ways to

2467
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,120
define communities so

2468
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,960
first of all there's geographic

2469
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:13,198
community as well uh

2470
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,319
but the way you're kind of defining

2471
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:17,839
community with yale

2472
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:19,840
and dartmouth is the email right

2473
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,440
that's what gives you there's a power to

2474
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:25,039
the email

2475
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:25,678
in the sense that that's how you can

2476
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:27,439
verify

2477
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,079
or efficiently verify yourself with

2478
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:33,439
being an a single individual

2479
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:35,519
in the university in that same way you

2480
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:38,079
can verify your

2481
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,639
employment at a company for example like

2482
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,079
google

2483
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:43,920
microsoft facebook do you see your

2484
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:45,920
uh potentially taking on those

2485
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:48,319
communities that'd be fascinating

2486
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,359
getting like anonymous community

2487
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:52,799
conversations

2488
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:54,839
inside google 100 crossed my mind

2489
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,400
to some extent this is this is something

2490
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,920
where

2491
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:00,319
i understand the college experience i

2492
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,399
understand the need got it and

2493
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:03,439
i've i've never i've never worked at

2494
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:06,319
google

2495
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:09,519
i don't know if they would hire me um

2496
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:12,719
hopefully maybe as a product manager

2497
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,080
uh i i think if there's a community that

2498
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,880
needs this product

2499
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:18,319
and has that and and has that will which

2500
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,279
i think

2501
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:22,799
especially as librex continues to grow

2502
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:24,719
and expand and change

2503
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,079
and learn and because that's what we're

2504
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,158
doing is we're learning right

2505
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:29,600
with each community it's not just about

2506
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:31,039
growing it's about

2507
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,120
learning from these from each of these

2508
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:36,000
communities and

2509
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:36,639
iterating um i think it's quite likely

2510
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,880
they're going to be

2511
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:41,920
all sorts of communities that could use

2512
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:45,119
this tool to improve their

2513
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,920
culture so to speak so forgive me i'm

2514
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:47,760
not actually

2515
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,279
like that knowledgeable about the

2516
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,199
history of attempts of

2517
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:54,000
building social networks to solve the

2518
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:56,719
problem the year solving

2519
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,238
but i was made aware that there was an

2520
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:00,000
app

2521
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:02,479
app or at least a social network called

2522
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,000
yik yak

2523
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:10,000
that was had a similar kind of

2524
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,880
um focus um i think the thing you've

2525
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,600
spoken about

2526
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,159
that differs between librex and yikayak

2527
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,800
is that

2528
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:17,839
yike was defined am i pronouncing it

2529
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,079
right even

2530
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,840
uh you're good yeah i'm good i met the

2531
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:25,039
founder so i can confirm

2532
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,960
you can confirm cool uh

2533
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:29,039
the that it was constrained to a

2534
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:32,880
geographical area versus like

2535
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:35,198
to the actual community um and that

2536
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,159
and that somehow had fundamental like

2537
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:37,839
actual

2538
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:39,279
differences in social dynamics that

2539
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,360
resulted but

2540
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:43,840
can you speak to the history of yik yak

2541
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:45,519
like how does lee breaks differ

2542
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,279
what lessons have you learned from that

2543
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,880
oh and i should say that i guess there

2544
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:50,238
was controversial

2545
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,760
i don't know i didn't look at the

2546
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:53,359
details but i'm guessing there's a bunch

2547
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,039
of racism and hate speech and all that

2548
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:59,359
kind of stuff that emerges there was

2549
01:23:55,039 --> 01:24:01,840
on you okay so that's an example of like

2550
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:03,599
okay here's how it goes wrong when you

2551
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,800
have anonymity

2552
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:09,039
on college campuses so how does zebrax

2553
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,880
going to do better

2554
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:12,079
yeah you guys got a lot of problems

2555
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,679
content problems but the content

2556
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:16,479
problems go deeper than

2557
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,920
maybe what the press would reveal

2558
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:20,879
there's a lot to say and

2559
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:22,239
part of it is parsing exactly what to

2560
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,000
talk about when it comes to you get

2561
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:25,359
and when you talk about startups i mean

2562
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,760
you know this i i

2563
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:29,198
you know startups um and you look at the

2564
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:32,079
postmortem it's almost

2565
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:33,198
never what people think it is and and

2566
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:35,920
oftentimes these things are

2567
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:37,359
somewhat unknowable and the the degree

2568
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,039
to which people

2569
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:40,479
seeking confirmation bias to something

2570
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:42,479
seeking closure yes

2571
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:43,759
look to find a singular attribute that

2572
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:45,599
caused the failure

2573
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,199
it feels like the little details often

2574
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:50,400
make all the difference

2575
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:51,599
yes and i think i think the details are

2576
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:54,479
so little that as humans

2577
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,360
we are not capable of parsing even what

2578
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:56,959
they are

2579
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:58,559
but i'll tell you i'll tell you my

2580
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,399
perspective on it

2581
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,159
um knowing that i'm also a human with

2582
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:04,479
biases um

2583
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:05,759
in this particular case very significant

2584
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:10,079
biases yeah

2585
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:12,719
um i um so i started building librex

2586
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,519
for its own merits i i i i at first i

2587
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,679
wasn't aware of

2588
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,360
yik but as i started to talk to people

2589
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:20,079
about this platform i was building

2590
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,519
i i was made aware of the cac and i

2591
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:24,840
built it from day one

2592
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,719
with a lot of the issues you get had in

2593
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,319
mind the

2594
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:31,119
so as you said the one difference

2595
01:25:28,319 --> 01:25:33,679
between yak is the geographical versus

2596
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:34,960
community based aspect going along with

2597
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,639
that

2598
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,239
one thing i realized by researching

2599
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:41,440
social media sites is that

2600
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:44,158
the majority of the negative content the

2601
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:44,158
content that's

2602
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:47,840
terrible and breaking all the rules is

2603
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,400
created by

2604
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,360
really and the people who are not

2605
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:54,079
reformable

2606
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:55,198
so to speak the people who are not

2607
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:58,960
showing the best part of

2608
01:25:55,198 --> 01:26:01,439
the human yeah experience yeah um

2609
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,158
it's a really small minority right yeah

2610
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:03,919
i remember

2611
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:05,519
i was listening to the founder of 4chan

2612
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:10,079
moot talk about this how like

2613
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:13,199
one guy was able to basically destroy

2614
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:14,880
like large swaths of his community

2615
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:17,279
yeah that's part of what makes it

2616
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:19,760
exciting for that minority

2617
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:22,079
is how much power they can have so if

2618
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,639
you're predisposed to think in this way

2619
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:26,479
it's exciting that you can walk into

2620
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:29,440
like i mentioned the party before you

2621
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:33,678
have a party of a lot of positive people

2622
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:36,158
and it feels especially if you

2623
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:39,679
don't have much power in this world it

2624
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:42,879
feels exceptionally empowering

2625
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:45,840
to to uh to destroy

2626
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,960
like the lives of many yeah and if you

2627
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:50,079
think this way

2628
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,158
it's a problem but i i i i'm hopeful

2629
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:54,559
that you're right that in most cases

2630
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:55,920
it's going to be a minority of people

2631
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,679
i think it is and that's what the

2632
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,800
research has showed

2633
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:04,000
and one really powerful thing is that

2634
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,920
we can really actively control who comes

2635
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,880
in and out of our community based on the

2636
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,560
edu verification and we can also control

2637
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,319
who's not in our community because we

2638
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,639
have that lever where each account is

2639
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:16,960
associated with it.edu

2640
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:18,159
um so that's the first point i would put

2641
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,880
out point out there

2642
01:27:18,158 --> 01:27:21,839
second point is controlled expansion

2643
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,560
meaning that

2644
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,639
we have community moderation we have

2645
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,920
this panel that allows the moderators to

2646
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,639
see all of the

2647
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,719
highly downvoted content all of the

2648
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:33,679
reported content all the flagged content

2649
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,760
and look through it

2650
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,760
and decide what they like and what's

2651
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:41,119
appropriate and what's not appropriate

2652
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:42,800
and we have um we ping every moderator

2653
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:45,840
when there's a report so things are

2654
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,520
taken down pretty quickly and we have

2655
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,119
our standards and we have

2656
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,639
i think above all of that we have a

2657
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:53,439
mission and

2658
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:54,800
it's a community-based mission yuk was

2659
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:56,399
more of a fun app and

2660
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,560
by its own admission it was a place

2661
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:01,920
where people could enjoy themselves and

2662
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:04,719
could sort of yak yeah yeah

2663
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,920
yeah you know chit chat um we have a we

2664
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:08,560
have a bigger purpose than that

2665
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,239
frankly and i think i think that shows

2666
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,120
and the people who self-select to be on

2667
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:12,959
that app

2668
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,519
to be on librex and to be on yak

2669
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:18,560
respectively the last thing i'll say is

2670
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:20,239
yuk yak was very few characters it was a

2671
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,320
twitter-esque platform

2672
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:23,519
and that doesn't allow for a tremendous

2673
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:25,599
amount of nuance it doesn't allow for a

2674
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:28,719
tremendous amount of conversation

2675
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,520
um librex is much more long form and so

2676
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:32,560
the kind of

2677
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,760
um posts that you'll get on librex are

2678
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:36,320
can spam pages

2679
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,800
they're like what people are starting to

2680
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:39,119
realize

2681
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:41,199
is that they can reach a lot more people

2682
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:44,960
at a lot more pertinent of a time

2683
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:46,559
a lot more quickly by posting their

2684
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,319
thoughts on librex than if they went to

2685
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,880
their school newspaper

2686
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:52,319
and i think the school newspapers might

2687
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,760
be a little worried about that but more

2688
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:54,399
importantly we're connecting people in

2689
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,119
this way we're

2690
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:58,319
long-form communication with nuance that

2691
01:28:57,119 --> 01:28:59,439
takes into account everything that's

2692
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:03,119
happening in the community

2693
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:05,599
temporally is really

2694
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:06,479
available at librex and you know not

2695
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,520
really

2696
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:11,198
communicable in 240 or 480 or whatever

2697
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,320
the number of characters

2698
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:15,678
the acts were um bound to and then you

2699
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:18,479
know i could talk about the history of

2700
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:18,960
the act if you want me to go further um

2701
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:21,599
they

2702
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,239
started i think they were at 12 schools

2703
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,960
and then

2704
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:25,519
spring break it people told their

2705
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,760
friends

2706
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,639
look at this app a thousand schools

2707
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,320
signed up and

2708
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:31,760
were had active communities they had a

2709
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:33,279
problem on their hands i see and then

2710
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,280
the high schools come on board

2711
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:37,119
yeah i think a lot of the things you

2712
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:39,519
said uh ring true to me

2713
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:41,920
but especially the vision one which i do

2714
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:44,320
think uh having a vision

2715
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,920
in the leadership having a mission makes

2716
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:48,158
all the difference in the world

2717
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,440
now that that's both for the engineers

2718
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:51,119
that are building

2719
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:52,799
like the team that's building the app

2720
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:55,519
the moderation and

2721
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,360
users because they kind of the mission

2722
01:29:55,520 --> 01:30:01,120
carries itself

2723
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:04,479
uh through the behavior of the

2724
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:04,479
of the people on the social network

2725
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,159
as a small tangent let me ask you

2726
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:10,238
something about um

2727
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:11,759
parlor but it's less about parlor more

2728
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:14,799
about aws

2729
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:17,039
so aws removed parlor from his platform

2730
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,639
you know for whatever reasons doesn't

2731
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:22,479
really matter but the fact that

2732
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:26,480
aws would do this was really

2733
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:28,718
really bothered me personally because

2734
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:30,079
i saw aws as the computing

2735
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:32,800
infrastructure

2736
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:35,198
and i always thought that part could not

2737
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,880
put a finger on its scale

2738
01:30:35,198 --> 01:30:38,719
and i don't know what your thoughts are

2739
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,039
like were you bothered by

2740
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:42,000
parlor being removed from aws and how

2741
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:44,479
does that

2742
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,639
affect how you think about the computing

2743
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:49,839
infrastructure on which

2744
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:50,639
librex is based i was bothered not so

2745
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,480
much by

2746
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:54,319
parlor specifically being taken out of

2747
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:57,359
aws but more

2748
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:58,719
the fact that something that's like a

2749
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:00,639
highway

2750
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,158
something that people rely on that

2751
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:03,920
people build on top of

2752
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:06,238
that people assume is going to be

2753
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:09,920
somewhat position agnostic

2754
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:12,158
like a road that people drive on is

2755
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,679
is becoming ideologically sort of

2756
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:16,559
discriminatory

2757
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:18,480
i just and of course mind you amazon can

2758
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,760
do what it wants it's a private company

2759
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:22,158
and i support the rights of private

2760
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:25,280
companies i just on an ethical

2761
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:28,799
and sort of a deep moral level i

2762
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:31,039
wonder like at what point

2763
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,239
should a company sort of be agnostic in

2764
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:35,359
that in that regard

2765
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:36,718
and let developers build on top of their

2766
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:38,399
infrastructure

2767
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,158
and where to where where does that

2768
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:43,439
responsibility hold

2769
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:44,479
yes it makes you uh hope that there's

2770
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:46,638
going to be

2771
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:48,799
from a capitalistic sense competitors to

2772
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:50,480
aws would say like we're not going to

2773
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,880
put our finger on the scale

2774
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:53,919
i mean on the highway is a good sort of

2775
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,159
example

2776
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,960
it's like if a privately owned highway

2777
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:59,679
exactly

2778
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:01,520
said uh you know we're no longer going

2779
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:03,199
to allow

2780
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,639
we're only going to allow electric

2781
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:06,559
vehicles

2782
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:08,079
and a bunch of people in this world

2783
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,960
would be like yes because

2784
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:13,600
electric is good for the environment and

2785
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:16,639
uh

2786
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,480
you know yes but then

2787
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,079
you have to consider the like the

2788
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,079
slippery slope nature of it

2789
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:23,760
but also like the the negative impact on

2790
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,679
the lives of many others

2791
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,880
and what that means for innovation and

2792
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:28,880
for like uh

2793
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:31,119
competition again in a capitalistic

2794
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:34,079
sense so there's some nature

2795
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:35,198
there's some level to this hierarchy of

2796
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:39,039
our existence

2797
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:40,799
that we should not allow to manipulate

2798
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:42,079
what's built on top of it it should be

2799
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,119
truly infrastructure

2800
01:32:42,079 --> 01:32:48,399
and it feels like compute is uh

2801
01:32:45,119 --> 01:32:50,960
storage and compute is the that layer

2802
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:52,799
like it shouldn't be messed with um i

2803
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,639
haven't seen anybody really complain

2804
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,400
about it like in terms of government

2805
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:58,319
and i'm not even sure government is the

2806
01:32:56,399 --> 01:32:59,599
right mechanism through policy and

2807
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:02,559
regulation to step

2808
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,920
in because again they do a messy job of

2809
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,960
fixing things

2810
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,520
but i do hope there's competitors to aws

2811
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,319
to make

2812
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,920
aws and step up because i do think you

2813
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:14,880
know i'm a fan of aws

2814
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:15,760
except this service it's a good service

2815
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:18,639
until this

2816
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:20,400
until yeah until they rip out the the

2817
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:22,079
rug

2818
01:33:20,399 --> 01:33:24,158
and the point is it's not that

2819
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:27,920
necessarily their decision

2820
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:31,359
was a bad one with parlor in particular

2821
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:33,359
it's that like the the slippery slope

2822
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:36,158
nature of it but also

2823
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:38,000
the it takes the good actors that are

2824
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:39,198
creating amazing products and makes them

2825
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,719
more fearful

2826
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:42,879
and when you're more fearful it's the

2827
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:44,719
same reason that anonymity is a tool

2828
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,159
that you don't create the best thing you

2829
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,198
could possibly create when you're

2830
01:33:46,158 --> 01:33:50,479
fearful you don't

2831
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:52,559
create that's right i think we kind of

2832
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:54,718
talked about it a little bit

2833
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,920
but i wonder if we can kind of revisit

2834
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,399
it a little bit um

2835
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,199
i talked to a guy named ronald sullivan

2836
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:03,359
who's a

2837
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:05,198
faculty at harvard law professor he was

2838
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:07,439
on the legal defense team he was the

2839
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:10,158
lawyer for harvey weinstein

2840
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:10,960
and aaron uh hernandez for the double

2841
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:12,638
murder case

2842
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,600
so he takes on these really difficult

2843
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:17,520
cases of on unpopular figures

2844
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,120
because he believes like that's the way

2845
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:22,560
you test

2846
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:25,519
that we believe in the rule of law but

2847
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:27,120
he was uh there's a big protest in

2848
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:30,239
harvard

2849
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:31,119
to get him uh to basically censor him

2850
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:34,079
and

2851
01:34:31,119 --> 01:34:35,279
to get him to no longer be faculty dean

2852
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:38,000
all those kinds of things

2853
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:39,679
and uh it was by a minority of students

2854
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,079
but

2855
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:43,279
it was a huge blow back obviously in the

2856
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:45,920
public but also

2857
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:47,599
inside harvard like that's not okay he

2858
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,199
stands for the very principles at the

2859
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,560
founding of harvard and at the

2860
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:52,000
principles of the founding of this

2861
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:56,159
country and the law and

2862
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:59,679
so on but the the basic argument is that

2863
01:34:56,158 --> 01:35:02,079
is was about safe spaces that

2864
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,960
it's unsafe to have somebody who is

2865
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:07,439
basically

2866
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:09,039
supporting harvey weinstein right

2867
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:10,719
what do you think about this whole idea

2868
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:14,158
of safe spaces

2869
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:15,439
uh on college campuses because it feels

2870
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:17,920
like

2871
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:21,678
the the mission of librex is pushing

2872
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:23,199
back against the idea of safe spaces

2873
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:25,039
i think safe spaces are fine when

2874
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:27,039
they're within people's private lives

2875
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:29,118
within their homes you know within their

2876
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:30,399
religious organizations

2877
01:35:29,118 --> 01:35:32,319
i think the problem becomes when the

2878
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:37,039
institution starts encouraging

2879
01:35:32,319 --> 01:35:42,000
or um backing safe spaces

2880
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:44,158
because what are people being safe from

2881
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,679
and oftentimes it seems like there's

2882
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:48,879
this idea that

2883
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:51,440
the harm that's being attempted to to be

2884
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:53,039
mitigated is the harm of confronting

2885
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:54,879
opinions you disagree with opinions you

2886
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:58,079
might find repugnant

2887
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,118
and if this is conflated with a need for

2888
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:01,198
safety

2889
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:04,158
then that's where the idea of liberal

2890
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:06,559
arts education sort of dies

2891
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:08,839
um of course it's complicated and we

2892
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:10,480
still want to have safe intellectual

2893
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,800
environments

2894
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:14,319
but the way that i hear the term safe

2895
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,480
space used today

2896
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:18,079
i think it doesn't really have a place

2897
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:21,359
within

2898
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:23,920
like the intellectual context yeah

2899
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:25,519
it's funny i mean this is why librex is

2900
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,359
really exciting is it's pushing those

2901
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,600
difficult conversations and i'd love to

2902
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:29,599
see

2903
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,520
ultimately there does seem to be an

2904
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:36,719
asymmetry of power

2905
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:38,000
that results in the concept of safe

2906
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:41,118
spaces and

2907
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,880
hate speech being redefined in a

2908
01:36:41,118 --> 01:36:44,639
slippery slope kind of way where it

2909
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,760
means basically anything you want it to

2910
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:48,960
mean

2911
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,840
and uh it basically is used to silence

2912
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,319
people

2913
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,360
to silence people they're like good

2914
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:56,479
thoughtful

2915
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:57,359
experts also beyond that i would say it

2916
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:59,519
has

2917
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:00,639
not just a pragmatic purpose which is

2918
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,480
the silencing

2919
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:04,719
but also sort of an ideological purpose

2920
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:05,359
which is a linguistic purpose which is

2921
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:08,800
to

2922
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:12,960
conflate words with unsafety

2923
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:15,279
and harm and violence which is what

2924
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,719
you kind of see on a cultural linguistic

2925
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:18,639
level is happening

2926
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,319
all around us right now is that this

2927
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:22,159
idea that words are harm

2928
01:37:20,319 --> 01:37:23,439
it's a very dangerous and slippery

2929
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:24,879
concept i mean

2930
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:26,638
it's not you don't have to slip that far

2931
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,880
to see why that's a problem

2932
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:30,159
once we start cr making words into

2933
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:31,520
violence and we start criminalizing

2934
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:33,839
words we get into

2935
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:36,080
some really authoritarian territory

2936
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:38,319
things that i think

2937
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:39,920
i mean myself and my background i don't

2938
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:40,479
know how much we have to go into it but

2939
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,399
uh

2940
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:45,198
things in my that my ancestors certainly

2941
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:45,198
would be worried about

2942
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:49,599
what's your background i'm a child of

2943
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:51,440
holocaust survivors and program

2944
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:54,320
survivors

2945
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:55,759
so yeah i mean me as well from different

2946
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:56,559
directions that come from the soviet

2947
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,920
union so

2948
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:02,159
there's uh well like in most of us

2949
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,079
hate and love runs through our blood

2950
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:06,158
from our history

2951
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,238
you mentioned mit is being added to

2952
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:09,519
librex has it already been added yes it

2953
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:12,879
was added um

2954
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:15,040
today today okay so let me ask this is

2955
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,319
exciting because um

2956
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:18,719
i don't know what your thoughts are

2957
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:20,158
about this but

2958
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:23,039
i'll tell you from my perspective if

2959
01:38:20,158 --> 01:38:25,679
you're a lot of mit folks listen to this

2960
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:27,519
i would love it if you join librex it'd

2961
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:31,039
be interesting to explore

2962
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:31,679
conversations on several topics inside

2963
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:35,118
mit

2964
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:35,118
but one of the most

2965
01:38:35,198 --> 01:38:40,399
moving that hasn't been discussed at all

2966
01:38:40,479 --> 01:38:44,879
except in little flourishes here and

2967
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:49,520
there is the topic

2968
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:53,199
of jeffrey epstein now

2969
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:56,400
there's been a huge amount of like

2970
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:58,799
impact that the connections of various

2971
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:01,359
faculty to jeffrey epstein

2972
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:03,360
and the various things that been said

2973
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:04,880
had on mit

2974
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:07,359
but it feels like the difficult

2975
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:10,319
conversation haven't had been

2976
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:12,399
had it's the administration trying to

2977
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:15,279
clean up and give a bunch of bs

2978
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:15,679
to try to pretend like let's just hide

2979
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:17,840
this

2980
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:18,800
part like nothing is broken nothing to

2981
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,560
see here

2982
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:22,000
there's a bad dude that did some bad

2983
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:24,719
things and

2984
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
uh some faculty that kind of uh

2985
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:27,760
misbehaved a little bit

2986
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,000
because they're a little bit clueless

2987
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:31,760
let's let's all look the other way

2988
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,960
harvard did this much better by the way

2989
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,960
they they completely

2990
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:38,158
it's almost like people pretend like

2991
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,079
harvard didn't have anything to do with

2992
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:43,519
jeffrey epstein

2993
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:45,519
but i think i'd be curious

2994
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,360
to to hear what those conversations are

2995
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,520
because uh

2996
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:51,359
the there's conversations on the topic

2997
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:54,480
of like

2998
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:55,039
uh well obviously sort of sexual assault

2999
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:57,919
and

3000
01:39:55,039 --> 01:39:59,840
disrespecting women on any kind of level

3001
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:00,719
within academia but just women in

3002
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,400
general

3003
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,079
that's an important topic to talk about

3004
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:06,399
very many

3005
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:07,679
sets of difficult conversations and the

3006
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:10,719
other topic

3007
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:13,760
is um you know funding

3008
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:16,239
uh for research like how are

3009
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:18,000
like what are we okay taking money from

3010
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:18,638
and whether we're not okay taking money

3011
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,158
from

3012
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:21,679
you know a lot there's a lot of just

3013
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:23,839
interesting difficult conversations to

3014
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:26,399
be had

3015
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:28,960
i've worked with people who you know

3016
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:30,238
refuse to take money from dod department

3017
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,960
of defense for example

3018
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:33,839
because in some indirect or direct way

3019
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,920
you're funding

3020
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,880
military industrial complex all those

3021
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,560
kinds of things

3022
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:40,000
i think with jeffrey epstein it's even

3023
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,960
more stark

3024
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,359
this contrast of like well what is and

3025
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:48,639
isn't ethical to take money from

3026
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:49,839
and i just think forget academia i think

3027
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:52,719
there's just a lot of

3028
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:53,279
interesting deep human discussions to be

3029
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,960
had

3030
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:56,559
and they haven't been and there's been

3031
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,800
somebody i don't know if you're familiar

3032
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:01,360
with eric weinstein

3033
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:04,000
who has been outraged by the fact that

3034
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:05,359
nobody's talking about jeffrey epstein

3035
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,920
nobody's having these difficult

3036
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:12,000
conversations and eric himself

3037
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:15,520
has had a sort of complicated journey

3038
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,279
through academia in the sense that

3039
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:18,880
he's a really kind of renegade thinker

3040
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:20,079
in many kinds of ways i'm not sure if

3041
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,760
you didn't know who eric is

3042
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:24,158
by any chance heard the name okay i

3043
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,840
actually uh checked out zev

3044
01:41:24,158 --> 01:41:28,638
it was heartening for me to see that i

3045
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:33,840
was not the youngest person

3046
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:33,840
on the yeah

3047
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:37,759
that's hilarious uh

3048
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:44,319
but uh but but eric has he's kind of a

3049
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:46,800
renegade thinker he's a

3050
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:48,559
mathematical physicist uh with a

3051
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:51,279
believer phd at harvard

3052
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,760
and he spent some time at mit and so on

3053
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:53,279
but he

3054
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,119
he speaks to the fact that sort of

3055
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:56,238
there's a culture of conformity and so

3056
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:58,238
on and if you

3057
01:41:56,238 --> 01:41:59,919
if you're somebody who's a bit outside

3058
01:41:58,238 --> 01:42:01,279
the box a bit weird in whatever

3059
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,319
dimension of weird

3060
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:05,599
that makes you actually kind of

3061
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:07,198
interesting that the system kind of

3062
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:10,159
wants to make you an outcast wants to

3063
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:11,198
throw you out and so he kind of opposes

3064
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:12,799
that whole idea

3065
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:14,559
so he's the perfect person to have

3066
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,400
conversations with in this kind of

3067
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:20,320
librex kind of context

3068
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:21,839
of anonymity because

3069
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:23,599
i'll tell you the few conversations that

3070
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:27,199
came across and they were

3071
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:28,480
very quickly silenced and i'm troubled

3072
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:30,399
by it

3073
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:32,638
i'm not sure what to think of it is

3074
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:35,279
there's a few um

3075
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:36,480
threads inside mit like on a mailing

3076
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:39,279
list

3077
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:40,879
discussing uh marvin minsky i don't know

3078
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:43,359
if you know how that is he's an ai

3079
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,199
researcher he's a summonable figure and

3080
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:46,719
before your time but one of the most

3081
01:42:45,198 --> 01:42:47,919
important people in art

3082
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:49,920
in the history of artificial

3083
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:53,118
intelligence and

3084
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:54,560
uh there was a discussion on a on a on a

3085
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:58,000
thread

3086
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,840
that involved uh

3087
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,600
the interaction between marvel minsky

3088
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,159
and jeffrey epstein

3089
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:06,480
that conversation was quickly shut down

3090
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:08,238
uh one person was pushed out of mit

3091
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:09,359
richard stallman who's one of the key

3092
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:11,599
figures in the

3093
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:12,559
because of that because he wanted some

3094
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:16,000
clarity

3095
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:18,239
about the situation but he also mis

3096
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,279
he spoke like we mentioned earlier

3097
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:22,799
without grace

3098
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:24,479
right but he was quickly punished for

3099
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,719
the administration

3100
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:29,439
uh because of a few people protesting

3101
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:32,319
and just that conversation

3102
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:34,319
uh i guess what bothered me most is it

3103
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:36,880
didn't continue

3104
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:37,359
it didn't it didn't expand there was no

3105
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,960
like

3106
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:41,599
complexity and and it was there was a

3107
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,600
hunger

3108
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,679
that was clear behind that conversation

3109
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:48,079
especially sort of for me i'd like to

3110
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:49,920
understand marvin minsky was one of the

3111
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:51,198
one one of the reasons i wanted to come

3112
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:54,158
to mit uh

3113
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:55,759
he's passed away but he's one of the key

3114
01:43:54,158 --> 01:43:56,399
figures in the field that i deeply care

3115
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:00,079
about our

3116
01:43:56,399 --> 01:44:03,198
artificial intelligence and i

3117
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:04,479
thought that his name was dragged

3118
01:44:03,198 --> 01:44:07,359
through the mud

3119
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:08,158
through that situation and without ever

3120
01:44:07,359 --> 01:44:11,279
being like

3121
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:12,719
resolved and so it's unclear to me like

3122
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:13,118
what am i supposed to think about all

3123
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:16,158
this

3124
01:44:13,118 --> 01:44:18,639
and and the only way to

3125
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:19,279
come to a conclusion there is to keep

3126
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:20,560
talking

3127
01:44:19,279 --> 01:44:22,479
it's like the thing we started this

3128
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:25,520
conversation with about truth

3129
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:26,158
it's like it is conversation so in that

3130
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:29,199
sense and

3131
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:31,359
i'd love uh if people on librex

3132
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:33,439
perhaps in other places but seems like

3133
01:44:31,359 --> 01:44:35,439
librex is a nice platform to discuss

3134
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:38,719
marvel minsky to discuss

3135
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:40,638
jeffrey epstein to learn from it to grow

3136
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:41,439
from it to see how we can make mit

3137
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:43,840
better

3138
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:45,599
because i'm still one of the people i've

3139
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:48,400
always dreamed of being at mit

3140
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:49,600
it was a dream come true in many ways

3141
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:51,198
and i still believe

3142
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,960
that mit is one of the most special

3143
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:54,399
places in this world

3144
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,158
like many other universities

3145
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:57,118
universities in general this is truly

3146
01:44:56,158 --> 01:44:59,920
special man

3147
01:44:57,118 --> 01:45:00,799
i you know it hurts my heart when people

3148
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,480
speak

3149
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:04,880
poorly of academia i understand what

3150
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:06,959
they mean they're very correct

3151
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:09,039
but there is much more in my opinion

3152
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:11,760
that's beautiful about academia

3153
01:45:09,039 --> 01:45:12,079
and that's broken i mean i don't know if

3154
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,400
uh

3155
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:15,679
you have something to comment it doesn't

3156
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:17,519
necessarily need to be about

3157
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:19,840
jeffrey epstein but there's these

3158
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:24,080
difficult things that come up

3159
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:26,159
that test the academic community right

3160
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:27,840
that it feels like conversation is the

3161
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:30,079
only way

3162
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,760
to resolve it i think people have a

3163
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:33,920
natural need for closure

3164
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,600
and it's not just i'm not as plugged

3165
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,639
into the what academics are talking

3166
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,920
about as

3167
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:42,159
you would be lex but even kids these

3168
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:45,039
days no respect for minsky

3169
01:45:42,158 --> 01:45:46,000
exactly i mean especially in the ai

3170
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:48,719
community i'm

3171
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,319
i'm not not necessarily a programmer um

3172
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:53,679
but what i will say is that

3173
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:55,279
um people come to librex and we always

3174
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,118
see a huge spike in

3175
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:58,800
users whenever there's like a tragedy on

3176
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:00,799
campus or something where people need

3177
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,800
closure

3178
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,400
recently there was a suicide just the

3179
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:07,520
other day

3180
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:09,519
on yale's campus and people were just

3181
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:14,000
coming to pay respects and to

3182
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:16,639
stay rest in peace and speak also about

3183
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,679
what might have led to an environment

3184
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:21,679
where people

3185
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:21,679
are drawn to these terrible

3186
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:28,239
results um so just having a conversation

3187
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:29,359
is important there because it like it

3188
01:46:28,238 --> 01:46:32,479
brings you

3189
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:34,399
people need the space especially when

3190
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:36,000
no one wants to go out and put their

3191
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:38,079
head above you know

3192
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,158
be the longest blade of grass on that

3193
01:46:38,079 --> 01:46:44,000
one yeah because of the stigma

3194
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:45,759
yeah people need to be able to speak

3195
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,600
yeah that fear really bothers me the

3196
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:49,199
fear that silences people like

3197
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,760
were they self-censored were they

3198
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:55,759
self-silence

3199
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:58,560
well i'm um

3200
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:59,760
you've created an amazing place i i'm

3201
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,679
kind of interested

3202
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:04,880
in your struggle and your journey of

3203
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,880
creating positive

3204
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:10,800
incentives because uh it's a problem

3205
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:12,238
in a very different domain that i'm also

3206
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:15,760
interested in

3207
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:17,519
um so i you know i love about robotics i

3208
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:20,159
love human robot interaction

3209
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,920
and so i believe that most people are

3210
01:47:20,158 --> 01:47:22,960
good and we can bring out the best in

3211
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:25,039
human nature

3212
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,719
social networks is a very tricky space

3213
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:28,399
to do that in so i'm glad you're taking

3214
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:29,679
on the problem and i'm glad you have the

3215
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:32,960
mission that you do

3216
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:35,359
i hope you succeed but uh

3217
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:36,960
you mentioned offline that you used to

3218
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:38,799
be into chess

3219
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:40,960
tell me about your journey through chess

3220
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:43,039
sure i was a very competitive tournament

3221
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,719
player growing up till about like 13.

3222
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:46,479
i got for the chess fans i got to around

3223
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:49,118
2000 um

3224
01:47:46,479 --> 01:47:50,879
uscf so i was a competitive player

3225
01:47:49,118 --> 01:47:54,000
especially my age group

3226
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:57,039
and um that actually led me to poker

3227
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,479
i was um i was playing a tournament

3228
01:47:57,039 --> 01:47:59,840
and what happens is when you're like a

3229
01:47:58,479 --> 01:48:00,879
very strong 13 year old and you're

3230
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,079
playing locally

3231
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,079
if you want a good match you're gonna

3232
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:07,760
end up playing a lot of adults and i

3233
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:09,359
ended up playing this um mid-40s guy

3234
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:11,440
who we played a really strong game he

3235
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:12,319
actually beat me i i still i still

3236
01:48:11,439 --> 01:48:13,599
remember the game and

3237
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:15,439
and think i could i should have played

3238
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:16,960
that move instead of that one but

3239
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:18,879
after after the game we had a

3240
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,560
post-mortem it was this me i think i was

3241
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:22,719
13 at the time and this 40 year old

3242
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:24,480
like hanging over this chessboard and

3243
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:26,000
looking over the moves and

3244
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:27,279
even at that even at my age it occurred

3245
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
to me that this guy was absolutely

3246
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:31,118
brilliant

3247
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,560
yes and after after the post-mortem not

3248
01:48:31,118 --> 01:48:34,079
only by the way in chess but just like

3249
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,400
in the way he articulates his thoughts

3250
01:48:34,079 --> 01:48:37,118
as

3251
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:38,399
some people are um after postmortem i

3252
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:39,599
went and looked him up online and i

3253
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:41,439
found out that he was a world series

3254
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:44,000
poker champion

3255
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:45,599
and what is it his name is bill chan oh

3256
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,840
wow and i haven't really kept up with

3257
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,760
him

3258
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:49,440
except one time there was another chess

3259
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:53,199
tournament when i was around

3260
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:54,719
14 and i followed him into an elevator

3261
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:56,000
as he was leaving the chess hall

3262
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,000
like pretending that i was going to go

3263
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,439
up just because i wanted to i just

3264
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,279
wanted to talk to him and i

3265
01:48:59,439 --> 01:49:02,479
suggested a sequel or some changes that

3266
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:03,840
he could that i thought he

3267
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:04,959
could make for his book and he was like

3268
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,760
actually i was thinking of doing the

3269
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,600
same thing

3270
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:09,600
which was incredibly validating to my 14

3271
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:11,600
year old or 15 year old self

3272
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:13,840
um but i really haven't kept up with him

3273
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,159
so it's a shout out to him but and then

3274
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:16,000
that

3275
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:17,198
he wrote a book called the mathematics

3276
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,840
of poker

3277
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:20,719
that i started reading and that first of

3278
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,239
all kick started my

3279
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:24,960
interest in game theory and second of

3280
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:26,319
all in poker um so it started from chess

3281
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,760
and then poker

3282
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:31,359
and i started with bitcoin poker and

3283
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,800
had a lot of success with that met a lot

3284
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:36,158
of amazing friends

3285
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:38,079
um learned a ton about i mean i think

3286
01:49:36,158 --> 01:49:40,079
about entrepreneurship as well as taking

3287
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:43,198
risks reasonable risks

3288
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:45,279
positive expected value risks and um

3289
01:49:43,198 --> 01:49:47,039
also just growing as a person and

3290
01:49:45,279 --> 01:49:49,920
mathematician and

3291
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:51,599
what's did you say bitcoin poker yeah

3292
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:53,679
what's bitcoin poker so you have to

3293
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:56,159
understand i was 14 years old right yes

3294
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:57,440
so how is a 14 year old with wonderful

3295
01:49:56,158 --> 01:50:00,079
parents who care about him

3296
01:49:57,439 --> 01:50:00,638
yeah and probably don't want him playing

3297
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:03,359
poker

3298
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:04,880
yeah um going to start playing poker

3299
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:06,238
because i wanted i wanted the challenge

3300
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:07,440
i loved the challenge i loved the

3301
01:50:06,238 --> 01:50:09,598
competition

3302
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:10,879
and i realized the answer was probably

3303
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:14,079
bitcoin

3304
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,639
because the implications of that and uh

3305
01:50:14,079 --> 01:50:16,319
they had

3306
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:17,679
they had these uh free world tournaments

3307
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,118
which for those who don't know

3308
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:21,039
what free rules are there's these

3309
01:50:19,118 --> 01:50:22,479
promotional tournaments that

3310
01:50:21,039 --> 01:50:24,319
sites put on where they'll put like a

3311
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:25,198
few dollars in and then thousands of

3312
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:27,599
people sign up

3313
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:28,719
and the winners get like a dollar and i

3314
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:30,880
started there and i

3315
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:31,760
worked my way up and that's amazing

3316
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:34,960
what's your

3317
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:37,199
sense about from that time to today

3318
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:39,760
of the growth of the cryptocurrency

3319
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:42,158
community i'm actually having

3320
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:43,679
like four or five conversation with

3321
01:50:42,158 --> 01:50:46,719
bitcoin

3322
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:47,118
proponents bitcoin maximus and like all

3323
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:48,880
these

3324
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:50,319
i'm just having all these cryptocurrency

3325
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:53,279
conversations currently

3326
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:54,719
because there's so many brilliant like

3327
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:56,559
technically brilliant

3328
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:58,639
but also financially and philosophically

3329
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:01,280
brilliant people in those communities

3330
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:01,920
it's fascinating with the explosion of

3331
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:03,759
impact

3332
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:06,560
like and also if you look into the

3333
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:08,560
future the possible revolutionary impact

3334
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:11,039
on society in general but what's your

3335
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:13,599
sense about this whole growth of bitcoin

3336
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:14,238
i'm definitely less knowledgeable on the

3337
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:16,719
currency

3338
01:51:14,238 --> 01:51:17,598
again like programming it was a means to

3339
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:20,480
an end yes

3340
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:21,920
right um what i will say is that there

3341
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:22,399
was this amazing community that grew out

3342
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,039
of it

3343
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:26,000
and you'd have people who were willing

3344
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:28,319
to

3345
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,079
stake me or have me be their horse and

3346
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:34,000
they're my backer

3347
01:51:30,079 --> 01:51:36,079
for having never met me for

3348
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,279
literally full bitcoin tournaments like

3349
01:51:36,079 --> 01:51:39,279
full bitcoin entry fee

3350
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:40,960
tournaments and i get a percentage of

3351
01:51:39,279 --> 01:51:43,439
the profits and they get a percentage

3352
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:45,118
and to have that level of community for

3353
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:47,039
that degree of money

3354
01:51:45,118 --> 01:51:48,319
i mean it gives you hope about the

3355
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:51,439
potential for

3356
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:54,479
you know humans to act in mutual

3357
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:56,479
best interest with a degree of trust

3358
01:51:54,479 --> 01:51:58,000
yeah there's a really fascinating strong

3359
01:51:56,479 --> 01:51:59,759
community there but

3360
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,359
speaking of like bringing out the best

3361
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:02,800
of human nature

3362
01:52:01,359 --> 01:52:04,799
it's a community that's currently

3363
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:07,920
struggling a little bit

3364
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:10,480
uh in terms of their ability to

3365
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:12,560
communicate in a positive inspiring way

3366
01:52:10,479 --> 01:52:15,198
like the bitcoin folks and we talk about

3367
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:18,000
this a lot they um

3368
01:52:15,198 --> 01:52:19,439
i honestly think they have a lot a lot

3369
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,479
of love in their

3370
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:24,319
hearts and minds but they just kind of

3371
01:52:22,479 --> 01:52:27,598
naturally

3372
01:52:24,319 --> 01:52:28,960
because the world has been like

3373
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:32,159
institutions

3374
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:35,039
and uh the centralized powers have been

3375
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:35,920
sort of mocking and uh fighting them for

3376
01:52:35,039 --> 01:52:38,238
many years

3377
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:39,359
that they've become sort of worn down

3378
01:52:38,238 --> 01:52:41,118
and cynical

3379
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:42,839
and so they tend to be a little bit more

3380
01:52:41,118 --> 01:52:44,719
aggressive and negative on the

3381
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:47,119
internet that's interesting in the way

3382
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:48,399
they communicate especially on twitter

3383
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:51,279
and it's just created this whole

3384
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:51,279
community of

3385
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:55,039
basically being derisive and mocking and

3386
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,040
trolling and all this kind of stuff

3387
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:58,960
yeah but people are trying to you know

3388
01:52:57,039 --> 01:53:01,519
as the as the bitcoin community grows as

3389
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:03,520
the cryptocurrency community grows

3390
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,040
they're trying to revolutionize that

3391
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,119
aspect too so they're trying to find the

3392
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:09,519
positive core and grow

3393
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:11,039
uh and and grow in that way so it's it's

3394
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,440
a it's fascinating because i think all

3395
01:53:11,039 --> 01:53:14,399
of us

3396
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:16,238
are trying to find the positive aspects

3397
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:17,920
of ourselves and trying to learn

3398
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:20,000
how to communicate in a positive way

3399
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,480
online it's like the internet has been

3400
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
around

3401
01:53:20,479 --> 01:53:23,759
social networks haven't been around that

3402
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,118
long we're trying to we're trying to

3403
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,039
figure this thing out

3404
01:53:25,118 --> 01:53:28,399
let me ask you the ridiculous question

3405
01:53:27,039 --> 01:53:30,719
uh i don't know if you have an

3406
01:53:28,399 --> 01:53:31,759
answer but who is the greatest chess

3407
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:34,880
player of all time

3408
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:37,119
in your view so since you like chess

3409
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,319
talks on how you define it but if you're

3410
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:40,479
talking about raw skill

3411
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:41,599
like if you put everyone across time

3412
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:43,839
into a torment together

3413
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:45,440
yeah um carlson would win i don't think

3414
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:47,279
that's particularly controversial oh you

3415
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:47,759
mean like with the same exact skill

3416
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:49,759
level

3417
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:51,360
exactly magnus cossack because the

3418
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:54,079
object now if you talk about

3419
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:54,639
political importance i think bobby

3420
01:53:54,079 --> 01:53:57,599
fischer

3421
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:58,560
is you know he's a he's the only one

3422
01:53:57,599 --> 01:53:59,840
that people still

3423
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:01,599
would use to go to someone on the street

3424
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,119
they know bobby fischer because he was

3425
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:04,319
because of what he represented right who

3426
01:54:03,118 --> 01:54:07,679
do you think is more famous

3427
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:08,238
on the street uh gary kasparov or bobby

3428
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:10,000
fischer

3429
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:11,759
probably fit in america but efficiently

3430
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,039
do you think so yes

3431
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:14,880
that's interesting i think we're gonna

3432
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:16,639
have to put that to the test yeah maybe

3433
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:18,719
it's maybe it's more reflective of the

3434
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:20,480
community that i was a part of but yeah

3435
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:23,118
also in the community you're a part of

3436
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:24,559
like young minds playing chess bobby

3437
01:54:23,118 --> 01:54:26,799
fischer was a superstar

3438
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:28,000
in terms of like yeah i think so because

3439
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:31,119
he's american

3440
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,479
and you know he stood up against the

3441
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:36,399
big bad russians yes at the time and uh

3442
01:54:34,479 --> 01:54:38,479
you know unfortunately he had a very bad

3443
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:40,479
downfall but um

3444
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:41,678
what you know for our geopolitical

3445
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:44,000
situation

3446
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:45,679
he meant a lot and then if you talk

3447
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:49,039
about compared to contemporaries

3448
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:50,158
actually i would say paul murphy was a

3449
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:53,198
bit of a throwback

3450
01:54:50,158 --> 01:54:54,479
was he's one of those geniuses that uh

3451
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:56,319
was just head and shoulders above

3452
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:58,238
everyone else

3453
01:54:56,319 --> 01:55:00,079
is there somebody that inspired your own

3454
01:54:58,238 --> 01:55:03,439
play like as a young mind

3455
01:55:00,079 --> 01:55:04,399
yeah i really like mikhail tall so like

3456
01:55:03,439 --> 01:55:05,839
you see you were

3457
01:55:04,399 --> 01:55:07,759
i think he was very aggressive right

3458
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:10,400
yeah very tactical yeah um

3459
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,599
which is funny because i am i found that

3460
01:55:10,399 --> 01:55:12,719
i was better at like sort of slow

3461
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:15,279
methodical play

3462
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:16,319
than quick tactics but i just i mean

3463
01:55:15,279 --> 01:55:17,279
there's something beautiful about the

3464
01:55:16,319 --> 01:55:18,639
creativity

3465
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:20,719
and that's something i always latched on

3466
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:22,560
to was being a creative player being a

3467
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:24,319
creative person i mean

3468
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,679
chess doesn't really reward creativity

3469
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:28,319
as much as a lot of other things

3470
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:30,560
especially entrepreneurial pursuits

3471
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:32,559
which i think is part of the reason why

3472
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:35,039
i sort of grew out of it

3473
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:37,520
but i always was attracted to the

3474
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:40,158
creativity that i did see in chess

3475
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:41,440
so let me ask the flip the uh the other

3476
01:55:40,158 --> 01:55:42,960
because he said poker

3477
01:55:41,439 --> 01:55:45,279
is there somebody that stands out to you

3478
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:46,480
as uh could be the greatest poker player

3479
01:55:45,279 --> 01:55:49,519
of all time

3480
01:55:46,479 --> 01:55:50,718
like who do you uh admire

3481
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:52,800
that's in that and that's a more

3482
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:55,599
controversial one because

3483
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:57,119
these chess players are such like first

3484
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:58,960
of all there's more than objectives

3485
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:00,479
objective standard and second of all

3486
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:03,439
there's like they're like almost like

3487
01:56:00,479 --> 01:56:04,399
cultural figures to me whereas poker

3488
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:07,439
players are more like

3489
01:56:04,399 --> 01:56:08,879
live living they feel more like yeah but

3490
01:56:07,439 --> 01:56:10,638
they feel more accessible

3491
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,840
but they also have like personalities

3492
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:17,039
yeah poker have like phil either

3493
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:19,520
their vices they have quirks they have

3494
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:20,158
humor like i guess we've seen videos of

3495
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,840
them

3496
01:56:20,158 --> 01:56:24,399
yeah because it's such a recent

3497
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:27,199
development let's say one person who i

3498
01:56:24,399 --> 01:56:28,000
admire so much and like if i if i could

3499
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:29,359
like have a dinner

3500
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,198
list of people that i want to have

3501
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:32,559
dinner with like maybe it'll happen now

3502
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:34,559
actually

3503
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:37,280
but i would love to have dinner with him

3504
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:38,719
um phil galphond

3505
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:41,679
who i don't most people probably won't

3506
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:45,520
know yeah but uh on this podcast but

3507
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:46,800
the way first of all he democratized

3508
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:48,960
poker learning

3509
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:51,599
in like the mathematical nitty-gritty

3510
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:53,679
how do you get good at poker type sense

3511
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:55,520
to the entire world in like an

3512
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:57,679
unprecedented way he was

3513
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,560
he gave he had this gift that he had

3514
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:00,000
learned and

3515
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:01,360
distilled by working with some of the

3516
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,039
greatest poker minds and he just

3517
01:57:01,359 --> 01:57:06,719
democratized it

3518
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:09,198
um through his website and um

3519
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:11,279
i learned a ton from him and not only

3520
01:57:09,198 --> 01:57:12,799
that but you just listen to him think

3521
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:14,719
and it's almost like a philosophical

3522
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:16,079
meditation the way that he

3523
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:17,760
breaks things down and thinks about

3524
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:20,719
these different elements and

3525
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:22,320
has such a holistic thought process it's

3526
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:25,359
like watching a genius work

3527
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:27,920
and you know he's also just a nice fun

3528
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:30,238
sociable guy that like you can you can

3529
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:32,079
imagine being at your dinner table yeah

3530
01:57:30,238 --> 01:57:33,759
all that combined which is not true for

3531
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:35,679
a lot of poker players right

3532
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:36,880
a lot of them are dark so say the least

3533
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:39,520
yes i

3534
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:41,359
i like i really like the what is he

3535
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:43,360
canadian daniel negrano

3536
01:57:41,359 --> 01:57:45,118
he's also a nice guy he's also a nice

3537
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:46,639
guy but he's also somebody who's able to

3538
01:57:45,118 --> 01:57:48,319
express his uh

3539
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:50,239
thoughts about poker really well but

3540
01:57:48,319 --> 01:57:52,319
also in an entertaining way

3541
01:57:50,238 --> 01:57:54,319
he seems to be able to predict cards

3542
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:56,639
better than anybody i've ever seen

3543
01:57:54,319 --> 01:57:57,519
like what uh you watch the challenge

3544
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:59,440
which challenge

3545
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:01,440
he uh he lost like a million dollars

3546
01:57:59,439 --> 01:58:03,439
recently to uh

3547
01:58:01,439 --> 01:58:05,039
doug polk he lost a million dollars to

3548
01:58:03,439 --> 01:58:07,678
doug polk heads up online

3549
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:08,800
it's really interesting yeah it's it's

3550
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:12,158
awesome to watch these

3551
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:15,279
these guys work so i know

3552
01:58:12,158 --> 01:58:18,638
you're 20 21 21 21

3553
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:21,920
uh so asking you for advice is uh

3554
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:23,039
is a little bit funny but uh but at the

3555
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:26,158
same time not

3556
01:58:23,039 --> 01:58:28,399
because you've created a social network

3557
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:30,479
you've created a startup from nothing as

3558
01:58:28,399 --> 01:58:32,559
we talked about earlier like without

3559
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:34,238
knowing how to program you've programmed

3560
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:35,679
i mean you've taken this whole journey

3561
01:58:34,238 --> 01:58:36,959
that a lot of people i think would be

3562
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:40,319
really inspired by

3563
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:41,920
so given that uh and given the fact that

3564
01:58:40,319 --> 01:58:43,439
20 years from now you probably laugh at

3565
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,599
the advice you're going to give now

3566
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:46,799
absolutely i hope so if i don't laugh at

3567
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:49,760
the advice i give now

3568
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:50,400
something went desperately wrong right

3569
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:53,520
yeah

3570
01:58:50,399 --> 01:58:54,879
uh so do you have advice for people that

3571
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:57,599
want to follow in your

3572
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:58,079
footsteps and create a startup whether

3573
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:00,560
it's in

3574
01:58:58,079 --> 01:59:03,920
the software app domain or whether it's

3575
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:06,960
anything else so i'll speak specifically

3576
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:08,399
about social media apps yes um

3577
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:10,079
try to keep it as narrow as possible so

3578
01:59:08,399 --> 01:59:11,519
i can laugh as little as possible when

3579
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:15,359
i'm 41.

3580
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:17,599
um and what i would say is that

3581
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:19,679
if you're like a 21 22 year old who's

3582
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:22,480
looking at me and being like

3583
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:24,480
i want to do something like this um what

3584
01:59:22,479 --> 01:59:27,678
i would say is you probably know better

3585
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:28,238
than just about anyone and if you have a

3586
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:30,800
feeling

3587
01:59:28,238 --> 01:59:31,839
in yourself that this is something that

3588
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,119
i have to do

3589
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:35,119
and this is something i could imagine

3590
01:59:33,118 --> 01:59:37,359
myself doing for the next 10 years

3591
01:59:35,118 --> 01:59:38,639
because if you're successful you are

3592
01:59:37,359 --> 01:59:39,118
going to have to do it for the next 10

3593
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:40,880
years

3594
01:59:39,118 --> 01:59:43,279
and through the ups and the downs

3595
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:44,319
through the amazing interviews with lex

3596
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:46,158
and through the

3597
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:48,238
not so amazing articles you might have

3598
01:59:46,158 --> 01:59:50,799
with other people right

3599
01:59:48,238 --> 01:59:52,319
um and you're gonna have to ride those

3600
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:53,679
highs and lows and you have to believe

3601
01:59:52,319 --> 01:59:55,840
in what you're doing but if you have

3602
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:58,399
that feeling what i would say is

3603
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:59,760
listen to as few people as possible

3604
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:02,079
because

3605
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,440
people are experts in domains but when

3606
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:05,279
it comes to like

3607
02:00:03,439 --> 02:00:08,319
what's hot and what's what what makes

3608
02:00:05,279 --> 02:00:10,960
sense in a social context

3609
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:12,000
you are the authority as a young person

3610
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,639
who's going through these

3611
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,760
things and living in in your sort of

3612
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:18,960
milieu

3613
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:22,079
and i mean i've talked to

3614
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:25,840
at this point you know so many experts

3615
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:29,840
experts so many investors

3616
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:30,480
um so you'd be amazed at the advice i've

3617
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,159
gotten

3618
02:00:30,479 --> 02:00:34,399
advice i've gotten so there's like a

3619
02:00:32,158 --> 02:00:36,719
minefield of bad advice

3620
02:00:34,399 --> 02:00:38,559
that's the hardest part i think for

3621
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:41,520
young people and it's the thing

3622
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:42,320
when people like i help i help yelli's

3623
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:44,320
all the time

3624
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:45,759
who asks like i never turn down when a

3625
02:00:44,319 --> 02:00:47,439
founder asked me to have a conversation

3626
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:50,159
i never turn it down

3627
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:51,919
i'm always there for them um and the

3628
02:00:50,158 --> 02:00:55,118
number one thing i worry about is that

3629
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:57,760
at yale we're taught implicitly and

3630
02:00:55,118 --> 02:00:59,198
explicitly that you listen to the adult

3631
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:00,000
in the room you listen to the person

3632
02:00:59,198 --> 02:01:03,598
with the highest

3633
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,039
you know pay grade and

3634
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:06,719
it's devastating because that's how

3635
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:09,760
innovation dies and

3636
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:13,279
you know yeah it's intimidating to like

3637
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:14,800
you talk to vc who probably

3638
02:01:13,279 --> 02:01:16,800
makes it worth a billion dollars yeah

3639
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:19,599
billion dollars and they're

3640
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:21,760
going to tell you you know all the all

3641
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:24,880
the successful startups they helped fund

3642
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:27,199
or even just a successful business owner

3643
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:29,599
is going to tell you some advice and

3644
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:31,678
it's hard psychologically to think that

3645
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:35,039
they might be wrong

3646
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:36,719
yeah but you're saying that's the only

3647
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:37,679
way way you succeed because if they knew

3648
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,520
what they were doing they would have

3649
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:43,199
built it themselves

3650
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:45,119
um and what's especially hard is people

3651
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:46,719
go oh of course you know

3652
02:01:45,118 --> 02:01:48,158
i'll listen to people's i'll listen to

3653
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:48,880
their advice but i'll know why it's

3654
02:01:48,158 --> 02:01:50,638
wrong

3655
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:52,400
yeah and then i'll and i'll do my own

3656
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:53,118
thing and that sounds great and abstract

3657
02:01:52,399 --> 02:01:54,479
but sometimes

3658
02:01:53,118 --> 02:01:56,559
you can't always even put your finger on

3659
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:59,678
why they're wrong yeah and i think

3660
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:01,840
to have the conviction to say

3661
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:04,079
you're wrong and i can't tell you why

3662
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:06,319
but i still think i'm right

3663
02:02:04,079 --> 02:02:07,920
it's a rare thing especially at like

3664
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:10,238
it's very counterintuitive and

3665
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:11,279
you might even say it's hubris or yeah

3666
02:02:10,238 --> 02:02:13,198
arrogant

3667
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:14,719
but i think it's necessary because a lot

3668
02:02:13,198 --> 02:02:17,198
of these things are

3669
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:19,359
they're not things that you can really

3670
02:02:17,198 --> 02:02:21,439
put into words until

3671
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:23,439
you see them in action like a lot of

3672
02:02:21,439 --> 02:02:25,198
them are kind of happy accidents

3673
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:27,039
yeah it's been it's been tough for me

3674
02:02:25,198 --> 02:02:30,158
like as a as a person who

3675
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:32,000
um like i'm very empathetic so i when

3676
02:02:30,158 --> 02:02:36,238
people tell me stuff

3677
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,679
i kind of want to understand them

3678
02:02:36,238 --> 02:02:40,079
and it's been a painful process

3679
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:42,319
especially people close to me

3680
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:44,719
basically everything i've done

3681
02:02:42,319 --> 02:02:46,559
especially in the recent few years

3682
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:48,079
a lot of people close to me said not to

3683
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:50,960
do yeah

3684
02:02:48,079 --> 02:02:52,880
and uh like my parents too that's been a

3685
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:55,520
hard one

3686
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:57,118
it's is to basically acknowledge to

3687
02:02:55,520 --> 02:03:00,560
myself

3688
02:02:57,118 --> 02:03:03,679
that you don't know like

3689
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:04,639
you you don't that everything you're

3690
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:07,039
going to say

3691
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:08,079
by way of advice for me is not going to

3692
02:03:07,039 --> 02:03:10,960
be helpful

3693
02:03:08,079 --> 02:03:11,840
like i love my parents very much but

3694
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:15,439
like

3695
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:18,560
they're just like they don't get it

3696
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:20,158
and and as you put it beautifully it's

3697
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:21,280
very difficult to put your finger on

3698
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:25,359
exactly

3699
02:03:21,279 --> 02:03:28,319
why because uh a lot of advice

3700
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:30,000
sounds reasonable that's the worst kind

3701
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:33,359
yeah

3702
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:35,279
yeah uh if it if it sounds really good

3703
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:37,039
that just means it's an ear worm like

3704
02:03:35,279 --> 02:03:38,479
that's like a song that you hear on the

3705
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:39,920
radio and then you're like

3706
02:03:38,479 --> 02:03:42,000
you're humming it in the car and it's

3707
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:44,079
like it's the same thing

3708
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,198
the more the better it sounds the more

3709
02:03:44,079 --> 02:03:48,399
skeptical

3710
02:03:45,198 --> 02:03:50,000
yeah reason is a is a bad drug like

3711
02:03:48,399 --> 02:03:52,799
should be very careful

3712
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:54,560
because like you know the things that

3713
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:56,719
seem impossible

3714
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:58,159
you ever every major innovation every

3715
02:03:56,719 --> 02:04:00,960
major business

3716
02:03:58,158 --> 02:04:02,479
seems impossible at birth but even not

3717
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:04,319
just the impossible things

3718
02:04:02,479 --> 02:04:06,238
i think you know you look at like love

3719
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:09,599
for example

3720
02:04:06,238 --> 02:04:11,439
it's very easy to give advice

3721
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:13,440
to sort of point out all the ways it can

3722
02:04:11,439 --> 02:04:15,439
go wrong or marriage

3723
02:04:13,439 --> 02:04:17,919
all the divorces that people go through

3724
02:04:15,439 --> 02:04:19,839
all the pain of years

3725
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:21,359
that you go through the divorce like the

3726
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:23,840
system of marriage

3727
02:04:21,359 --> 02:04:25,679
the marriage industrial complex all the

3728
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:26,400
money that's wasted all those kinds of

3729
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:28,158
things

3730
02:04:26,399 --> 02:04:29,519
but that advice is useless when you're

3731
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:32,638
in love

3732
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:34,239
the point uh the point is to just

3733
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:36,400
pat the person in the back and say go

3734
02:04:34,238 --> 02:04:38,000
get him kid like what is it the goodwill

3735
02:04:36,399 --> 02:04:39,670
hunting and went to see about

3736
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,359
a girl oh yeah

3737
02:04:39,670 --> 02:04:44,078
[Laughter]

3738
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:44,719
that's a good movie i love that movie

3739
02:04:44,078 --> 02:04:47,679
but

3740
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:48,158
yeah that that's uh that took me a long

3741
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:50,078
time

3742
02:04:48,158 --> 02:04:51,439
to figure out i'm still trying to fight

3743
02:04:50,078 --> 02:04:55,599
through it but especially when you're

3744
02:04:51,439 --> 02:04:58,238
young that's hard but uh

3745
02:04:55,599 --> 02:05:00,078
nothing in life is uh worth

3746
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:01,198
accomplishing is easy so

3747
02:05:00,078 --> 02:05:02,479
but i think it's really interesting you

3748
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:03,519
make that connection between like

3749
02:05:02,479 --> 02:05:05,919
startup advice

3750
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:07,920
and like your parents because it's the

3751
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:09,679
exact same sort of mechanism

3752
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:11,039
where when you're young your parents are

3753
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:13,760
usually like right

3754
02:05:11,039 --> 02:05:15,599
yeah right and the experts are usually

3755
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:16,320
right and you know if you listen to them

3756
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:17,920
and you you

3757
02:05:16,319 --> 02:05:19,840
you follow their orders you're gonna go

3758
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:21,520
to a school like yale yeah and at a

3759
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:24,319
certain point

3760
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:25,360
stops making sense and i've i've seen my

3761
02:05:24,319 --> 02:05:27,198
friends at yale

3762
02:05:25,359 --> 02:05:28,719
go down paths because they just

3763
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:29,839
continued listening to their parents

3764
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:31,920
that

3765
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:33,840
i know in their heart of hearts is not

3766
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:36,880
the right path for them

3767
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:39,119
yeah you know what that's how i see

3768
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,480
like the education system the whole

3769
02:05:39,118 --> 02:05:44,158
point

3770
02:05:40,479 --> 02:05:46,319
is to guide you to a certain

3771
02:05:44,158 --> 02:05:47,519
point in your life and everybody's point

3772
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:51,198
is different

3773
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:53,679
and your task is

3774
02:05:51,198 --> 02:05:54,799
to at that point to have a personal

3775
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:56,239
revolution

3776
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:57,920
and create your own path but no one

3777
02:05:56,238 --> 02:05:58,399
tells you that nobody tells you that

3778
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:00,000
because they're

3779
02:05:58,399 --> 02:06:01,920
they want you to keep following the same

3780
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,439
path as they they're leading you towards

3781
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:06,399
like they're not going to say

3782
02:06:03,439 --> 02:06:07,279
your whole job is to eventually rebel

3783
02:06:06,399 --> 02:06:09,279
yeah

3784
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:11,519
that's how revolut that's how rebellion

3785
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:13,599
works you're not supposed to be told

3786
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:14,800
but that is the task they can take you

3787
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:17,279
just like you said

3788
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:19,119
and depending who you are they can take

3789
02:06:17,279 --> 02:06:20,800
you really far

3790
02:06:19,118 --> 02:06:22,399
but at a certain point you have to rebel

3791
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:23,760
that could be getting you know phd

3792
02:06:22,399 --> 02:06:24,960
that could be in your undergrad that

3793
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:25,760
could be high schools yeah it could be

3794
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:28,399
any point

3795
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:29,840
one thing that i think played a pretty

3796
02:06:28,399 --> 02:06:31,039
pivotal role and i've never really

3797
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:33,199
mentioned this

3798
02:06:31,039 --> 02:06:34,800
um he might not even know the person

3799
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:37,118
about to tell you about

3800
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:38,560
um in sort of me actually going out and

3801
02:06:37,118 --> 02:06:40,319
making librex was that

3802
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:42,880
i was taking this graduate level math

3803
02:06:40,319 --> 02:06:45,920
class um

3804
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:46,880
my sophomore year um and i met this uh i

3805
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:49,279
met this uh

3806
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:50,880
phd student who was also in it and had

3807
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:53,759
considerable

3808
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:55,039
citations and also startup experience

3809
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:56,719
and i think he actually ended up being

3810
02:06:55,039 --> 02:06:59,439
the cto of a unicorn

3811
02:06:56,719 --> 02:07:02,158
later on um i've sort of lost touch with

3812
02:06:59,439 --> 02:07:05,198
him but we're still facebook friends

3813
02:07:02,158 --> 02:07:07,118
as it is in the 21st century right um

3814
02:07:05,198 --> 02:07:08,638
so and i was in a class and i was

3815
02:07:07,118 --> 02:07:10,158
telling him i really want to i really

3816
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:12,639
want to make this thing but i have no

3817
02:07:10,158 --> 02:07:15,679
technical background um

3818
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:17,359
and he this guy's a computer genius he

3819
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:20,639
worked under dan spielman

3820
02:07:17,359 --> 02:07:22,719
a ael so yeah he's a good guy right and

3821
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:24,719
we were doing some math together um we

3822
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:27,118
were doing something on discrepancy

3823
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:28,399
for those who really care about math uh

3824
02:07:27,118 --> 02:07:32,000
so combinatorics

3825
02:07:28,399 --> 02:07:33,839
um and uh he just turns to me he's like

3826
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,359
i think you could do it like what do you

3827
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:37,520
mean you think i could do is like

3828
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:38,559
i think you could do it yeah and i was

3829
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:41,280
like really

3830
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:42,639
but i respected this guy so much um his

3831
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:44,880
name was young duck

3832
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:46,480
um shout out to young duck i respected

3833
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:48,400
this guy so much that i was like

3834
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:50,000
if young duck says i can do it and young

3835
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:52,799
doug is a legit genius

3836
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:54,078
and he knows and he knows me because we

3837
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:55,279
were in two classes together and we

3838
02:07:54,078 --> 02:07:58,238
spent a lot of time together

3839
02:07:55,279 --> 02:08:00,000
if he thinks i can do it then who am i

3840
02:07:58,238 --> 02:08:01,759
to say i can't do it

3841
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,118
yeah you know that's a lesson for

3842
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:04,960
mentorship

3843
02:08:03,118 --> 02:08:06,559
is like by the way he has no idea

3844
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:08,158
probably

3845
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:10,079
well he might not even remember that

3846
02:08:08,158 --> 02:08:13,118
interaction which is funny but the

3847
02:08:10,078 --> 02:08:15,920
the point is that when a crazy

3848
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:17,519
young kid comes up to you with a crazy

3849
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:19,920
dream

3850
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:21,920
uh you know every once in a while you

3851
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:23,920
should just pet him in the back and say

3852
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:25,760
i believe in you

3853
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:28,319
like you can do it if they look up to

3854
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:31,360
you that means your words have power

3855
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:32,639
and if you say no no come on be like

3856
02:08:31,359 --> 02:08:36,399
reasonable

3857
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:37,199
like you know finish your school work

3858
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:39,118
kind of thing

3859
02:08:37,198 --> 02:08:41,039
like that's that's unreasonable to take

3860
02:08:39,118 --> 02:08:42,158
that leap now just finish your education

3861
02:08:41,039 --> 02:08:45,039
blah blah blah whatever

3862
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:46,000
whatever the reasonable advice is every

3863
02:08:45,039 --> 02:08:48,880
once in a while

3864
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,359
maybe often as a mentor you should say

3865
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:52,480
you know

3866
02:08:49,359 --> 02:08:54,399
go see about a girl in in california or

3867
02:08:52,479 --> 02:08:56,078
whatever the equivalent is

3868
02:08:54,399 --> 02:08:57,839
that was my moment that was my goodwill

3869
02:08:56,078 --> 02:08:58,719
hunting this is your goodwill hunting

3870
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:01,360
moment

3871
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:03,520
oh man i miss robin williams i was a

3872
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:06,000
special guy

3873
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:07,199
people love it uh when i ask about book

3874
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,279
recommendations

3875
02:09:07,198 --> 02:09:10,319
in general of course your journey is

3876
02:09:09,279 --> 02:09:12,078
just beginning but

3877
02:09:10,319 --> 02:09:15,118
is there something that jumps out to you

3878
02:09:12,078 --> 02:09:17,840
technical fiction philosophical sci-fi

3879
02:09:15,118 --> 02:09:19,359
coloring books blog posts you read

3880
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:22,000
somewhere

3881
02:09:19,359 --> 02:09:24,078
that had an impact on your life uh video

3882
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:26,719
games

3883
02:09:24,078 --> 02:09:28,078
that you recommend to others minecraft

3884
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:30,399
manual

3885
02:09:28,078 --> 02:09:32,158
manga i mean yeah video you could

3886
02:09:30,399 --> 02:09:33,679
mention video games too that if there's

3887
02:09:32,158 --> 02:09:36,799
something that jumps out to you that

3888
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:38,719
just had like an impact um

3889
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:40,960
i guess i'll say i really like the book

3890
02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:42,960
the the war of art

3891
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:44,399
um which is a book about creative

3892
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:46,639
resistance and the creative struggle and

3893
02:09:44,399 --> 02:09:49,279
what it means to be creative yeah

3894
02:09:46,639 --> 02:09:51,199
um and part of what i see in this

3895
02:09:49,279 --> 02:09:54,479
conversation and what you're doing lex

3896
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:56,000
is so much of the war of arts idea is

3897
02:09:54,479 --> 02:09:57,839
that you just keep writing

3898
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,319
and writing and writing until you get to

3899
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:02,880
the new crap yeah yeah

3900
02:10:00,319 --> 02:10:03,599
and yeah you just you just you just roll

3901
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:05,118
with it right

3902
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:07,039
and that's sort of what happens when you

3903
02:10:05,118 --> 02:10:07,839
have like three-hour conversations with

3904
02:10:07,039 --> 02:10:10,158
people is yeah

3905
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:11,599
you can only have so much scripted or

3906
02:10:10,158 --> 02:10:15,118
societally constructed

3907
02:10:11,599 --> 02:10:17,199
stuff until you get to the real you

3908
02:10:15,118 --> 02:10:19,039
and you have to show up i mean he's that

3909
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:20,319
book that book is kind of painful

3910
02:10:19,039 --> 02:10:21,840
it's really painful and it's not

3911
02:10:20,319 --> 02:10:22,559
something i would recommend for every

3912
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:24,000
part of it

3913
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:26,880
but for what it did in my life at the

3914
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,920
time it also kind of normalized

3915
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:30,560
i don't know um i part of my coming of

3916
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:34,000
age story

3917
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:35,920
is the part of it's about realizing that

3918
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,359
i'm a creative person and person who

3919
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:40,319
needs to create

3920
02:10:37,359 --> 02:10:42,078
um that's sort of a god-given thing i

3921
02:10:40,319 --> 02:10:42,880
think for a lot of people but it's

3922
02:10:42,078 --> 02:10:44,078
something that i

3923
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:46,239
don't really feel like i can live

3924
02:10:44,078 --> 02:10:47,679
without and part of it was realizing

3925
02:10:46,238 --> 02:10:49,839
that even within some of these more

3926
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:52,399
rigid structures it's okay that i don't

3927
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:52,960
sort of fit in with them and to hear

3928
02:10:52,399 --> 02:10:55,118
about

3929
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:56,719
the struggles of other creatives was

3930
02:10:55,118 --> 02:10:58,559
something for my own self-esteem and my

3931
02:10:56,719 --> 02:10:59,439
own growing up that was really important

3932
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:01,599
to me

3933
02:10:59,439 --> 02:11:03,279
so i don't think the book itself might

3934
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:05,440
be perfect

3935
02:11:03,279 --> 02:11:06,960
but for what it did for my life it was

3936
02:11:05,439 --> 02:11:09,118
really impactful

3937
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:10,960
yeah i think exactly the words may not

3938
02:11:09,118 --> 02:11:13,279
be uh

3939
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:14,560
exactly right by way of advice but i

3940
02:11:13,279 --> 02:11:16,479
think the journey that a lot of

3941
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:19,520
creatives take

3942
02:11:16,479 --> 02:11:20,479
by reading that book is uh kind of

3943
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:22,079
profound

3944
02:11:20,479 --> 02:11:24,000
he also has another one called turning

3945
02:11:22,078 --> 02:11:28,000
pro i think i mean he in general

3946
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:30,319
espouses like taking it seriously

3947
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,920
like if you have a creative mind and you

3948
02:11:30,319 --> 02:11:32,799
want to create something special in this

3949
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:36,800
world

3950
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:39,279
go do it it's not don't you know show up

3951
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:40,960
and so many blank pages so many people

3952
02:11:39,279 --> 02:11:43,599
would like tell me like

3953
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:44,319
would encourage me either blatantly or

3954
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:47,119
through like

3955
02:11:44,319 --> 02:11:49,599
implicit means to like basically take

3956
02:11:47,118 --> 02:11:53,039
the app less seriously

3957
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:54,719
it's a good signal by the way um

3958
02:11:53,039 --> 02:11:56,479
it's a good signal because my really

3959
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:57,198
close friends the ones who have always

3960
02:11:56,479 --> 02:11:58,559
supported me

3961
02:11:57,198 --> 02:12:00,559
yeah they never said that because they

3962
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:02,320
got it they understood that was

3963
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:04,079
that that was my path and they might be

3964
02:12:02,319 --> 02:12:05,679
skeptical they might be like

3965
02:12:04,078 --> 02:12:08,399
i mean one of my friends i remember told

3966
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:09,599
me like i was always like taken aback

3967
02:12:08,399 --> 02:12:11,679
about why you were so

3968
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:13,840
certain this would work out and he's

3969
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:15,359
like i finally got it like once i saw it

3970
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:16,800
like popping off but like

3971
02:12:15,359 --> 02:12:18,799
before that i just didn't get it but

3972
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:20,880
like he still supported me

3973
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:22,719
and i think i think it's a really good

3974
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,400
signal and actually

3975
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:26,158
just the fact of going through this

3976
02:12:24,399 --> 02:12:28,638
process has made me

3977
02:12:26,158 --> 02:12:30,238
socially feel so much more connected and

3978
02:12:28,639 --> 02:12:31,840
i've somewhat consolidated my social

3979
02:12:30,238 --> 02:12:32,479
life to some degree but it's so much

3980
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:34,639
more

3981
02:12:32,479 --> 02:12:35,839
vulnerable connected and that's part of

3982
02:12:34,639 --> 02:12:37,760
the creative process

3983
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:39,440
i have to thank for that i think this

3984
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:41,760
there's something that's like

3985
02:12:39,439 --> 02:12:43,439
unstoppable about the creative mind it's

3986
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:47,280
like it's right there that fire

3987
02:12:43,439 --> 02:12:48,638
and i guess part of the part of the

3988
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:51,198
thing that you're supposed to do is let

3989
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:54,000
that fire burn in whichever direction

3990
02:12:51,198 --> 02:12:55,039
and it's gonna hurt it's gonna hurt fire

3991
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,800
will hurt

3992
02:12:55,039 --> 02:12:58,078
uh but on top of the video game she's

3993
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:01,360
mentioned stanley parable

3994
02:12:58,078 --> 02:13:02,960
offline is there uh you said you played

3995
02:13:01,359 --> 02:13:03,439
some video games is there a video game

3996
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:05,599
that you

3997
02:13:03,439 --> 02:13:06,479
especially love do you recommend i play

3998
02:13:05,599 --> 02:13:09,119
for example

3999
02:13:06,479 --> 02:13:11,039
yeah i'll uh i'll mention it's actually

4000
02:13:09,118 --> 02:13:12,158
really in keeping with what we've been

4001
02:13:11,039 --> 02:13:14,719
talking about

4002
02:13:12,158 --> 02:13:16,238
it's the beginner's guide which is what

4003
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:18,078
i it was made by the same guy davey

4004
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:18,879
rendon who made the stanley parable

4005
02:13:18,078 --> 02:13:20,960
which i

4006
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:21,920
i briefly saw you i i just clicked the

4007
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:24,719
video and yeah

4008
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:25,359
then i went to sleep it was at 2am um

4009
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:27,039
and then

4010
02:13:25,359 --> 02:13:29,679
um but i briefly saw you that you were

4011
02:13:27,039 --> 02:13:32,719
looking at um and

4012
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:34,960
it's the it's a game that is better

4013
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:38,880
treated as art and i think

4014
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:40,560
um i won't claim to understand the

4015
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:41,359
creator because that would be a cardinal

4016
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:46,400
sin

4017
02:13:41,359 --> 02:13:46,399
to me of uh as a creative person but uh

4018
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:50,000
it gets to the heart of a lot of the

4019
02:13:48,319 --> 02:13:51,840
things that we've been uh that we've

4020
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,719
been talking about which is the creative

4021
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:54,960
mind

4022
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:56,480
um the game can be interpreted a lot of

4023
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:59,520
ways in a feminist way

4024
02:13:56,479 --> 02:14:01,519
it could be interpreted as story of

4025
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:04,480
friends it could be interpreted

4026
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:05,360
as the story of critics versus a

4027
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:07,198
creative

4028
02:14:05,359 --> 02:14:10,319
the way i like to interpret it and i

4029
02:14:07,198 --> 02:14:14,158
don't want to give out away too much

4030
02:14:10,319 --> 02:14:16,238
is the story of the creative part of

4031
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:17,679
your mind that creates just for the sake

4032
02:14:16,238 --> 02:14:20,479
of creating

4033
02:14:17,679 --> 02:14:21,440
meaning the part that creates for no

4034
02:14:20,479 --> 02:14:24,839
rhyme or reason

4035
02:14:21,439 --> 02:14:28,319
or clear meaning it's almost it's almost

4036
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:30,078
ethereal um versus the part that's

4037
02:14:28,319 --> 02:14:32,880
you could call it the editor you could

4038
02:14:30,078 --> 02:14:36,319
call it the pragmatist you could call it

4039
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:38,400
the necessary force of ego in our

4040
02:14:36,319 --> 02:14:39,920
in our lives we can't totally be egoless

4041
02:14:38,399 --> 02:14:40,960
right but we need to be egoless to be

4042
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:44,480
creative

4043
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:46,399
and how that sort of internal censure

4044
02:14:44,479 --> 02:14:47,919
what role does it play and how do we

4045
02:14:46,399 --> 02:14:50,238
allow our creative minds to be

4046
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:51,440
creative and yet how do we still become

4047
02:14:50,238 --> 02:14:54,238
useful

4048
02:14:51,439 --> 02:14:55,118
because and it's funny that a video game

4049
02:14:54,238 --> 02:14:57,759
right

4050
02:14:55,118 --> 02:14:58,399
could have this fascinating intention

4051
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:01,520
which

4052
02:14:58,399 --> 02:15:04,638
reminds me about the ridiculous question

4053
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:08,079
every once in a while ask about meaning

4054
02:15:04,639 --> 02:15:10,078
and death so this this

4055
02:15:08,078 --> 02:15:11,279
whole this whole ride ends you're at the

4056
02:15:10,078 --> 02:15:13,679
beginning of the ride

4057
02:15:11,279 --> 02:15:14,639
but it could end any day actually that's

4058
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:16,960
that's kind of

4059
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:19,039
the way human life works you could die

4060
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:20,960
today you can die tomorrow

4061
02:15:19,039 --> 02:15:22,960
uh do you think about your immortality

4062
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:25,520
do you think about death

4063
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:26,560
do you meditate on it and in that

4064
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:30,560
context

4065
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:33,360
as the creative but a pragmatist too

4066
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:36,880
as running a startup uh what do you

4067
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:41,198
think is the meaning of this whole thing

4068
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:44,239
yeah so on mortality right um

4069
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:45,439
about about three years ago four years

4070
02:15:44,238 --> 02:15:48,718
ago now

4071
02:15:45,439 --> 02:15:51,598
i was uh excited to go to yale

4072
02:15:48,719 --> 02:15:53,439
i was playing six hours of squash a day

4073
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:56,239
which squash is a sport i love

4074
02:15:53,439 --> 02:15:56,799
so much and i was really getting a lot

4075
02:15:56,238 --> 02:15:58,399
better and

4076
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:01,679
i was even thinking i could maybe walk

4077
02:15:58,399 --> 02:16:01,679
onto the yell team

4078
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:09,279
and uh i woke up one day

4079
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:12,158
i felt really really sick i

4080
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:13,039
went and i decided not to go squash that

4081
02:16:12,158 --> 02:16:17,598
day

4082
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:19,359
and i know um i wanted to i almost did

4083
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:20,639
and you'll see how this story turns out

4084
02:16:19,359 --> 02:16:21,279
so you'll decide if i made the right

4085
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:23,440
choice

4086
02:16:21,279 --> 02:16:25,118
i decided not to go squash today and i

4087
02:16:23,439 --> 02:16:26,319
decided to get my driver's license

4088
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:27,439
uh where i had to get my driver's

4089
02:16:26,319 --> 02:16:28,719
license because i want to get driver's

4090
02:16:27,439 --> 02:16:30,078
license before i

4091
02:16:28,719 --> 02:16:32,000
you know it's just how young i am before

4092
02:16:30,078 --> 02:16:34,159
i went off to college because otherwise

4093
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,840
i might never get it um and i'm going

4094
02:16:34,159 --> 02:16:36,638
back and i successfully got my driver's

4095
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:40,639
license

4096
02:16:36,638 --> 02:16:43,199
for him and i go back to uh

4097
02:16:40,638 --> 02:16:44,318
i go back to my house and i decided i

4098
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:45,679
don't want to drive back because i just

4099
02:16:44,318 --> 02:16:47,599
feel so sick

4100
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:48,799
like things are spinning i have the

4101
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:51,679
worst headache

4102
02:16:48,799 --> 02:16:52,318
i come home i run back right into my bed

4103
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:54,000
and

4104
02:16:52,318 --> 02:16:55,519
feeling really sick to the point where i

4105
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,519
even like asked my mom who

4106
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:59,040
is the doctor i'm like should i should i

4107
02:16:57,519 --> 02:17:00,478
go to the hospital and she's like

4108
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:02,240
you can just wait it out i'm sure and

4109
02:17:00,478 --> 02:17:05,279
she'll get better yeah

4110
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:05,599
i like your mom yeah um and then you

4111
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,599
know

4112
02:17:05,599 --> 02:17:09,599
and then at one point i look at my arms

4113
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:13,040
and they're like covered in this like

4114
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:14,398
red splotchy stuff yeah and i'm like

4115
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:15,359
well i think and she's like yeah we have

4116
02:17:14,398 --> 02:17:17,760
to go

4117
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:18,960
um and so i go there and they're like

4118
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:20,719
you have scarlet fever

4119
02:17:18,959 --> 02:17:21,839
and uh they're like there's nothing we

4120
02:17:20,718 --> 02:17:22,318
can do you should probably just go back

4121
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:25,760
home

4122
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:26,398
so i go back home six hours later i wake

4123
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,318
up

4124
02:17:26,398 --> 02:17:30,159
in the morning they'd let me out at like

4125
02:17:28,318 --> 02:17:31,840
3 a.m um they let me

4126
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:35,280
i come home in the morning and i feel

4127
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:37,439
this like a spear through my chest

4128
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:39,280
and i never felt anything like it and i

4129
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:39,679
was it was very disconcerting when you

4130
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:40,559
have a

4131
02:17:39,679 --> 02:17:42,478
because we're all used to different

4132
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:43,119
source of pain right and that was sort

4133
02:17:42,478 --> 02:17:45,199
of pain

4134
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:46,240
never felt before i suppose an athlete

4135
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:49,679
you're used to like

4136
02:17:46,239 --> 02:17:51,119
feeling pain um so i tell my parents and

4137
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:52,478
immediately we hop back in the car we go

4138
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:53,439
up to the same hospital as that six

4139
02:17:52,478 --> 02:17:55,279
hours ago

4140
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:56,479
and they initially didn't want to let me

4141
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:57,679
in and i was like i have chest pain

4142
02:17:56,478 --> 02:17:58,718
they're like oh come in

4143
02:17:57,679 --> 02:18:00,558
because they're like you're a healthy

4144
02:17:58,718 --> 02:18:02,079
guy wait your turn i'm like no you don't

4145
02:18:00,558 --> 02:18:02,799
understand i have like a pain in my

4146
02:18:02,079 --> 02:18:04,959
chest

4147
02:18:02,799 --> 02:18:07,199
and then they let me in they start doing

4148
02:18:04,959 --> 02:18:08,799
tests on me they like put something like

4149
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:10,639
in my back which is really scary it's a

4150
02:18:08,799 --> 02:18:12,478
huge needle and

4151
02:18:10,638 --> 02:18:14,478
i'm smiling because it's like one of the

4152
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:15,679
ways i reduce stress i guess or deal

4153
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:18,959
with this sort of thing

4154
02:18:15,679 --> 02:18:20,960
and make light of it but like know that

4155
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:23,438
you know it was definitely very scary in

4156
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:25,678
the moment shocking and scary

4157
02:18:23,439 --> 02:18:26,559
and they go and they they do a bunch of

4158
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:29,280
tests and they

4159
02:18:26,558 --> 02:18:29,759
determined that a virus like attacked my

4160
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:32,239
heart

4161
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:33,840
and i had myocarditis and pericarditis

4162
02:18:32,239 --> 02:18:36,879
and they said i had

4163
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:38,000
maybe 25 to 35 chance at one point of

4164
02:18:36,879 --> 02:18:41,119
dying

4165
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:43,439
and so

4166
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:45,040
i'm sitting in my i they met me into the

4167
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:46,479
hospital i'm in the bed in my bed for

4168
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:50,399
about three weeks

4169
02:18:46,478 --> 02:18:53,679
um and i'm just i'm just standing there

4170
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:54,239
and i had this moment also that i

4171
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:57,760
remember

4172
02:18:54,239 --> 02:19:00,959
very specifically where

4173
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:03,040
i was in so much pain

4174
02:19:00,959 --> 02:19:05,119
that like i was crying not out of like

4175
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:07,519
emotional standpoint but actually just

4176
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:10,000
purely out of the pain itself

4177
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:11,599
like i could feel my heart in my chest

4178
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,159
and when i leaned back i felt it

4179
02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:15,760
touch my rib cage and feel horrible so i

4180
02:19:14,159 --> 02:19:16,718
couldn't go to sleep and lean back i had

4181
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:19,280
to lean forward

4182
02:19:16,718 --> 02:19:21,039
all throughout the night right and i'm

4183
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:22,639
feeling my and i'm feeling my chest i'm

4184
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:23,679
feeling this terrible pain in my chest

4185
02:19:22,638 --> 02:19:27,039
and i'm crying

4186
02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:28,558
unstoppably and i mean also maybe i

4187
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:30,399
should mention that at the time

4188
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:31,920
i was someone who like refused to take

4189
02:19:30,398 --> 02:19:33,119
in anything into my body that wasn't

4190
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:35,439
natural

4191
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:36,719
and so a lot of the time i i tried to be

4192
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:39,359
unmedicated

4193
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:41,438
um eventually i i didn't allow them to

4194
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:44,559
add a little medication to my body

4195
02:19:41,439 --> 02:19:47,120
but there's just so much uncertainty and

4196
02:19:44,558 --> 02:19:49,759
pain and the first time i had to come to

4197
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:51,280
terms with mortality

4198
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:53,200
uh first of all i think you still should

4199
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:54,640
have gone play squash i mean come on

4200
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:56,880
i mean yeah i thought you were i thought

4201
02:19:54,639 --> 02:20:02,879
you're serious about this

4202
02:19:56,879 --> 02:20:05,679
you still carry that with you sort of

4203
02:20:02,879 --> 02:20:06,959
there is power to realizing the ride can

4204
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:09,680
end

4205
02:20:06,959 --> 02:20:10,639
right in very suddenly very suddenly

4206
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:14,239
yeah

4207
02:20:10,639 --> 02:20:17,840
and painfully and you know

4208
02:20:14,239 --> 02:20:20,239
it has pragmatic application to like

4209
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:21,040
what you trajectories you take through

4210
02:20:20,239 --> 02:20:24,079
life right

4211
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:25,040
something else that is worth noting is

4212
02:20:24,079 --> 02:20:28,239
that

4213
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:29,520
i for the next year couldn't walk to my

4214
02:20:28,239 --> 02:20:31,680
classes

4215
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:33,359
so i get to yell they put me in a

4216
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:36,720
medical single

4217
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:38,559
alone and i have to get shuttled to all

4218
02:20:36,719 --> 02:20:40,398
my classes i have to ask i had to ask a

4219
02:20:38,559 --> 02:20:41,119
few professors to even move classes so i

4220
02:20:40,398 --> 02:20:44,559
could actually

4221
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:44,960
get there um i can't move my book i

4222
02:20:44,559 --> 02:20:46,959
can't

4223
02:20:44,959 --> 02:20:48,559
lift my book bags i can't i can't walk

4224
02:20:46,959 --> 02:20:52,239
upstairs

4225
02:20:48,559 --> 02:20:54,799
um i spent like 12 hours a day

4226
02:20:52,239 --> 02:20:55,680
in my dorm room just like staring at the

4227
02:20:54,799 --> 02:20:58,318
walls

4228
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:59,600
and more so and more than that all this

4229
02:20:58,318 --> 02:21:03,519
like

4230
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:07,280
you i got to watch my body like

4231
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:08,960
deteriorate and like the muscle like

4232
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:10,399
fall off of it because i was i was

4233
02:21:08,959 --> 02:21:13,438
taking these pills and

4234
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:14,398
they're kind of catabolic um and for an

4235
02:21:13,439 --> 02:21:16,479
18 year old

4236
02:21:14,398 --> 02:21:18,159
i mean i think every 18 year old has

4237
02:21:16,478 --> 02:21:21,519
feelings about their body

4238
02:21:18,159 --> 02:21:21,840
um man or woman and you know just seeing

4239
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:23,760
this

4240
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:24,880
it's like you're watching sort of death

4241
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:26,880
transpire

4242
02:21:24,879 --> 02:21:28,639
and you're also very fatigued because

4243
02:21:26,879 --> 02:21:30,719
your heart's not at

4244
02:21:28,639 --> 02:21:32,639
peak condition and you're thinking about

4245
02:21:30,719 --> 02:21:33,920
the future and a lot of the things you

4246
02:21:32,639 --> 02:21:35,519
enjoy have kind of been stripped away

4247
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:39,680
from you

4248
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:41,600
and i um i took a meditation practice

4249
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:44,000
like started with like five minutes a

4250
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:45,359
day um at my peak i was at like 40

4251
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,280
minutes a day

4252
02:21:45,359 --> 02:21:48,559
kept it up consistently for about two

4253
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:51,359
years

4254
02:21:48,559 --> 02:21:52,879
um and i started thinking about like

4255
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:55,840
what do i want to do

4256
02:21:52,879 --> 02:21:55,839
and like what do i care about

4257
02:21:56,398 --> 02:21:59,519
and to get to your point i think you're

4258
02:21:58,318 --> 02:22:04,398
asking like how does this

4259
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:04,399
carry forward right i think

4260
02:22:04,559 --> 02:22:08,239
i realized that you know there's an end

4261
02:22:06,799 --> 02:22:09,438
and i realized that there are things i

4262
02:22:08,239 --> 02:22:11,119
believe

4263
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:13,280
and things that i believe that might not

4264
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:14,960
be so overtly popular

4265
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:16,319
but that i truly think make the world a

4266
02:22:14,959 --> 02:22:19,759
better place

4267
02:22:16,318 --> 02:22:22,239
and in spite of and then basically

4268
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:23,840
if my conditions provided i wanted to

4269
02:22:22,239 --> 02:22:26,159
make something that

4270
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:26,960
i wanted to do something that would make

4271
02:22:26,159 --> 02:22:29,600
me feel

4272
02:22:26,959 --> 02:22:31,358
sort of whole in that way yeah i mean

4273
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:33,439
that's an amazing journey to take that

4274
02:22:31,359 --> 02:22:36,000
time and to come out on the other end

4275
02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:37,359
um no man that's amazing i did not

4276
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:40,719
realize like that

4277
02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:41,920
there was a long-term struggle i think

4278
02:22:40,719 --> 02:22:45,599
that's

4279
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:47,520
in the end if you do succeed

4280
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:49,359
will have a profound positive impact

4281
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:50,399
because struggle is ultimately like

4282
02:22:49,359 --> 02:22:54,000
humbling

4283
02:22:50,398 --> 02:22:56,079
but also empowering so

4284
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,760
i'm glad to see that but from the

4285
02:22:56,079 --> 02:22:59,840
perspective of the creator of the other

4286
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:03,280
ridiculous question about meaning

4287
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:03,280
do you think about this kind of stuff

4288
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:07,840
is that uh the you know the meaning of

4289
02:23:07,439 --> 02:23:11,280
life

4290
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:13,920
for you the meaning of life for

4291
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:15,200
us descendants of apes in general the

4292
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:17,040
first thing i'd like to say

4293
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:18,640
is that i think part of like when we

4294
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:20,000
talk about the meaning of life the

4295
02:23:18,639 --> 02:23:22,000
part of it is the fact that we get to

4296
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,559
struggle with this question and we get

4297
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:26,719
to

4298
02:23:22,559 --> 02:23:28,959
do it together for a long time and we

4299
02:23:26,719 --> 02:23:30,079
sometimes i think it's accepting that

4300
02:23:28,959 --> 02:23:31,519
there's no meaning at all

4301
02:23:30,079 --> 02:23:34,398
and sometimes i think it's accepting

4302
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:35,920
that or even just parsing the phrase and

4303
02:23:34,398 --> 02:23:39,680
thinking about the meaning of life

4304
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:42,000
i sometimes i'm look i'm very young um

4305
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:43,439
again i hope that anything i say now is

4306
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,280
going to be

4307
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:46,479
very different in the future because i

4308
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:49,840
think i mean

4309
02:23:46,478 --> 02:23:52,159
life has so many meanings that

4310
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:53,760
it'll be crazy to see what i think in 20

4311
02:23:52,159 --> 02:23:56,559
years about the meaning of life and yeah

4312
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:57,439
right from the future cut him some slack

4313
02:23:56,559 --> 02:24:00,559
please do

4314
02:23:57,439 --> 02:24:03,600
um perspective

4315
02:24:00,559 --> 02:24:05,279
perspective having said that you know

4316
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:07,120
i think part of what brings meaning to

4317
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:08,640
my life is things like this where we

4318
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:09,600
think about these things with people who

4319
02:24:08,639 --> 02:24:12,318
are

4320
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:14,318
really really really on the ball and we

4321
02:24:12,318 --> 02:24:15,920
get to connect with these people

4322
02:24:14,318 --> 02:24:17,680
that certainly brings meaning to my life

4323
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:20,879
human connection

4324
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:21,439
yeah this conversation is is just

4325
02:24:20,879 --> 02:24:23,199
another

4326
02:24:21,439 --> 02:24:25,600
like echo of the thing you're trying to

4327
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:28,640
create uh in a digital space

4328
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:30,640
right yes that's the same kind of magic

4329
02:24:28,639 --> 02:24:32,000
from from what i understand about what

4330
02:24:30,639 --> 02:24:33,599
you're trying to create

4331
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:36,239
is the same reason i fell in love with

4332
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:37,680
the long form podcasting like as a fan

4333
02:24:36,239 --> 02:24:40,879
that's why i listened to long-form

4334
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:44,000
podcasts is there something deeply

4335
02:24:40,879 --> 02:24:45,199
human and genuine about the the

4336
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,760
interchange

4337
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:49,200
through their voice but i do think that

4338
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:52,478
connection through text

4339
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:53,760
can be even more powerful like i think

4340
02:24:52,478 --> 02:24:56,079
about letters

4341
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:58,159
i still write letters to russia you know

4342
02:24:56,079 --> 02:25:01,760
there's something powerful in letters

4343
02:24:58,159 --> 02:25:04,239
when you when you put

4344
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:05,920
a lot of yourself in the words you say

4345
02:25:04,239 --> 02:25:07,680
in the words you write

4346
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:09,359
that's powerful you can really

4347
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:12,800
communicate

4348
02:25:09,359 --> 02:25:15,840
not just the actual semantic meaning

4349
02:25:12,799 --> 02:25:16,478
of of uh of the words but like a lot of

4350
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:18,398
who you are

4351
02:25:16,478 --> 02:25:19,840
through those words and create real

4352
02:25:18,398 --> 02:25:23,119
connections so

4353
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:26,159
i hope you succeed there and

4354
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:28,160

bringing out the best in human nature

4359
02:25:34,559 --> 02:25:38,239
in the digital space i think that's a

4360
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:41,120
battleground

4361
02:25:38,239 --> 02:25:42,398

4362
