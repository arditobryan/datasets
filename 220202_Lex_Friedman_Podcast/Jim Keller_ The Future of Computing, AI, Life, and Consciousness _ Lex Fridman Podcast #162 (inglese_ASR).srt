00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,040
the following is a conversation with jim

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,599
keller his second time in the podcast

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,480
jim is a legendary microprocessor

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,480
architect

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,559
and is widely seen as one of the

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,320
greatest engineering minds

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:19,358
of the computing age in a peculiar twist

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,839
of space-time in our simulation jim is

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,320
also

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,518
a brother-in-law of jordan peterson we

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,839
talk about this

12
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,799
and about computing artificial

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,079
intelligence

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,199

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,920
a side note let me say that jim is

22
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,320
someone who on a personal level

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,760
inspired me to be myself there was

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,079
something in his words

25
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,079
on and off the mic or perhaps that he

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,039
even paid attention to me at all

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,960
that almost told me you're all right kid

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,640
a kind of pat on the back that can

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,040
make the difference between a mind that

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,680
flourishes and a mind that is broken

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,799
down

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,720
by the cynicism of the world so i guess

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,720
that's just my brief few words of thank

34
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,478
you to jim and in general

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,640
gratitude for the people who have given

36
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,519
me a chance on this podcast

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840

38
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,000

and now here's my conversation with jim

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,159
keller what's the value and

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,960
effectiveness of theory versus

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,920
engineering

47
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,559
this dichotomy in uh building good

48
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,079
software

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,200
or hardware systems well it's

50
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,559
good designs both i guess that's pretty

51
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,719
obvious

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
but engineering do you mean you know

53
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,118
reduction of practice of known methods

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,478
and then science is the pursuit of

55
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:57,680
discovering things that people don't

56
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,039
understand

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,320
or solving unknown problems definitions

58
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
are interesting here but

59
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,679
i was thinking more in theory

60
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,438
constructing models

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,599
that kind of generalize about how things

62
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,799
work and engineering

63
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,159
is like actually building stuff the

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,400
pragmatic like

65
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,878
okay we have these nice models but how

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,959
do we actually get things to work maybe

67
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,639
economics is a nice example like

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,000
economists have all these models of how

69
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,839
the economy works and

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,560
how different policies will have an

71
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,878
effect but then there's the actual

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,120
okay let's call it engineering of like

73
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,959
actually deploying the policies

74
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
so computer design is almost all

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,759
engineering

76
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,000
and reduction of practice is known

77
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,518
message now

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,439
because of the complexity of the

79
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,039
computers we built

80
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,479
you know you could think you're well

81
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,000
we'll just go write some code

82
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,079
and then we'll verify it and we'll put

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,840
it together and then you find out that

84
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
the combination of all that stuff is

85
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,719
complicated

86
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,560
and then you have to be inventive to

87
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,239
figure out how to do it

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
right so that's that's definitely

89
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,280
happens a lot

90
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,319
and then every so often some big idea

91
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,800
happens

92
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,598
but it might be one person and that idea

93
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,840
is in what

94
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,199
in the space of engineering or is it in

95
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,479
the space well i'll give you an example

96
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,799
so one of the limits of computer

97
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,039
performance is branch predictions

98
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,719
so and there's there's a whole bunch of

99
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,359
ideas about how good you could predict

100
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,439
the branch

101
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
and people said there's a limit to it

102
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,799
it's an asthmatic curve

103
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,799
and somebody came up with a better way

104
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,080
to do branch prediction it was a lot

105
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
better

106
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,719
and he published a paper on it and every

107
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,840
computer in the world now uses it

108
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,840
and it was one idea so the the engineers

109
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,598
who build branch prediction hardware

110
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,319
were happy to drop the one kind of

111
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:45,199
training array and put it in another one

112
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,318
so it was it was a real idea and branch

113
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,439
prediction is

114
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,359
is one of the key problems underlying

115
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,959
all of sort of the lowest level of

116
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
software it boils down to branch

117
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,360
prediction

118
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,719
boils down to uncertainty computers are

119
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
limited by you know single thread

120
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,878
computers limited by two things

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,239
the predictability of the path of the

122
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,359
branches and the predictability of the

123
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,640
locality

124
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,799
of data so we have predictors that now

125
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,559
predict both of those pretty well

126
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,560
yeah so memory is you know a couple

127
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,400
hundred cycles away local cache is

128
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,238
couple cycles away

129
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,879
when you're executing fast virtually all

130
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,518
the data has to be in the local cache

131
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,199
so a simple program says you know add

132
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,959
one to every element in array

133
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,478
it's really easy to see what the stream

134
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,000
of data will be

135
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,000
but you might have a more complicated

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,759
program that you know says get a get an

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,639
element of this array look at something

138
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,160
make a decision

139
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,160
go get another element it's kind of

140
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,600
random and you can think that's really

141
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
unpredictable

142
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,720
and then you make this big predictor

143
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,280
that looks at this kind of pattern and

144
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
you realize

145
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,319
well if you get this data in this data

146
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,918
then you probably want that one

147
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,839
and if you get this one and this one and

148
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,198
this one you probably want that one

149
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,799
and is that theory or is that

150
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,280
engineering like the paper that was

151
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,680
written

152
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,359
was it uh well it was asymptotic kind of

153
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,519
kind of discussion or is it more like

154
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,120
here's a hack that works well

155
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,719
um it's a little bit of both like

156
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,199
there's information theory in it i think

157
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,600
somewhere

158
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,319
okay so that's actually trying to prove

159
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,080
yeah but once once you know the method

160
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,439
implementing it is an engineering

161
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,680
problem

162
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,279
now there's a flip side of this which is

163
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,000
in a big design team

164
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,559
what percentage of people think their

165
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,120
their

166
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,759
their uh their their plan or their

167
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,399
life's work is engineering versus design

168
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,600
inventing things so lots of companies

169
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,239
will reward you for

170
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,840
filing patents yes some many big

171
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,199
companies get stuck because to get

172
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,799
promoted you have to come up with

173
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,400
something new

174
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,478
and then what happens is everybody's

175
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:39,918
trying to do some random new thing

176
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,240
99 which doesn't matter and the basics

177
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,918
get

178
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,680
neglected and or

179
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,758
they get to there's a dichotomy they

180
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,120
think like the cell library and the

181
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,199
basic cad tools

182
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,120
you know or basic you know software

183
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,879
validation methods

184
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
that's simple stuff you know they want

185
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,319
to work on the exciting stuff

186
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,360
and then they they spend lots of time

187
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,560
trying to figure out how to patent

188
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,319
something

189
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,478
and that's mostly useless but the

190
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,360
breakthroughs are on the simple stuff

191
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,719
no no you no you have to do the simple

192
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
stuff really well

193
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,039
if you're brilliant building a building

194
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,720
out of bricks you want great bricks

195
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,719
so you go to two places to sell bricks

196
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,199
so one guy says yeah they're over there

197
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,880
in an

198
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,800
ugly pile and the other guy is like

199
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,399
lovingly tells you about the 50 kinds of

200
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
bricks and how hard they are and how

201
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,079
beautiful they are and

202
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,000
how square they are and you know which

203
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,639
one you can buy bricks from

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,079
which is going to make a better house so

205
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,759
you're talking about the craftsman the

206
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,038
person who understands bricks who loves

207
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,720
bricks who loves their varieties

208
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,439
that's a good word you know good

209
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,120
engineering is great craftsmanship

210
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,719
and when you start thinking engineering

211
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
is about invention

212
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,759
and set up a system that rewards

213
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,360
invention

214
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,598
the craftsmanship gets neglected okay so

215
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,038
maybe one perspective is the theory the

216
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,159
science

217
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,399
over emphasizes invention and

218
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
engineering emphasizes craftsmanship and

219
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,519
therefore

220
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,959
like so if you it doesn't matter what

221
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,399
you do in theory well everybody knows

222
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,918
like read the tech rags they're always

223
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,719
talking about some breakthrough or

224
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,719
intervention

225
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
innovation and everybody thinks that's

226
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,000
the most important thing

227
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,720
but the number of innovative ideas is

228
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,560
actually relatively low we need them

229
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,240
right and innovation creates a whole new

230
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,720
opportunity like when

231
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,840
when some guy invented the internet

232
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,319
right

233
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,079
like that was a big thing the million

234
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
people that wrote software against that

235
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,279
were mostly doing

236
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,159
engineering software writing so the

237
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,758
elaboration of that idea was huge

238
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,840
i don't know if you know brendan ike he

239
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,680
wrote javascript in 10 days

240
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,279
and that's an interesting story it makes

241
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
me wonder

242
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,719
and it was you know famously for many

243
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,598
years considered to be

244
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,599
a pretty crappy programming language

245
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,120
still is perhaps it's been improving

246
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,240
sort of consistently

247
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,439
but the interesting thing about that guy

248
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,478
is

249
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,639
you know he doesn't get any awards you

250
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,680
don't get a nobel prize or a field medal

251
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,960
or

252
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,959
uh a crappy piece of

253
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,239
you know that software code that is

254
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,079
currently the number one programming

255
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,720
language in the world that runs

256
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,079
now is cons increasingly running the

257
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,639
backhand of the internet what does he

258
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,519
end up does he know why everybody uses

259
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,280
it

260
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,240
like that would be an interesting thing

261
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,918
was it the right thing at the right time

262
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
because like when stuff like javascript

263
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,598
came out like there's a move from you

264
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,560
know writing c programs and c

265
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,240
plus plus to let's call what they call

266
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,479
managed code frameworks

267
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,519
where you write simple code it might be

268
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,599
interpreted it has

269
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,440
lots of libraries productivity is high

270
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,278
and you don't have to be an expert

271
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,479
so you know java was supposed to solve

272
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,958
all the world's problems it

273
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,560
was complicated javascript came out you

274
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,439
know after a bunch of other scripting

275
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,679
languages

276
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,360
i'm not an expert on it but yeah but was

277
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,159
it the right thing at the right time

278
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,159
or was there something you know clever

279
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,919
because he wasn't the only one

280
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,360
there's a few elements maybe if he

281
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,240
figured out what it was

282
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,278
no then he'd get a prize like that

283
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,759
destructive theory

284
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:06,639
yeah you know babies probably he hasn't

285
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,919
defined this

286
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,838
or he this needs a good promoter well

287
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,679
i think there was a bunch of blog posts

288
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,040
written about it which is like

289
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:19,278
wrong is right which is like doing the

290
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,278
crappy thing fast

291
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,200
just like hacking together the thing

292
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,200
that answers some of the needs

293
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,879
and then iterating over time listening

294
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,240
to developers like listening to people

295
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,600
who actually use the thing

296
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,519
this is something you can do more in

297
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,278
software

298
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,560
but the right time like you have to

299
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,320
sense you have to have a good

300
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,639
instinct of when is the right time for

301
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,920
the right tool and make it super

302
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,319
simple and just get it

303
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,000
out there the problem is this is true

304
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,879
with hardware this is less true with

305
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,799
software is

306
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,039
this backward compatibility that just

307
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,799
drags behind you as

308
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,679
you know as you try to fix all the

309
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,519
mistakes of the past but the the timing

310
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,719
was good there's something about that it

311
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,360
wasn't accidental

312
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,480
you have to like give yourself over to

313
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,278
the

314
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,440
you have to have this like broad sense

315
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,838
of what's needed now

316
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
and both scientifically and like the

317
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,519
community

318
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,560
and just like this it was obvious that

319
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,839
uh

320
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,399
there was no the interesting thing about

321
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,079
javascript is

322
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,759
everything that ran in the browser at

323
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,559
the time like java

324
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,919
and and i think other like scheme other

325
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,879
programming languages

326
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,479
they were all in a separate external

327
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,879
container

328
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,959
and then javascript was literally just

329
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,399
injected into the web page it was the

330
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,479
dumbest possible thing

331
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,639
running in the same thread as everything

332
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,200
else and like

333
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,759
uh it was inserted as a comment so

334
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,959
javascript code is inserted as a comment

335
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:52,159
in the html code and it was i mean it's

336
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,958
there's it's either genius or super dumb

337
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,799
but it's like

338
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,639
right so it has no apparatus for like a

339
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,479
virtual machine and container

340
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,679
it just executed in the framework the

341
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,920
program is already running

342
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,120
and it was that's cool and then uh

343
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,078
because something about that

344
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,278
accessibility

345
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:10,000
the ease of its use uh

346
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,278
resulted in then developers innovating

347
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,360
on how to actually use it

348
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,720
i mean i don't even know what to make of

349
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,278
that but

350
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,240
it does seem to echo across different

351
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,240
software

352
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
like stories of different software php

353
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,799
has the same story really crappy

354
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,600
language

355
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,479
they just took over the world i always

356
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,320
have a joke that

357
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
the random length instructions that

358
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,560
variable length instructions that's

359
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,199
always one

360
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,319
even though they're obviously worse like

361
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,600
nobody knows why

362
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,040
x86 is arguably the worst architecture

363
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,200
you know on the planet is one of the

364
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,599
most popular ones well i mean isn't

365
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,240
isn't that also the story of risk versus

366
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,480
i mean is that simplicity there's

367
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,159
something about simplicity that

368
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,519
uh us in this evolutionary process

369
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:58,480
is valued if it's simple it's uh

370
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,839
gets it spreads faster it seems like

371
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,000
yeah or is that not always true

372
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,079
that's always true yeah it could be

373
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,399
simple is good but too simple is bad

374
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,559
so why did risk win you think so far did

375
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,639
risk win

376
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,638
in the long arc of history maybe we

377
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,480
don't know so who who's going to win

378
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,759
what what's risk what's cisco who's

379
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,320
going to win in that space

380
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,679
in these instruction sets a ice offers

381
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,360
going to win but

382
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,719
they'll be little computers that run

383
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,759
little programs like normal

384
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,879
all over the place but but

385
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,799
we're we're going through another

386
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,639
transformation so but

387
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,240
you think instruction sets underneath it

388
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,079
all will change

389
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,278
yeah they evolve slowly they don't

390
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,199
matter very much

391
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,278
they don't matter very much okay i mean

392
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,879
the limits of performance are

393
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,278
you know predictability of instructions

394
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:46,159
and data i mean that's the big thing

395
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,919
and then the usability of it is some you

396
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,838
know

397
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,000
quality of design quality of tools

398
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,440
availability

399
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,278
like right now x86 is proprietary with

400
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,360
intel and amd but they can change it any

401
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,759
way they want independently

402
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,519
right arm is proprietary to arm and they

403
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,480
won't let anybody else change it

404
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,278
so it's like a sole point and risk 5 is

405
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,680
open source

406
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,480
so anybody can change it which is super

407
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,319
cool

408
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,079
but that also might mean it gets changed

409
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,278
in too many random ways that there's no

410
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,679
common

411
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,639
sub subset of it that people can use do

412
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,399
you like open

413
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,919
or do you like clothes like if you were

414
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,200
to bet all your money on one or the

415
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,679
other risk five versus

416
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,600
no idea it's case dependent well x86

417
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,958
oddly enough when intel first started

418
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,360
developing it they licensed

419
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,958
like seven people so it was the open

420
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,200
architecture

421
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,359
and then they move faster than others

422
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,720
and also bought one or two of them

423
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,120
but there were seven different people

424
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,879
making x86 because at the time there was

425
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,560
6502 and z80s and you know 8086

426
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,799
and you could argue everybody thought

427
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,198
z80 was the better instruction set

428
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,240
but that was propriety proprietary to

429
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,039
one place

430
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,360
oh and the 6800 so there's like five or

431
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:02,240
four or five different microprocessors

432
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
intel went open got the market share

433
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,120
because people felt like they had

434
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,519
multiple sources from it and then over

435
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,120
time it narrowed down the two players

436
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,399
so why you as a historian uh well

437
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,600
why did intel win for so long

438
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,440
with the with their processors i mean

439
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,879
they were great their process

440
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,959
development was great

441
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,958
oh so it's just looking back to

442
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,359
javascript and brand nike is uh

443
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,879
microsoft and netscape and all these uh

444
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,079
internet browsers

445
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,759
microsoft won the browser game because

446
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:36,879
they aggressively stole

447
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,679
other people's ideas like right after

448
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,838
they did it

449
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,120
you know i i don't know if intel was

450
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,839
stealing other people's ideas

451
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,799
they started making a just good way they

452
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,160
started making

453
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,879
rams random access memories

454
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,799
and then at the time when the japanese

455
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,480
manufacturers came up

456
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,519
you know they were getting out competed

457
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,360
on that and they pivoted the

458
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,278
microprocessors and they made the first

459
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,680
you know integrated microprocessor

460
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:05,120
programs uh 4004 or something

461
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,719
who was behind that pivot that's a hell

462
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,600
of a pivot andy grove

463
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,079
and he was great that's a hell of a

464
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,759
pivot

465
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,919
and then they led semiconductor industry

466
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,360
like they were just a little company ibm

467
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,439
all kinds of big companies had

468
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,039
both loads of money and they out

469
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,199
innovated everybody

470
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:26,159
auto innovated okay yeah yeah so it's

471
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,399
not like marketing it's not yeah

472
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,198
their processor designs were pretty good

473
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,639
um

474
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,719
i think the you know core 2

475
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,000
was probably the first one i thought was

476
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,680
great

477
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,399
it was a really fast processor and then

478
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,838
haswell was great

479
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,278
what makes a great processor in that

480
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,519
delay oh if you just look at it's

481
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:48,000
performance versus everybody else

482
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,679
it's you know the size of it the you

483
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,360
know usability of it

484
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,638
so it's not specific some kind of

485
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,000
element that makes it beautiful it's

486
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,399
just like literally just raw

487
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
performance is that how you think about

488
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,120
processors it's just like

489
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,039
raw performance of course

490
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,159
it's like a horse race the fastest one

491
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,500
wins

492
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,519
now you don't care how

493
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,198
[Laughter]

494
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,560
just as long as it was well there's the

495
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,000
fastest in the environment

496
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,278
like right you know for years you made

497
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,799
the fastest one you could and then

498
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,240
people started to have power limits

499
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,078
so then you made the fastest at the

500
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,278
right power point and then

501
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,439
and then when we started doing

502
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,679
multiprocessors like

503
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,199
if you could scale your processors more

504
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,120
than the other guy you could be 10

505
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,319
faster on like a single thread but you

506
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,959
have more threads

507
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,959
so there's lots of variability and then

508
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,679
arm

509
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,958
really explored like you know they have

510
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,679
the a series and the r

511
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,198
series and the m series like a family of

512
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,120
processors for all these different

513
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,479
design points from like unbelievably

514
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,399
small and simple

515
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,000
and so then when you're doing the design

516
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,278
it's sort of like this big palette of

517
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
cpus

518
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,120
like they're the only ones with a

519
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,320
credible you know top to bottom palette

520
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,600
and what do you mean incredible

521
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,199
top to bottom well there's people who

522
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,639
make microcontrollers that are small but

523
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,319
they don't have a fast one there's

524
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,160
people make fast processors but don't

525
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,959
have a little a medium one or a small

526
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,360
one is it hard to do that full palette

527
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,640
that's

528
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,399
that seems like a it's a lot of

529
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,759
different so what's the difference in

530
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,519
uh the arm folks and intel in terms of

531
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,640
the way they're approaching this problem

532
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,519
well intel almost all their processor

533
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,839
designs were

534
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,798
you know very custom high end you know

535
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,759
for the last 15

536
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,439
20 years the fastest force possible yeah

537
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,359
in one horseshoe

538
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,240
yeah and then architecture they're

539
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,240
really good but the company itself was

540
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,160
fairly insular to what's going on in the

541
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,759
industry with cad tools and stuff

542
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,679
and there's this debate about custom

543
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,000
design versus synthesis

544
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,280
and how do you approach that i'd say

545
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,640
intel was slow on the

546
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,079
getting to synthesize processors arm

547
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,919
came in from the bottom and they

548
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,720
generated ip which went to all kinds of

549
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,240
customers

550
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,759
so they had very little say how the

551
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,038
customer implemented their

552
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,919
ip so arm is super friendly to the

553
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,599
synthesis ip environment whereas intel

554
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,919
said we're going to make this great

555
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,319
client chip server chip with our own cad

556
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,160
tools with our own process with our own

557
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,279
you know other supporting ip and

558
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:15,038
everything only works with our stuff

559
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:17,599
so is that is arm winning the mobile

560
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:19,279
platform space in terms of processors

561
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:21,918
and so

562
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,440
in that and what you're describing is

563
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,960
why they're winning well they

564
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,038
had lots of people doing lots of

565
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,279
different experiments so they controlled

566
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,879
the processor architecture and ip

567
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,639
but they let people put in lots of

568
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,039
different chips and there was a lot of

569
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,559
variability in what happened there

570
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,640
whereas intel when they made their

571
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:39,918
mobile their foray into mobile they had

572
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,038
one team doing one

573
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,840
part right so it wasn't 10 experiments

574
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:48,400
and then their mindset was pc mindset

575
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,759
microsoft software mindset and that

576
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,240
brought a whole bunch of things along

577
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,400
that

578
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,240
the mobile world embedded world don't do

579
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,360
do you think it was possible for intel

580
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,279
to pivot hard and win the mobile

581
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,119
market that's a hell of a difficult

582
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,200
thing to do right for a huge company to

583
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,519
just pivot

584
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,440
i mean it's so interesting to because

585
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,480
we'll talk about your current work

586
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,640
it's like it's clear that pcs were

587
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,240
dominating for several decades

588
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:20,160
like desktop computers and then mobile

589
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,480
it's unclear it's a leadership question

590
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,080
like like apple under steve jobs when he

591
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,798
came back they pivoted multiple

592
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,279
times you know they built ipads and

593
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,839
itunes and phones and tablets and

594
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,200
great macs like like who knew computers

595
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,399
should be made out of aluminum

596
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,640
nobody knew that that they're great it's

597
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,360
super fun that was steve yeah steve jobs

598
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,919
like they pivoted multiple times

599
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,678
and uh you know the old intel they they

600
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,600
did that multiple times

601
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,919
they made drams and processors and

602
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,359
processes and

603
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,440
i got to ask this what was it like

604
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,240
working with steve jobs i didn't work

605
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,519
with him

606
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,679
did you interact with him twice i said

607
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:04,158
hi to him twice in the cafeteria

608
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:07,120
what did he say hi he said hey fellas

609
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,600
he was friendly he was wandering around

610
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,119
and

611
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,959
with somebody he couldn't find the table

612
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,839
because the cafeteria was

613
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,919
was packed and i gave my table but i

614
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,319
worked for mike colbert who talked to

615
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,120
like mike was the unofficial cto of

616
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:20,720
apple

617
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,359
and a brilliant guy and he worked for

618
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,038
steve for 25 years maybe more

619
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,558
and he talked to steve multiple times a

620
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,480
day

621
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,079
and he was one of the people who could

622
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,679
put up with steve's let's say brilliance

623
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,839
and intensity

624
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,038
and and steve really liked him and steve

625
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,959
trusted

626
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:40,879
mike to translate the he thought up

627
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,480
into engineering products at work and

628
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,640
then mike ran a group called platform

629
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,319
architecture and i was in that group

630
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,759
so many times i'd be sitting with mike

631
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,519
and the phone would ring

632
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:50,960
it'd be steve and mike would hold the

633
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,319
phone like this because steve would be

634
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,319
yelling about something or other

635
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,839
yeah and he would translate it and he

636
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,279
translated and then he would say

637
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,199
steve wants us to do this so

638
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,678
was steve a good engineer or no i don't

639
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,759
know he was a great idea guy

640
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,440
idea person he's a really good selector

641
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,119
for talent

642
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,640
yeah so that seems to be one of the key

643
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,759
elements of leadership right

644
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,080
and then he was a really good first

645
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,359
principals guy like like somebody say

646
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,798
something couldn't be done and he would

647
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,158
just think

648
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:23,200
that's obviously wrong right

649
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,960
but you know maybe it's hard to do maybe

650
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,759
it's expensive to do maybe we need

651
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
different people

652
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,079
you know there's like a whole bunch of

653
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,279
you know if you want to do something

654
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,720
hard

655
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,079
you know maybe it takes time maybe you

656
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,558
have to iterate there's a whole bunch of

657
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,158
things

658
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,240
you could think about but saying it

659
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,799
can't be done is stupid

660
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,640
how would you compare so it seems like

661
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,519
elon musk is more

662
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,200
engineering centric but it's also i

663
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,879
think he considers himself a designer

664
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,519
too he has a design mind

665
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,760
steve jobs feels like he is much more

666
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:53,839
idea space design space versus

667
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,000
engineering yeah just make it happen

668
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,038
like the world should be this way just

669
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,359
figure it out but

670
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,679
but he used computers you know he had

671
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,279
computer people talk to him all the time

672
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,720
like mike was a really good computer guy

673
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,720
he knew what computers could do

674
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,480
computer meaning computer hardware like

675
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,960
hardware software all of pieces the

676
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,679
whole thing

677
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,400
and then he would you know have an idea

678
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,240
about what could we do with this next

679
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,759
that was grounded in reality it wasn't

680
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,519
like he was you know just

681
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,879
finger painting on the wall and wishing

682
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,720
somebody would interpret it

683
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,120
like so he had this interesting

684
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,200
connection because

685
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,158
no he wasn't a computer architect or a

686
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,919
designer

687
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,720
but he had an intuition from the

688
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,200
computers we had to what could happen

689
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,000
and essentially you say intuition

690
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,319
because

691
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,720
it seems like he was pissing off a lot

692
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,879
of engineers in

693
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,240
his intuition about what canada can't be

694
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,960
done those

695
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,558
like the what is all these stories about

696
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,038
like floppy disks and all that kind of

697
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,158
stuff like

698
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,158
yeah so in in steve the first round like

699
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,159
he'd go into a lab

700
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,200
and look at what's going on and hate it

701
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,080
and and

702
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,759
uh fire people or or ask somebody in the

703
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,158
elevator what they're doing for apple

704
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,400
and you know not be happy when he came

705
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,240
back my impression was

706
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,080
is he surrounded himself with this

707
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,319
relatively small group of people

708
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,759
yes and didn't really interact outside

709
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,519
of that as much

710
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,679
and then the joke was you'd see like

711
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,639
somebody moving a prototype through the

712
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,880
quad with a

713
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,799
with a black blanket over it and that

714
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,320
was because it was secret

715
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,918
you know partly from steve because they

716
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,798
didn't want steve to see it until it was

717
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,200
ready

718
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,400
yeah the dynamic with johnny ive and

719
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,319
steve

720
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,200
is interesting it's like you don't wanna

721
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:38,319
he ruins as many ideas as he generates

722
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,038
yeah

723
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,000
yeah it's a dangerous kind of line to

724
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,558
walk

725
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,558
if you have a lot of ideas like like

726
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,399
gordon bell was famous for ideas

727
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,759
right and it wasn't that the percentage

728
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,360
of good ideas was way higher than

729
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,599
anybody else

730
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,439
it was he had so many ideas and and he

731
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,759
was also good at talking people about it

732
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,720
and

733
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,960
and getting the filters right and you

734
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,400
know seeing through stuff

735
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,319
whereas elon was like hey i want to

736
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,840
build rockets so

737
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,480
steve would hire a bunch of rocket guys

738
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:11,359
and elon would go read rocket manuals

739
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,440
so ian is a better engineer a sense like

740
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:16,240
or like more uh

741
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,798
like a love and passion for the manuals

742
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,200
yeah

743
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,720
and the details the details the

744
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,640
craftsmanship too right

745
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,159
well i guess you had craftsmanship too

746
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,480
but of a different kind

747
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,919
what do you make of the just the

748
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,360
standard for just a little longer what

749
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,600
do you make of like the anger and the

750
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,158
passion and all that the the firing and

751
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,599
the

752
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,240
mood swings and the madness the

753
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,879
um you know being emotional and all that

754
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,200
that's

755
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,520
steve and i i guess elon too so what is

756
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,240
that a is that a bugger feature

757
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,359
it's a feature so there's a graph which

758
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,038
is

759
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:52,479
uh y-axis productivity yeah x-axis at

760
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,599
zero it's chaos

761
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,038
yeah and infinity is complete order yeah

762
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:02,079
right so as you go from the

763
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,440
you know the origin as you improve order

764
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,519
you improve productivity

765
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,840
yeah and at some point productivity

766
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,679
peaks and then it goes back down again

767
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,359
yeah too much order nothing can happen

768
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,000
yes but the question is

769
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,959
is how close to the chaos is that no no

770
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,640
no here's the thing

771
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,240
is once you start moving the directional

772
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,880
order the force vector to drive you

773
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,200
towards order is unstoppable

774
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,919
oh this is the same every organization

775
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,038
will

776
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,038
move to the place where their

777
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,119
productivity is stymied by order

778
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,119
so you need uh so the question is who's

779
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,278
the counter force

780
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,719
like because it also feels really good

781
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,319
as you get more organized

782
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,640
then productivity goes up the

783
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,960
organization feels it they orient it

784
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,799
towards it right to hire more people

785
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,400
they get more guys who can run process

786
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,679
you get bigger

787
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,278
right and then inevitably inevitably

788
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,880
the organization gets captured by the

789
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,519
bureaucracy that manages all the

790
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,440
processes

791
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,440
right and then humans really like that

792
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,880
and so if you just walk into a room

793
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,880
and say guys love what you're doing

794
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,799
but i need you to have less order

795
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,640
if you don't have some force behind that

796
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,798
nothing will happen

797
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,320
i i can't tell you on how many levels

798
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,038
that's profound so

799
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,960
so that's why i'd say it's a feature now

800
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,319
could you be nicer about it

801
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,278
i don't know i don't know any good

802
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:23,119
examples of being nicer about it

803
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,720
well the funny thing is to get stuff

804
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,239
done you need people who can manage

805
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,600
stuff and manage people because humans

806
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,120
are complicated they need lots of care

807
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,399
and feeding and you need to tell them

808
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,158
they look nice and they're doing good

809
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,798
stuff and pat them on the back

810
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,080
right i don't know do you tell me is

811
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:37,599
that is that needed

812
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,519
humans need that i had a friend he

813
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,599
started to manage the group and he said

814
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,278
i figured it out you have to praise them

815
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,199
before they do anything

816
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,400
i was waiting until they were done and

817
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,679
they're always mad at me

818
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
now i tell them what a great job they're

819
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,200
doing while they're doing it but then

820
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,319
you get stuck in that trap because then

821
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,919
when they're not doing something how do

822
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,839
you confront these people

823
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,520
i think a lot of people that had trauma

824
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,558
in their childhood who disagree with you

825
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,558
successful people

826
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,158
that you just first do the rough stuff

827
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,240
and then be nice later

828
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,760
i don't know okay but you know nice

829
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,000
engineering companies are full of adults

830
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:11,278
who had all kinds of range of childhoods

831
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,038
you know most people had okay childhoods

832
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,558
well i don't know if uh and lots of

833
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:18,480
people only work for praise

834
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:21,038
which is weird you mean like everybody

835
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,599
i'm not that interested in this but uh

836
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:22,798
well you

837
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,000
you're you're probably looking for

838
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:28,480
somebody's approval um

839
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,359
even still yeah maybe i should think

840
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,038
about that

841
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,038
maybe somebody who's no longer with this

842
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,960
kind of thing

843
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,398
i don't know i used to call it my dad

844
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,000
and tell him what i was doing he was he

845
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:38,479
was very excited about engineering and

846
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,919
stuff

847
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,679
you got his approval uh yeah a lot

848
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,520
i was lucky like he he decided i was

849
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,080
smart and unusual as a kid and that was

850
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,759
okay when i was really young

851
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,678
so when i like did poorly in school i

852
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,519
was dyslexic i didn't read until i was

853
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,360
third or fourth grade and they didn't

854
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,558
care my parents were like

855
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:03,278
oh he'll be fine so

856
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:05,038
that was funny that was cool is he still

857
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,880
with us

858
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:12,240
you miss him sure yeah he had

859
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,880
parkinson's and then cancer his last 10

860
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,558
years were tough

861
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,159
and i killed him killing a man like

862
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,278
that's hard

863
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,720
the mind well it's pretty good um

864
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:28,960
parkinson's causes slow dementia and uh

865
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,960
the chemotherapy i think accelerated it

866
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,079
but it was like hallucinogenic dementia

867
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,440
so he was

868
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:37,918
clever and funny and interesting and

869
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,600
was it was pretty unusual do you

870
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,759
remember conversations

871
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,199
uh of course from that time like where

872
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,759
do you have fond memories

873
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,840
of the guy yeah oh yeah anything come to

874
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,839
mind

875
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,278
a friend told me one time i could draw a

876
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,319
computer on the whiteboard faster than

877
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,960
anybody you'd ever met

878
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,720
and i said you should meet my dad like

879
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,159
when i was a kid he'd come home and say

880
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,200
i was driving by this bridge and i was

881
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,480
thinking about it and he pulled out a

882
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,360
piece of paper and he'd draw the whole

883
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,679
bridge

884
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,119
he was a mechanical engineer yeah and he

885
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,399
would just draw the whole thing and then

886
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,558
he would tell me about it and

887
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,319
tell me how you would have changed it

888
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:11,839
and he had this you know

889
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,319
idea that he could understand and

890
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,398
conceive anything and i i just grew up

891
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,398
with that so that was natural

892
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:19,839
so if you know like when i interview

893
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,599
people i ask them to draw a picture of

894
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,119
something they did on a whiteboard

895
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,359
and it's really interesting like some

896
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,639
people draw a little box

897
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,479
you know and then they'll say and then

898
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,159
this talks to this and yeah

899
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,759
i'd be like this is frustrating and i

900
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,480
had this other guy come in one time he

901
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,158
says

902
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,440
well i designed a floating point in this

903
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,640
chip but i'd really like to tell you how

904
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,000
the whole thing works and then tell you

905
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,038
how the floating point works inside of

906
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,119
it do you mind if i do that

907
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,720
he covered two whiteboards yeah like 30

908
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,199
minutes and i hired him

909
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,880
like yeah he was great this is craftsman

910
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,440
i mean that's the craftsmanship to that

911
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,200
yeah but also the the mental agility to

912
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,759
understand the whole thing

913
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,720
right put the pieces in contacts like

914
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,558
you know

915
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,558
real view of the balance of how the

916
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,398
design worked

917
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,079
because if you don't understand it

918
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,918
properly when you start to draw it

919
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,439
you'll fill up half the white board with

920
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,000
like a little piece of it and

921
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,600
you know like your ability to lay it out

922
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,359
in an understandable way it takes a lot

923
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,359
of understanding so

924
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,879
and be able to zoom into the detail and

925
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,278
then zoom out to the zoom

926
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,278
really fast what about the impossible

927
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:22,798
thing you see your dad

928
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:25,359
believed that uh you could do anything

929
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,558
that's a weird feature for a craftsman

930
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,000
yeah

931
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,720
it seems that that uh echoes in your own

932
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,720
behavior

933
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,079
like that's that's the well it's not

934
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,240
that anybody can do anything right now

935
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,519
right it's that if you work at it you

936
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,720
can get better at it

937
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,720
and there might not be a limit

938
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,399
and they did funny things like like he

939
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,519
always wanted to play piano so at the

940
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:48,239
end of his life he started playing the

941
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,079
piano

942
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,440
when he had parkinson's and he was

943
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,879
terrible

944
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,558
but he thought if he really worked out

945
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,240
in this life maybe the next life he'd be

946
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:59,440
better at it

947
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,839
he might be onto something yeah

948
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,720
he enjoyed doing it yeah so that's

949
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,158
pretty funny do you think the

950
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,000
perfect is the enemy of the good in

951
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,200
hardware and software engineering

952
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,119
it's like we were talking about

953
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,600
javascript a little bit and

954
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,798
the messiness of the 10-day building

955
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:16,839
process

956
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,960
yeah it's you know creative tension

957
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:20,558
right

958
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,759
the creative tension is you have two

959
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:26,000
different ideas that you can't do both

960
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,599
right right and then but the fact that

961
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,359
you want to do both

962
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,000
causes you to go try to solve that

963
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:35,199
problem that's the creative part

964
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,960
so if you're building computers like

965
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,319
some people say we have the schedule

966
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,079
and anything that doesn't fit in the

967
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,918
schedule we can't do

968
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,158
right so they throw out the perfect

969
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,759
because they have a schedule

970
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,440
i hate that then there's other people

971
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,480
who say we need to get this perfectly

972
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,798
right

973
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,919
and no matter what you know more people

974
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,038
more money

975
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,240
right and there's a really clear idea

976
00:31:57,038 --> 00:31:59,679
about what you want some people are

977
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,919
going to articulate in it

978
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,120
right so let's call that the perfect

979
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,559
yeah yeah

980
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,158
all right but that's also terrible

981
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,278
because they never ship anything you

982
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,799
never hit any goals

983
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,359
so now you have that now you have your

984
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,639
framework yes you can't throw out stuff

985
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,839
because you can't get it done today

986
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,200
because maybe you get it done tomorrow

987
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,480
or the next project

988
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,919
right you can't so you have to i work

989
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,399
with a guy that i really like working

990
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,360
with

991
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,639
but he over filters his ideas over

992
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,558
filters

993
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,600
he'd start thinking about something and

994
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,759
as soon as he figure out what's wrong

995
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,359
with it you'd throw it out

996
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,640
and then i start thinking about it like

997
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,879
you know you come up with an idea and

998
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,399
then you find out what's wrong with it

999
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,760
and then you give it a little time to

1000
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:38,398
set because sometimes you know you

1001
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,240
figure out

1002
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,398
how to tweak it or maybe that idea helps

1003
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,120
some other idea

1004
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,798
so idea generation is really funny so

1005
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,839
you have to give your ideas space

1006
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,839
like spaciousness of mind is key but you

1007
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,199
also have to execute programs and get

1008
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,639
done

1009
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,159
and then it turns out computer

1010
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,159
engineering is fun because it takes you

1011
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,720
know 100 people to build a computer

1012
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,519
200 to 300 whatever the number is and

1013
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,440
people are so

1014
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:07,599
variable about you know temperament and

1015
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,440
you know skill sets and stuff

1016
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,879
that you know in a big organization you

1017
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,480
find that the people who love the

1018
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,320
perfect ideas and the people that want

1019
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,480
to get stuff done yesterday and

1020
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:17,839
people like to come up with ideas and

1021
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,839
people like to

1022
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,199
let's say shoot down ideas and it takes

1023
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,439
the whole

1024
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,720
it takes a large group of people some

1025
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,320
are good at generating ideas some are

1026
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,880
good at filtering ideas and then

1027
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:32,960
all in that giant mess you somehow

1028
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,880
i guess the goal is for that giant mess

1029
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,720
of people to uh

1030
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,320
find the perfect path through the

1031
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,200
attention the creative tension

1032
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,798
but like how do you know when you said

1033
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
there's some people good at articulating

1034
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:46,000
what perfect looks like what a good

1035
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,960
design is like if you're sitting in a

1036
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,558
in a room and uh you have a set of ideas

1037
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,558
about like how to design uh a better

1038
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,720
processor how do you know

1039
00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:59,678
this is this is something special here

1040
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,278
this is a good idea

1041
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,880
let's try this so have you ever

1042
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:04,398
brainstormed idea with a couple people

1043
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,159
that were really smart

1044
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:07,439
and you kind of go into it and you you

1045
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,000
don't quite understand it

1046
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,878
and you're working on it and then you

1047
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,639
start you know

1048
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:13,918
talking about it putting it on the

1049
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,320
whiteboard

1050
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,480
maybe it takes days or weeks and then

1051
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,359
your brain start to kind of synchronize

1052
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,719
it's really weird and like you start to

1053
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,719
see what each other is thinking

1054
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,480
and yeah and it starts to work like you

1055
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,679
can see work like my talent in computer

1056
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,159
design is i can

1057
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,200
i can see how computers work in my head

1058
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,200
like really well

1059
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,559
and i know other people can do that too

1060
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,319
and when you're working with people that

1061
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:43,440
can do that

1062
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,200
like it is kind of a an amazing

1063
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,358
experience

1064
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,638
and then and every once in a while you

1065
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:49,279
get to that place and then you find the

1066
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,800
flaw

1067
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,119
which is kind of funny because you you

1068
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,919
can you can fool yourself in

1069
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,320
but the two of you kind of drifted along

1070
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,319
yeah

1071
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,880
into the direction that was useless yeah

1072
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,359
that happens too like you have to

1073
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,400
because you know well the nice thing

1074
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:05,440
about computer design there's always

1075
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,920
reduction in practice

1076
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,599
like you come up with your good ideas

1077
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,960
and i know some architects who really

1078
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,320
love ideas

1079
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,838
and then they work on them and they put

1080
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,119
it on the shelf they go work on the next

1081
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,639
idea and put on the shelf they never

1082
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,640
reduce the practice

1083
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,920
so they find out what's good and bad

1084
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,519
because most

1085
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,320
every time i've done something really

1086
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,000
new by the time it's done

1087
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,519
like the good parts are good but i know

1088
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,480
all the flaws like

1089
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,440
yeah would you say your career just your

1090
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,440
own experience

1091
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,119
is your career defined by mostly by

1092
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,800
flaws or by successes

1093
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,000
like if again there's great tension

1094
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,280
between those if you haven't

1095
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,519
tried hard yeah right and done something

1096
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,760
new

1097
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,280
right then you're not going to be facing

1098
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,839
the challenges when you build it then

1099
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,920
you find out all the problems with it

1100
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,440
and but when you look back you see

1101
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,400
problems

1102
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,838
okay oh when i look back um what do you

1103
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,599
think earlier in my career

1104
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:05,920
yeah like eb5 was the second alpha chip

1105
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,480
uh i was so embarrassed about the

1106
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,599
mistake so i could barely talk about it

1107
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,960
and it was in the guinness book of

1108
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,320
worlds records and it was the fastest

1109
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,358
processor on the planet

1110
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,519
yeah so it was and at some point i

1111
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,440
realized that was really a bad

1112
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,719
mental framework to deal with like doing

1113
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,079
something new we did a bunch of new

1114
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:23,279
things and some worked out great and

1115
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,160
some were bad

1116
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,920
and we learned a lot from it and then

1117
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:31,118
the next one we learned a lot

1118
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,880
that also ev6 also had some really cool

1119
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,760
things in it i think the proportion of

1120
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,480
good stuff went

1121
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,760
up but it had a couple of fatal flaws in

1122
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,880
it that were

1123
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,359
painful and then uh

1124
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,559
yeah you learn to channel the pain into

1125
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,598
like pride

1126
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,679
not pride really you know just uh

1127
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,760
realization about how the world works

1128
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,159
okay or how that kind of ideas that

1129
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,480
works

1130
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,279
life is suffering that's the reality

1131
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,000
what uh

1132
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,519
no it's not well i know the buddha said

1133
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,920
that and a couple other people

1134
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:04,079
are stuck on it no it's you know there's

1135
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,599
this kind of weird combination of good

1136
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,119
and bad

1137
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,640
you know light and darkness that you

1138
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,640
have to tolerate and

1139
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:11,838
you know deal with yeah there's

1140
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,480
definitely lots of suffering in the

1141
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:14,078
world

1142
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,000
depends on the perspective it seems like

1143
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,560
there's way more darkness but uh

1144
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,440
that makes the light part really nice

1145
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,960
what uh

1146
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,838
computing hardware

1147
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,320
or just any kind of even software design

1148
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,199
are you

1149
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,039
uh do you find beautiful from your own

1150
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:34,000
work from

1151
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:36,239
other people's work that you're just uh

1152
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,559
we were just talking about the

1153
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,959
the battleground of flaws and mistakes

1154
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:43,119
and errors but things that were just

1155
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,320
beautifully done is there something that

1156
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,838
pops to mind

1157
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:51,200
well when things are beautifully done

1158
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:53,599
usually there's a well thought out set

1159
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,919
of abstraction layers

1160
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,280
so the whole thing works in unison

1161
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,280
nicely yes

1162
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,200
and and when i say abstraction layer

1163
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,359
that means two different components when

1164
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,358
they work together

1165
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,598
they work independently they don't have

1166
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,838
to know what the other one is doing

1167
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,519
so that decoupling yeah so the famous

1168
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:12,960
one was the the network stack like

1169
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,199
there's a seven layer network

1170
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,240
you know data transport and protocol and

1171
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:17,919
all the layers

1172
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:19,838
and the innovation was is when they

1173
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,200
really wrote got that right

1174
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,078
because networks before that didn't

1175
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,960
define those very well the layers could

1176
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,400
innovate independently and occasionally

1177
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,880
the layer boundary would

1178
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,000
you know the interface would be upgraded

1179
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,640
and that that let

1180
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,599
you know the the design space breathe

1181
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,358
and

1182
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,880
you could do something new in layer

1183
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:39,519
seven without having to worry about how

1184
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,640
layer four

1185
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:45,039
worked right and so good design does

1186
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:48,480
that and you see it in processor designs

1187
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:51,838
when we did the zen design at amd

1188
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,320
we made several components very modular

1189
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:56,480
and you know my insistence at the top

1190
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,119
was i wanted all the interfaces to find

1191
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,358
before we wrote the rtl for the pieces

1192
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,599
one of the verification leads said if we

1193
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,440
do this right i can test the pieces

1194
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,280
so well independently when we put it

1195
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,639
together we won't find all these

1196
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,560
interaction bugs because the floating

1197
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,480
point knows how the cache works

1198
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,078
and i was a little skeptical but he was

1199
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,039
mostly right

1200
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,880
that the modularity design greatly

1201
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,400
improved the quality

1202
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,838
is that universally true in general

1203
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,358
would you say about good designs the

1204
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:25,119
modularity is

1205
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,880
like usually talked about this before

1206
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,358
humans are only so smart like

1207
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,920
and we're not getting any smarter right

1208
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:35,440
but the complexity of things is going up

1209
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,920
yeah so you know a beautiful design

1210
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,920
can't be bigger than the person doing it

1211
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,599
it's just you know their piece of it

1212
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,000
like the odds of you doing a really

1213
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,519
beautiful

1214
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,199
design of something that's way too hard

1215
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,920
for you is slow

1216
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,439
right if it's way too simple for you

1217
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,480
it's not that interesting it's like well

1218
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,679
anybody could do that

1219
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,559
but when you get the right match of your

1220
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:58,559
your expertise and you know mental power

1221
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,400
to the right design size

1222
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,159
that's cool but that's not big enough to

1223
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,800
make a meaningful impact in the world

1224
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,799
so now you have to have some framework

1225
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,839
to design the pieces

1226
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,000
so that the whole thing is big and

1227
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:13,440
harmonious

1228
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,838
but you know when you put it together

1229
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,920
it's

1230
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,719
you know sufficiently sufficiently

1231
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,480
interesting to to be used

1232
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:23,039
and you know so that's like a beautiful

1233
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,039
design is

1234
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,920
matching the limits of that human

1235
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,719
cognitive capacity

1236
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,240
to uh to the module you can create and

1237
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,039
creating a nice interface between those

1238
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:34,399
modules

1239
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,960
and thereby do you think there's a limit

1240
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,920
to the kind of beautiful complex systems

1241
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,199
we can build with this kind of modular

1242
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:46,000
design it's like uh

1243
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,439
you know if we build increasingly more

1244
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,440
complicated you can think of like the

1245
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,358
internet

1246
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,200
okay let's scale it up you can think of

1247
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:57,279
like social network like twitter

1248
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:59,598
as one computing system

1249
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,640
and but those are little modules yeah

1250
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,119
right

1251
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,838
but it's built on it's built on so many

1252
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,800
components nobody at twitter even

1253
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:08,559
understands right so

1254
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,318
so so if an alien showed up and looked

1255
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,920
at twitter he wouldn't just see twitter

1256
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:12,960
as a beautiful simple thing that

1257
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,680
everybody uses

1258
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,400
which is really big you would see the

1259
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:18,480
network

1260
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,000
it runs on the fiber optics the data is

1261
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,920
transported the computers the whole

1262
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
thing is so bloody complicated

1263
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,680
nobody twitter understands it and so i

1264
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,280
think that's what the alienware sees

1265
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,838
so yeah if an alien showed up and looked

1266
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,720
at twitter or looked at the various

1267
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:32,639
different

1268
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,879
networked systems that you can see on

1269
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,559
earth so imagine they were really smart

1270
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,519
they could comprehend the whole thing

1271
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:41,039
and then they sort of you know evaluated

1272
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:42,639
the human and thought this is really

1273
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,440
interesting no human on this planet

1274
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,039
comprehends the system they built

1275
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,318
no individual or well would they even

1276
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,719
see individual humans that's the

1277
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:51,039
interest

1278
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,639
like we humans are very human-centric

1279
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,679
entity-centric

1280
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,920
and so we think of us as the organ as

1281
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,679
the central organism and the networks as

1282
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,559
just the connection of organisms

1283
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,919
but from a perspective of an alien from

1284
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:07,039
an outside perspective

1285
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,880
it seems like yeah yeah i get it where

1286
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,279
the ants and they'd see the ant colony

1287
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,960
the ant colony yeah or the result the

1288
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
production of the ant colony which is

1289
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,679
like

1290
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,119
cities and it's it's uh

1291
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,879
yeah in that sense humans are pretty

1292
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,920
impressive the modularity that we're

1293
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,880
able to

1294
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,280
and the and how robust we are to noise

1295
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,640
and

1296
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,920
mutation all that kind of stuff well

1297
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,480
that's because it's stress tested all

1298
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,318
the time

1299
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,760
yeah you know you build all these cities

1300
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:33,199
with buildings and you get earthquakes

1301
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,440
occasionally and

1302
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,439
you know some you know wars earthquakes

1303
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,838
viruses every once in a while

1304
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,559
you know changes in business plans for

1305
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,358
you know like

1306
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,599
shipping or something like like as long

1307
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:48,480
as it's all stress tested then

1308
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,800
it keeps adapting to the the situation

1309
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,480
so

1310
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,160
the that's that's a curious phenomena

1311
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,760
well let's go let's talk about moore's

1312
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:59,118
law a little bit

1313
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,119
uh at the broad view

1314
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,200
of moore's law was just exponential

1315
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,240
improvement of uh

1316
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:07,838
computing capability uh like openai for

1317
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:12,559
example recently

1318
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:14,400
published this kind of papers looking at

1319
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,880
the exponential improvement in the

1320
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,240
training efficiency of neural networks

1321
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,920
for like image net and all that kind of

1322
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,719
stuff we just got better on

1323
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,599
this is purely software aside just

1324
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:25,679
figuring out

1325
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,039
better tricks and algorithms for

1326
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,440
training neural networks

1327
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:31,279
and that seems to be improving uh

1328
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,240
significantly faster than the moore's

1329
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,880
law prediction

1330
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:35,358
you know so that's in the software space

1331
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,400
like

1332
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,679
what do you think if moore's law

1333
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,000
continues or

1334
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,799
if the general version of moore's law

1335
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,719
continues

1336
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,560
do you think that comes mostly from the

1337
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:47,519
hardware from the software some mix of

1338
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,799
the two

1339
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,719
some interesting totally uh so not the

1340
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,920
reduction of the size of the transistor

1341
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:58,159
kind of thing but more in the uh

1342
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,838
in the totally interesting kinds of

1343
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,118
innovations in the hardware space all

1344
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,920
that kind of stuff

1345
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,440
well there's like a half a dozen things

1346
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,318
going on in that graph

1347
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,920
so one is there's initial innovations

1348
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:11,599
that had a lot of had room to be

1349
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,358
exploited

1350
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,838
so you know the efficiency of the

1351
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:18,400
networks has improved dramatically

1352
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,239
and then the decomposability of those

1353
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,838
and the use go you know they started

1354
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,838
running on one computer then multiple

1355
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,599
computers and multiple gpus and then

1356
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:27,599
arrays of gpus and

1357
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,800
they're up to thousands and at some

1358
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,880
point

1359
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,400
so so it's sort of like they were

1360
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,000
consumed they were going from like a

1361
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,559
single computer application to a

1362
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,960
thousand

1363
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:38,400
computer application so that's not

1364
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,318
really a moore's law thing that's an

1365
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,160
independent vector how many computers

1366
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:43,599
can i put on this problem

1367
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:45,039
because the computers themselves are

1368
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,838
getting better on like a moore's law

1369
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:47,759
rate

1370
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,358
but their ability to go from one to ten

1371
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,520
to a hundred to a thousand

1372
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,799
yeah you know was something and then

1373
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,480
multiplied by

1374
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,880
you know the amount of computes it took

1375
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,159
to resolve like alex net to resnet the

1376
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,480
transformers it's

1377
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:01,519
it's been quite you know steady

1378
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,039
improvements

1379
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,800
but those are like s cars aren't they

1380
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:06,318
yeah that's the exactly kind of s-curves

1381
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,519
that are underlying moore's law from the

1382
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,239
very beginning

1383
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:10,719
so so what what's the biggest what's the

1384
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:13,759
most

1385
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:16,078
uh productive uh rich

1386
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,119
source of s-curves in in the future do

1387
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,880
you think is it

1388
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,519
hardware is it software or is it so

1389
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,559
hardware is going to move along

1390
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,480
relatively slowly like you know double

1391
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,799
performance every two years

1392
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,400
there are there's still i like how you

1393
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,200
call that slow yeah that's the slow

1394
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,440
version

1395
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,439
the snail's pace of moore's law maybe we

1396
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,960
should we should

1397
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,639
we should uh trademark that one

1398
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,280
whereas the scaling by number of

1399
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,039
computers you know can go much faster

1400
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,119
you know i'm sure at some point google

1401
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,039
had a you know their initial search

1402
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,680
engine was running on a laptop you know

1403
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,279
like

1404
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:52,960
yeah and at some point they really

1405
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,000
worked on scaling that and then they

1406
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,318
factored

1407
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,519
the indexer from you know this piece and

1408
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,000
this piece and this piece and they

1409
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:00,719
spread the data on more things and you

1410
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,679
know they did

1411
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,199
a dozen innovations but as they scaled

1412
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,358
up the number of computers on that

1413
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,039
it kept breaking finding new bottlenecks

1414
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:09,679
in their software and their schedulers

1415
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:12,400
and

1416
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:14,399
and made them rethink like it seems

1417
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,400
insane to do a scheduler across a

1418
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,079
thousand computers to schedule parts of

1419
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,800
it and then send the results to one

1420
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,240
computer

1421
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,119
but if you want to schedule a million

1422
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:26,078
searches that makes perfect sense

1423
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,000
so so there's the the scaling by just

1424
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,920
quantity is probably the richest

1425
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,000
thing but then as you scale quantity

1426
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,960
like a network that was great on 100

1427
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,039
computers may be

1428
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,440
completely the wrong one you may pick a

1429
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:42,318
network that's 10 times slower

1430
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,838
on 10 000 computers like per computer

1431
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:45,599
but if you go from a hundred to ten

1432
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:46,719
thousand that's a hundred times

1433
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,720
so that's one of the things that

1434
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:51,759
happened when we did internet scaling is

1435
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:53,679
the efficiency went down

1436
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,359
not up the future of computing is

1437
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,000
inefficiency not efficiency

1438
00:46:55,358 --> 00:47:00,480
but scales in efficient scale it's it's

1439
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,639
scaling faster than inefficiency

1440
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,240
bites you and as long as there's you

1441
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:05,598
know dollar value there like scaling

1442
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:07,358
costs lots of money

1443
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,200
yeah but google showed facebook showed

1444
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,078
everybody showed that the scale was

1445
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,199
where the money was

1446
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,039
at it was and so it was worth it

1447
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,838
financially do you think

1448
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:18,719
is it possible that like basically the

1449
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,719
entirety

1450
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,959
of earth will be like a computing

1451
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:24,239
surface like this table will be doing

1452
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,000
computing

1453
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,399
this hedgehog will be doing computing

1454
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,519
like everything really inefficient dumb

1455
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,680
computing would be

1456
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,440
fiction books they call it computronium

1457
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:34,480
computing we turn everything into

1458
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,000
computing

1459
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,318
well most of the elements aren't very

1460
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,159
good for anything like you're not going

1461
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:42,960
to make a computer out of iron like

1462
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,879
you know silicon and carbon have like

1463
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,400
nice structures

1464
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,480
you know we'll we'll see what what you

1465
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,920
can do with the rest of it

1466
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,760
people talk about well maybe we can turn

1467
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,880
the sun into computer but it's

1468
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,839
it's hydrogen and a little bit of helium

1469
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,160
so what i mean is more like actually

1470
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:00,558
just

1471
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:01,519
adding computers to everything oh okay

1472
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,960
so you're just

1473
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:04,719
converting all the mass of the universe

1474
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,400
into a computer no no

1475
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,399
so not using to be ironic from the

1476
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,639
simulation point of view is like

1477
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,920
the simulator build mass to simulate

1478
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,000
like

1479
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,200
yeah i mean yeah so i mean ultimately

1480
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,559
this is all heading towards the

1481
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:17,919
simulation yeah well

1482
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,079
i i think i might have told you the

1483
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,280
story a tesla they were deciding

1484
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,640
so they want to measure the current

1485
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,400
coming out of the battery and they

1486
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:25,759
decide between putting the resistor in

1487
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,400
there

1488
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,359
and putting a computer with a sensor in

1489
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,039
there

1490
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:34,000
and the computer was faster than the

1491
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,838
computer i worked on in 1982.

1492
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,559
and we chose the computer because it was

1493
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:41,119
cheaper than the resistor

1494
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,160
so so sure this hedgehog you know it

1495
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,400
costs 13

1496
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,920
and we can put a you know an ai that's

1497
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,079
the smartest you in there for five bucks

1498
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,159
it'll have one

1499
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,599
you know so computers will be you know

1500
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,279
he'd be everywhere

1501
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,280
i was hoping it wouldn't be smarter than

1502
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,480
me because well everything's going to be

1503
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,079
smarter than you

1504
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,358
but you were saying it's inefficient i

1505
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,680
thought it was better to have a lot of

1506
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:01,598
doubt

1507
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:03,358
well well moore's law will slowly

1508
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,720
compact that stuff so even the dump

1509
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,000
things will be smarter than us

1510
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:07,439
the dump things are going to be smart or

1511
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
they're going to be smart enough to talk

1512
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,519
to something that's really smart

1513
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,838
you know it's like well just remember

1514
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,159
like

1515
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:17,519
a big computer chip yeah you know it's

1516
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:20,799
like an inch by an inch

1517
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,880
and you know 40 microns thick

1518
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,960
it doesn't take very much very many

1519
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,880
atoms to make a high power computer

1520
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,880
yeah and 10 000 of them can fit in the

1521
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,480
shoe box

1522
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,000
but you know you have the the cooling

1523
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,000
and power problems but you know

1524
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,358
people are working on that but they

1525
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,880
still can't write

1526
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:40,880
uh compelling poetry or music or uh

1527
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,240
understand what love is or have a fear

1528
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,079
of mortality so

1529
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,000
so we're still winning neither can most

1530
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,810
of humanity so

1531
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,480
well they can write books about it so uh

1532
00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:53,440
[Laughter]

1533
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,920
but but speaking about this uh you know

1534
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,720
uh

1535
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,000
this walk along the path of innovation

1536
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:59,598
towards uh

1537
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,599
the dumb things being smarter than

1538
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,280
humans you are now

1539
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:08,559
the cto of uh

1540
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:13,680
tens torrent as of two months ago

1541
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:15,440
they uh build hardware for deep learning

1542
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,118
how do you build scalable and efficient

1543
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,960
deep learning this is such a fascinating

1544
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,838
space yeah yeah so it's interesting so

1545
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,199
um

1546
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:22,880
up until recently i thought there was

1547
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,000
two kinds of computers there are serial

1548
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,519
computers

1549
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,039
that run like c programs and then

1550
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,280
there's parallel computers

1551
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,558
so the way i think about it is you know

1552
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,720
parallel computers you

1553
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,640
have given parallelism like gpus are

1554
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,719
great because you have a million pixels

1555
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:39,039
and modern gpus run a program on every

1556
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:42,318
pixel they call the shader program

1557
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,719
right so or like finite element analysis

1558
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:44,079
you

1559
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:45,759
you build something you know you make

1560
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,960
this into little tiny chunks you give

1561
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,480
each chunk to a computer

1562
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,000
so you're giving all these chunks a

1563
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,000
parallel something like that

1564
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,440
but most c programs you write this

1565
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,760
linear narrative

1566
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,599
and you have to make it go fast to make

1567
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,200
it go fast you predict all the branches

1568
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,960
all the data fetches and you run that

1569
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,679
more in parallel but that's found

1570
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,679
parallelism

1571
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,318
ai is i'm still trying to decide how

1572
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,039
fundamental this is

1573
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:12,079
it's a given parallelism problem but the

1574
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,119
way people

1575
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,720
describe the neural networks and then

1576
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,400
how they write them in pi torch it makes

1577
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:19,759
graphs yeah

1578
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,480
that might be fundamentally different

1579
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,200
than the gpu kind of parallelism yeah it

1580
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,079
might be

1581
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:27,199
because the when you run the gpu program

1582
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,440
on all the pixels

1583
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,519
you're running like you know depends you

1584
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,039
know this group of pixels say it's

1585
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,199
background blue and that runs a really

1586
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:37,039
simple program this pixel is

1587
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,960
you know some patch of your face so you

1588
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,400
have some really interesting shader

1589
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,519
program to give you impression of

1590
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,280
translucency

1591
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,920
but the pixels themselves don't talk to

1592
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,400
each other there's no graph

1593
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,920
right so you you do the image and then

1594
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,200
you do the next image and you do the

1595
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,318
next image

1596
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:56,480
and you run 8 million pixels 8 million

1597
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,679
programs every time and modern gpus have

1598
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,719
like 6 000

1599
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,799
thread engines in them so you know to

1600
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:04,719
get 8 million pixels each one runs a

1601
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,680
program on you know 10 or 20

1602
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:09,279
pixels and that's how that's how they

1603
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:12,480
work but there's no graph

1604
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,839
but you think graph might be a totally

1605
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,280
new way to think about hardware so raja

1606
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:18,000
gadori and i've been having this good

1607
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,480
conversation

1608
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,440
about giving versus found parallelism

1609
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,039
and then

1610
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,119
the kind of walk cause we got more

1611
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,079
transistors like you know computers way

1612
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,318
back when did

1613
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,559
stuff on scalar data then we did it on

1614
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,318
vector data famous vector machines

1615
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,160
now we're making computers that operate

1616
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,639
on matrices

1617
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:38,719
right and then the the category we we

1618
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:41,279
said that was next was spatial

1619
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,558
like imagine you have so much data that

1620
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,280
you know you want to do the compute on

1621
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,160
this data

1622
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,920
and then when it's done it says send the

1623
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:49,118
result to this pile of data run some

1624
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,318
software on that

1625
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,680
and it's better to to think about it

1626
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:55,440
spatially than

1627
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:57,440
to move all the data to a central

1628
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,079
processor and do all the work

1629
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,318
so especially i mean moving in the space

1630
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,318
of data as opposed to moving the data

1631
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:07,119
yeah you have a you have a petabyte data

1632
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,480
space spread across some huge array of

1633
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,400
computers

1634
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,159
and when you do a computation somewhere

1635
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,800
you send the result of that computation

1636
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,719
or maybe

1637
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,480
a pointer to the next program some other

1638
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,719
piece of data and do it

1639
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,719
but i think a better word might be graph

1640
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,519
and all the ai neural networks are

1641
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:23,199
graphs

1642
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:25,519
do some computations send the result

1643
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:28,239
here do another computation do a data

1644
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:31,199
transformation do a merging do a pooling

1645
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:32,239
do another computation is it possible to

1646
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,639
compress and say

1647
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:35,838
how we make this thing efficient this

1648
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:39,118
whole process efficient

1649
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:40,799
that's different so first uh

1650
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,318
the fundamental elements in the graphs

1651
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,559
are things like matrix multiplies

1652
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:46,000
convolutions data manipulations and data

1653
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,720
movements

1654
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,599
so gpus emulate those things with their

1655
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:51,279
little singles

1656
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,960
you know basically running a single

1657
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,960
threaded program

1658
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,318
and then there's a you know nvidia calls

1659
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,240
it a work where they group a bunch of

1660
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:01,440
programs that are similar together

1661
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:03,838
so for efficiency and instruction use

1662
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,280
and then at a higher level you kind of

1663
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,039
you take this graph and you say this

1664
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,079
part of the graph is a matrix multiplier

1665
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,759
which runs on these

1666
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,240
32 threads but the model at the bottom

1667
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,920
was

1668
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:17,039
built for running programs on pixels not

1669
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,159
executing graphs

1670
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:22,239
so it's emulation yes so is it possible

1671
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,960
to build something that natively runs

1672
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:26,159
graphs

1673
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,199
yes so that's what ten storm did

1674
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,719
so where are we on that how like in the

1675
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,279
history of that effort

1676
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:34,239
are we in the early days yeah i think so

1677
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,000
tense torrance

1678
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,439
started by a friend of mine labisha

1679
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,760
bajak and i

1680
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,960
i was his first investor so i've been

1681
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,480
you know kind of

1682
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,639
following him and talking to him about

1683
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,000
it for years and

1684
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:47,759
in the fall when i was considering

1685
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,719
things to do

1686
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,000
i decided you know the we we held a

1687
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:54,959
conference last year with a

1688
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,079
friend organized it and and we we wanted

1689
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,760
to bring in thinkers

1690
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,400
and two of the people were andre

1691
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,359
carpassi and chris lattner

1692
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,039
and andre gave this talk on youtube

1693
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:08,318
called software 2.0

1694
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:08,719
which i think is great which is we went

1695
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:10,639
from

1696
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:13,679
programmed computers where you write

1697
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:16,159
programs to data program computers

1698
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:18,239
you know like the futures you know of

1699
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,199
software as data programs the the

1700
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:22,879
networks

1701
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:25,118
and i think that's true and then

1702
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,798
chris has been work he worked on llvm

1703
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,960
the low-level virtual machine which

1704
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:31,199
became the intermediate representation

1705
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,639
for all compilers

1706
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,039
and now he's working on another project

1707
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:38,078
called mlir which is mid-level

1708
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:40,639
intermediate representation which is

1709
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,720
essentially under the graph about how do

1710
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,639
you represent that kind of computation

1711
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:47,679
and then coordinate large numbers of

1712
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,679
potentially heterogeneous computers

1713
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:51,358
and and i would say technically tense

1714
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,919
torrents

1715
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:56,078
you know two pillars are those those

1716
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,159
those two ideas software 2.0 and

1717
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,318
mid-level representation

1718
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:01,679
but it's in service of executing graph

1719
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:03,838
programs

1720
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:04,960
the hardware is designed to do that so

1721
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,279
it's including the hardware

1722
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,318
piece yeah and then the other cool thing

1723
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,920
is

1724
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,079
for a relatively small amount of money

1725
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,200
they did a test chip and two production

1726
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,480
chips

1727
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:18,879
so it's like a super effective teams and

1728
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,639
and unlike some ai startups where if you

1729
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,720
don't build the hardware to run the

1730
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,400
software that they really want to do

1731
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:25,919
then you have to fix it by writing lots

1732
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,480
more software

1733
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,318
so the hardware naturally does matrix

1734
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,760
multiply convolution the data

1735
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:34,798
manipulations

1736
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,839
and the data movement between processing

1737
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,960
elements that

1738
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:40,239
that you can see in the graph which i

1739
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,240
think is all pretty clever

1740
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,959
and that's that's what i'm i'm working

1741
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,919
on now

1742
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,240
so uh the i think it's called the grace

1743
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,519
call

1744
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,000
processor uh introduced last year it's

1745
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:53,199
uh

1746
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,599
you know there's a bunch of measures of

1747
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:58,798
performance we're talking about horses

1748
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,240
it seems to outperform 368 trillion

1749
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,280
operations per second seems to

1750
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,639
outperform nvidia's tesla t4 system so

1751
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,119
these are just numbers

1752
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:09,118
what do they actually mean in real world

1753
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,280
perform like what are the

1754
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,960
metrics for you that you're chasing in

1755
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,680
in your horse race like what do you care

1756
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,519
about

1757
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:19,598
well first so the the native language of

1758
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:21,759
you know people who write ai network

1759
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,920
programs is pie torch now by torch

1760
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,839
tensorflow there's a couple others

1761
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,000
the pi torch is one over tensor flows

1762
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:29,838
it's just i'm not an expert on that

1763
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,280
i i know many people have switched from

1764
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:33,039
tensorflow to pi torch

1765
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,640
yeah and there's technical reasons for

1766
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:36,400
it and i use both

1767
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:38,159
both are still awesome both are still

1768
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,240
awesome but the deepest

1769
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:41,759
love is for pytorch currently yeah

1770
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:42,479
there's more love for that and that that

1771
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,880
may change

1772
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,559
so the first thing is when they write

1773
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,400
their programs

1774
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,319
can the hardware execute it pretty much

1775
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,280
as it was written

1776
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:54,960
right so pi torch turns into a graph we

1777
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,440
have a graph compiler that makes that

1778
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,519
graph

1779
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,960
then it fractions the graph down so if

1780
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,400
you have a big matrix multiply we turn

1781
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,000
it into right-sized chunks that run on

1782
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,680
the processing elements

1783
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,798
it hooks all the graph up it lays out

1784
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:08,399
all the data there's a couple mid-level

1785
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,400
representations of it that are also

1786
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,639
simulatable so that

1787
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,880
if you're writing the code you can see

1788
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:16,318
how it's going to go through the machine

1789
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,720
which is pretty cool and then at the

1790
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,719
bottom it schedules kernels like

1791
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:22,798
math data manipulation data movement

1792
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:25,679
kernels which do this stuff

1793
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:27,440
so we don't have to run write a little

1794
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,879
program to do matrix multiply because we

1795
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,159
have a big matrix multiplier

1796
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,838
like there's no cmd program for that

1797
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:36,480
but there is scheduling for that right

1798
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:39,279
so the the

1799
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,639
one of the goals is if you write a piece

1800
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,839
of pytorch code that looks pretty

1801
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:43,279
reasonable you should be able to compile

1802
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:45,679
it run it on the hardware

1803
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,040
without having to tweak it and and do

1804
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:47,919
all kinds of crazy things to get

1805
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:49,759
performance

1806
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,200
there's not a lot of intermediate steps

1807
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,799
right it's running directly as right

1808
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:55,118
like on a gpu if you write a large

1809
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,719
matrix multiply naively you'll get five

1810
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,559
to ten percent of the peak performance

1811
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:59,759
of the gpu

1812
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,440
right and then there's a bunch there's a

1813
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,640
bunch of people publish papers on this

1814
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,400
and i read them about

1815
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,639
what steps do you have to do and it goes

1816
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,559
from pretty reasonable

1817
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:10,719
well transpose one of the matrices so

1818
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:13,519
you wrote or not column ordered

1819
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:15,519
you know block it so that you can put a

1820
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:19,199
block of the matrix on different

1821
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:21,039
sms you know groups of threads

1822
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:22,960
but some of it gets into little details

1823
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,880
like you have to schedule it just so so

1824
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,440
you don't have registered conflicts

1825
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,920
so the the the they call them cuda

1826
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,920
ninjas

1827
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:33,519
i love it to get to the optimal point

1828
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:36,399
you either write a pre

1829
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:37,838
use a pre-written library which is a

1830
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,079
good strategy for some things

1831
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:42,078
or you have to be an expert in micro

1832
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,760
architecture to program it

1833
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,519
right so the optimization step is way

1834
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,000
more complicated with the gpa so our

1835
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:49,440
our goal is if you write pi torch that's

1836
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,719
good pi torch you can do it

1837
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,679
now there's as the networks are evolving

1838
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,318
you know they've changed from

1839
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:57,598
convolutional to matrix multiply

1840
00:59:56,318 --> 00:59:59,039
people are talking about conditional

1841
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,519
graphs you're talking about very large

1842
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:03,920
matrices they're talking about sparsity

1843
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:06,079
you're talking about problems that scale

1844
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,280
across many many chips

1845
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:11,839
so the the native you know

1846
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,519
data item is a as a packet like so you

1847
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:14,400
send a packet to a processor it gets

1848
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:15,838
processed

1849
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,000
it does a bunch of work and then it may

1850
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:20,400
send packets to other processors and

1851
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
and they execute like a data flow graph

1852
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,480
kind of methodology

1853
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,440
got it we have a big network on chip and

1854
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,358
then 16

1855
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,358
the next second chip has 16 ethernet

1856
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,119
ports they hook lots of them together

1857
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,119
and it's the same graph compiler across

1858
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,400
multiple chips so that's where the scale

1859
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:35,119
comes in so it's built to scale

1860
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,680
naturally

1861
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:39,440
now my experience with scaling is as you

1862
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:40,639
scale you run into lots of interesting

1863
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,280
problems

1864
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:45,039
so scaling is the mountain to climb yeah

1865
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,839
so the hardware is built to do this and

1866
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:47,920
then

1867
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,039
we're in the process of is there a

1868
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,880
software part to this

1869
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:54,558
with ethernet and all that well the

1870
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,480
you know the protocol at the bottom you

1871
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:59,680
know we send you know it's an ethernet

1872
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,519
phi but the protocol basically says

1873
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:02,960
send a packet from here to there it's

1874
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:05,039
all point to point

1875
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,519
the header bit says which processor to

1876
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,440
send it to and we basically

1877
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:11,119
take a packet off our on-chip network

1878
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,358
put an ethernet header on it

1879
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,640
send it to the other end to strip the

1880
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:16,000
header off and send it to the local

1881
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:17,358
thing it's pretty straightforward

1882
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,559
human human interaction is pretty

1883
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:19,838
straightforward too but when you get a

1884
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,839
million of us we could

1885
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:23,279
do some crazy stuff together it could be

1886
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:26,480
fun

1887
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,359
so is that the goal is scale so like for

1888
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,760
example i've

1889
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,759
been recently doing a bunch of robots at

1890
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,400
home for my own personal pleasure

1891
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,680
uh am i going to ever use 10 story or is

1892
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,280
this more for

1893
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:38,719
there's all kinds of problems like

1894
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,000
they're small inference problems or

1895
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:41,358
small training problems there's big

1896
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,599
training problems

1897
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:45,199
what's the big goal is it the big

1898
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,480
difference uh training problems or the

1899
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,159
small training problems

1900
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,679
well one of the goals is to scale from

1901
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:53,039
100 milliwatts to a

1902
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:55,358
to a megawatt you know so like really

1903
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,599
have some range on the problems and

1904
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:59,199
the same kind of ai programs work at all

1905
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,599
different levels

1906
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:03,838
so that's cool the natural since the

1907
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:07,519
natural data item is a packet that

1908
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:10,000
we can move around it's built to scale

1909
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:11,440
but so many people have you know small

1910
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,679
problems

1911
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,679
right right but but uh you know like

1912
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,239
inside that phone is a small problem

1913
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:20,639
to solve so do you see that storm

1914
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,558
potentially being inside a phone well

1915
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:23,679
the power efficiency of local memory

1916
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,240
local computation

1917
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:26,960
and the way we built it is pretty good

1918
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:28,879
and then

1919
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,159
there's a lot of efficiency on being

1920
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,358
able to do conditional graphs and

1921
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:34,480
sparsity

1922
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:36,078
i think it for complicated networks i

1923
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,679
want to go in a small factor it's been

1924
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,920
quite good

1925
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:41,038
um but we have to prove that that's a

1926
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,240
that's a fun problem and that's the

1927
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,640
early days of the company right it's a

1928
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:46,479
couple years you said

1929
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,798
but you think you invested you think

1930
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,199
they're legit yeah as you join yeah well

1931
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:53,119
that's well it's also it's a really

1932
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,679
interesting place to be

1933
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,960
like the ai world is exploding you know

1934
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:58,399
and

1935
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,079
i looked at some other opportunities

1936
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,119
like build a faster processor which

1937
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,760
people want

1938
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,798
yes but that's more on incremental path

1939
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,400
than

1940
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:07,838
what's going to happen in ai in the next

1941
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,480
10 years

1942
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:12,239
so this is kind of you know an exciting

1943
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,159
place to be part of

1944
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:15,519
the revolutions will be happening in the

1945
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:16,639
very space and then

1946
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:18,239
lots of people are working on it but

1947
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:19,358
there's lots of technical reasons why

1948
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:20,239
some of them you know aren't going to

1949
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:23,038
work out that well

1950
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:25,358
and and you know that's that's

1951
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:27,440
interesting and there's also the same

1952
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:28,798
problem about getting the basics right

1953
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,000
like we've talked to customers about

1954
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:32,318
exciting features

1955
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,760
and at some point we realized that each

1956
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:35,199
unit was realizing

1957
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,960
they want to hear first about memory

1958
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:37,679
bandwidth local bandwidth compute

1959
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,760
intensity

1960
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:41,838
programmability they want to know the

1961
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,599
basics power management

1962
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:45,920
how the network ports work what are the

1963
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,119
basics do all the basics work

1964
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,960
because it's easy to say we got this

1965
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:53,440
great idea that you know the crack gbt3

1966
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,000
but the the people we talked to want to

1967
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,240
say

1968
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,358
if i buy that so we have a pc express

1969
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,519
card

1970
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:01,279
with our chip on it if you buy the card

1971
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:02,719
you plug it in your machine you download

1972
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,960
the driver how long does it take me to

1973
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:06,480
get my network to run

1974
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,240
right right you know that's a real

1975
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,400
question it's a very basic question

1976
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:12,318
so yeah is there an answer to that yet

1977
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,280
or is it trying to our goal is like an

1978
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:16,719
hour

1979
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:19,119
okay when can i buy a tesla uh

1980
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:21,038
pretty soon for my for the small case

1981
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,838
training yeah pretty soon

1982
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:26,000
months good i love the idea of you

1983
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:29,759
inside the room with the

1984
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:33,599
carpathi andre kapathi and chris ladner

1985
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:35,920
uh very um

1986
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,039
very interesting very brilliant people

1987
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,880
very out of the box

1988
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,039
thinkers but also like first principles

1989
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,599
thinkers well they both

1990
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,200
get stuff done they only get stuff done

1991
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:47,599
to get their own projects done they

1992
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:48,879
they talk about it clearly they educate

1993
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,720
large numbers of people and they've

1994
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,000
created platforms for other people to go

1995
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,558
do their stuff on

1996
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,159
yeah the the clear thinking that's able

1997
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,359
to be communicated is kind of

1998
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:02,078
impressive it's kind of remarkable to

1999
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:02,400
yeah i'm a fan well let me ask because

2000
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,640
uh

2001
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,160
i talked to chris actually a lot these

2002
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:07,759
days he's been uh

2003
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:09,598
one of the cool just to give him a shout

2004
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:14,160
out and he's been

2005
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:16,559
so supportive as a human being so

2006
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,318
everybody's quite different like great

2007
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,880
engineers are different but he's been

2008
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:21,038
like

2009
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,160
sensitive to the human element in a way

2010
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,000
that's been fascinating

2011
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:26,639
like he was one of the early people on

2012
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,920
this stupid podcast that i do to say

2013
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:31,038
like

2014
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,798
don't quit this thing and also

2015
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,079
talk to whoever the hell you want to

2016
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:36,400
talk to

2017
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,359
that kind of from a legit engineer to

2018
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,000
get like

2019
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:40,400
props and be like you can do this that

2020
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,920
was

2021
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,440
i mean that's what a good leader does

2022
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,838
right they just kind of

2023
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,639
let a little kid do his thing like go go

2024
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:49,119
do it let's see

2025
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:51,118
let's see see what turns out that that's

2026
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:54,400
a that's a pretty powerful thing but

2027
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,440
what do you um what's your sense about

2028
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,200
he used to be

2029
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,720
he no i think stepped away from google

2030
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,838
right

2031
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:03,759
he said sci-fi i think uh

2032
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:05,519
what what's really impressive to you

2033
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,880
about the things that chris has worked

2034
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:08,239
on because it's that we mentioned the

2035
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,838
optimization

2036
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:13,598
the compiled design stuff the llvm uh

2037
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:16,400
then there's he's also a google work

2038
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:19,599
that the tpu stuff

2039
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,280
he's obviously worked on swift so the

2040
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,880
programming language side

2041
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,720
talking about people that work in the

2042
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,039
entirety of the stack yeah

2043
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:27,759
uh what uh from your time interacting

2044
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,680
with chris

2045
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,000
and knowing the guy what's really

2046
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:37,038
impressive to you it just inspires you

2047
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,119
well well like llvm became

2048
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,400
you know the platform the de facto

2049
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,559
platform for

2050
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,680
you know compilers like it's it's

2051
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,119
amazing

2052
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:46,798
and you know it was good code quality

2053
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,640
good design choices he hit the right

2054
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,318
level of abstraction

2055
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:51,920
there's a little bit of the right time

2056
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:53,358
in the right place

2057
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,358
and then he built a new programming

2058
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:57,598
language called swift

2059
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:59,679
which you know after you know let's say

2060
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:01,039
some adoption resistance became very

2061
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:02,719
successful

2062
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,799
i don't know that much about his work at

2063
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:07,279
google although i know that

2064
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:08,079
you know that was the typical they

2065
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,000
started

2066
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,440
tensorflow stuff and they you know it

2067
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,119
was new is you know

2068
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,280
they wrote a lot of code and then at

2069
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,920
some point it needed to be refactored

2070
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,519
to be you know because it its

2071
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,280
development slowed down why

2072
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:23,440
pytorch started a little later and then

2073
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,839
passed it so he did a lot of work on

2074
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,880
that

2075
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:28,400
and then his idea about mlir which is

2076
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,480
what people started to realize is the

2077
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:33,440
complexity of the software stack above

2078
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,679
the low level ir was getting so high

2079
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,159
that forcing the features of that into a

2080
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:38,159
level

2081
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:40,399
was was putting too much of a burden on

2082
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,440
it so he's splitting that into multiple

2083
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,798
pieces

2084
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,720
and that was one of the inspirations for

2085
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:46,559
our software stack where we have

2086
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:48,639
several intermediate representations

2087
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,839
that are all executable

2088
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:52,400
and you can look at them and do

2089
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:53,838
transformations on them before you lower

2090
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,400
the level

2091
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:58,159
so that was i think we started before

2092
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,240
moir

2093
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:01,358
really got you know far enough along to

2094
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:03,038
use

2095
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:04,639
uh but we're interested in that he's

2096
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,640
really excited about that malaya

2097
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:08,000
he's that's that's his like little baby

2098
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:10,078
so he you know

2099
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,920
and there seems to be some profound

2100
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:14,880
ideas on that that are really useful so

2101
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,560
so each one of those things has been

2102
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,319
as the world of software gets more and

2103
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,159
more complicated how do we

2104
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,679
create the right abstraction levels to

2105
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:23,358
simplify it in a way that

2106
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,960
people can now work independently on

2107
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,719
different levels of it

2108
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,480
so i would say all all three of those

2109
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:31,600
projects allovm

2110
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:32,479
swift and mlir did that successfully so

2111
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,000
i'm interested what's

2112
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,519
what he's going to do next in the same

2113
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,960
kind of way yes

2114
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:43,199
so on either the tpu or maybe the

2115
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,600
nvidia gpu side how does 10 story you

2116
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,079
think

2117
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,960
or the ideas underlying it doesn't have

2118
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:50,479
to be testosterone

2119
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:54,719
just this kind of graph focused

2120
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:57,439
uh graph centric hardware

2121
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,119
deep learning-centric hardware beat

2122
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,798
nvidia's

2123
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:02,238
do you think it's possible for it to

2124
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:05,278
basically overtake nvidia

2125
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,399
sure what's what's that process look

2126
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:09,199
like what's that

2127
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:11,119
a journey look like you think well gpus

2128
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,318
were built around shader programs on

2129
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:15,039
millions of pixels

2130
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:17,199
not to run graphs yes so there's a

2131
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:20,238
hypothesis that says

2132
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:22,079
the way the graphs you know are built

2133
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:24,000
is going to be really interesting to be

2134
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:26,719
inefficient on computing this

2135
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,359
and then the the primitives is not a cmd

2136
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,079
program

2137
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:32,239
it's matrix multiply convolution and

2138
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:33,600
then the data manipulations are fairly

2139
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:35,439
extensive about

2140
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,880
like how do you do a fast transpose with

2141
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,639
a program i don't know if you've ever

2142
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,319
written the transpose program

2143
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,920
they're ugly and slow but in hardware

2144
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,798
you can do really well

2145
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,560
like i'll give you an example so when

2146
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:47,679
gpu accelerators first started doing

2147
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,440
triangles

2148
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,039
like so you have a triangle which maps

2149
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,559
on the set of pixels

2150
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:53,838
so you build it's very easy

2151
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,679
straightforward to build a hardware

2152
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:56,880
engine that will find all those pixels

2153
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,119
and it's kind of weird because you walk

2154
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,480
along the triangle to get to the edge

2155
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:02,238
and then you have to go back down to the

2156
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:04,000
next row and walk along and then you

2157
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:06,639
have to decide on the edge

2158
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,920
if the line of the triangle is like half

2159
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,600
on the pixel

2160
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,960
what's the pixel color because it's half

2161
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,960
of this pixel and half the next one

2162
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,560
that's called rasterization

2163
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,480
because you're saying that could be done

2164
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:19,679
in uh in hardware now

2165
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:21,919
that's an example of that operation as a

2166
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,199
software program is really bad

2167
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,600
i've written a program that did

2168
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:27,359
rasterization the hardware that does it

2169
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,039
has actually less code than

2170
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:31,519
the software program that does it and

2171
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:34,238
it's way faster

2172
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,159
right so there are certain times when

2173
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:37,678
the abstraction you have rasterize a

2174
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:39,599
triangle

2175
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,119
you know execute a graph you know

2176
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,960
components of a graph

2177
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:44,640
the right thing to do in the hardware

2178
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,679
software boundary is for the hardware to

2179
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,000
naturally do it

2180
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,000
and so the gpu is really optimized for

2181
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,158
the rasterization of triangles

2182
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,560
well no that's just well like in a

2183
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:57,039
modern you know

2184
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,080
that's a small piece of modern gpus what

2185
01:10:57,039 --> 01:10:59,920
they did is

2186
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:01,679
that they still rasterize triangles when

2187
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,399
you're running the game but for the most

2188
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,920
part

2189
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:05,759
most of the computation in the area the

2190
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,000
gpu is running shader programs

2191
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,440
but they're single threaded programs on

2192
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,198
pixels not graphs

2193
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:14,158
let's be honest to say i don't actually

2194
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:15,439
know the the math behind shader

2195
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:17,599
shading and lighting and all that kind

2196
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:19,279
of stuff i don't know what

2197
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,280
they look like little simple floating

2198
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:23,039
point programs or complicated ones you

2199
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:23,599
can have 8 000 instructions in a shader

2200
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:25,760
program

2201
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,840
but i i don't have a good intuition why

2202
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,039
it could be parallelized so easily

2203
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,039
no it's because you have 8 million

2204
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:31,840
pixels in every single so when you have

2205
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:35,279
a light

2206
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,800
right yeah that comes down the angle you

2207
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:38,719
know the amount of light

2208
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,400
like like say this is a line of pixels

2209
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:42,000
across this table

2210
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:43,599
right the amount of light on each pixel

2211
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,198
is subtly different

2212
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,960
and each pixel is responsible for

2213
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:48,879
figuring out what figure it out so that

2214
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,719
pixel says on this pixel i know the

2215
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,239
angle of the light i know the occlusion

2216
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,679
i know the color i am

2217
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:55,279
like every single pixel here is a

2218
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,039
different color every single pixel gets

2219
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:58,639
a different amount of light

2220
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:00,399
every single pixel has a subtly

2221
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,159
different translucency

2222
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:04,158
so to make it look realistic the

2223
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:05,039
solution was you run a separate program

2224
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:06,639
on every pixel

2225
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:08,479
see but i thought there's a reflection

2226
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,199
from all over the place is every picture

2227
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:11,198
yeah but there is

2228
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:14,000
so so you build a reflection map which

2229
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:15,359
also has some pixelated thing

2230
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,039
and then when the pixel is looking at

2231
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,039
the reflection map it has to calculate

2232
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:21,119
what the normal of the surface is

2233
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:22,640
and it does it per pixel by the way

2234
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:23,679
there's both loads of hacks on that

2235
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,719
you're like you may have a lower

2236
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:26,800
resolution

2237
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:29,039
light map reflection map there's all

2238
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,039
these you know attacks they do

2239
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:32,800
but at the end of the day it's per pixel

2240
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:35,519
computation

2241
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,079
and it so happened that you can map uh

2242
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,640
graph

2243
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:39,279
like computation onto the this pixel

2244
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,360
essentially

2245
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:43,279
you could do floating point programs on

2246
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:46,079
convolutions and matrices

2247
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:48,079
and nvidia invested for years in cuda

2248
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,279
first for hpc and then they got lucky

2249
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:51,439
with the ai

2250
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:53,198
trend but do you think they're going to

2251
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:57,198
essentially not be able to

2252
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:59,759
hardcore pivot out of their we'll see

2253
01:12:57,198 --> 01:13:01,119
that's always interesting how often do

2254
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,679
big companies hardcore pivot

2255
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:06,238
occasionally

2256
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:06,880
how much do you know about nvidia folks

2257
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:09,919
so

2258
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,279
some yeah well i'm i'm curious as well

2259
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,359
who's ultimately as a

2260
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,719
well they've innovated several times but

2261
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:17,198
they've also worked really hard on

2262
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,960
mobile they worked really hard on radios

2263
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:20,479
you know you know they're fundamentally

2264
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,239
a gpu company

2265
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:24,639
well they tried to pivot it's an

2266
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:27,198
interesting little uh

2267
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,320
game and play in autonomous vehicles

2268
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:30,158
right with

2269
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,759
or semi-autonomous like playing with

2270
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:34,719
tesla and so on and seeing

2271
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,520
that's a dipping a toe into that kind of

2272
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,198
pivot

2273
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,719
they came out with this platform which

2274
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:40,319
is interesting technically

2275
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:42,000
yeah but it was like a three thousand

2276
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:43,759
watt you know

2277
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
you know thousand watt three three

2278
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,960
thousand dollar you know gpu platform

2279
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,920
i don't know if it's interesting

2280
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,039
technically it's interesting

2281
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,119
philosophically i

2282
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:53,279
i technically i don't know if it's the

2283
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:55,119
execution that craftsmanship was there

2284
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:56,319
i'm not sure but that i didn't get a

2285
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:58,319
sense they were

2286
01:13:56,319 --> 01:14:00,238
repurposing gpus for an automotive

2287
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:01,519
solution right it's not a real pivot

2288
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:02,079
they didn't they didn't build a

2289
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,960
ground-up

2290
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:06,399
solution right like the like the chips

2291
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,920
inside tesla are pretty cheap like

2292
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:09,439
mobile eye has been doing this

2293
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,119
they're they're doing the classic work

2294
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:12,399
from the simplest thing yeah you know

2295
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:15,039
they were building 40 mil

2296
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:16,079
square millimeter chips and nvidia their

2297
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:18,158
solution had two

2298
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:19,840
800 millimeter chips and two 200

2299
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:21,439
millimeter chips and

2300
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,679
you know like boatloads are really

2301
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:25,519
expensive drams and

2302
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:26,960
and you know it's a really different

2303
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,880
approach

2304
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,119
the mobilelite fit the let's say

2305
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,719
automotive cost and form factor

2306
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:34,559
and then they added features as it was

2307
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,560
economically viable and

2308
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,640
nvidia said take the biggest thing and

2309
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,400
we're gonna go make it work

2310
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,400
you know and and that's also influenced

2311
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:44,000
like waymo there's a whole bunch of

2312
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:46,719
autonomous startups where they have a

2313
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,198
5000 watt server in their trunk

2314
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:51,119
right and but that's that's because they

2315
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:51,678
think well 5000 watts and you know 10

2316
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,119
000

2317
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:56,239
is okay because it's replacing the

2318
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:57,920
driver elon's approach was that port has

2319
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:59,678
to be cheap enough

2320
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,520
to put it in every single tesla whether

2321
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:02,158
they turn on it autonomous driving or

2322
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,120
not

2323
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:06,960
which and mobileye was like we need to

2324
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:08,079
fit in the bomb and you know cost

2325
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,319
structure that

2326
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:12,238
car companies do so they may sell you a

2327
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:16,319
gps for 1500 bucks

2328
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:19,119
but the bond for that's like 25

2329
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:20,238
well and uh for mobile eye it seems like

2330
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:22,238
neural networks

2331
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:24,000
were not first-class citizens like the

2332
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:27,439
computation they didn't start out as

2333
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,359
a yeah it was a cv problem yeah and did

2334
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,119
classic cv and found stop lights and

2335
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:33,279
lines and they were really good at it

2336
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:34,800
yeah and they never i mean i don't know

2337
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,559
what's happening now but they never

2338
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,880
fully pivoted i mean it's like it's the

2339
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,880
nvidia thing and then

2340
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,920
as opposed to so if you look at the new

2341
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,600
tesla work

2342
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,359
it's like neural networks from the

2343
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,960
ground up yeah right

2344
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:48,960
yeah and even tesla started with a lot

2345
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,279
of cv stuff in it and andre's basically

2346
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,480
been

2347
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:55,198
eliminating it move it move

2348
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:56,158
everything into the network so uh

2349
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:58,079
without

2350
01:15:56,158 --> 01:15:59,920
this isn't like confidential stuff but

2351
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,079
you sitting on a porch

2352
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,520
looking over the world looking at the

2353
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,079
work that andre is doing

2354
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:08,080
that elon's doing with tesla autopilot

2355
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:09,279
uh do you like the trajectory of where

2356
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:11,119
things are going on the floor

2357
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:12,399
they're making serious progress i like

2358
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:14,640
the videos of people

2359
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:16,399
driving the beta stuff like it's taking

2360
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,679
some pretty complicated intersections

2361
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:20,719
and all that but it's

2362
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:22,158
it's still an intervention for drive i

2363
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,960
mean i i have autopilot the current

2364
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:24,719
autopilot my

2365
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,239
my tesla i use it every day do you have

2366
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,640
full self-driving beta or no

2367
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:30,079
no so you you like where this is going

2368
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,159
we're making progress it's taking longer

2369
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:35,519
than anybody thought

2370
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:38,238
you know my wonder was

2371
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,960
is you know hardware three is it enough

2372
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:41,519
computing

2373
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,239
off by two off by five off by ten off by

2374
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,520
a hundred

2375
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:47,039
yeah and and i i thought it probably

2376
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,640
wasn't enough

2377
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:52,079
but they're doing pretty well with it

2378
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,760
now yeah and one thing is

2379
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:55,600
the data set gets bigger the training

2380
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,199
gets better and then there's this

2381
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,280
interesting thing is

2382
01:16:57,198 --> 01:17:01,198
you sort of train and build an arbitrary

2383
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:03,039
size network that solves the problem

2384
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:04,719
and then you refactor the network down

2385
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:08,719
to the thing that you can afford

2386
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:10,640
to ship right so the the goal isn't to

2387
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:12,880
build the network that fits in the phone

2388
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,719
it's to build something that actually

2389
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,119
works

2390
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:19,679
and then then how do you make that most

2391
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:21,279
effective on the hardware you have

2392
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,359
and they seem to be doing that much

2393
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,198
better than a couple years ago

2394
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,039
well the one really important thing is

2395
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:29,279
also what they're doing well is

2396
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:31,039
how to iterate that quickly which means

2397
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:32,639
like it's not just about one time

2398
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:34,079
deployment one building is constantly

2399
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,920
entering the network

2400
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:37,439
and trying to automate as many steps as

2401
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,239
possible right

2402
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:42,238
and that's actually the principles of

2403
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:43,439
the software 2.0 like you mentioned with

2404
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:46,799
andre

2405
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:48,399
is uh it's not just

2406
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,800
i mean i don't know what the actual his

2407
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:52,559
description of software 2.0 is

2408
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,000
if it's just high-level philosophical or

2409
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,400
their specifics but the

2410
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,158
interesting thing about what that

2411
01:17:56,399 --> 01:18:01,759
actually looks in the real world

2412
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:04,000
is it's that uh what i think andre calls

2413
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,000
the data engine it's like

2414
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,079
it's the iterative improvement of the

2415
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,279
thing you have a neural network

2416
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:13,119
that uh does stuff fails on a bunch of

2417
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:14,158
things and learns from it over and over

2418
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:15,840
and over so you're constantly

2419
01:18:14,158 --> 01:18:19,279
discovering edge cases

2420
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,319
so it's very much about uh like data

2421
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:22,479
engineering like

2422
01:18:20,319 --> 01:18:23,840
figuring out it's it's kind of what you

2423
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:25,599
were talking about with testosterone is

2424
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,960
you have the data landscape

2425
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,120
they have to walk along that data

2426
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,840
landscape in a way that uh

2427
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:33,519
that's constantly improving the the the

2428
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,279
neural network and that that feels like

2429
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:39,040
that's the central piece of it yeah

2430
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:40,800
itself and there's two pieces of it like

2431
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:42,238
you you find edge cases that don't work

2432
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,079
and then you define something that goes

2433
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:45,519
get your data for that

2434
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:47,439
but then the other constraint is whether

2435
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,440
you have to label it or not like the

2436
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:51,359
the amazing thing about like the gpt3

2437
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:52,799
stuff is it's unsupervised

2438
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:54,479
so there's essentially infinite amount

2439
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,760
of data now there's obviously infinite

2440
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:57,279
amount of data

2441
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,119
available from cars of people

2442
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,119
successfully driving

2443
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:03,198
but you know the the current pipelines

2444
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,479
are mostly running on labeled data which

2445
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:08,559
is human limited

2446
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:12,079
so when that becomes unsupervised

2447
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:14,080
right it it'll create unlimited amount

2448
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:16,158
of data which then they'll scale

2449
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:18,079
now the networks that may use that data

2450
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:19,519
might be way too big for cars

2451
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:20,960
but then there'll be the transformation

2452
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,239
from now we have unlimited data i know

2453
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,920
exactly what i want

2454
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:25,678
now can i turn that into something that

2455
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,279
fits in the car

2456
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:29,119
and that pro that process is going to

2457
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:30,399
happen all over the place

2458
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:32,559
every time you get to the place where

2459
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:34,000
you have unlimited data and that's what

2460
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,239
software 2.0 is about

2461
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,920
unlimited data training networks to do

2462
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:41,198
stuff

2463
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:43,039
without humans writing code to do it and

2464
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:45,839
ultimately also trying to discover like

2465
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:47,519
you're saying the self-supervised

2466
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,520
formulation of the problem so the

2467
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,520
unsupervised formulation of the problem

2468
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,120
like uh you know in driving there's this

2469
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:56,719
really interesting

2470
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:58,960
thing which is you look at a scene

2471
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:01,840
that's before you and you have data

2472
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,319
about what a successful human driver did

2473
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,239
in that scene you know one second later

2474
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:09,359
it's a little piece of data that you can

2475
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:11,519
use just like with gpt-3 as training

2476
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:13,279
currently even even though tesla says

2477
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,480
they're using that it's an open question

2478
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:16,479
to me

2479
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:18,079
how much how far can you can you sell

2480
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:21,119
all of the driving with just

2481
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:24,238
that self-supervised piece of data

2482
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,439
and like i i think that's what comedy is

2483
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:27,119
doing

2484
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:28,960
that's what common ai is doing but the

2485
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,198
question is how

2486
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,239
how much data so what comedy ai doesn't

2487
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:35,039
have

2488
01:20:32,238 --> 01:20:36,718
is as good of a data engine for example

2489
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:39,920
as tesla does that's where the

2490
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:41,198
like the organization of the data i mean

2491
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,840
as far as i know i haven't talked to

2492
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:44,960
george

2493
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:47,760
but they do have the data the question

2494
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,439
is how much data is needed

2495
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,360
because we say infinite very loosely

2496
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:52,638
here uh it's it's

2497
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:55,439
and then the other question which you

2498
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:57,520
said i don't know if you think it's

2499
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:59,279
still an open question is

2500
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,920
are we in the right order of magnitude

2501
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:04,639
for the compute necessary

2502
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,440
that is is this is it like what elon

2503
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:07,359
said this

2504
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:08,479
chip that's in there now is enough to do

2505
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:10,639
full self-driving

2506
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:12,319
or do we need another order of magnitude

2507
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:13,199
i think nobody actually knows the answer

2508
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:16,158
to that question

2509
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:17,439
i like the confidence that elon has but

2510
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:18,879
yeah we'll see

2511
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:20,799
and there's another funny thing is you

2512
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,159
don't learn to drive with infinite

2513
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,760
amounts of data

2514
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:26,079
you learn to drive with an intellectual

2515
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:29,199
framework that understands physics and

2516
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:30,319
color and horizontal surfaces and laws

2517
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:33,919
and roads and

2518
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:36,639
you know all your your uh experience

2519
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,480
from manipulating your environment

2520
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,840
like look there's so many factors go

2521
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:41,439
into that so then when you learn to

2522
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,199
drive

2523
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:45,759
like driving is a subset of this

2524
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:47,678
conceptual framework that you have

2525
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:49,440
right and so with self-driving cars

2526
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:51,520
right now we're teaching them to drive

2527
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:53,599
with driving data

2528
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,280
you never teach a human to do that you

2529
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,560
teach a human all kinds of interesting

2530
01:21:55,279 --> 01:21:58,238
things like

2531
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,000
language like don't do that you know

2532
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:01,759
watch out you know there's all kinds of

2533
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,158
stuff going on well this is where you i

2534
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,520
think previous time with we talked about

2535
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:08,559
where you poetically uh disagreed with

2536
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,400
my naive

2537
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:14,239
uh notion about humans i just think that

2538
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:15,759
humans will will make this whole driving

2539
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:18,158
thing really difficult

2540
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,280
yeah all right like i said humans don't

2541
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:20,879
move that slow

2542
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:22,559
it's a ballistics problem it's a

2543
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,000
ballistic human zero ballistics problem

2544
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,760
which is like poetry to me

2545
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,279
it's very it's very possible that in

2546
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,560
driving they're indeed purely a

2547
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:29,840
ballistics problem i

2548
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,600
and i think that's probably the right

2549
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,159
way to think about it but

2550
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,800
i still they still continue to surprise

2551
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:37,119
me those

2552
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,719
and damn pedestrians the cyclists other

2553
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:40,079
humans and other cars

2554
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,560
and yeah but it's going to be one of

2555
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:44,800
these compensating things so

2556
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,400
like when you're driving you have an

2557
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,719
intuition about what humans are going to

2558
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:48,960
do

2559
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,960
but you don't have 360 cameras and

2560
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,679
radars and you have an attention problem

2561
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,920
so yeah

2562
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:56,319
so so the self-driving car comes in with

2563
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,039
no attention problems 360 cameras right

2564
01:22:56,319 --> 01:22:58,880
you know

2565
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:00,399
a bunch of other features yeah so

2566
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,600
they'll wipe out a whole class of

2567
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:04,479
accidents

2568
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,840
right and you know you know emergency

2569
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,439
braking with radar and

2570
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,079
especially as it gets you know ai

2571
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:11,519
enhanced will eliminate collisions

2572
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:13,119
right but then you have the other

2573
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,520
problems of these unexpected things

2574
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:15,039
where

2575
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,760
you know you think your human intuition

2576
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:19,600
is helping but then the cars also have

2577
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,360
you know a set of hardware features that

2578
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,159
you're not even close to

2579
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:25,198
and the key thing of course is uh if you

2580
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:27,198
wipe out

2581
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:28,399
a huge number of kind of accidents then

2582
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:31,119
it might be just way

2583
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:32,799
safer than the human driver even though

2584
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:35,279
even if humans are still a problem

2585
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,960
that's hard to figure out yeah that's

2586
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:37,599
probably what happens autonomous cars

2587
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,198
will have

2588
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,880
a small number of accidents humans would

2589
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:43,839
have avoided but they'll wipe

2590
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:45,359
they'll get rid of the bulk of them what

2591
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,560
do you think about

2592
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:50,399
uh like tesla's dojo efforts

2593
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,080
or it can be bigger than tesla in

2594
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:53,679
general it's kind of like the tense

2595
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:55,920
torrent

2596
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:57,279
uh trying to innovate like this is the

2597
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,119
dichotomy like

2598
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:00,319
should a company try to from scratch

2599
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:03,198
build its own

2600
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:04,158
neural network training hardware well

2601
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:06,799
first i think it's great

2602
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:08,158
so we need lots of experiments right and

2603
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,600
there's lots of

2604
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:11,359
startups working on this and they're

2605
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,800
pursuing different things

2606
01:24:11,359 --> 01:24:14,399
you know i was there when we started

2607
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,199
dojo and it was sort of like

2608
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:17,839
what's the unconstrained computer

2609
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:21,599
solution

2610
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:23,520
to go do very large training problems

2611
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,600
and then there's fun stuff like you know

2612
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,040
we said well we have this 10 000 watt

2613
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,039
board to cool

2614
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:30,560
well you go talk to guys at spacex and

2615
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:32,000
they think 10 000 watts is a really

2616
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,560
small number not a big number

2617
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,439
yeah and and there's brilliant people

2618
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,280
working on it i'm

2619
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:38,879
curious to see how it'll come out i i

2620
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:40,639
couldn't tell you you know

2621
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,639
i know it pivoted a few times since i

2622
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:44,560
left so so the

2623
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,840
cooling does seem to be a big problem i

2624
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,679
do like what

2625
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:49,199
elon said about it which is like we

2626
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:50,560
don't want to do the thing

2627
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:52,319
unless it's way better than the

2628
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:55,840
alternative whatever the alternative

2629
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:59,119
is so it has to be way better than like

2630
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,920
racks of gpus yeah and the other thing

2631
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:02,319
is just like

2632
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,760
you know you know the tesla autonomous

2633
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:06,399
driving hardware

2634
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,760
it was only serving one software stack

2635
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:09,679
and the hardware team and the software

2636
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,880
team were tightly coupled

2637
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,719
you know if you're building a general

2638
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,239
purpose ai solution then you know

2639
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,319
there's so many different customers with

2640
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:18,879
so many different needs

2641
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:19,679
now something andre said is i think this

2642
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,920
is amazing

2643
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:25,760
10 years ago like vision recommendation

2644
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,039
language were completely different

2645
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,719
disciplines

2646
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:30,800
we said the people literally couldn't

2647
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,960
talk to each other and three years ago

2648
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,639
it was all neural networks but the very

2649
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,399
different neural networks

2650
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:38,800
and recently it's converging on one set

2651
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:40,399
of networks they vary a lot in size

2652
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:43,119
obviously they vary in data

2653
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:44,799
varying outputs but the technology has

2654
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:47,359
converged a good bit

2655
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,560
yeah these transformers behind gbt3 it

2656
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:50,158
seems like they could be applied to

2657
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,520
video they could be applied to a lot of

2658
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:52,399
yeah and it's like and they're all

2659
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,560
really

2660
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:55,759
it was like to literally replace letters

2661
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:59,360
with pixels

2662
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:01,199
yeah it does vision it's amazing so

2663
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:03,359
and then size actually improves the

2664
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,719
thing so the bigger it gets the more

2665
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:05,599
compute you throw at it the better it

2666
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,039
gets

2667
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,280
the more data you have the better it

2668
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:11,198
gets so

2669
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:13,039
so so then you start to wonder well is

2670
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:15,519
that a fundamental thing or is

2671
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:16,800
is this just another step to some

2672
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:18,639
fundamental understanding about this

2673
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,639
kind of computation

2674
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,920
which is really interesting us humans

2675
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:23,199
don't want to believe that that kind of

2676
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,399
thing will achieve conceptual

2677
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,079
understandings you were saying like

2678
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:26,879
you'll figure out physics but maybe it

2679
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:30,238
will

2680
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,960
maybe probably will well it's worse than

2681
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:32,559
that

2682
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,560
it'll understand physics in ways that we

2683
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,440
can't understand i like to hear stephen

2684
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,639
will from

2685
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:38,799
talk where he said you know there's

2686
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,639
three generations of physics there was

2687
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,560
physics by reasoning well big things

2688
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,880
should false faster than small things

2689
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,880
right

2690
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,800
that's reasoning and then there's

2691
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:49,119
physics by equations

2692
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,239
like you know but the number of programs

2693
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:52,158
in the world that are solved with the

2694
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,519
single equations relatively low almost

2695
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:55,359
all programs have you know

2696
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,639
more than one line of code maybe 100

2697
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:58,559
million lines of code

2698
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:00,719
so you said that now we're going to

2699
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,400
physics by equation which is his project

2700
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:04,319
which is cool

2701
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:05,599
i might point out that there was there

2702
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,679
was two

2703
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,800
two generations of physics before

2704
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:11,520
reasoning

2705
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:14,079
habit like all animals you know know

2706
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:15,920
things fall and you know birds fly and

2707
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:17,760
you know predators know how to you know

2708
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,880
solve a differential equation to cut off

2709
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,239
a

2710
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:24,960
accelerating you know curving animal

2711
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:26,959
path yep and then there was uh you know

2712
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:30,079
the gods did it

2713
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:33,119
right so yeah right so

2714
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:36,000
you know there's five generations now

2715
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:38,238
software 2.0 says programming things is

2716
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,198
not the last step

2717
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:42,638
data so there's going to be a physics

2718
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:47,039
past stephen's

2719
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:47,039
wolfram's com that's not explainable

2720
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:51,920
and and actually there's no reason that

2721
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:53,119
i can see while that even that's the

2722
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,520
limit

2723
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:56,719
like there's something beyond that i

2724
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,639
mean they're usually like usually when

2725
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,920
you have this hierarchy it's not like

2726
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,880
well if you have this step in this step

2727
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,880
in this step and they're all

2728
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,319
qualitatively different

2729
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,920
and conceptually different it's not

2730
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:07,679
obvious why you know six is the right

2731
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,039
hand number of hierarchy steps in not

2732
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:11,119
seven or eight or

2733
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:13,679
well then it's probably impossible for

2734
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:16,000
us to to comprehend

2735
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:18,158
something that's beyond the thing that's

2736
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,399
not explainable

2737
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:21,839
yeah because i think but the thing that

2738
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:23,359
you know understands the thing that's

2739
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:26,639
unexplainable to us

2740
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:29,439
we'll conceive the next one and like i'm

2741
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:33,920
not sure why there's a limit to it

2742
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:36,719
uh your brain hurts that's the sad story

2743
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:38,399
if if we look at our own brain which is

2744
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:41,840
an interesting uh

2745
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:42,479
illustrative example in your work with

2746
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,800
testor

2747
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:45,759
and trying to design deep learning

2748
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,880
architectures

2749
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:50,000
uh do you do you think about the brain

2750
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,480
at all

2751
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,359
maybe from a hardware designer

2752
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:55,519
perspective

2753
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:57,359
if you could uh change something about

2754
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:00,800
the brain what would you change

2755
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:02,719
or do funny question like how would you

2756
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,239
so your brain is really weird like you

2757
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,920
know your cereal cortex where we think

2758
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:08,559
we do most of our thinking

2759
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,440
is what like six or seven neurons thick

2760
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,280
yeah like

2761
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:13,039
that's weird like all the big networks

2762
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:16,079
are way bigger than that

2763
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:17,920
like way deeper so that seems odd

2764
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:20,719
and then you know when you're thinking

2765
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:22,639
if it's if if the input generates a

2766
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:25,119
result you can lose it goes really fast

2767
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:26,639
but if it can't that generates an output

2768
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:28,319
that's interesting which turns into an

2769
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:30,000
input and then your brain

2770
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:31,759
to the point where you mold things over

2771
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,158
for days and how many trips through your

2772
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,039
brain

2773
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:36,399
is that right like it's you know 300

2774
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:37,679
milliseconds or something to get through

2775
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:40,158
seven levels of neurons

2776
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:42,000
i forget the number exactly but then it

2777
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:43,279
does it over and over and over as it

2778
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,359
searches

2779
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:47,039
and the brain clearly is looks like some

2780
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:48,479
kind of graph because you have a neuron

2781
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:49,840
with you know connections and it talks

2782
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:51,759
to other ones and

2783
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,920
it's locally very computationally

2784
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:56,239
intense but it's also

2785
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,679
does sparse computations across a pretty

2786
01:29:56,238 --> 01:30:00,158
big area

2787
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:01,279
there's a lot of messy biological type

2788
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:03,839
of things and it's

2789
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:05,519
it's meaning like first of all there's

2790
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,440
mechanical chemical and electrical

2791
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:11,120
signals that's all that's going on

2792
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:13,519
then the there's a the asynchronicity

2793
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:15,039
of signals and there's like there's just

2794
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,120
a lot of variability that seems

2795
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:19,920
continuous and messy and just a

2796
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:21,119
mess of biology and it's unclear whether

2797
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,920
that's a

2798
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:25,359
good thing yeah or it's a bad thing

2799
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,960
because if

2800
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:29,198
if it's a good thing that we need to run

2801
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,639
the entirety of the evolution

2802
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:32,719
well we're going to have to start with

2803
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:35,119
basic bacteria to create some imaging

2804
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:37,279
we could you could build a brain with 10

2805
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:39,198
layers would that be better or worse

2806
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:40,479
or more more connections or less

2807
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:42,479
connections or you know

2808
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:44,079
we don't know to what level our brains

2809
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:46,158
are optimized

2810
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:47,439
but if i was changing things like yeah

2811
01:30:46,158 --> 01:30:48,079
like you know you can only hold like

2812
01:30:47,439 --> 01:30:50,559
seven numbers

2813
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:51,760
in your head yeah like why not 100 or a

2814
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,239
million

2815
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,920
never thought of that like and why can't

2816
01:30:54,238 --> 01:30:57,599
like why can't we have like a floating

2817
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,199
point processor that can compute

2818
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,440
anything we want

2819
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:02,960
like and see it all properly like that

2820
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:04,879
would be kind of fun

2821
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,560
and why can't we we see in four or eight

2822
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,800
dimensions

2823
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,840
like because you know 3d is kind of a

2824
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,760
drag

2825
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,760
like all the hard mass transforms are up

2826
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:15,039
in multiple dimensions

2827
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,760
so there's that you know you could

2828
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:20,158
imagine a brain architecture that

2829
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:22,159
you know you could enhance with a whole

2830
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:23,519
bunch of features that would be

2831
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:25,119
you know really useful for thinking

2832
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,960
about things it's possible that the

2833
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:27,679
limitations you're describing are

2834
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,840
actually

2835
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:32,000
essential for like the constraints are

2836
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:35,600
essential for creating

2837
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,560
like the depth of intelligence like that

2838
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,840
the ability to reason you know it's hard

2839
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,920
to say because

2840
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,880
like your brain is clearly a parallel

2841
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,199
processor

2842
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,800
you know you know 10 billion neurons

2843
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:48,319
talking to each other at a relatively

2844
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,719
low clock rate

2845
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:52,479
but it produces something that looks

2846
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:54,480
like a serial thought process

2847
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:56,158
it's a serial narrative in your head

2848
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:58,238
that's true right but then

2849
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:59,839
there are people famously who are visual

2850
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:02,079
thinkers like

2851
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:03,760
i think i'm a relatively visual thinker

2852
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:06,238
i can imagine any object

2853
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,600
and rotate it in my head and look at it

2854
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:09,439
and there are people who say they don't

2855
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,199
think that way at all

2856
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:13,839
and recently i read an article about

2857
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:16,079
people people who say they don't have a

2858
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,960
they don't have a voice in their heads

2859
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:19,439
they

2860
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,960
can talk but when they you know it's

2861
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:22,238
like well what are you thinking

2862
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,239
they'll they'll describe something

2863
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:27,839
that's visual

2864
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,839
so that's curious

2865
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:34,238
now if if you're saying

2866
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,600
if we dedicated more hardware to holding

2867
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:38,079
information like you know

2868
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,600
10 numbers or a million numbers like

2869
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:41,840
would that

2870
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,360
just distract us from our ability to

2871
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,679
form this kind of

2872
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:46,880
singular identity like it dissipates

2873
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:49,279
somehow right

2874
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:51,279
but but maybe you know future humans

2875
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:53,119
will have many identities that

2876
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:54,559
have some higher level organization but

2877
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:55,439
can actually do lots more things in

2878
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,039
parallel

2879
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:58,638
yeah there's no reason if we're thinking

2880
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:00,560
modularly there's no reason we can't

2881
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:01,359
have multiple consciousnesses in one

2882
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,039
brain

2883
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:05,519
yeah and maybe there's some way to make

2884
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:07,840
it faster so that the

2885
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:10,080
you know the the area the computation

2886
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,079
could

2887
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:15,599
could still have a unified feel to it

2888
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:17,439
but while still having way more ability

2889
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,280
to do parallel stuff at the same time

2890
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:20,479
could definitely be improved it could be

2891
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:22,800
improved okay

2892
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:24,238
well it's it's pretty good right now

2893
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:26,719
actually people don't give it enough

2894
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:28,879
credit the thing is pretty nice the

2895
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,800
the you know the the fact that the right

2896
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:34,480
ends seem to be

2897
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:37,840
on give a nice like spark

2898
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:39,119
of uh beauty to the whole experience

2899
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,119
i don't know i don't know if it can be

2900
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:42,399
improved easily it could be more

2901
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:45,039
beautiful

2902
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:46,158
i don't know how yeah what do you mean

2903
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:48,479
what do you mean how

2904
01:33:46,158 --> 01:33:49,439
all the ways you can't imagine no but

2905
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:51,279
that's the whole point

2906
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:52,719
i wouldn't be able to i'm at the fact

2907
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:55,439
that i can imagine ways in

2908
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:55,760
in in which it could be more beautiful

2909
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:58,158
means

2910
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,280
so do you know you know ian banks his

2911
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:03,039
stories

2912
01:33:59,279 --> 01:34:04,719
so the the super smart ais there

2913
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:07,359
live mostly live in the world of what

2914
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:10,719
they call infinite fun

2915
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:13,599
because they can create arbitrary

2916
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:15,439
worlds so they interact and you know the

2917
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,719
story has it they interact in the normal

2918
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:18,479
world and they're very smart and they

2919
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,319
can do all kinds of stuff

2920
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:21,678
and you know a given mind can you know

2921
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:23,840
talk to a million humans at the same

2922
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:25,520
time because we're very slow and

2923
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,440
for reasons you know artificial the

2924
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,719
story they're interested in people and

2925
01:34:27,439 --> 01:34:31,678
doing stuff but

2926
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,960
they mostly live in this this other land

2927
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:35,920
of thinking

2928
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:37,920
my inclination is to think that the

2929
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,960
ability to create infinite fun will

2930
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:43,359
um will not be so fun

2931
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:46,079
that's sad there are so many things to

2932
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:48,639
do imagine be able to make a star

2933
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:50,559
move planets around yeah yeah but

2934
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:51,199
because we can imagine that as wildlife

2935
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,119
is fun

2936
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:54,960
if we can if we actually were able to do

2937
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:56,639
it it'd be a slippery slope

2938
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:58,960
where fun wouldn't even have a meaning

2939
01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:01,920
because we just consistently

2940
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,920
desensitize ourselves by the infinite

2941
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,158
amounts of fun we're having

2942
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,359
and the sadness uh the the dark stuff is

2943
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:10,319
what makes it fun

2944
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:11,118
i think i mean that could be the russian

2945
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:12,559
it could be the

2946
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:16,399
could be the fun makes it fun and the

2947
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,400
sadnesses makes it bittersweet

2948
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:20,319
yeah that's true fun could be uh the

2949
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:22,480
thing that makes it fun

2950
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:24,238
so what do you think about the expansion

2951
01:35:22,479 --> 01:35:27,198
not through the biology side but through

2952
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:28,879
the bci the brain computer interfaces

2953
01:35:27,198 --> 01:35:31,439
yeah you got a chance to check out the

2954
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:35,039
neural link stuff it's super interesting

2955
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:37,439
like like humans like like our thoughts

2956
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:39,439
to manifest as action

2957
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:41,599
you know like like as a kid you know

2958
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:44,238
like shooting a rifle was super fun

2959
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,000
driving a mini bike doing things and

2960
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:48,000
then computer games i think

2961
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,158
for a lot of kids became the thing where

2962
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,960
they you know they can do what they want

2963
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:52,719
they can fly a

2964
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,239
plane they can do this they can do this

2965
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:56,000
right but you have to

2966
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:57,519
have this physical interaction now

2967
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,158
imagine

2968
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:02,159
you know you could just imagine stuff

2969
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:05,359
and it happens

2970
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:07,198
right like really richly

2971
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:08,479
and interestingly like we kind of do

2972
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:10,638
that when we dream like dream

2973
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:12,799
dreams are funny because like if you

2974
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:14,239
have some control or awareness in your

2975
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:17,039
dreams

2976
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:17,759
like it's very realistic looking or not

2977
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:20,000
realistic

2978
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,320
it depends on the dream but you can also

2979
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,479
manipulate that

2980
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:25,599
and you know what what's possible there

2981
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:26,959
is is

2982
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,039
is odd and the fact that nobody

2983
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,760
understands it's hilarious but

2984
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:33,920
um do you think it's possible to expand

2985
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:36,960
that capability through computing

2986
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:38,399
sure is there some interesting so from a

2987
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,399
hardware designer perspective

2988
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,000
is there do you think you'll present

2989
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:42,638
totally new challenges and the kind of

2990
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,880
hardware that

2991
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:45,760
required that like so this hardware

2992
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,319
isn't

2993
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,440
standalone computing well this just

2994
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:51,599
knows

2995
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:52,719
today computer games are rendered by

2996
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,199
gpus

2997
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:55,920
right right so but you've seen the gans

2998
01:36:55,198 --> 01:36:59,198
stuff

2999
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:01,359
yep right where trained neural networks

3000
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:03,599
render realistic images but there's no

3001
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:06,079
pixels no triangles no shaders

3002
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,719
no light maps no nothing so the future

3003
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:09,840
of

3004
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:12,480
graphics is probably ai right yes

3005
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,039
now that ai is heavily trained by lots

3006
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:16,319
of real

3007
01:37:13,039 --> 01:37:17,198
data right so if you have an interface

3008
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,238
with a

3009
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:23,279
aai renderer right

3010
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:24,959
so if you say render a cat it won't say

3011
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:26,238
well how tall is the cat and how big it

3012
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,600
you know it'll render a cat and you

3013
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:29,118
might say well a little bigger a little

3014
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:31,199
smaller you know

3015
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:32,799
make it a tabby shorter hair you know

3016
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:34,559
like you could tweak it

3017
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,920
like the the amount of data you'll have

3018
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,280
to

3019
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:40,000
send to interact with a very powerful ai

3020
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:43,279
renderer

3021
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,719
could be low but the question is for

3022
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:47,679
brain computer interfaces

3023
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:48,000
would need to render not onto a screen

3024
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:51,118
but

3025
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,479
render onto the brain and

3026
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:53,839
like directly so that there's a

3027
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:55,839
bandwidth you could do it both ways i

3028
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,960
mean our eyes are really good sensors

3029
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:00,560
it could render onto a screen and

3030
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,079
we could feel like we're participating

3031
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,520
in it you know they're gonna

3032
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:05,359
they're gonna have you know like the

3033
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:07,040
oculus kind of stuff it's gonna be so

3034
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:08,880
good when a projection to your eyes you

3035
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:10,800
think it's real

3036
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,400
you know they're slowly solving those

3037
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:16,000
problems

3038
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:18,000
and i suspect when the renderer

3039
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,399
of that information into your head is

3040
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,158
also ai mediated

3041
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:24,559
you know they'll be able to give you the

3042
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:27,759
cues that you know you really want for

3043
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:29,600
depth and all kinds of stuff like your

3044
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,000
your brain is probably faking your your

3045
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,159
visual

3046
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,679
field right like your eyes are twitching

3047
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:35,359
around but you don't notice that

3048
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,359
occasionally they blank you don't notice

3049
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:38,960
that you know there's all kinds of

3050
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:40,880
things like you think you see over here

3051
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,079
but you don't really see there yeah it's

3052
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,319
all fabricated

3053
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:45,439
yeah so yeah peripheral vision is

3054
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:48,000
fascinating

3055
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:49,519
so if you have an ai renderer that's

3056
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,960
trained to understand

3057
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:54,880
exactly how you see and the kind of

3058
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,000
things that enhance the realism of the

3059
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:59,840
experience

3060
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,840
it could be super real actually

3061
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,079
so i don't know what the limits that are

3062
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:06,319
but

3063
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:08,158
obviously if if we have a brain

3064
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:10,559
interface that goes in

3065
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:12,000
inside your you know visual cortex in a

3066
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:15,280
better way than your eyes do

3067
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:18,560
which is possible it's a lot neurons

3068
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:21,039
yeah um maybe that will be even

3069
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:22,000
cooler well the really cool thing is it

3070
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:23,519
has to do with the

3071
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
the infinite fun that you're referring

3072
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,159
to which is our brains seem to be very

3073
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,840
limited and like you said computational

3074
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:31,920
so very plastic

3075
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:34,239
very plastic yeah yeah so it's a it's a

3076
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,800
com interesting combination

3077
01:39:34,238 --> 01:39:39,118
now the the interesting open question is

3078
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:42,159
the limits of that neuroplasticity like

3079
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:43,599
how how flexible is that thing

3080
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:46,158
because we don't we haven't really

3081
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:47,679
tested it we know about that experiments

3082
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:48,960
where they they put like a pressure pad

3083
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:51,359
on somebody's head

3084
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,359
and had a visual transducer pressurize

3085
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:56,319
it and somebody slowly learned to see

3086
01:39:53,359 --> 01:39:56,960
yep that's like it's especially at a

3087
01:39:56,319 --> 01:39:59,519
young age

3088
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:02,000
if you throw a lot at it like what what

3089
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,800
can it uh

3090
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,479
uh can it completely so can you like

3091
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,520
arbitrarily expand it with computing

3092
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:09,198
power so

3093
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,840
connected to the internet directly

3094
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:13,759
somehow yeah the answer's probably yes

3095
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:15,440
so the problem with biology and ethics

3096
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:19,360
is like there's a mess there

3097
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:20,799
like us humans are perhaps unwilling to

3098
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:24,079
take

3099
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,440
risks in uh into directions that are

3100
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:27,679
full of uncertainty

3101
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:29,599
so that's like 90 of the population is

3102
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:32,480
unwilling to take risks the other 10

3103
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:34,079
is rushing into the risks unaided by any

3104
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:36,718
infrastructure whatsoever

3105
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:37,118
and you know and that that's where all

3106
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,198
the fun

3107
01:40:37,118 --> 01:40:40,559
happens in you know society there's been

3108
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:42,158
huge transformations

3109
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:43,760
yeah in the last you know a couple

3110
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:45,439
thousand years yeah

3111
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,119
it's funny i mean i got a chance to

3112
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:48,719
interact with uh uh

3113
01:40:47,118 --> 01:40:50,479
this is matthew johnson from johns

3114
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:52,480
hopkins he's doing this large-scale

3115
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:54,158
study of psychedelics

3116
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:55,279
it's it's becoming more and more i've

3117
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:56,719
gotten a chance to interact with that

3118
01:40:55,279 --> 01:40:57,679
community of scientists working on

3119
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:59,679
psychedelics

3120
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:00,960
but because of that that opened the door

3121
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,719
to me to

3122
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,000
all these uh what are they called

3123
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:06,000
psychonauts the

3124
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,198
people who like you said the ten percent

3125
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,800
who like

3126
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:10,479
i don't care i don't know if there's a

3127
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,119
science behind this i'm taking the

3128
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:13,678
spaceship

3129
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:14,719
to if i'm being the first on mars i'll

3130
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:16,319
be uh

3131
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:18,399
the you know you know psychedelic's

3132
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:21,279
interesting in the sense that

3133
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:23,599
in another dimension uh like you said

3134
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:26,158
it's a way to explore the

3135
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:28,079
with the limits of the human mind like

3136
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:30,479
what is this thing capable of doing

3137
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:32,158
because you kind of like when you dream

3138
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:33,678
you detach it i don't know exactly in

3139
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:37,118
your science of it but

3140
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:39,760
you detach your like reality

3141
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:41,439
from what your mind the images your mind

3142
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,960
is able to conjure up and your mind goes

3143
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:46,638
into weird places

3144
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,760
and like entities appear freudian type

3145
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:49,520
of

3146
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,119
like trauma is probably connected in

3147
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,000
there somehow but you start to have like

3148
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:54,479
these

3149
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,238
weird vivid worlds that like so do you

3150
01:41:54,479 --> 01:42:00,158
actively dream

3151
01:41:56,238 --> 01:42:01,839
do you why not i had like six six

3152
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:03,519
hours of dreams and i it's like really

3153
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:05,760
useful time i know

3154
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,360
i do i haven't uh i don't for some

3155
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:10,480
reason i just knock out

3156
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:12,238
and uh i have sometimes like anxiety

3157
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:16,079
inducing kind of like

3158
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:18,319
very pragmatic like nightmare type of

3159
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:21,519
dreams but not nothing fun nothing

3160
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:24,639
nothing fun nothing fun i i try

3161
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:27,199
i unfortunately have mostly have fun

3162
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:28,560
in uh the waking world which is very

3163
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:29,839
limited in the amount of fun you can

3164
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,679
have

3165
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,960
it's not that limited either yeah that's

3166
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:37,600
what we'll have to talk

3167
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:40,800
yeah i need instructions uh yeah there's

3168
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:43,199
like a manual for that you might wanna

3169
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:44,560
i looked it up i'll ask elon what uh

3170
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:46,319
what did you dream

3171
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,400
you know years ago and i i read about

3172
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:50,799
you know

3173
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:52,960
like you know a book about how to have

3174
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,560
you know become aware of your dreams

3175
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:56,480
i worked on it for a while like there's

3176
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:58,159
this trick about you know imagine you

3177
01:42:56,479 --> 01:43:01,439
can see your hands and look out

3178
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:04,000
and and i got somewhat good at it like

3179
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:05,359
but my mostly when i'm thinking about

3180
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,880
things or working on problems

3181
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:09,679
i i i prep myself before i go to sleep

3182
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:13,118
it's like

3183
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:15,359
i i pull into my mind all the things i

3184
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:19,039
want to work on or think about

3185
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:20,238
and then that let's say greatly improves

3186
01:43:19,039 --> 01:43:23,279
the chances that i'll

3187
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:26,319
i'll work on that while i'm sleeping

3188
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:30,079
and then and then i also

3189
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:30,079
you know basically asked to remember it

3190
01:43:30,238 --> 01:43:34,959
and i often remember very detailed

3191
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:35,839
within the dream yeah or outside the

3192
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:37,840
dream well

3193
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:40,800
to bring it up in in my dreaming and

3194
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:42,560
then remember it when i wake up

3195
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,480
it's just it's more of a meditative

3196
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:48,719
practice you say

3197
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:50,479
you know to prepare yourself to do that

3198
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:52,319
like if you go to you know the sleep

3199
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:53,839
still gnashing your teeth about some

3200
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:55,439
random thing that happened

3201
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:57,760
that you're not that really interested

3202
01:43:55,439 --> 01:43:59,678
in you'll dream about it

3203
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,000
that's really interesting maybe but but

3204
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:04,719
you can direct your dreams

3205
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,319
somewhat by prepping you know i'm going

3206
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:08,319
to try that it's really interesting

3207
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,000
like the most important the interesting

3208
01:44:08,319 --> 01:44:12,158
not like uh

3209
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,238
what what did this guy send in an email

3210
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:15,439
kind of like stupid worry stuff but like

3211
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:16,479
fundamental problems you're actually

3212
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:17,678
concerned about

3213
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:19,599
prepping and interesting things you're

3214
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:21,279
worried about or just you're reading or

3215
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,159
you know some great conversation you had

3216
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:23,519
or something

3217
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:25,599
some adventure you want to have like

3218
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:28,800
there's there's a lot of

3219
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:32,159
space there and

3220
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,920
and it seems to work that

3221
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:36,319
you know my percentage of interesting

3222
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:40,319
dreams and memories went up

3223
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:42,238
is there uh is that the source of uh

3224
01:44:40,319 --> 01:44:45,359
if you were able to deconstruct like

3225
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:48,158
where some of your best ideas came from

3226
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:49,039
do is there a process that's at the core

3227
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:51,839
of that

3228
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:53,679
yeah like so some people you know walk

3229
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,039
and think some people like in the shower

3230
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:56,800
the best ideas hit them

3231
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:58,479
if you talk about like newton apple

3232
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,440
hitting them on the head

3233
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:03,118
no i i found that a long time ago i'm i

3234
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:05,118
process things somewhat slowly

3235
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:06,559
so like in college i had friends that

3236
01:45:05,118 --> 01:45:07,439
could study at the last minute get an a

3237
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,760
next day

3238
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:10,879
i can't do that at all so i always front

3239
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:13,760
loaded all the work

3240
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,079
like i do all the problems early you

3241
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,840
know

3242
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:17,600
for finals like the last three days i

3243
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:19,600
wouldn't look at a book

3244
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,960
because i want you know because like a

3245
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:22,880
new fact the day before

3246
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,639
finals may screw up my understanding of

3247
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:27,760
what i thought i knew so my

3248
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:29,760
my goal was to always get it in and and

3249
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:32,400
give it time to soak

3250
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,079
and i used to you know i remember we

3251
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:36,319
were doing like 3d calculus i would have

3252
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:37,118
these amazing dreams of 3d surfaces with

3253
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:38,559
normal

3254
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:40,479
you know calculating the gradient and

3255
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:44,159
this is like all come up so

3256
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:44,718
it was really fun like very visual and

3257
01:45:44,158 --> 01:45:46,719
uh

3258
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:47,760
and if i got cycles of that that was

3259
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:50,000
useful

3260
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,880
um and the other is don't over filter

3261
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,760
your ideas

3262
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:55,279
like i like that process of

3263
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,639
brainstorming where lots of ideas can

3264
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:57,198
happen i like people who have lots of

3265
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:58,880
ideas

3266
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:00,479
and things but that's what's up then

3267
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,480
there's a yeah let them sit and let it

3268
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:05,678
breathe a little bit

3269
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:08,319
and then reduce it to practice like at

3270
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:10,880
some point you really have to

3271
01:46:08,319 --> 01:46:12,960
does it really work like you know is

3272
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,880
this real or not

3273
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,399
right but you but you have to do both

3274
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,800
there's creative tension there like how

3275
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:20,319
do you

3276
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:23,039
be both open and you know precise

3277
01:46:20,319 --> 01:46:24,719
if you had ideas that you just that sit

3278
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:29,039
in your mind for like years

3279
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:32,158
before the sure it's an interesting uh

3280
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:33,039
way to is generate ideas and just let

3281
01:46:32,158 --> 01:46:36,319
them sit

3282
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:38,399
let them sit there for a while

3283
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:40,000
i think i have a few of those ideas you

3284
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:43,359
know that was so funny

3285
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:46,238
yeah i think that's you know creativity

3286
01:46:43,359 --> 01:46:47,198
uh this one or something for the slow

3287
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:50,399
thinkers in the

3288
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:52,079
in the room i suppose as i some people

3289
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:54,559
like you said are just like

3290
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:56,079
like the yeah it's really interesting

3291
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,520
like there's so much diversity in how

3292
01:46:56,079 --> 01:46:59,359
people think

3293
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:01,520
you know how fast or slow they are how

3294
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:03,039
well they remember don't

3295
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:05,040
like you know i'm not super good at

3296
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:06,319
remembering facts but processes and

3297
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:07,679
methods

3298
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:10,158
like in our engineering i went to penn

3299
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:12,480
state and almost all our engineering

3300
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:14,559
tests were open book i could remember

3301
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:16,079
the page and not the formula

3302
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,840
but as soon as i saw the formula i could

3303
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:20,800
remember the whole method if i

3304
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:22,319
if i'd learned it yeah you know so it's

3305
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,920
just a funny

3306
01:47:22,319 --> 01:47:25,198
or some people could you know i i

3307
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,359
swatched friends like flipping through

3308
01:47:25,198 --> 01:47:29,118
the book trying to find the formula

3309
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:31,039
even knowing that they'd done just as

3310
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:32,960
much work and i would just open the book

3311
01:47:31,039 --> 01:47:34,840
i was on page 27

3312
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:36,000
about half i could see the whole thing

3313
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:38,159
visually

3314
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,520
yeah and you know and you have to learn

3315
01:47:38,158 --> 01:47:40,238
that about yourself and figure out what

3316
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:42,320
to do with the

3317
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:43,759
function optimally i had a friend who he

3318
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:45,519
was always concerned he didn't know how

3319
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:47,119
he came up with ideas

3320
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:48,960
he had lots of ideas but he said they

3321
01:47:47,118 --> 01:47:50,079
just sort of popped up

3322
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:51,679
like you'd be working on something

3323
01:47:50,079 --> 01:47:53,118
having this idea like where does it come

3324
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:54,800
from

3325
01:47:53,118 --> 01:47:56,719
but you can have more awareness of it

3326
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:58,880
like like

3327
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:00,399
like like how you how your brain works

3328
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:01,840
is a little murky as you go down

3329
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:03,679
from the voice in your head or the

3330
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:05,199
obvious visualizations

3331
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:06,880
like when you visualize something how

3332
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:08,399
does that happen yes

3333
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:10,159
you know if i say you know visualize

3334
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:11,359
volcano it's easy to do right

3335
01:48:10,158 --> 01:48:13,439
and what does it actually look like when

3336
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:14,399
you visualize it i can visualize to the

3337
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:15,839
point where i don't see

3338
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:18,158
very much out of my eyes and i see the

3339
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:19,760
colors of the thing i'm visualizing

3340
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:21,198
yeah but there's like a there's a shape

3341
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,039
there's a texture there's a color but

3342
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:24,000
there's also conceptual visualization

3343
01:48:23,039 --> 01:48:25,679
like

3344
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,439
what are you actually visualizing when

3345
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:29,039
you're visualizing volcano just like

3346
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:30,399
with peripheral vision you think you see

3347
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:32,000
the whole thing yeah yeah

3348
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:33,519
that's a good way to say it you know you

3349
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,118
have this kind of

3350
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:38,320
almost peripheral vision of your

3351
01:48:35,118 --> 01:48:40,079
visualizations they're like these ghosts

3352
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:41,279
but if you know if you if you work on it

3353
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:42,079
you can get a pretty high level of

3354
01:48:41,279 --> 01:48:43,599
detail

3355
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:45,359
and somehow you can walk along those

3356
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,480
visualizations to come up with an idea

3357
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:48,639
which is uh

3358
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:50,879
but weird but when you're thinking about

3359
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:52,719
solving problems

3360
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:54,719
like you're you're putting information

3361
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:55,600
and you're exercising the stuff you do

3362
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,079
know

3363
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:00,560
you're sort of teasing the area that's

3364
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:04,479
you don't understand and don't know

3365
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:06,719
but you can almost you know feel

3366
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:07,839
you know that process happening you know

3367
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:11,359
that's that's how i

3368
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:13,039
like like like i know sometimes when i'm

3369
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:14,799
working really hard on something like

3370
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:16,158
like i get really hot when i'm sleeping

3371
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,920
and you know it's like

3372
01:49:16,158 --> 01:49:19,920
we got the blank throw i wake up all the

3373
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,920
blankets are on the floor

3374
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:24,719
and you know every time it's while i

3375
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:27,118
wake up and think wow that was great

3376
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:28,719
you know are you able to uh to reverse

3377
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:30,319
engineer what the hell happened there

3378
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:32,399
oh sometimes it's vivid dreams and

3379
01:49:30,319 --> 01:49:34,238
sometimes it's this kind of like you say

3380
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:35,679
like shadow thinking that you you sort

3381
01:49:34,238 --> 01:49:37,198
of have this feeling you're

3382
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:39,118
you're going through this stuff but it's

3383
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:40,638
it's not that obvious isn't that so

3384
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:42,880
amazing that the mind just

3385
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:44,560
does all these little experiments i

3386
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,118
never you know i thought i always

3387
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,800
thought

3388
01:49:45,118 --> 01:49:48,799
it's like a river that you can't you're

3389
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,440
just there for the ride but you're right

3390
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:52,960
if you prep

3391
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:53,678
it no it's all understandable meditation

3392
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:55,279
really helps

3393
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:58,880
you you got to start figuring out you

3394
01:49:55,279 --> 01:49:58,880
need to learn language of your own mind

3395
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:04,000
and there's multiple levels of it but

3396
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:06,560
the abstractions again right it's

3397
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,760
somewhat comprehensible and observable

3398
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:10,239
and

3399
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,840
feelable or whatever the right word is

3400
01:50:10,238 --> 01:50:13,839
no it's

3401
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,520
you know you're not long for the ride

3402
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:17,840
you are the ride

3403
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,239
i have to ask you hardware engineer

3404
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:21,840
working on neural networks now

3405
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:24,879
what's consciousness what the hell is

3406
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:27,760
that thing is that is that just some

3407
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:29,039
little weird quirk of our particular uh

3408
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:30,719
computing device

3409
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:33,760
or is it something fundamental that we

3410
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:36,719
really need to crack open if we're to

3411
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:38,159
to build like good computers do you ever

3412
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,079
think about consciousness like

3413
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:42,559
why it feels like something to be i know

3414
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:46,079
it's it's it's really weird

3415
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:48,320
so yeah i mean

3416
01:50:46,079 --> 01:50:50,639
everything about it is weird first it's

3417
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:52,639
a half a second behind reality

3418
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:54,719
right it's a post-hoc narrative about

3419
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:57,599
what happened you've already

3420
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:58,719
done stuff by the time you're conscious

3421
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:00,239
of it

3422
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:01,679
and your consciousness generally is a

3423
01:51:00,238 --> 01:51:03,678
single threaded thing but we know your

3424
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:07,840
brain is 10 billion neurons

3425
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:09,920
running some crazy parallel thing

3426
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,960
and there's a really big sorting thing

3427
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,039
going on there

3428
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:15,679
it also seems to be really reflective in

3429
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:17,840
the sense that

3430
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:19,520
you create a space in your head right

3431
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:20,319
like we don't really see anything right

3432
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:22,000
like

3433
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:23,519
photons hit your eyes it gets turned

3434
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,439
into signals it goes through multiple

3435
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:27,840
layers the neurons

3436
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:29,678
you know like i'm so curious that you

3437
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,880
know that looks glassy and that looks

3438
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:32,800
not glassy like

3439
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:34,159
like how the resolution of your vision

3440
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,520
is so high you have to go through all

3441
01:51:34,158 --> 01:51:37,519
this processing

3442
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,960
yeah where for most of it it looks

3443
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:41,679
nothing like vision

3444
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:43,198
okay like like there's no theater in

3445
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:47,599
your mind

3446
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:50,479
right so we we have a world in our heads

3447
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:51,599
we're literally just isolated behind our

3448
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:55,519
sensors

3449
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:58,639
but we can look at it speculate about it

3450
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:00,880
speculate about alternatives problem

3451
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:02,800
solve what if you know there's so many

3452
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:06,079
things going on

3453
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:08,079
and that process is lagging reality

3454
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:09,439
and it's single threaded even though the

3455
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:12,559
underlying thing is like

3456
01:52:09,439 --> 01:52:14,000
massively parallel so it's so curious

3457
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,920
so imagine you're building an ai

3458
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,520
computer if you wanted to replicate

3459
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:18,880
humans well you'd have huge arrays of

3460
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:21,040
neural networks and

3461
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:22,319
apparently only six or seven deep which

3462
01:52:21,039 --> 01:52:23,840
clarious

3463
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:25,840
they only remember seven numbers but i

3464
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:28,319
think we can upgrade that a lot

3465
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:29,920
right and then somewhere in there you

3466
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:30,559
would train the network to create

3467
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,440
basically

3468
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,760
the world that you live in right so like

3469
01:52:33,439 --> 01:52:35,839
tell

3470
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,039
stories to itself about the world that

3471
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,119
it's perceiving well

3472
01:52:37,039 --> 01:52:40,719
create this create the world tell

3473
01:52:39,118 --> 01:52:44,639
stories in the world

3474
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:47,840
and then have many dimensions of

3475
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:49,199
you know like sideshows to it like we

3476
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:51,440
have an emotional structure

3477
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:52,719
like we have a biological structure and

3478
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:54,960
that seems hierarchical too

3479
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:56,639
like like if you're hungry it dominates

3480
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,679
your thinking if you're mad it dominates

3481
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:59,920
your thinking

3482
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:01,520
like and we don't know if that's

3483
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,239
important to consciousness or not but it

3484
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,000
certainly

3485
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:05,598
disrupts you know in truths in the

3486
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:07,039
consciousness

3487
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:09,840
like so there's lots of structure to

3488
01:53:07,039 --> 01:53:11,439
that and we like to dwell on the past we

3489
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:12,079
like to think about the future we like

3490
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:15,519
to imagine

3491
01:53:12,079 --> 01:53:18,158
we'd like to fantasize right and

3492
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:19,280
the somewhat circular observation of

3493
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:22,399
that is the thing

3494
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:23,840
we call consciousness now if you created

3495
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:25,519
a computer system it did all things

3496
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,199
create world views created future

3497
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:29,360
alternate histories

3498
01:53:27,198 --> 01:53:31,598
you know dwelled on past events you know

3499
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:33,920
accurately or semi-accurately

3500
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:34,960
you know it's it's consciousness just

3501
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:36,319
bring up like

3502
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:41,840
natural well would that feel look and

3503
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:41,840
feel conscious to you like do you think

3504
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:45,359
do you think the thing that looks

3505
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:47,520
conscious is conscious like

3506
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:49,198
do you uh again this is like an

3507
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:51,199
engineering kind of question i think

3508
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:54,719
because

3509
01:53:51,198 --> 01:53:56,799
uh like

3510
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:58,639
if we want to engineer consciousness is

3511
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,639
it okay to engineer something that just

3512
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:02,560
looks conscious

3513
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:04,159
or is it is there a difference between

3514
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:06,000
well we have all consciousness because

3515
01:54:04,158 --> 01:54:07,039
it's a super effective way to manage our

3516
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,639
affairs

3517
01:54:07,039 --> 01:54:10,079
yeah it's right the social development

3518
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:10,880
yeah well it gives us the planning

3519
01:54:10,079 --> 01:54:13,118
system

3520
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:14,560
you know we have a huge amount of stuff

3521
01:54:13,118 --> 01:54:16,079
like when we're talking

3522
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,760
like the reason we can talk really fast

3523
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:19,760
is we're modeling each other a really

3524
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:21,199
high level of detail and consciousness

3525
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:23,599
is required for that right and

3526
01:54:21,198 --> 01:54:26,079
well all those components together

3527
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:28,319
manifest consciousness

3528
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:29,840
right so if we make intelligent beings

3529
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:30,399
that we want to interact with that we're

3530
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,920
like

3531
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:33,519
you know wondering what they're thinking

3532
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,719
you know you know looking forward to

3533
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,159
seeing them

3534
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:38,880
you know when they interact with them

3535
01:54:36,158 --> 01:54:41,679
they they're interesting surprising

3536
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:42,159
you know fascinating you know they will

3537
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:43,760
probably

3538
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:46,960
feel conscious like we do and we'll

3539
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:49,840
we'll perceive them as conscious

3540
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:52,399
i don't know why not but you never know

3541
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:55,039
another fun question on this because

3542
01:54:52,399 --> 01:54:56,079
in in from a computing perspective we're

3543
01:54:55,039 --> 01:54:59,439
trying to create something that's

3544
01:54:56,079 --> 01:55:03,198
human-like or superhuman-like

3545
01:54:59,439 --> 01:55:06,559
let me ask you about aliens aliens

3546
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:09,439
uh do you think there's intelligent

3547
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,719
alien civilizations out there and do you

3548
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:14,319
think

3549
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:18,158
their technology their computing

3550
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:21,198
their ai bots their uh their chips

3551
01:55:18,158 --> 01:55:23,679
are of the same nature as ours

3552
01:55:21,198 --> 01:55:25,039
yeah i got i have no idea i mean if

3553
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:27,118
there's lots of aliens out there they've

3554
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:28,560
been awfully quiet

3555
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:30,559
you know there's there's speculation

3556
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:32,960
about why

3557
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,760
there seems to be more than enough

3558
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:37,279
planets

3559
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:38,800
out there there's a lot yeah um

3560
01:55:37,279 --> 01:55:41,279
there's intelligent life on this planet

3561
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:43,840
that seems quite different you know like

3562
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:45,599
you know dolphins seem like plausibly

3563
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:47,360
understandable octopuses don't seem

3564
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:48,960
understandable at all

3565
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:50,880
if they live longer than a year maybe

3566
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:53,679
they would be running the planet

3567
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:54,960
they seem really smart and their neural

3568
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:56,399
architecture is completely different

3569
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,560
than ours

3570
01:55:56,399 --> 01:56:00,000
now who knows how they perceive things i

3571
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:01,760
mean that's the question is for us

3572
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,520
intelligent beings who might not be able

3573
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:05,039
to perceive other kinds of intelligence

3574
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:06,639
if they become sufficiently different

3575
01:56:05,039 --> 01:56:08,639
than us so yeah

3576
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:09,840
we live in the current constrained world

3577
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:11,199
that you know it's three-dimensional

3578
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,039
geometry and

3579
01:56:11,198 --> 01:56:14,399
the geometry defines a certain amount of

3580
01:56:13,039 --> 01:56:16,238
physics

3581
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:18,079
and you know you know there's like how

3582
01:56:16,238 --> 01:56:20,638
time works seems to work

3583
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:22,158
like there's so many things that seem

3584
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:23,760
like a whole bunch of the input

3585
01:56:22,158 --> 01:56:26,319
parameters to the you know another

3586
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:29,039
conscious being are the same

3587
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:30,799
yes like if it's biological biological

3588
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:32,560
things seem to be in a relatively narrow

3589
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:34,480
temperature range

3590
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:37,520
right because you know organic stones

3591
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:40,158
aren't stable too cold or too hot

3592
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:43,840
you know so so there's if you specified

3593
01:56:40,158 --> 01:56:46,079
the list of things that

3594
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,159
input to that but as soon as we make

3595
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:50,479
really smart

3596
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:52,079
you know beings and they go solve about

3597
01:56:50,479 --> 01:56:53,359
how to think about a billion numbers at

3598
01:56:52,079 --> 01:56:56,399
the same time and

3599
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:58,000
and how to think in n there's a funny

3600
01:56:56,399 --> 01:56:58,960
science fiction book where the all the

3601
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,760
society

3602
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:03,760
had uploaded into this matrix and at

3603
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:04,320
some point some some of the beans in the

3604
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,320
matrix

3605
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:07,759
thought i wonder if there's intelligent

3606
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:09,118
life out there

3607
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:10,639
so they had to do a whole bunch of work

3608
01:57:09,118 --> 01:57:12,238
to figure out like how to make a

3609
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:14,800
physical thing

3610
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:16,158
because their matrix was self-sustaining

3611
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,760
and they made a little spaceship and

3612
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:18,399
they traveled to another planet when

3613
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,560
they got there

3614
01:57:18,399 --> 01:57:22,559
there was like life running around but

3615
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:24,000
there was no intelligent life

3616
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,080
and then they figured out that there was

3617
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,238
these huge

3618
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:30,000
you know organic matrix all over the

3619
01:57:28,238 --> 01:57:32,399
planet inside there where intelligent

3620
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:36,158
beings had uploaded themselves

3621
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:39,039
into that matrix so everywhere

3622
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:40,399
intelligent life was as soon as it got

3623
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:42,800
smart

3624
01:57:40,399 --> 01:57:45,039
it up leveled itself into something way

3625
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:47,440
more interesting than 3d geometry and

3626
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:48,719
yeah it escaped whatever this is not

3627
01:57:47,439 --> 01:57:51,118
escaped

3628
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:53,039
better yeah the the essence of what we

3629
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:57,039
think of as an intelligent being

3630
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:59,118
i tend to like the thought experiment of

3631
01:57:57,039 --> 01:58:00,238
the organism like humans aren't the

3632
01:57:59,118 --> 01:58:02,319
organisms

3633
01:58:00,238 --> 01:58:03,678
i like the notion of like richard

3634
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:07,920
dawkins and memes

3635
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:10,639
that ideas themselves are the organisms

3636
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:11,359
like that are just using our minds to

3637
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:15,199
evolve

3638
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:17,759
so like we're just like meat receptacles

3639
01:58:15,198 --> 01:58:19,279
for ideas to breed and multiply and so

3640
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:23,920
on and

3641
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:26,319
maybe those are the aliens yes so

3642
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:28,239
uh jordan peterson has a line says you

3643
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:29,118
know you think you have ideas but ideas

3644
01:58:28,238 --> 01:58:32,158
have you

3645
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:33,279
yeah right good line which and and then

3646
01:58:32,158 --> 01:58:34,238
we know about the phenomena of

3647
01:58:33,279 --> 01:58:36,158
groupthink

3648
01:58:34,238 --> 01:58:37,839
and there's so many things that

3649
01:58:36,158 --> 01:58:40,000
constrain us

3650
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:41,279
but i think you can examine all that and

3651
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,279
not be

3652
01:58:41,279 --> 01:58:46,000
completely owned by the ideas and

3653
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:48,079
completely sucked into groupthink

3654
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,679
and part of your responsibility as a as

3655
01:58:48,079 --> 01:58:51,599
a human

3656
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:53,440
is to escape that kind of phenomena

3657
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:54,880
which isn't you know it's

3658
01:58:53,439 --> 01:58:56,879
you know it's it's one of the creative

3659
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:57,760
tension things again you're constructed

3660
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:59,840
by it

3661
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:01,679
but you can still observe it and you can

3662
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,400
think about it and you can make choices

3663
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:05,279
about

3664
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:06,879
to some level how constrained you are by

3665
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:11,439
it

3666
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:11,440
and you know it's useful to do that

3667
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:17,599
and but but at the same time

3668
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:20,000
and it could be by doing that that you

3669
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:20,639
know the the the group and society

3670
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,639
you're

3671
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:24,079
you're part of becomes collectively even

3672
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:26,560
more interesting

3673
01:59:24,079 --> 01:59:28,158
so you know so the outside observer will

3674
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:29,920
think wow

3675
01:59:28,158 --> 01:59:31,439
you know all these lexus running around

3676
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:32,800
with all these really independent ideas

3677
01:59:31,439 --> 01:59:33,678
have created something even more

3678
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:37,119
interesting

3679
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:40,000
and uh aggregate so

3680
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:41,759
so i uh so i don't know i'm those are

3681
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,599
lenses to look at the situation

3682
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:45,360
but i'll give you some inspiration but i

3683
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:48,560
don't think they're constrained

3684
01:59:45,359 --> 01:59:49,279
right you know as a small little quirk

3685
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:52,719
of history

3686
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:53,519
it seems like you're related to jordan

3687
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:55,359
peterson

3688
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:57,599
like you mentioned he's going through

3689
01:59:55,359 --> 01:59:59,839
some rough stuff now

3690
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:02,480
is there some comment you can make about

3691
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:06,159
the the roughness of the human journey

3692
02:00:02,479 --> 02:00:10,718
the ups and downs well

3693
02:00:06,158 --> 02:00:13,519
i i became an expert in benzo withdrawal

3694
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:14,800
like which is you took benzodiazepines

3695
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:18,880
and at some point

3696
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:21,119
they interact with gaba circuits

3697
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:23,118
you know to reduce anxiety and do 100

3698
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:24,960
other things like there's actually

3699
02:00:23,118 --> 02:00:26,559
no known list of everything they do

3700
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:28,079
because they interact with so many parts

3701
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,199
of your body

3702
02:00:28,079 --> 02:00:31,519
and then once you're on them you

3703
02:00:29,198 --> 02:00:32,960
habituate to them and you're you're

3704
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:34,560
you have a dependency it's not like

3705
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:35,920
you're a drug dependency we're trying to

3706
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:39,280
get high it's a

3707
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:39,679
it's a metabolic dependency and then if

3708
02:00:39,279 --> 02:00:43,279
you

3709
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:43,599
discontinue them there's a funny thing

3710
02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:46,880
called

3711
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:48,239
kindling which is if you stop them

3712
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:50,159
and then go you know you'll have a

3713
02:00:48,238 --> 02:00:51,678
horrible it's for all symptoms if you go

3714
02:00:50,158 --> 02:00:53,198
back on them at the same level you won't

3715
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:55,760
be stable

3716
02:00:53,198 --> 02:00:57,359
and that unfortunately happened to him

3717
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:58,880
because it's so deeply integrated into

3718
02:00:57,359 --> 02:01:00,799
all the kinds of systems in the body it

3719
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,279
literally changes the size and numbers

3720
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,119
of

3721
02:01:01,279 --> 02:01:05,519
neurotransmitter sites in your brain

3722
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:07,519
yeah so there's a there's a

3723
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,560
process called the ashton protocol where

3724
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:10,880
you taper it down

3725
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:12,560
slowly over two years to people go

3726
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:13,599
through that goes through unbelievable

3727
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,119
hell

3728
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:16,719
and what jordan went through seemed to

3729
02:01:15,118 --> 02:01:18,639
be worse because

3730
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:20,239
the on advice of doctors you know we'll

3731
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:23,760
stop taking these and take this

3732
02:01:20,238 --> 02:01:27,118
it was the disaster and he got some

3733
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:27,599
yeah it was pretty tough um he seems to

3734
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:29,279
be doing

3735
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:31,840
quite a bit better intellectually you

3736
02:01:29,279 --> 02:01:33,118
can see his brain clicking back together

3737
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:35,199
i spent a lot of time with i've never

3738
02:01:33,118 --> 02:01:36,639
seen anybody suffer so much well his

3739
02:01:35,198 --> 02:01:40,079
brain is also like this

3740
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:41,039
powerhouse right so i wonder does a

3741
02:01:40,079 --> 02:01:42,800
brain

3742
02:01:41,039 --> 02:01:44,639
that's able to think deeply about the

3743
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:46,079
world suffer more through these kinds of

3744
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,840
withdrawals like

3745
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:49,439
i don't know i've watched videos of

3746
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:51,760
people going through withdrawal

3747
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:54,000
they they all seem to suffer

3748
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:56,320
unbelievably

3749
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,439
and you know my work goes out to

3750
02:01:56,319 --> 02:01:59,198
everybody

3751
02:01:57,439 --> 02:02:01,598
and there's some funny math about this

3752
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:02,719
some doctors said as best you can tell

3753
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:04,239
you know there's the standard

3754
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:05,599
recommendations don't take them for more

3755
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:07,039
than a month and then taper over a

3756
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:09,279
couple of weeks

3757
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:11,279
many doctors prescribe them endlessly

3758
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:14,319
which is against the protocol but

3759
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:16,719
it's common right and then

3760
02:02:14,319 --> 02:02:17,439
something like 75 percent of people when

3761
02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:19,198
they taper

3762
02:02:17,439 --> 02:02:20,719
it's you know half the people have

3763
02:02:19,198 --> 02:02:23,919
difficulty but 75

3764
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:24,719
get off okay 20 have severe difficulty

3765
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:27,599
and 5

3766
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:29,439
have life-threatening difficulty and if

3767
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:31,520
you're one of those it's really bad

3768
02:02:29,439 --> 02:02:32,559
and the stories that people have on this

3769
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:35,360
is

3770
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:37,039
heartbreaking and tough so you put some

3771
02:02:35,359 --> 02:02:38,479
of the fault that the doctors that just

3772
02:02:37,039 --> 02:02:41,519
not know what the hell they're doing

3773
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:43,598
oh no it's hard to say it's it's one of

3774
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:46,080
those commonly prescribed things like

3775
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:47,679
one doctor said what happens is if

3776
02:02:46,079 --> 02:02:49,039
you're prescribed them for a reason

3777
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:51,359
and then you have a hard time getting

3778
02:02:49,039 --> 02:02:54,000
off the protocol basically says you're

3779
02:02:51,359 --> 02:02:56,639
either crazy or dependent

3780
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,238
and you get kind of pushed into a

3781
02:02:56,639 --> 02:02:59,760
different treatment regime

3782
02:02:58,238 --> 02:03:01,678
you're a drug drug addict or a

3783
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:04,079
psychiatric patient

3784
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:05,440
and so like one doctor said you know i

3785
02:03:04,079 --> 02:03:07,118
prescribed me for 10 years thinking i

3786
02:03:05,439 --> 02:03:09,519
was helping my patients and i realized i

3787
02:03:07,118 --> 02:03:11,679
was really harming them

3788
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:14,480
and you know the awareness of that is

3789
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:16,800
slowly coming up

3790
02:03:14,479 --> 02:03:17,519
the fact that they're casually

3791
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:20,800
prescribed

3792
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:24,239
to people is horrible

3793
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:25,440
and it's bloody scary and some people

3794
02:03:24,238 --> 02:03:26,079
are stable on them but they're on them

3795
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:27,519
for life

3796
02:03:26,079 --> 02:03:29,118
like once you know it's another one of

3797
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:31,199
those drugs that

3798
02:03:29,118 --> 02:03:32,479
but benzo's long range have real impacts

3799
02:03:31,198 --> 02:03:34,158
on your personality

3800
02:03:32,479 --> 02:03:36,319
people talk about the benzo bubble where

3801
02:03:34,158 --> 02:03:38,000
you get disassociated from reality and

3802
02:03:36,319 --> 02:03:40,479
your friends a little bit

3803
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,399
it's it's it's it's really terrible the

3804
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:43,039
mind is terrifying we were talking about

3805
02:03:42,399 --> 02:03:45,598
how

3806
02:03:43,039 --> 02:03:46,399
how the infinite possibility of fun but

3807
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:47,840
like

3808
02:03:46,399 --> 02:03:49,359
it's the infinite possibility of

3809
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:50,960
suffering too which is one of the

3810
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:53,598
dangers of

3811
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:55,039
uh like expansion of the human mind it's

3812
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:57,199
like

3813
02:03:55,039 --> 02:03:58,960
i wonder if all the possible huma

3814
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:02,078
experiences that a

3815
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:04,480
intelligent computer can have is it

3816
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:07,759
mostly fun or is it mostly

3817
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:10,000
suffering so like if you if you uh brute

3818
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:11,920
force expand

3819
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,840
the set of possibilities like are you

3820
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:15,679
going to run into some trouble

3821
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:18,078
in terms of like torture and suffering

3822
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:20,719
and so on maybe our human brain is just

3823
02:04:18,078 --> 02:04:22,158
protecting us from much more possible

3824
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:25,520
pain and suffering

3825
02:04:22,158 --> 02:04:27,439
maybe the space of pain is like much

3826
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:30,639
larger than we could possibly imagine

3827
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:32,799
and that the world's in the balance

3828
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:34,159
you know all the all the literature on

3829
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:35,920
religion and stuff is

3830
02:04:34,158 --> 02:04:38,319
you know the struggle between good and

3831
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:40,078
evil is is balanced versus

3832
02:04:38,319 --> 02:04:41,439
very finely tuned for reasons that are

3833
02:04:40,078 --> 02:04:43,279
complicated

3834
02:04:41,439 --> 02:04:44,559
but that's a that's a long philosophical

3835
02:04:43,279 --> 02:04:45,840
conversation

3836
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,840
uh speaking of balance that's

3837
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:50,319
complicated i i wonder because we're

3838
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:51,920
living through one of the more important

3839
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:53,679
moments in human history with this

3840
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:56,319
particular virus

3841
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:58,000
it seems like pandemics have at least

3842
02:04:56,319 --> 02:05:01,279
the ability to

3843
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:03,679
uh kill off most of the human population

3844
02:05:01,279 --> 02:05:04,880
at their worst and they're just

3845
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:06,000
fascinating because there's so many

3846
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:07,760
viruses in this world

3847
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,920
there's so many i mean viruses basically

3848
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:12,159
around the world in the sense that uh

3849
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:13,520
they've been around very long time

3850
02:05:12,158 --> 02:05:15,279
they're everywhere

3851
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:16,880
they seem to be extremely powerful and

3852
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:17,519
they're just in a distributed kind of

3853
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:19,440
way but

3854
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:21,040
at the same time they're not intelligent

3855
02:05:19,439 --> 02:05:22,719
and they're not even living

3856
02:05:21,039 --> 02:05:25,519
do you have like high level thoughts

3857
02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:27,198
about this virus that uh

3858
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:28,719
like in terms of you being fascinated

3859
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:31,439
about terrified or

3860
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:32,399
not somewhere in between so i believe in

3861
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:36,158
frameworks right

3862
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:38,879
so like one of them is the evolution

3863
02:05:36,158 --> 02:05:39,519
like we're evolved creatures right yes

3864
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,960
and

3865
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:42,560
one of the things about evolution is

3866
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:44,319
it's hyper competitive

3867
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,400
and it's not competitive out of a sense

3868
02:05:44,319 --> 02:05:48,399
of evil it's competitive in the sense of

3869
02:05:46,399 --> 02:05:50,238
there's endless variation in variations

3870
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:52,479
that work better when

3871
02:05:50,238 --> 02:05:54,718
and then over time there's so many

3872
02:05:52,479 --> 02:05:57,198
levels of that competition

3873
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:58,158
you know like multi-cellular life partly

3874
02:05:57,198 --> 02:06:01,678
exists because

3875
02:05:58,158 --> 02:06:04,078
of you know the the competition between

3876
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:05,679
you know different kinds of life forms

3877
02:06:04,078 --> 02:06:08,000
and we know sex partly exists to

3878
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:11,520
scramble our genes so that we have

3879
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,279
you know genetic variation against

3880
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:16,480
the invasion of the bacteria and the

3881
02:06:13,279 --> 02:06:18,238
viruses and it's endless like

3882
02:06:16,479 --> 02:06:20,238
i read some funny statistic like the

3883
02:06:18,238 --> 02:06:20,638
density of viruses and bacteria in the

3884
02:06:20,238 --> 02:06:22,638
ocean

3885
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:24,480
is really high and one third of the

3886
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:26,000
bacteria die every day because the virus

3887
02:06:24,479 --> 02:06:29,439
is invading them

3888
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,880
like one-third of them wow like

3889
02:06:29,439 --> 02:06:32,559
like i don't know if that number is true

3890
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:34,000
but it was like it's

3891
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:35,679
like there's like the amount of

3892
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,118
competition and what's going on is

3893
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:39,279
stunning

3894
02:06:37,118 --> 02:06:41,679
and there's a theory as we age we slowly

3895
02:06:39,279 --> 02:06:44,719
accumulate bacterias and viruses

3896
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:45,199
and as our immune system kind of goes

3897
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:47,599
down

3898
02:06:45,198 --> 02:06:49,519
you know that's what slowly kills us and

3899
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:51,119
it just feels so peaceful from a human

3900
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:53,840
perspective when we sit back and they're

3901
02:06:51,118 --> 02:06:56,639
able to have a relaxed conversation

3902
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:58,480
uh and there's wars going on out there

3903
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:00,159
like right now

3904
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:02,559
you're you're harboring how many

3905
02:07:00,158 --> 02:07:04,879
bacteria and you know the ones

3906
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:06,320
many of them are parasites on you and

3907
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:07,760
some of them are helpful and some of

3908
02:07:06,319 --> 02:07:09,359
them are modifying your behavior and

3909
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:10,880
some of them are

3910
02:07:09,359 --> 02:07:12,479
you know it's just really it's really

3911
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:14,480
wild but

3912
02:07:12,479 --> 02:07:16,078
you know this particular manifestation

3913
02:07:14,479 --> 02:07:18,319
is unusual

3914
02:07:16,078 --> 02:07:19,359
you know in the demographic how it hit

3915
02:07:18,319 --> 02:07:21,439
and the political

3916
02:07:19,359 --> 02:07:22,559
you know response that it engendered and

3917
02:07:21,439 --> 02:07:24,319
you know the health care

3918
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:26,000
response it engendered and the

3919
02:07:24,319 --> 02:07:26,880
technology it's gendered it's kind of

3920
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,639
wild

3921
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:31,039
yeah the communication on twitter that

3922
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:32,480
it uh every level all that kind of stuff

3923
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:34,800
at every single level yeah

3924
02:07:32,479 --> 02:07:36,959
but but what usually kills life the big

3925
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:39,920
extinctions are caused by

3926
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:41,920
meteors and volcanoes that's the one

3927
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:45,118
you're worried about as opposed to

3928
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:46,239
human-created bombs solar flares are

3929
02:07:45,118 --> 02:07:47,598
another good one

3930
02:07:46,238 --> 02:07:50,479
you know occasionally solar flares hit

3931
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:53,800
the planet so it's nature

3932
02:07:50,479 --> 02:07:55,919
oh yes yeah it's all pretty wild on

3933
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:57,920
another historic moment

3934
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:01,279
this is perhaps outside but perhaps

3935
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:01,279
within your uh

3936
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:04,479
space of frameworks that you think about

3937
02:08:03,198 --> 02:08:06,719
that just happened

3938
02:08:04,479 --> 02:08:08,000
i guess a couple weeks ago is um i don't

3939
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:09,039
know if you're paying attention at all

3940
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:14,078
it's the

3941
02:08:09,039 --> 02:08:16,880
the game stop and wall street bets

3942
02:08:14,078 --> 02:08:18,479
so it's really fascinating there's kind

3943
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:20,159
of a theme to this conversation

3944
02:08:18,479 --> 02:08:22,000
today because it's like you know that

3945
02:08:20,158 --> 02:08:24,559
works the

3946
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,359
it's cool how there's a large number of

3947
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:30,719
people in a distributed way

3948
02:08:27,359 --> 02:08:31,679
almost having a kind of fun we're able

3949
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:35,760
to take on

3950
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:39,520
the powerful elites elite hedge funds

3951
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:43,360
centralized powers and overpower them

3952
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:45,119
uh do you have thoughts i mean saga

3953
02:08:43,359 --> 02:08:47,118
i don't know enough about finance but it

3954
02:08:45,118 --> 02:08:49,198
was like the elon

3955
02:08:47,118 --> 02:08:51,359
you know robin hood guy when they talked

3956
02:08:49,198 --> 02:08:52,799
yeah what do you think about that

3957
02:08:51,359 --> 02:08:55,039
well the robin guy didn't know how the

3958
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:56,960
finance system worked that was clear

3959
02:08:55,039 --> 02:08:58,639
right he was treating like the the

3960
02:08:56,960 --> 02:08:59,840
people who settled the transactions as a

3961
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:01,279
black box

3962
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:03,440
and suddenly somebody called him up and

3963
02:09:01,279 --> 02:09:05,118
said hey black box calling you

3964
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:06,559
your transaction volume means you need

3965
02:09:05,118 --> 02:09:07,598
to put up three billion dollars right

3966
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:08,719
now and he's like i don't have three

3967
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:09,920
billion dollars

3968
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:11,359
like i don't even make any money on

3969
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:12,480
these trades why do i owe three billion

3970
02:09:11,359 --> 02:09:13,118
dollars while you're sponsoring the

3971
02:09:12,479 --> 02:09:15,519
trade

3972
02:09:13,118 --> 02:09:16,639
so so there was a set of abstractions

3973
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:18,320
that

3974
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:19,760
you know i don't think either like like

3975
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:22,319
now he understands it like

3976
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:25,520
this happens in chip design like you buy

3977
02:09:22,319 --> 02:09:27,279
wafers from tsmc or samsung or intel

3978
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:28,960
and you know they say it works like this

3979
02:09:27,279 --> 02:09:31,118
and you do your design based on that and

3980
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:32,560
then chip comes back and doesn't work

3981
02:09:31,118 --> 02:09:34,238
and then suddenly you start having to

3982
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:36,000
open the black boxes like the

3983
02:09:34,238 --> 02:09:38,000
transistors really work like they said

3984
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:41,599
you know what's the real issue

3985
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:43,359
so so the

3986
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:45,279
there's a whole set of things that

3987
02:09:43,359 --> 02:09:46,158
created this opportunity and somebody

3988
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:48,559
spotted it

3989
02:09:46,158 --> 02:09:50,238
now people spot these kinds of

3990
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:52,320
opportunities all the times there's been

3991
02:09:50,238 --> 02:09:53,919
flash crashes there's been

3992
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:56,719
you know there's always short squeezes

3993
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:59,199
are fairly regular every ceo i know

3994
02:09:56,719 --> 02:10:00,158
hates the shorts because they're they're

3995
02:09:59,198 --> 02:10:01,678
manipulating

3996
02:10:00,158 --> 02:10:03,759
they're trying to manipulate their stock

3997
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:06,239
in a way that they make money

3998
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:07,599
and you know deprive value from both

3999
02:10:06,238 --> 02:10:08,799
this you know the company and the

4000
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:11,840
investors

4001
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:13,279
so the fact that

4002
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:15,679
you know some of these stocks were so

4003
02:10:13,279 --> 02:10:17,439
short it's hilarious

4004
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:19,760
that this hasn't happened before i don't

4005
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:22,000
know why and i don't actually know why

4006
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:23,280
some serious hedge funds didn't do it to

4007
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,479
other hedge funds

4008
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:26,840
and some of the hedge funds actually

4009
02:10:24,479 --> 02:10:29,678
made a lot of money on this yes

4010
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:32,159
so my my guess is we know

4011
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:33,520
five percent of what really happened and

4012
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:34,399
that a lot of the players don't know

4013
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:36,800
what happened

4014
02:10:34,399 --> 02:10:38,078
and the people who probably made the

4015
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:39,440
most money aren't the people that

4016
02:10:38,078 --> 02:10:41,599
they're talking about

4017
02:10:39,439 --> 02:10:42,479
yeah that's do you think there was

4018
02:10:41,599 --> 02:10:44,480
something uh

4019
02:10:42,479 --> 02:10:45,598
i mean this is the this is the cool kind

4020
02:10:44,479 --> 02:10:49,118
of uh

4021
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:51,440
elon uh you're the same kind of

4022
02:10:49,118 --> 02:10:52,319
conversationalist which is like first

4023
02:10:51,439 --> 02:10:55,839
principles

4024
02:10:52,319 --> 02:10:58,000
questions of like what the hell happened

4025
02:10:55,840 --> 02:11:00,239
uh just very basic questions of like was

4026
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,198
there something shady going on

4027
02:11:00,238 --> 02:11:04,559
uh what you know who are the parties

4028
02:11:03,198 --> 02:11:06,158
involved it's the basic questions that

4029
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:08,639
everybody wants to know about

4030
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:10,158
yeah so like we're in a very hyper

4031
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:11,840
competitive world right

4032
02:11:10,158 --> 02:11:13,359
but transactions like buying and selling

4033
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:14,400
stock is a trust event

4034
02:11:13,359 --> 02:11:16,238
you know i trust the company

4035
02:11:14,399 --> 02:11:16,799
representing themselves properly you

4036
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:18,238
know

4037
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:20,239
i bought the stock because i think it's

4038
02:11:18,238 --> 02:11:22,559
going to go up i trust that the

4039
02:11:20,238 --> 02:11:25,598
regulations are solid

4040
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:26,719
now inside of that there's all kinds of

4041
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:29,760
places where

4042
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:32,319
you know humans over trust and

4043
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:34,480
you know this this expose let's say some

4044
02:11:32,319 --> 02:11:36,719
weak points in the system

4045
02:11:34,479 --> 02:11:38,399
i don't know if it's going to get

4046
02:11:36,719 --> 02:11:39,920
corrected i don't know if the

4047
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:41,598
i don't know if we have close to the

4048
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:44,480
real story

4049
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:46,159
yeah my suspicion is we don't yeah and

4050
02:11:44,479 --> 02:11:47,678
listen to that guy he was

4051
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:49,039
like a little wide-eyed about and then

4052
02:11:47,679 --> 02:11:50,880
he did this and then they did that and

4053
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:52,399
it was like

4054
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:54,000
i think you should know more about that

4055
02:11:52,399 --> 02:11:56,399
your business than that

4056
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:58,560
but again there's many businesses when

4057
02:11:56,399 --> 02:12:00,879
like this layer is really stable

4058
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:02,480
you stop paying attention to it you pay

4059
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:02,960
attention to the stuff that's bugging

4060
02:12:02,479 --> 02:12:05,439
you

4061
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:06,719
or new you don't pay attention to the

4062
02:12:05,439 --> 02:12:07,919
stuff that just seems to work all the

4063
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:09,520
time you just

4064
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:11,840
you know the sky's blue every day

4065
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:13,360
california and where once a while the

4066
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:15,199
continued rains there was like what do

4067
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:17,118
we do

4068
02:12:15,198 --> 02:12:18,638
somebody go bring in the lawn furniture

4069
02:12:17,118 --> 02:12:20,078
you know like it's getting wet

4070
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:21,840
we don't know it's getting wet yeah it

4071
02:12:20,078 --> 02:12:23,359
doesn't it was blue for like 100 days

4072
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:25,920
and now it's

4073
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:26,960
you know so but part of the problem here

4074
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:29,520
with vlad this

4075
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:31,840
the ceo of robin hood is the scaling is

4076
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:34,719
that what we've been talking about is

4077
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:35,920
there's a lot of unexpected things that

4078
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:39,039
happen with the scaling

4079
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:40,639
and you have to be i think the scaling

4080
02:12:39,039 --> 02:12:41,760
forces you to then return to the

4081
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:43,359
fundamentals

4082
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:45,199
well it's interesting because when you

4083
02:12:43,359 --> 02:12:46,799
buy and sell stocks the scaling is you

4084
02:12:45,198 --> 02:12:48,319
know the stocks only move in a certain

4085
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:49,920
range and if you buy a stock you can

4086
02:12:48,319 --> 02:12:51,840
only lose that amount of money

4087
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,960
on the short short market you can lose a

4088
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:55,760
lot more than you can

4089
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:57,520
benefit like it has a it has a weird

4090
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:59,119
cost you know cost function or whatever

4091
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:01,360
the right word for that is

4092
02:12:59,118 --> 02:13:02,960
so he was trading in a market where he

4093
02:13:01,359 --> 02:13:04,158
wasn't actually capitalized for the

4094
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:07,359
downside

4095
02:13:04,158 --> 02:13:09,439
if it got outside a certain range

4096
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:10,639
now whether something the various has

4097
02:13:09,439 --> 02:13:14,238
happened i have no idea

4098
02:13:10,639 --> 02:13:15,920
but at some point the

4099
02:13:14,238 --> 02:13:17,598
financial risk to both him and his

4100
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:19,039
customers was way outside of his

4101
02:13:17,599 --> 02:13:20,480
financial capacity

4102
02:13:19,039 --> 02:13:22,719
and his understanding how the system

4103
02:13:20,479 --> 02:13:25,198
work was clearly

4104
02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:27,039
weak or or he didn't represent himself i

4105
02:13:25,198 --> 02:13:28,799
you know i don't know the person

4106
02:13:27,039 --> 02:13:30,000
when i listened to him nick yeah it

4107
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:32,239
could have been the surprise question

4108
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:34,479
was like and then these guys called and

4109
02:13:32,238 --> 02:13:36,158
you know it sounded like he was treating

4110
02:13:34,479 --> 02:13:38,000
stuff as a black box

4111
02:13:36,158 --> 02:13:39,439
maybe he shouldn't have but maybe his

4112
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:41,118
whole pilot expert somewhere else and it

4113
02:13:39,439 --> 02:13:44,638
was going on i don't i don't know

4114
02:13:41,118 --> 02:13:45,519
yep i mean this is uh this is one of the

4115
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:47,760
qualities of

4116
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:48,960
a good leader is under fire you have to

4117
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,360
perform

4118
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:52,960
and that means to think clearly and to

4119
02:13:51,359 --> 02:13:55,198
speak clearly

4120
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:56,158
and he dropped the ball on those things

4121
02:13:55,198 --> 02:13:58,319
because

4122
02:13:56,158 --> 02:13:59,598
and understand the problem quickly learn

4123
02:13:58,319 --> 02:14:03,039
and understand the problem

4124
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:05,760
like at this like basic level

4125
02:14:03,039 --> 02:14:07,039
like what the hell happened and my guess

4126
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:09,280
is

4127
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:10,479
you know at some level it was amateurs

4128
02:14:09,279 --> 02:14:12,479
trading against

4129
02:14:10,479 --> 02:14:14,799
you know expert slash insiders slash

4130
02:14:12,479 --> 02:14:17,598
people with you know special information

4131
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:18,800
outsiders is insiders yeah and the

4132
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:20,719
insiders

4133
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:22,800
you know my guess is the next time this

4134
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:25,760
happens we'll make money on it

4135
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:26,000
the insiders always win well they have

4136
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:27,679
more

4137
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,599
tools and more incentive i mean this

4138
02:14:27,679 --> 02:14:31,440
always happens like the outsiders are

4139
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:33,199
doing this for fun the insiders are

4140
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:35,519
doing this 24 7.

4141
02:14:33,198 --> 02:14:36,719
but there's numbers in the outsiders

4142
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:40,239
this is the interesting thing

4143
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:42,158
well there's numbers on the insiders too

4144
02:14:40,238 --> 02:14:43,839
like different kind of numbers different

4145
02:14:42,158 --> 02:14:45,679
kind of numbers

4146
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:47,360
but this could be a new era because i

4147
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:48,960
don't know at least i didn't expect that

4148
02:14:47,359 --> 02:14:50,880
uh a bunch of redditors could

4149
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:52,158
you know there's uh you know millions of

4150
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:54,239
people who can get together

4151
02:14:52,158 --> 02:14:55,439
the next one won't be a surprise but

4152
02:14:54,238 --> 02:14:57,439
don't you think the

4153
02:14:55,439 --> 02:14:59,039
the the crowd the people are planning

4154
02:14:57,439 --> 02:15:01,279
the next attack

4155
02:14:59,039 --> 02:15:04,238
we'll see but it has to be a surprise

4156
02:15:01,279 --> 02:15:04,238
can't be the same game

4157
02:15:04,399 --> 02:15:08,960
as to the end it could be there's a very

4158
02:15:07,279 --> 02:15:09,519
large number of games to play and they

4159
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:11,439
can be

4160
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:13,679
agile about it i don't know i'm not an

4161
02:15:11,439 --> 02:15:16,158
expert right that's a good question how

4162
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:17,840
the space of games how how restricted is

4163
02:15:16,158 --> 02:15:20,158
it

4164
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:22,560
yeah and the system is so complicated it

4165
02:15:20,158 --> 02:15:24,559
could be relatively unrestricted

4166
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:26,480
and also like you know during the last

4167
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:28,639
couple financial crashes

4168
02:15:26,479 --> 02:15:30,799
you know what set it off was you know

4169
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:33,599
sets of derivative events where

4170
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:34,480
you know the you know nasim talibs you

4171
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:37,199
know thing is

4172
02:15:34,479 --> 02:15:38,559
they're they're they're trying to lower

4173
02:15:37,198 --> 02:15:40,158
volatility

4174
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:42,000
in the short run but creating tail

4175
02:15:40,158 --> 02:15:43,679
events and

4176
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,359
systems always evolve towards that and

4177
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:48,800
then they always crash like

4178
02:15:45,359 --> 02:15:52,319
the gas curve is the you know star low

4179
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:55,920
ramp plateau crash it's 100

4180
02:15:52,319 --> 02:15:58,479
effective in the long run

4181
02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:00,560
let me ask you some advice to put on

4182
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:02,559
your profound hat

4183
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:04,639
what uh there's a bunch of young folks

4184
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:07,679
to listen to this thing

4185
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:09,840
for no good reason whatsoever

4186
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:11,920
undergraduate students maybe high school

4187
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:12,960
students maybe just young folks a young

4188
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:16,480
at heart

4189
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:18,158
looking for the next steps to taking

4190
02:16:16,479 --> 02:16:19,759
life what advice would you give to a

4191
02:16:18,158 --> 02:16:22,559
young person today about

4192
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:23,760
life maybe career but also life in

4193
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:26,639
general

4194
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:28,159
get good at some stuff well get to know

4195
02:16:26,639 --> 02:16:29,440
yourself right

4196
02:16:28,158 --> 02:16:31,198
get good at something that you're

4197
02:16:29,439 --> 02:16:33,279
actually interested in you have to love

4198
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:34,638
what you're doing to get good at it

4199
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:36,159
you really got to find that don't waste

4200
02:16:34,638 --> 02:16:38,879
all your time doing stuff that's just

4201
02:16:36,159 --> 02:16:43,439
boring or bland or numbing

4202
02:16:38,879 --> 02:16:43,438
right don't let old people screw you

4203
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:47,519
well people get talked into doing all

4204
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,079
kinds of and wrapping up huge

4205
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:50,559
student

4206
02:16:48,079 --> 02:16:52,000
you know student debts and like there's

4207
02:16:50,558 --> 02:16:53,920
so much crap going on

4208
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,679
you know and then it drains your time

4209
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:56,000
and drains yeah the eric weinstein you

4210
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:57,359
know

4211
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,040
thesis that you know the older

4212
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:00,559
generation will let go

4213
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:02,000
yeah and they're trapping all the young

4214
02:17:00,558 --> 02:17:02,318
people i think there's some truth to

4215
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,760
that

4216
02:17:02,318 --> 02:17:07,119
yeah sure just because you're old

4217
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:08,559
doesn't mean you stop thinking i know

4218
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:11,840
lots of really original

4219
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:15,438
yeah old people i'm an old person

4220
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:18,239
so um but you have to be conscious about

4221
02:17:15,439 --> 02:17:20,559
it you can fall into the ruts and then

4222
02:17:18,239 --> 02:17:22,318
do that you know when i hear young

4223
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:24,398
people spouting opinions that sounds

4224
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:26,000
like they come from fox news or cnn i

4225
02:17:24,398 --> 02:17:28,398
think they've been captured by

4226
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,439
groupthink and memes and supposed to

4227
02:17:28,398 --> 02:17:30,879
think on their own

4228
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:33,359
you know so if you find yourself

4229
02:17:30,879 --> 02:17:35,679
repeating what everybody else is saying

4230
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:37,519
you're not going to have a good life

4231
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:38,398
like like that's not how the world works

4232
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:40,478
it may be

4233
02:17:38,398 --> 02:17:42,558
it seems safe but it puts you at great

4234
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:45,760
jeopardy for

4235
02:17:42,558 --> 02:17:47,438
well being boring or unhappy or

4236
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:48,880
how long did it take you to find the

4237
02:17:47,439 --> 02:17:52,000
thing that uh

4238
02:17:48,879 --> 02:17:53,438
you have fun with well i don't know

4239
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,200
i've been a fun person since i was

4240
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:56,639
pretty little so everything i've gone

4241
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:57,920
through a couple periods of depression

4242
02:17:56,638 --> 02:18:00,079
in my life

4243
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:02,478
for a good reason or for uh the reason

4244
02:18:00,079 --> 02:18:05,840
that doesn't make any sense

4245
02:18:02,478 --> 02:18:07,599
yeah like some some things are hard

4246
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:09,280
like you go through mental transitions

4247
02:18:07,599 --> 02:18:12,159
in high school i was

4248
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:14,960
really depressed for a year and i think

4249
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:16,558
i had my first midlife crisis at 26.

4250
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:19,919
i kind of thought is this all there is

4251
02:18:16,558 --> 02:18:21,679
like i was working at a job that i loved

4252
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:23,280
and but i was going to work and all my

4253
02:18:21,679 --> 02:18:25,120
time is consumed

4254
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:27,200
what's what's the escape out of that

4255
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:30,319
depression what's the answer to is

4256
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:31,920
is this all there is well

4257
02:18:30,318 --> 02:18:33,119
a friend of mine i asked him because he

4258
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:34,478
was working his ass off i said what's

4259
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:37,840
your work-life balance

4260
02:18:34,478 --> 02:18:38,558
like like there's you know work friends

4261
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:41,200
family

4262
02:18:38,558 --> 02:18:42,478
personal time are you bouncing in that

4263
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:45,599
and he said work 80

4264
02:18:42,478 --> 02:18:47,358
family 20 and i try to i try to find

4265
02:18:45,599 --> 02:18:50,000
some time to sleep

4266
02:18:47,359 --> 02:18:51,679
like there's no personal time there's no

4267
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,280
passion at a time

4268
02:18:51,679 --> 02:18:55,200
because you know young people are often

4269
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:56,800
passionate about work so and i was

4270
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:58,960
certainly like that

4271
02:18:56,799 --> 02:19:01,679
but you need to you need to have some

4272
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:05,039
space in your life for different things

4273
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:06,719
and that's that creates uh that makes

4274
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:10,000
you resistant to the whole

4275
02:19:06,718 --> 02:19:11,518
the the the dip the the deep dips into

4276
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,879
depression kind of thing yeah well you

4277
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:16,000
have to get to know yourself too

4278
02:19:12,879 --> 02:19:18,558
meditation helps some physical

4279
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:21,359
something physically intense helps like

4280
02:19:18,558 --> 02:19:21,759
the weird places your mind goes kind of

4281
02:19:21,359 --> 02:19:24,000
thing

4282
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:26,079
like and why does it happen why do you

4283
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,920
do what you do like triggers like

4284
02:19:26,079 --> 02:19:31,120
the things that cause your mind to go to

4285
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:33,200
different places kind of thing or

4286
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:34,639
events like you're upbringing for better

4287
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:35,599
or worse whether your parents are great

4288
02:19:34,638 --> 02:19:38,799
people or not

4289
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:40,880
you you you come into

4290
02:19:38,799 --> 02:19:42,239
you know adulthood with all kinds of

4291
02:19:40,879 --> 02:19:44,239
emotional burdens

4292
02:19:42,239 --> 02:19:46,079
yeah and you can see some people are so

4293
02:19:44,239 --> 02:19:47,599
bloody stiff and restrained and they

4294
02:19:46,079 --> 02:19:48,879
think you know the world's fundamentally

4295
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:51,680
negative

4296
02:19:48,879 --> 02:19:52,959
like you maybe you have unexplored

4297
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:56,159
territory

4298
02:19:52,959 --> 02:19:58,559
yeah or you're afraid of something uh

4299
02:19:56,159 --> 02:20:02,079
definitely afraid of quite a few things

4300
02:19:58,559 --> 02:20:03,359
then you gotta go face them like like

4301
02:20:02,079 --> 02:20:05,039
what's the worst thing that happened

4302
02:20:03,359 --> 02:20:06,640
you're going to die right

4303
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:08,160
like that's inevitable you might as well

4304
02:20:06,639 --> 02:20:10,318
get over that like a 100

4305
02:20:08,159 --> 02:20:11,280
death rate like people were worried

4306
02:20:10,318 --> 02:20:13,439
about the virus but

4307
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:14,399
you know the human condition is pretty

4308
02:20:13,439 --> 02:20:16,239
deadly

4309
02:20:14,398 --> 02:20:18,239
there's something about embarrassment

4310
02:20:16,239 --> 02:20:21,840
let's see i've competed a lot in my life

4311
02:20:18,239 --> 02:20:24,398
and i think the if i'm too introspected

4312
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:26,880
the thing i'm most afraid of is

4313
02:20:24,398 --> 02:20:27,920
being like humiliated i think nobody

4314
02:20:26,879 --> 02:20:29,599
cares about that

4315
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:30,879
look you're the only person on the

4316
02:20:29,600 --> 02:20:32,159
planet zack cares about you being

4317
02:20:30,879 --> 02:20:36,239
humiliated exactly

4318
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:39,439
it's like a really useless thought it is

4319
02:20:36,239 --> 02:20:40,719
it's like uh you're all humiliating

4320
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:42,000
something happened in a room full of

4321
02:20:40,719 --> 02:20:43,599
people and they walk out and they didn't

4322
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,359
think about it one more second

4323
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:46,960
or maybe somebody told a funny story to

4324
02:20:45,359 --> 02:20:48,640
somebody else and then it just hates it

4325
02:20:46,959 --> 02:20:51,919
throughout yeah

4326
02:20:48,639 --> 02:20:53,199
yeah now i know it too i mean

4327
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:55,439
i've been really embarrassed about

4328
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:57,520
that nobody cared about myself

4329
02:20:55,439 --> 02:20:58,720
yeah it's a funny thing so the worst

4330
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:01,280
thing ultimately is just

4331
02:20:58,719 --> 02:21:02,478
uh yeah but that's the cage and then you

4332
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:04,079
have to get out of it yeah

4333
02:21:02,478 --> 02:21:05,679
like once you here's the thing once you

4334
02:21:04,079 --> 02:21:08,799
find something like that

4335
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:10,159
you have to be determined to break it

4336
02:21:08,799 --> 02:21:11,679
because otherwise you'll just you know

4337
02:21:10,159 --> 02:21:13,359
slowly accumulate that kind of junk and

4338
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:16,720
then you die as a

4339
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:17,040
you know a mess so the goal i guess it's

4340
02:21:16,719 --> 02:21:18,639
so

4341
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:20,399
it's like a cage with a cage i guess the

4342
02:21:18,639 --> 02:21:21,760
goal is to die in the biggest possible

4343
02:21:20,398 --> 02:21:25,358
cage

4344
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:27,280
well ideally you have no cage

4345
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:29,760
people do get enlightened i've got a few

4346
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:31,920
it's great you found a few there's a few

4347
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:34,398
out there i don't know of course

4348
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:35,680
um either that or they have you know

4349
02:21:34,398 --> 02:21:37,039
it's a great sales pitch there's like

4350
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:38,079
enlightened people writing books and

4351
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:40,000
doing all kinds of stuff

4352
02:21:38,079 --> 02:21:42,000
it's a good way to sell a book i'll give

4353
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,719
you that you've never met somebody you

4354
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,760
just thought

4355
02:21:42,719 --> 02:21:49,119
they just killed me like this like like

4356
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:50,398
mental clarity humor no 100 but i just

4357
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:51,920
feel like they're living in a bigger

4358
02:21:50,398 --> 02:21:53,358
cage they have their own

4359
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:55,760
they don't think there's a cage they're

4360
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:57,120
still okay you secretly suspect there's

4361
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:58,960
always the case

4362
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:00,640
ah there's no there's nothing outside

4363
02:21:58,959 --> 02:22:01,000
the the unit there's nothing outside the

4364
02:22:00,639 --> 02:22:05,760
cage

4365
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:09,040
[Laughter]

4366
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:09,760
you were you worked in a bunch of

4367
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:12,960
companies

4368
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:16,239
uh you led a lot of amazing teams

4369
02:22:12,959 --> 02:22:18,159
um i don't i'm not sure if you've ever

4370
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:19,359
been like at the early stages of a

4371
02:22:18,159 --> 02:22:23,600
startup

4372
02:22:19,359 --> 02:22:26,159
but do you have advice for

4373
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:28,239
uh somebody that wants to uh do a

4374
02:22:26,159 --> 02:22:30,318
startup or build a company

4375
02:22:28,239 --> 02:22:32,559
like build a strong team of engineers

4376
02:22:30,318 --> 02:22:36,159
that are passionate just want to

4377
02:22:32,559 --> 02:22:39,199
uh solve a big problem like is there uh

4378
02:22:36,159 --> 02:22:41,200
more specifically on that point well you

4379
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:43,200
have to be really good at stuff

4380
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:44,720
if you're going to lead and build a team

4381
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:46,960
you better be really interested in how

4382
02:22:44,719 --> 02:22:48,719
people work and think

4383
02:22:46,959 --> 02:22:50,079
the people or the solution to the

4384
02:22:48,719 --> 02:22:52,879
problems there's two things right

4385
02:22:50,079 --> 02:22:53,600
one is how people work and the other is

4386
02:22:52,879 --> 02:22:55,119
actually

4387
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:56,640
there's there's quite a few successful

4388
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:58,240
startups it's pretty clear the founders

4389
02:22:56,639 --> 02:23:00,159
don't know anything about people

4390
02:22:58,239 --> 02:23:01,359
like the idea was so powerful that it

4391
02:23:00,159 --> 02:23:04,159
propelled them

4392
02:23:01,359 --> 02:23:06,800
but i suspect somewhere early they they

4393
02:23:04,159 --> 02:23:08,318
hired some people who understood people

4394
02:23:06,799 --> 02:23:09,920
because people really need a lot of care

4395
02:23:08,318 --> 02:23:10,719
and feeding to collaborate and work

4396
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:13,840
together and

4397
02:23:10,719 --> 02:23:14,559
feel engaged and work hard you know like

4398
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:16,799
startups are

4399
02:23:14,559 --> 02:23:18,079
all about out producing other people

4400
02:23:16,799 --> 02:23:19,679
like you're nimble because you don't

4401
02:23:18,079 --> 02:23:21,840
have any legacy

4402
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:23,520
you don't have you know a bunch of

4403
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:25,840
people who are depressed about life

4404
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:27,439
you know just showing up you know so

4405
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:28,799
startups have a lot of advantages that

4406
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:31,600
way

4407
02:23:28,799 --> 02:23:32,879
you know do you like the the steve jobs

4408
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:35,120
talked about this idea

4409
02:23:32,879 --> 02:23:36,239
of a players and b players i don't know

4410
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:39,840
if you uh

4411
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:42,239
know this formulation yeah no um

4412
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:44,840
organizations that get taken over by pb

4413
02:23:42,239 --> 02:23:47,520
player leaders

4414
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:48,000
often really underperform their rc

4415
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:50,880
players

4416
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:52,159
that said in big organizations there's

4417
02:23:50,879 --> 02:23:53,519
so much work to do

4418
02:23:52,159 --> 02:23:55,200
like and there's so many people who are

4419
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:56,319
happy to do what you know like the

4420
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:58,399
leadership or the

4421
02:23:56,318 --> 02:24:00,239
big idea people who can see it consider

4422
02:23:58,398 --> 02:24:01,680
menial jobs

4423
02:24:00,239 --> 02:24:04,000
and you know you need a place for them

4424
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:06,159
but you need an organization that

4425
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:08,398
both values and rewards them but doesn't

4426
02:24:06,159 --> 02:24:10,398
let them take over the leadership of it

4427
02:24:08,398 --> 02:24:11,840
got it but so so you need to have an

4428
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:12,398
organization that's resistant to that

4429
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:15,840
but

4430
02:24:12,398 --> 02:24:18,879
in the early days the the notion with

4431
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:19,760
with steve was that like one b player in

4432
02:24:18,879 --> 02:24:22,239
a room

4433
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:22,960
of a players will be like destructive to

4434
02:24:22,239 --> 02:24:25,199
the whole

4435
02:24:22,959 --> 02:24:27,199
i've seen that happen i i don't know if

4436
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:29,040
it's like always true

4437
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:30,560
like you know you you run into people

4438
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:31,920
who are clearly b players but they think

4439
02:24:30,559 --> 02:24:33,439
they're very players and so they have a

4440
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:34,879
loud voice at the table and they make

4441
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:36,318
lots of demands for that

4442
02:24:34,879 --> 02:24:38,239
but there's other people are like i know

4443
02:24:36,318 --> 02:24:40,000
who i am i just want to work with you

4444
02:24:38,239 --> 02:24:41,199
know cool people and cool and just

4445
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,680
tell me what to do and i'll go get it

4446
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:43,680
done

4447
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:45,680
yeah you know so you have to again this

4448
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:48,000
is like people skills like

4449
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:49,600
what kind of person is it you know i've

4450
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,520
met some really great

4451
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:53,040
people i love working with that weren't

4452
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:54,640
the biggest id people the most

4453
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:56,000
productive ever but they show up they

4454
02:24:54,639 --> 02:24:58,000
get it done

4455
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:59,040
you know they create connection and

4456
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,000
community that people

4457
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:04,960
value it's it's it's pretty diverse so i

4458
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:07,120
don't think there's a recipe for that

4459
02:25:04,959 --> 02:25:08,559
i gotta ask you about love i heard

4460
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:10,560
you're into this now

4461
02:25:08,559 --> 02:25:11,840
into this love thing yeah is this is you

4463
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:14,880

book about your you know your management

philosophy he said it'd be a short book

4473
02:25:30,370 --> 02:25:37,840
[Laughter]

4474
02:25:34,879 --> 02:25:38,799
well that one was all pretty well uh

4475
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:41,280

4476
02:25:38,799 --> 02:25:42,318
love family friendship all that kind of

4477
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:44,239
uh

4478
02:25:42,318 --> 02:25:45,760
human stuff play in a successful life

4479
02:25:44,239 --> 02:25:47,439
you've been exceptionally successful in

4480
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:50,318
the space of

4481
02:25:47,439 --> 02:25:51,040
like running teams building cool in

4482
02:25:50,318 --> 02:25:53,840
this world

4483
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:56,479

02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:59,200
love get in the way did love help

4485
02:25:56,478 --> 02:26:00,478
the family get in the way to family help

4486
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:02,079
friendship you want the engineer's

4487
02:26:00,478 --> 02:26:04,478
answer

4488
02:26:02,079 --> 02:26:05,760
please so but first love is functional

4489
02:26:04,478 --> 02:26:08,398
right

4490
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:10,800
it's functional in what way so we

4491
02:26:08,398 --> 02:26:12,159
habituate ourselves to the environment

4492
02:26:10,799 --> 02:26:13,840
and actually jordan told me jordan

4493
02:26:12,159 --> 02:26:15,600
peterson told me this line

4494
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:17,120
so you go through life and you just get

4495
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:17,920
used to everything except for the things

4496
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:20,800
you love

4497
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:22,398
they they remain new like this is really

4498
02:26:20,799 --> 02:26:24,239
useful for you know

4499
02:26:22,398 --> 02:26:25,920
like like other people's children and

4500
02:26:24,239 --> 02:26:27,359
dogs and you know trees

4501
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:29,680
you just don't pay that much attention

4502
02:26:27,359 --> 02:26:30,880
to your own kids you monitor them really

4503
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:32,639
closely

4504
02:26:30,879 --> 02:26:35,199
like and if they go off a little bit

4505
02:26:32,639 --> 02:26:36,398
because you love them if you're smart

4506
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:38,800
if you're going to be a successful

4507
02:26:36,398 --> 02:26:42,478
parent you notice it right away

4508
02:26:38,799 --> 02:26:44,799
you don't habituate to

4509
02:26:42,478 --> 02:26:46,639
just things you love and if you want to

4510
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:47,438
be successful at work if you don't love

4511
02:26:46,639 --> 02:26:48,879
it

4512
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:51,040
you're not going to put the time in

4513
02:26:48,879 --> 02:26:52,159
somebody else it's somebody else that

4514
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:53,920
loves it like

4515
02:26:52,159 --> 02:26:57,439
because it's new and interesting and

4516
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:58,960
that lets you go to the next level

4517
02:26:57,439 --> 02:27:00,559
so it's the thing it's just a function

4518
02:26:58,959 --> 02:27:03,438
that generates newness

4519
02:27:00,559 --> 02:27:04,559
and novelty and surprises you know those

4520
02:27:03,439 --> 02:27:06,559
kind of things

4521
02:27:04,559 --> 02:27:08,239
it's really interesting but and there's

4522
02:27:06,559 --> 02:27:09,760
people figured out lots of

4523
02:27:08,239 --> 02:27:11,680
you know frameworks for this you know

4524
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:13,040
like like humans seem to go in

4525
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:14,800
partnership go through

4526
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:16,479
you know interest like somebody suddenly

4527
02:27:14,799 --> 02:27:18,079
somebody's interesting

4528
02:27:16,478 --> 02:27:20,000
and then you're infatuated with them and

4529
02:27:18,079 --> 02:27:21,840
then you're in love with them

4530
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:24,000
and then you you know different people

4531
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:26,398
have ideas about parental love or mature

4532
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:28,398
love like you go through a cycle of that

4533
02:27:26,398 --> 02:27:29,920
which keeps us together and it's you

4534
02:27:28,398 --> 02:27:31,199
know super functional for creating

4535
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:33,680
families and

4536
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:35,359
and creating communities and making you

4537
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:36,880
support somebody despite the fact that

4538
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:41,120
you don't love them

4539
02:27:36,879 --> 02:27:44,799
like and and

4540
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:47,760
it can be really enriching you know

4541
02:27:44,799 --> 02:27:49,599
now in the work life balance scheme if

4542
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:51,280
all you do is work

4543
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:53,040
you think you may be optimizing your

4544
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:56,239
work potential but if you don't

4545
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:59,120
love your work or you don't have family

4546
02:27:56,239 --> 02:28:02,000
and friends and things you care about

4547
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:03,439
your brain isn't well balanced like

4548
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,879
everybody knows the experience of you

4549
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:06,479
works on something all week you went

4550
02:28:04,879 --> 02:28:07,599
home and took two days off and you came

4551
02:28:06,478 --> 02:28:09,840
back in

4552
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:11,439
the odds of you working on the thing you

4553
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:12,639
picking up right where you left off is

4554
02:28:11,439 --> 02:28:16,000
zero

4555
02:28:12,639 --> 02:28:16,000
your brain refactored it

4556
02:28:16,879 --> 02:28:20,719
but being in blood is great it's like

4557
02:28:19,359 --> 02:28:22,000
changes the color of the light in the

4558
02:28:20,719 --> 02:28:25,119
room

4559
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:27,760
it creates a spaciousness that's that's

4560
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:30,560
different it helps you think

4561
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:31,280
it makes you strong buckowski had this

4562
02:28:30,559 --> 02:28:33,439
line about

4563
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:36,159
love being a fog that dissipates with

4564
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:38,000
the first light of reality

4565
02:28:36,159 --> 02:28:39,520
in the morning it's that's depressing i

4566
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,520
think it's the other way around

4567
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:42,960
it lasts well you like you said it's a

4568
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:45,120
function it's a thing that just

4569
02:28:42,959 --> 02:28:46,079
be the light that actually enlivens your

4570
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:47,760
world and

4571
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:49,200
creates the interest and the power and

4572
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:52,800
the strength and the

4573
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:54,640
to go do something well it's like

4574
02:28:52,799 --> 02:28:56,079
like that sounds like you know there's

4575
02:28:54,639 --> 02:28:57,760
like physical love emotional of

4576
02:28:56,079 --> 02:28:59,280
intellectual love spiritually yeah

4577
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:00,960
right isn't it all the same thing kind

4578
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:02,239
of nope

4579
02:29:00,959 --> 02:29:04,478
you should differentiate that maybe

4580
02:29:02,239 --> 02:29:05,840
that's your problem in your book you

4581
02:29:04,478 --> 02:29:06,079
should you should refine that a little

4582
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:07,600
bit

4583
02:29:06,079 --> 02:29:09,120
different chapters yeah there's

4584
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:10,800
different chapters what's that what's

4585
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:12,240
these are there aren't these are just

4586
02:29:10,799 --> 02:29:15,599
different layers of the same thing

4587
02:29:12,239 --> 02:29:17,039
the stack no physical people people

4588
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:18,318
some people are addicted to physical

4589
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:21,680
love and they have no idea about

4590
02:29:18,318 --> 02:29:22,719
emotional or intellectual love

4591
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:24,318
i don't know if they're the same thing

4592
02:29:22,719 --> 02:29:25,840
so i think they're different that's true

4593
02:29:24,318 --> 02:29:27,519
they could be different it'd be

4594
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:28,478
it i guess the ultimate goal is for it

4595
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:30,079
to be the same well if you want

4596
02:29:28,478 --> 02:29:30,719
something to be bigger and interesting

4597
02:29:30,079 --> 02:29:32,159
you should find

4598
02:29:30,719 --> 02:29:34,639
all its components and differentiate

4599
02:29:32,159 --> 02:29:36,559
them not climb it together

4600
02:29:34,639 --> 02:29:38,000
people do this all the time they yeah

4601
02:29:36,559 --> 02:29:39,439
and the modularity

4602
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,439
get your abstraction layers right and

4603
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:42,800
then you can you have room to breathe

4604
02:29:41,439 --> 02:29:44,479
well maybe you can write the forward to

4605
02:29:42,799 --> 02:29:46,719
my book about love

4606
02:29:44,478 --> 02:29:49,199
yeah or the afterwards and the after you

4607
02:29:46,719 --> 02:29:50,559
really tried

4608
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:53,359
i feel like lex has made a lot of

4609
02:29:50,559 --> 02:29:54,959
progress in this book but

4610
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:56,559
uh well you have things in your life

4611
02:29:54,959 --> 02:29:58,639
that you love yeah

4612
02:29:56,559 --> 02:30:01,199
yeah you know so and they are you're

4613
02:29:58,639 --> 02:30:03,599
right they're modular it's

4614
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:05,040
and you can have multiple things with

4615
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:08,318
the same person or the same

4616
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:09,760
thing and yeah but yeah

4617
02:30:08,318 --> 02:30:12,398
depending on the moment of the day yeah

4618
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:14,239
there's like what bukowski

4619
02:30:12,398 --> 02:30:16,159
described as that moment you go from

4620
02:30:14,239 --> 02:30:18,318
being in love to having

4621
02:30:16,159 --> 02:30:19,359
a different kind of love yeah right and

4622
02:30:18,318 --> 02:30:20,879
that's the transition

4623
02:30:19,359 --> 02:30:22,640
but when it happens if you read the

4624
02:30:20,879 --> 02:30:25,279
owner's manual and you believed it

4625
02:30:22,639 --> 02:30:26,559
you would have said oh this happened it

4626
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:28,800
doesn't mean it's not love it's a

4627
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:31,760
different kind of love

4628
02:30:28,799 --> 02:30:32,000
but but maybe there's something better

4629
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:34,318
about

4630
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,520
that as you grow old if all you do is

4631
02:30:34,318 --> 02:30:39,119
regret

4632
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:40,640
how you used to be it's sad right

4633
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:42,479
you should have learned a lot of things

4634
02:30:40,639 --> 02:30:43,840
because like who you can be in your

4635
02:30:42,478 --> 02:30:45,679
future self is

4636
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:47,520
is actually more interesting and

4637
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:50,000
possibly delightful than

4638
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:50,800
you know being a mad kid in love with

4639
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,600
the

4640
02:30:50,799 --> 02:30:55,599
the next person like that's super fun

4641
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:57,920
when it happens but

4642
02:30:55,600 --> 02:31:00,960
that's that's you know five percent of

4643
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:02,719
the possibility

4644
02:31:00,959 --> 02:31:04,639
yeah that's right that there's a lot

4645
02:31:02,719 --> 02:31:05,199
more fun to be had in the long lasting

4646
02:31:04,639 --> 02:31:07,519
stuff

4647
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:09,120
yeah or meaning you know if that's me

4648
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:10,800
which is a kind of fun

4649
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:12,720
it's a deeper kind of fun and it's

4650
02:31:10,799 --> 02:31:15,840
surprising you know that's

4651
02:31:12,719 --> 02:31:17,920
like like the thing i like is surprises

4652
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:19,280
you know and you just never know what's

4653
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:20,639
gonna happen yeah

4654
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:21,760
but you have to look carefully and you

4655
02:31:20,639 --> 02:31:22,559
have to work at it you have to think

4656
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:24,960
about it and

4657
02:31:22,559 --> 02:31:26,159
you know it's yeah you have to see the

4658
02:31:24,959 --> 02:31:28,318
surprises when they happen

4659
02:31:26,159 --> 02:31:29,760
right you have to be looking for it from

4660
02:31:28,318 --> 02:31:33,359
the branching perspective

4661
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:35,280
you mentioned regrets uh

4662
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:38,000
do you have regrets about your own

4663
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:40,000
trajectory oh yeah of course

4664
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:43,040
yeah some of it's painful but you want

4665
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:45,359
to hear the painful stuff

4666
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:46,720
i'd say like in terms of working with

4667
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:48,640
people

4668
02:31:46,719 --> 02:31:50,559
when people did say stuff i didn't like

4669
02:31:48,639 --> 02:31:53,840
especially if it was a bit nefarious

4670
02:31:50,559 --> 02:31:56,318
i took it personally and i also felt it

4671
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:56,719
was personal about them but a lot of

4672
02:31:56,318 --> 02:31:58,639
times

4673
02:31:56,719 --> 02:32:00,719
like humans are you know most humans are

4674
02:31:58,639 --> 02:32:02,000
a mess right and then they act out and

4675
02:32:00,719 --> 02:32:04,478
they do stuff

4676
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,920
and i this psychologist i heard a long

4677
02:32:04,478 --> 02:32:07,679
time ago said

4678
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:09,040
you tend to think somebody does

4679
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:10,479
something to you

4680
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:11,920
but really what they're doing is they're

4681
02:32:10,478 --> 02:32:13,199
doing what they're doing while they're

4682
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:16,159
in front of you

4683
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:17,040
it's not that much about you yeah right

4684
02:32:16,159 --> 02:32:20,239
and

4685
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:22,000
as i got more interested in

4686
02:32:20,239 --> 02:32:23,280
you know when i work with people i think

4687
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:25,840
about them and

4688
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:27,359
probably analyze them and understand

4689
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:29,200
them a little bit and then when they do

4690
02:32:27,359 --> 02:32:30,720
stuff i'm way less surprised and i'm

4691
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:31,200
wait you know and if it's bad i'm way

4692
02:32:30,719 --> 02:32:34,879
less

4693
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:35,359
hurt and i react way less like i sort of

4694
02:32:34,879 --> 02:32:37,839
expect

4695
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:38,720
everybody's got their yeah and it's

4696
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:41,200
not about you

4697
02:32:38,719 --> 02:32:41,760
it's not about me that much it's like

4698
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:43,040
you know

4699
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:45,120
you know you do something and you think

4700
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:46,800
you're embarrassed but nobody cares

4701
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:48,479
like and somebody's really mad at you at

4702
02:32:46,799 --> 02:32:50,639
the odds of it being about

4703
02:32:48,478 --> 02:32:51,840
you yeah no they're getting mad the way

4704
02:32:50,639 --> 02:32:53,039
they're doing that because of some

4705
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:55,439
pattern they learned

4706
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:56,720
and you know and maybe you can help them

4707
02:32:55,439 --> 02:32:58,239
if you care enough about it

4708
02:32:56,719 --> 02:33:00,398
but or you could step you could see it

4709
02:32:58,239 --> 02:33:02,159
coming and step out of the way

4710
02:33:00,398 --> 02:33:04,639
like like i wish i was way better at

4711
02:33:02,159 --> 02:33:07,600
that i'm i'm a bit of a hothead

4712
02:33:04,639 --> 02:33:08,799
and and you said with steve that was a

4713
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:11,120
feature not a bug

4714
02:33:08,799 --> 02:33:13,039
yeah well he was using it as the counter

4715
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:14,960
force the orderliness that would crush

4716
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:16,960
his work well you were doing the same

4717
02:33:14,959 --> 02:33:18,799
yeah maybe i don't think i don't think

4718
02:33:16,959 --> 02:33:21,358
my uh my vision was big enough

4719
02:33:18,799 --> 02:33:23,920
it was more like i just got pissed off

4720
02:33:21,359 --> 02:33:26,399
and did stuff

4721
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:27,200
i'm sure that's just yeah yeah you're

4722
02:33:26,398 --> 02:33:29,519
telling me

4723
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:31,359
i don't know if it had the it didn't

4724
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:32,880
have the amazing effect of creating the

4725
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:35,200
trillion dollar company it was more like

4726
02:33:32,879 --> 02:33:38,159
i just got pissed off and left

4727
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:39,040
and or made enemies that he shouldn't

4728
02:33:38,159 --> 02:33:41,119
have been

4729
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:42,640
yeah it's hard like i didn't really

4730
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:43,600
understand politics until i worked at

4731
02:33:42,639 --> 02:33:45,358
apple

4732
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:47,680
where you know steve was a master player

4733
02:33:45,359 --> 02:33:49,359
of politics and his staff had to be or

4734
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:51,200
they wouldn't survive them and

4735
02:33:49,359 --> 02:33:52,318
it was definitely part of the culture

4736
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:54,399
and then i've been in companies where

4737
02:33:52,318 --> 02:33:56,799
they say it's political but it's all

4738
02:33:54,398 --> 02:33:58,639
you know fun and games compared to apple

4739
02:33:56,799 --> 02:34:00,318
and it's not that

4740
02:33:58,639 --> 02:34:02,559
the people apple are bad people it's

4741
02:34:00,318 --> 02:34:04,559
just they operated politically at a

4742
02:34:02,559 --> 02:34:06,239
higher level

4743
02:34:04,559 --> 02:34:07,760
you know it's not like oh somebody said

4744
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:10,719
something bad about somebody

4745
02:34:07,760 --> 02:34:11,120
somebody else which is most politics

4746
02:34:10,719 --> 02:34:13,760
it's

4747
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:15,600
you know they they had strategies about

4748
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:18,318
accomplishing their goals

4749
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:19,760
sometimes you know over the dead bodies

4750
02:34:18,318 --> 02:34:23,039
of their enemies

4751
02:34:19,760 --> 02:34:25,359
you know with some communication yeah

4752
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:28,240
more game of thrones and sophistication

4753
02:34:25,359 --> 02:34:29,840
and like a big time factor rather than a

4754
02:34:28,239 --> 02:34:31,680
you know well that requires a lot of

4755
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:34,639
control over your emotions i think

4756
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:35,520
uh to do to have a bigger strategy in

4757
02:34:34,639 --> 02:34:38,398
the way you behave

4758
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:40,319
yeah and it's it's it's effective in the

4759
02:34:38,398 --> 02:34:42,559
sense that coordinating thousands of

4760
02:34:40,318 --> 02:34:44,879
people to do really hard things

4761
02:34:42,559 --> 02:34:46,478
where many of the people in there don't

4762
02:34:44,879 --> 02:34:47,599
understand themselves much less how

4763
02:34:46,478 --> 02:34:50,639
they're participating

4764
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:53,120
yeah creates all kinds of

4765
02:34:50,639 --> 02:34:55,680
you know drama and problems that you

4766
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:57,120
know our solution is political in nature

4767
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:58,800
like how do you convince people how do

4768
02:34:57,120 --> 02:35:00,319
you leverage them how do you motivate

4769
02:34:58,799 --> 02:35:01,119
them how do you get rid of them how you

4770
02:35:00,318 --> 02:35:03,119
know like there's

4771
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:04,399
there's so many layers of that that are

4772
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:06,479
interesting

4773
02:35:04,398 --> 02:35:08,478
and even though some some of it let's

4774
02:35:06,478 --> 02:35:12,159
say may be tough

4775
02:35:08,478 --> 02:35:14,159
it's not evil

4776
02:35:12,159 --> 02:35:15,600
unless you know you use that skill to

4777
02:35:14,159 --> 02:35:17,280
evil purposes which some people

4778
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:19,280
obviously do but

4779
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:20,720
but it's a skill set that operates you

4780
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:22,720
know and i wish i'd

4781
02:35:20,719 --> 02:35:24,318
you know i was interested in it but i

4782
02:35:22,719 --> 02:35:26,639
you know it was sort of like i'm an

4783
02:35:24,318 --> 02:35:28,398
engineer i do my thing

4784
02:35:26,639 --> 02:35:29,680
and you know there's there's times when

4785
02:35:28,398 --> 02:35:33,119
i could have way bigger

4786
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:34,960
impact if i you know knew how to

4787
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:36,880
if i paid more attention and knew more

4788
02:35:34,959 --> 02:35:39,119
about that

4789
02:35:36,879 --> 02:35:40,000
about the human layer of the stack yeah

4790
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:42,000
that human

4791
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:43,040
political power you know expression

4792
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:45,280
layer of the stack

4793
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:46,800
which is complicated and there's lots to

4794
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:49,280
know about it i mean people are good at

4795
02:35:46,799 --> 02:35:51,199
it are just amazing

4796
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:52,840
and when they're good at it and let's

4797
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:55,520
say

4798
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:56,478
relatively kind and oriented in a good

4799
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:59,280
direction

4800
02:35:56,478 --> 02:36:00,639
you can really feel it can get lots of

4801
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:03,520
stuff done and coordinate things you

4802
02:36:00,639 --> 02:36:05,840
never thought possible

4803
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:07,680
but all people like that also have some

4804
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:09,680
pretty hard edges because

4805
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:11,280
you know it's it's a heavy lift and i

4806
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:13,040
wish i'd spent more time with that when

4807
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:14,560
i was younger but

4808
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:17,520
but maybe i wasn't ready you know i was

4809
02:36:14,559 --> 02:36:20,079
a wide-eyed kid for 30 years

4810
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:20,640
it's a little bit of a kid i know what

4811
02:36:20,079 --> 02:36:25,120
do you

4812
02:36:20,639 --> 02:36:27,039
hope your legacy is when there's a

4813
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:28,880
when there's a book like a hitchhiker's

4814
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:31,359
guide to the galaxy and this is like a

4815
02:36:28,879 --> 02:36:34,398
one sentence entry ball jim caller from

4816
02:36:31,359 --> 02:36:36,000
like that guy lived at some point

4817
02:36:34,398 --> 02:36:38,159
there's not many you know not many

4818
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,959
people be remembered uh you're one of

4819
02:36:38,159 --> 02:36:42,478
the

4820
02:36:38,959 --> 02:36:44,879
sparkling little human creatures

4821
02:36:42,478 --> 02:36:46,318
that had a big impact on the world how

4822
02:36:44,879 --> 02:36:48,559
do you hold you'll be remembered

4823
02:36:46,318 --> 02:36:50,639
my daughter was trying to get uh she

4824
02:36:48,559 --> 02:36:53,760
added my wikipedia page to say that i

4825
02:36:50,639 --> 02:36:55,358
was a legend and a guru

4826
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:58,159
but they took it out so she put it back

4827
02:36:55,359 --> 02:36:59,760
in she's 15.

4828
02:36:58,159 --> 02:37:00,979
i think i think that was probably the

4829
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:02,639
best part of my legacy

4830
02:37:00,979 --> 02:37:04,478
[Laughter]

4831
02:37:02,639 --> 02:37:06,000
she got her sister they were all excited

4832
02:37:04,478 --> 02:37:07,519
they were like trying to put it in the

4833
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,079
references because there's articles in

4834
02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:10,239
that and

4835
02:37:08,079 --> 02:37:11,200
they're telling you that so the eyes of

4836
02:37:10,239 --> 02:37:14,159
your kids your

4837
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:15,840
uh legend well they're pretty skeptical

4838
02:37:14,159 --> 02:37:19,359
because they'll be better than that

4839
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:20,639
they're like dad so yeah that's

4840
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:22,720
that's stupid that kind of stuff is

4841
02:37:20,639 --> 02:37:24,398
super fun in terms of the big legends

4842
02:37:22,719 --> 02:37:26,799
stuff anchor

4843
02:37:24,398 --> 02:37:28,398
okay legacy i don't really care you're

4844
02:37:26,799 --> 02:37:29,679
just an engineer

4845
02:37:28,398 --> 02:37:32,000
no they've been thinking about building

4846
02:37:29,680 --> 02:37:33,600
a big pyramid

4847
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:36,719
so i had a debate with a friend about

4848
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:38,800
whether pyramids or craters are cooler

4849
02:37:36,719 --> 02:37:40,000
and you realize that there's craters

4850
02:37:38,799 --> 02:37:41,358
everywhere but you know they built a

4851
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
couple of pyramids five thousand years

4852
02:37:41,359 --> 02:37:45,439
ago in there

4853
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:46,879
and they remember you think that would

4854
02:37:45,439 --> 02:37:50,159
be foreign

4855
02:37:46,879 --> 02:37:51,438
uh those aren't easy to build oh i know

4856
02:37:50,159 --> 02:37:54,398
and they don't actually know how they

4857
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:58,000
built them which is great

4858
02:37:54,398 --> 02:38:00,478
it's either uh agi or aliens could be

4859
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:01,600
involved so i think

4860
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:03,519
i think you're gonna have to figure out

4861
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:06,559
quite a few more things than just

4862
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:08,319
the basics of civil engineering

4863
02:38:06,559 --> 02:38:09,920
so i guess you hope your legacy is

4864
02:38:08,318 --> 02:38:12,639
pyramids

4865
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:14,478
that would that would be cool and my

4866
02:38:12,639 --> 02:38:16,159
wikipedia page you know getting updated

4867
02:38:14,478 --> 02:38:17,760
by my daughter periodically

4868
02:38:16,159 --> 02:38:20,000
like those two things would pretty much

4869
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:21,920
