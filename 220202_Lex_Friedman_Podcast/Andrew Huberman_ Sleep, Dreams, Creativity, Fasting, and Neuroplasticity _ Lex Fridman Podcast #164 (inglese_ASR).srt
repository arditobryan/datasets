1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,560
andrew huberman his second time in the

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:06,639
podcast

4
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,879
he's a neuroscientist at stanford a

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,919
world-class researcher and educator

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,000
and now he has a new podcast on youtube

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,199
and all the usual places called

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,079
hubermann lab

9
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,800
that i can't recommend highly enough

10
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,519
quick mention

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,320
of our sponsors master class online

12
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,640
courses

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,399
four sigmatic mushroom coffee magic

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,278
spoon low carb cereal

15
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,518
and better help online therapy click the

16
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,159
sponsor links to get a discount

17
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,839
by the way masterclass is testing to see

18
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,718
if they want to support this podcast

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,960
long term

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,160
so if you're on the fence now is the

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,160
time to sign up

22
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,839
and i'm pretty sure andrew will have a

23
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,479
neuroscience master class on there soon

24
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,640
enough

25
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,718
though his podcast is basically a weekly

26
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,198
master class in itself

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,920
as a side note let me say that andrew is

28
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,479
a friend

29
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,520
and a new collaborator we're working on

30
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,198
a paper together

31
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440
about a topic we're both really

32
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,198
passionate about at the intersection of

33
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,960
neuroscience and machine learning

34
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,558
but that's probably many months away

35
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
from being published

36
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,319
still i'm really excited about this work

37
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,840
he's one of the smartest and kindest

38
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,959
people i have the pleasure of talking to

39
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
on this podcast

40
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,239
so i hope we'll talk many more times in

41
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,920
the future

42
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,239

47
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,239
and now here's my conversation with

48
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,118
andrew huberman

49
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,158
why do humans need sleep let's let's go

50
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,519
with a big

51
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,719
first question okay well the answer i'll

52
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,879
start with

53
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,759
is the one that i always default to when

54
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,798
there's a why

55
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,680
question which is uh i wasn't consulted

56
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,600
at the design

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,399
phase so so i wriggle my way out of

58
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,438
giving a

59
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,040
absolute answer right but

60
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:57,199
there's one mechanism that's very clear

61
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,960
that's super important which is that the

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,320
longer we are awake

63
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:05,438
the more adenosine accumulates

64
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,478
in our brain and adenosine binds to

65
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:12,318
adenosine receptors no surprise there

66
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,599
and it creates the feeling of sleepiness

67
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:18,079
independent of time of day or night

68
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,639
so there are two mechanisms one is we

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
get sleepy

70
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,000
as adenosine accumulates the longer

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,159
we've been awake the more adenosine is

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,919
accumulated in our system

73
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,680
but how sleepy we get

74
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,280
for a given amount of adenosine depends

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,560
on where we are in this so-called

76
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,039
circadian cycle

77
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,199
and the circadian cycle is just this

78
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,280
very very well conserved oscillation

79
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,719
it's a temperature oscillation where you

80
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,318
go from a low point

81
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,840
typically if you're awake during the day

82
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,958
and you're asleep at night you'll

83
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,878
your lowest temperature point will be

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,239
like three a.m four a.m and then your

85
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,840
temperature will start to creep

86
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,239
up as you wake up in the morning and

87
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,759
then it'll peak in the late afternoon

88
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,959
and then it'll start to drop again

89
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,919
toward the evening and then you get

90
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,840
sleepy again that

91
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,639
oscillation in temperature takes 24

92
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,920
hours temperature

93
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,598
yeah plus or minus an hour and i

94
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,759
don't even though i wasn't consulted at

95
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,639
the design phase i do not think it's a

96
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,840
coincidence

97
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,199
that it's aligned to the 24-hour spin of

98
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,439
the earth on its axis

99
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,318
and the fact that we tend to be bathed

100
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,560
in sunlight

101
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,079
for a portion of that spin and in

102
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
darkness for the other portion that's

103
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
been so there are two mechanisms the

104
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,759
adenosine accumulation and the circadian

105
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:31,519
time point that we happen to be at and

106
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,359
those converge

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,039
to create a sense of sleepiness or

108
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,120
wakefulness the simple way

109
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,759
to reveal these two mechanisms to

110
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,680
uncouple them is stay up for 24 hours

111
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,120
and you will find that even though

112
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
you've been let's say you stay up

113
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,280
midnight

114
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,080
2 a.m 3 a.m provided you're on a regular

115
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,598
schedule

116
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,280
like that i follow not like the kind

117
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,000
that you follow uh

118
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
you get i will get very sleepy around 3

119
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,318
4 a.m

120
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,519
but then around 5 or 6 or 7 a.m which is

121
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,919
my normal wake-up time

122
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,200
i'll start to feel more alert even

123
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,759
though adenosine has been accumulating

124
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,598
further so adenosine is higher for me

125
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,959
the longer i stay up and yet i feel more

126
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:11,840
alert than i did a few hours ago and

127
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,158
that's because these are

128
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
two interacting forces so adenosine

129
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,039
makes you sleepy

130
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,879
and then just how sleepy or how awake

131
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,239
you feel also depends on where you are

132
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,680
in this temperature oscillation that

133
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,439
takes 24 hours okay so that's

134
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,639
fascinating so there's a bunch of

135
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,879
oscillations going on

136
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
and then it kind of through the

137
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,560
evolutionary process

138
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
have evolved to all be aligned somewhat

139
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,319
and they interplay so it's

140
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,839
you said your your body temperature goes

141
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,879
up and down

142
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,439
there's chemicals in your brain that

143
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,079
uh oscillate and then there's the actual

144
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,439
oscillation

145
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:50,478
of the the sun in the

146
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,478
in the sky so all of that together

147
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,160
has some impact on each other and

148
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,240
somehow that all

149
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,199
results in us wanting to go to sleep

150
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,439
every night

151
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,038
right so um and we can get right into

152
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,319
the meat of this so i guess we just dove

153
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,439
right in but the

154
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:08,000
so the the temperature oscillation

155
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,000
is the effector of the circadian clock

156
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,839
so every cell in our body has a 24-hour

157
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
rhythm that's dictated by

158
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,319
genes like clock per bee male this is

159
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,478
one of the great successes of biology

160
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,839
they give a nobel prize to the record

161
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,680
i don't know if rapper got it forgive me

162
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,279
but sorry if you got it steve

163
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
congratulations if you didn't i'm sorry

164
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,719
i wasn't on the committee um

165
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
nonetheless did beautiful work steve

166
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,800
reporter and others

167
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
um but mike roshbosh and like other

168
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
people worked out these mechanisms in

169
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,359
flies and bacteria and mammals there are

170
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,680
these genes

171
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,560
that create 24-hour oscillations in gene

172
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,199
expression etc in every cell of our body

173
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,879
but what aligns those is a signal from

174
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,079
the master circadian clock which sits

175
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,959
right above the roof of the mouth

176
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,918
called the suprachiasmatic nucleus and

177
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,879
that clock

178
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,439
synchronizes all the clocks of the body

179
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,719
to this

180
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,839
general temperature rhythm by way of

181
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
controlling

182
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,519
systemic temperature which makes perfect

183
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,038
sense if you want to create a general

184
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,159
oscillation in all the tissues and

185
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,120
organs in the body

186
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,560
use temperature and so that work on

187
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
temperature if people want to explore it

188
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,639
further was joe takahashi who was at

189
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,399
northwestern now at ut

190
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,160
southwestern in dallas and it is

191
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,519
absolutely clear that humans do better

192
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,080
on a diurnal schedule

193
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,719
sorry lex than a nocturnal schedule

194
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,519
because

195
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,520
you could say well provided i sleep and

196
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,038
push adenosine back downhill which is

197
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,839
what happens when we sleep adenosine

198
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,519
is then reduced and provided i am on

199
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,959
more or less a 24 hour schedule why

200
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,680
should it matter that i'm awake when the

201
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,000
sun's out

202
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,120
and um and i'm asleep when the sun is

203
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,800
down but

204
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,560
it turns out that if you look at health

205
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,000
metrics people that are

206
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,478
strictly nocturnal do far worse

207
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,120
on immune function or metabolic function

208
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:50,719
etc

209
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,319
than people who are diurnal who are

210
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,520
awake during the daytime and animals

211
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,360
that are nocturnal

212
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,799
it's the opposite and animals that are

213
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,520
so-called crepuscular which

214
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,199
tend to be active at dawn and at dusk

215
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,478
this is a beautiful system i won't go

216
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,478
down that rabbit hole but these are

217
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,240
animals whose visual systems

218
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,598
operate best they tend to be predators

219
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,160
like mountain lions

220
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,639
they have optimized their waking times

221
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,199
for the times when the animals they eat

222
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,199
can't see well in those light conditions

223
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,919
but given the rod cone ratios in their

224
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,919
eyes

225
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,079
the the mountain lion is picking off

226
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:23,120
it's like when you see uh special forces

227
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,359
and they're looking through

228
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,478
night vision goggles and they have a

229
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,479
clear advantage

230
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,519
right they're seeing in the dark that's

231
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:30,240
basically what it's like to be a

232
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,279
mountain lion

233
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,560
as opposed to a bunny rabbit would you

234
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,359
say that a lot of these

235
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,879
cycles evolved in the predator-prey

236
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,080
relationships of the different

237
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,918
throughout the food chain so it's

238
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,120
basically all somehow has to do with

239
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,598
survival

240
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,800
in the in this complicated web of

241
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,800
predators and prey

242
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
almost certainly there had to have been

243
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,120
a time in which humans being

244
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,319
awake and active at night as opposed to

245
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,038
during the day

246
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,080
uh led to high level higher levels of

247
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,318
lethality

248
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,758
and probably particularly in kids you

249
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,400
imagine kids running around in the dark

250
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,598
and getting

251
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,878
that where there are a lot of animals

252
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,560
that can see really well under those

253
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,479
conditions and humans can't

254
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,839
and this would be all pre-electricity

255
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,359
even if you're carrying a torch

256
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,119
i mean the range of illumination on a

257
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,240
torch is nothing

258
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,319
compared to what um a a nighttime

259
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,918
predator like a large cat or something

260
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,120
can can do that i mean they basically

261
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,478
they can see everything they need to in

262
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
order to eat us

263
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,318
and not the other way around so one

264
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,520
fascinating thing you said

265
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,160
is uh that blew my mind and we went

266
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,598
right past

267
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,479
it uh which is the temperature is a

268
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
really powerful like if you were to

269
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,879
think about the ways that different

270
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,639
parts of the body

271
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,320
different systems the body would

272
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:45,919
communicate with each other

273
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,399
temperature would be a really good one

274
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:51,120
and that just i mean maybe it's obvious

275
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,240
but it kind of blew my mind just now

276
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,519
that yeah these systems are all

277
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,080
distributed

278
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,000
right and they have to kind of they're

279
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,278
not actually sending signals but they're

280
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,278
coordinating they need

281
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:07,679
some sort of universal thing to look at

282
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,879
in order to coordinate and temperature

283
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,559
is a nice one to

284
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,399
to uh to build around and that way

285
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,159
you can control the behavior of all

286
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,958
these different systems by controlling

287
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,958
the temperature right it's attractive to

288
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,639
think of a mechanism where this

289
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,479
master circadian clock secretes a

290
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,159
peptide or something that goes and

291
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,080
locks to receptors in all the cells and

292
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,120
gets it just right but that leaves far

293
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,839
too much room for

294
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,480
variability binding affinities cells in

295
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,080
a lot of

296
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,920
parts of our body are at different

297
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,399
stages of maturation they're turning

298
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,240
over

299
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,159
liver cells and so forth and for

300
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,000
instance our we have a clock in our gut

301
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,600
and in our liver

302
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,440
such that if we were just take out your

303
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,879
liver and put it on a table

304
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
and just look at the expression of these

305
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,399
genes it would be in a 24 hour

306
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,320
oscillation on its own it's independent

307
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,919
but something has to entrain them and

308
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,680
keep them all synchronized and so it's

309
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,079
not obvious that it would be temperature

310
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,199
takahashi's great gift to biology was to

311
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,759
show that

312
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,360
all the stuff coming out of this master

313
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,360
circadian clock

314
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,800
at the end of the day that's a weird

315
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,240
statement no pun intended

316
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,919
at the end at the end of the day end the

317
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
night at the um

318
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,000
at the end of the story it all boils

319
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,719
down to making sure that the temperature

320
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,799
of tissues

321
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,480
oscillates in the same fashion that's

322
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,879
blowing my mind and thinking

323
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,680
like what other mechanism could possibly

324
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:24,399
exist

325
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,879
to create that kind of oscillation well

326
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,958
you're

327
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,879
you're russian it's cold in russia for a

328
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,479
lot of the year the hibernation signal

329
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,399
in certain animals is a remarkable

330
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,000
signal there are peptides secreted from

331
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,639
this very same clock

332
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,679
that in animals like ground squirrels or

333
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,000
bears

334
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,359
they go into a kind of a torpor where

335
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,278
everything reproduction

336
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
metabolism everything is reduced while

337
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:45,519
they're in their cave they don't

338
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,078
actually stay asleep

339
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,278
all of winter that's a myth um and they

340
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,639
actually do these very

341
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,240
um dramatic and periodic arousals from

342
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,600
hibernation where they just shake and

343
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,879
shake and shake it looks like a seizure

344
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
and then they go back under into the

345
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,078
torpor

346
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,440
that's from a peptide that's released

347
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,759
but that's different because that's

348
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,839
about

349
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,919
shutting down the whole system it's

350
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,560
clear that having these very regular

351
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,000
oscillations every 24 hours is essential

352
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:14,399
for everything from

353
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,759
metabolism to reproduction is there uh

354
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,399
an optimal temperature for sleep that

355
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,600
i i should mention i think your latest

356
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,320
episode

357
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,159
uh you uh and people should go check out

358
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:32,000
helixsleep.com huberman to support

359
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:33,519
andrew uh thanks for the plug

360
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
i mean that's the amazing thing about

361
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,120
the stuff that you're creating oh

362
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,440
and yes you have a new podcast that's

363
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,440
amazing and this past month he did a

364
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,920
whole series on sleep

365
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,360
which people should definitely check out

366
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,360
there's some podcasts that come out

367
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,120
that just make me want to be a better

368
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,839
human being

369
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
by just the quality uh three blue one

370
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,079
brown grant

371
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,720
sanderson is like that for me just like

372
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,679
wow

373
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,800
this is uh education is best so andrew

374
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,799
uh symbolizes that captures that

375
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,559
brilliantly so go support the sponsor so

376
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,799
he doesn't stop doing the thing

377
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,679
uh so they i think they have a cooling

378
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,319
pad too

379
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,879
so i uh uh eight sleep mattress sponsors

380
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,079
me

381
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,720
uh they've been uh they sent me a

382
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:20,879
mattress

383
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,320
and it's been i've never listened i used

384
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,399
to sleep

385
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,399
on the floor sleeping where you fall you

386
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,720
sleep for a fall i don't give a [ __ ]

387
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
it doesn't doesn't really matter but so

388
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,560
like i would have never

389
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
bought a nice mattress because it's like

390
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,559
why

391
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:39,360
i'm fine this is a floor it's fine but

392
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,199
it was a game changer to uh be able to

393
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,159
control temperature like for me it's

394
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,320
cooling

395
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,000
to cool i don't know what the hell it is

396
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,720
well you want the brain and nervous

397
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
system

398
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,000
and the rest of the body needs to drop

399
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,680
by about anywhere from two to three

400
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,919
degrees in order to get into your

401
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,120
deepest sleep and transition to sleep

402
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,039
that's really going to help you don't

403
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,720
want to be cold that you're

404
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,000
bothered and can't fall asleep but

405
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
that's why some people like it really

406
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,078
cold in the room and under a warm

407
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,079
blanket or with socks on for some people

408
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,599
that can that can be good because this

409
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,439
temperature oscillation

410
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,839
is such that as your temperature is

411
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,079
dropping that correlates with the

412
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,079
generally with the most sleepy phase of

413
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,239
your circadian cycle

414
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,000
so cool is better for falling and

415
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,159
staying asleep and sleeping deeply

416
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,679
and then i i guess like that's what ate

417
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,439
sleep showed they have like an app

418
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,239
is uh it warms back up uh to wake you up

419
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
the idea that

420
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,639
i haven't actually used it i'm like this

421
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,639
is stupid uh

422
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,919
people say it works but i just keep it

423
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,959
the same temperature throughout the

424
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,399
night

425
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,119
but uh warming it up i guess wakes you

426
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,799
up which is

427
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,720
it was just fascinating yeah because

428
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,319
you're the wake up signal

429
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
is it's interesting to think about it's

430
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,839
not just correlated with an increase in

431
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,799
body temperature the increase in body

432
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,880
temperature

433
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,479
is triggering the release of cortisol

434
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,198
from your adrenals and that's the wake

435
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,720
up signal

436
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,078
do you think it's absolute temperatures

437
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,040
we're talking about is just even

438
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:00,799
relative

439
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,919
just even just a decrease well

440
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,519
everyone's going to have slightly

441
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,838
different basal temperature the idea

442
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,120
that everybody should be 98.6 i mean

443
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,880
that's a myth

444
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,560
and there are theories that body

445
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,039
temperature overall has been dropping in

446
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,638
the last 50 years or so i i doubt that's

447
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,519
true for somebody who's athletic like

448
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,039
you and is

449
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,600
you know young and healthy but basically

450
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,399
the the coldest period of that 24-hour

451
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,639
cycle

452
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,000
is when you are going to be sleepiest

453
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,120
there's actually a period within that

454
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,639
24-hour cycle

455
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,639
it's a it's a time point called your

456
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,320
temperature minimum and your temperature

457
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,120
minimum tends to be

458
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
about two hours before your typical

459
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
wake-up time

460
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
i'm not talking about the wake-up time

461
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,440
in the middle of the night where you go

462
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,879
use the bathroom or where you set an

463
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
alarm to go catch a flight i mean

464
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,639
if you were to just allow yourself to

465
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,319
sleep without a clock for a few days

466
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,759
measure when you typically wake up two

467
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
hours before then is your temperature

468
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,159
minimum

469
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,240
and that temperature minimum turns out

470
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:56,000
to be a very important

471
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,799
landmark in your circadian cycle because

472
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,399
it turns out that if you get bright

473
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,359
light in your eyes

474
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,440
in the hours immediately before your

475
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,800
temperature minimum

476
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,079
so two to four hours or any time within

477
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,958
the two or four hour window before that

478
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,039
temperature minimum

479
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,278
you are going to what's called delay

480
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,519
your circadian clock the next day

481
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,879
that whole oscillation is going to move

482
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,679
forward it will make you want to go to

483
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,600
sleep later

484
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,439
and wake up later whereas if you get

485
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,079
bright light in your eyes in the

486
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,040
hours after that temperature minimum so

487
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:28,638
let's say for me

488
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,319
typical wake up time is 6 a.m my

489
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
temperature minimum somewhere around 4

490
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,079
a.m if i get bright light in my eyes

491
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,399
5 a.m 6 a.m 7 a.m it's going to advance

492
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,198
that oscillation so that i want to go to

493
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,120
bed earlier

494
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,958
and wake up earlier the subsequent

495
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,720
nights so you might say

496
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,239
wait but most nights i go to sleep and

497
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,040
wake up at more or less the same time

498
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,879
why is that

499
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,480
and that's because the same thing is

500
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,078
happening on both sides you are both

501
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,159
advancing your clock a little bit

502
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,758
and assuming that you're looking at

503
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,198
light in the evening you're also

504
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,720
delaying your clock a little bit so you

505
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,958
get kind of captured in between and then

506
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,360
your rhythm more or less oscillates

507
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,000
at the at the same period as we say as

508
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,759
the

509
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
spin of the earth unless you're like you

510
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,360
where you're i get text messages from

511
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,440
you sometimes at

512
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,959
odd hours and i'm i if you're on the

513
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,600
east coast then i know that you had to

514
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,198
have been

515
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,440
pulling basically and all night yeah

516
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,958
yeah that's the interesting

517
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,680
uh point about the messiness of

518
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:25,439
sleep so most people seem to up perform

519
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,000
the best when they have like a regular

520
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,040
sleep schedule

521
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,120
i perhaps am the same

522
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,360
but i don't know that and i tend to

523
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,278
believe that

524
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,959
you can also perform relatively

525
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:42,799
optimally with

526
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:47,359
chaos of sleep of uh

527
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:49,919
like a weird soup of like power naps

528
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,320
and all-nighters and all of that as long

529
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,000
as you're

530
00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:00,480
like happy doing what you love

531
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,320
and maybe you can um

532
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
tell me what you think about this i i

533
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,679
tend to for myself

534
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,720
try to minimize stress in life so

535
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,679
what i found for myself with diet

536
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,360
with sleep is that if i obsess about it

537
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,120
being perfect

538
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,479
then i'll actually stress quite a bit

539
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,759
when it's not

540
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,439
like i'll feel shitty

541
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:27,519
uh when i don't get enough sleep because

542
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,480
i know i should be getting more sleep as

543
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,798
opposed to

544
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
the actual physiological effects of not

545
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,240
getting enough sleep

546
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,038
i find if i just accept whatever the

547
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,400
hell happens

548
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,279
happens and smile and just you know take

549
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,919
it all in

550
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,558
like david goggins style like if it

551
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,600
sucks

552
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,240
it's even better or what is it jocko's

553
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,199
like good

554
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,480
or whatever he says right i think there

555
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,759
several things that you said that are

556
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,880
important but i

557
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,558
i agree that one can have a dysregulated

558
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,559
sleep schedule and still

559
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,879
be a happy person and productive in much

560
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,759
of my life i've pulled all-nighters and

561
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,799
slept weird schedules you know i think

562
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,400
many people

563
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,079
can probably relate to going to sleep

564
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,440
waking up four hours later being up for

565
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,798
an hour or two on your computer then

566
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
going back to sleep and getting amazing

567
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:15,519
sleep the next day functioning

568
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,038
i think we've i think it's important

569
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,839
that people have highlighted the

570
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,119
importance

571
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,798
of sleep and getting enough rest i do

572
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,479
think it's gone too far

573
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,000
and now i'm editorializing a little bit

574
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
but i think that

575
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,759
we've created this anxiety about sleep

576
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,200
that it's get if we don't sleep enough

577
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,240
we're gonna get dementia if we don't get

578
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,160
sleep then

579
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
uh you know the reproductive axis is

580
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,480
gonna you know completely crash

581
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,359
um you know there's a lot of evidence to

582
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,599
the contrary

583
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,839
and as well just based on personal

584
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,319
experience and based on the fact that

585
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,199
sure that it may be that a solid eight

586
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,599
hours with no

587
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,319
in uh interruptions in there or nine or

588
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,558
ten

589
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,359
could do great benefit but you can do

590
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:55,599
really well

591
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,038
if you do what you say which is you wake

592
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,879
up you don't want to start stressing

593
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,000
about it creating this meta stress about

594
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,720
sleep

595
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,759
being happy it is actually one of the

596
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,279
most powerful

597
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,879
things that you can do not allowing

598
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,599
yourself to go down that rabbit hole of

599
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,480
stress

600
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,279
for the following reason a lot of our

601
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,200
fatigue

602
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,359
is not due just to the build-up of

603
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,558
adenosine or time of day the circadian

604
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,079
thing we were talking about earlier an

605
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,519
additional factor

606
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:23,199
is that effort is in related to the

607
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,200
release of epinephrine of adrenaline in

608
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,720
our brain and body

609
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,240
at some point those levels get so high

610
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,679
that we get stressed mentally

611
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,599
we get stressed physically and we want

612
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,160
to give up there are good data published

613
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,079
in cell

614
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,160
showing that that signal the epinephrine

615
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,119
signal is eventually accumulates and

616
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,558
there's a quit

617
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:47,038
point dopamine the molecule of pursuit

618
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:49,839
and reward and feeling good

619
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,200
resets our ability to be an effort in

620
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,399
fact

621
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,798
a lot of people don't know this but

622
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,880
dopamine is actually what

623
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,798
epinephrine is made from if you look at

624
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,840
the biochemical cascade it starts with

625
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,279
tyrosine which is rich in found in red

626
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,038
meats and things of that sort

627
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,359
and tyrosine is eventually converted

628
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,158
through things like altopa into dopamine

629
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:12,319
dopamine is made into epinephrine so i

630
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,480
mean this sounds kind of new ag but

631
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,000
happiness joy and pleasure in what

632
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,200
you're doing

633
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,200
creates a chemical milieu that

634
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,640
provides more of the chemicals that

635
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,080
allow for effort

636
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,000
and there's nothing new ag about that

637
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,439
it's in every biochemistry textbook

638
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,798
it's in every decent neuroscience

639
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,000
textbook they just don't talk about the

640
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,200
happiness part they just talk about the

641
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,440
dopamine part

642
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,798
so i think that limiting your stress and

643
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,240
at least recognizing

644
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,519
okay if you're pulling an all-nighter or

645
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,599
you're somehow on messed up sleep

646
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,480
that there is going to be a point in

647
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,798
that 24-hour cycle where your brain is

648
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,279
not

649
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,558
trustworthy where your mental state is

650
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,200
not

651
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,200
worth placing too much weight on because

652
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,960
you are near that temperature minimum

653
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
and near that temperature minimum which

654
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,640
is correlates that two hour

655
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,240
about two hours before you would

656
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,679
normally wake up

657
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,919
the brain is is hobbling along

658
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,798
and anything you feel or think at that

659
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,520
time

660
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,558
should not be given too much value but

661
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,079
if you can trick

662
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,000
yourself into thinking that's the

663
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,119
pleasure point you afford yourself a

664
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,480
huge advantage

665
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,239
there's a study done by a colleague of

666
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,960
mine at stanford that showed

667
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,720
that positive anticipation about the

668
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,319
next day events

669
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,759
actually is a powerful metric

670
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,519
for creating quality sleep even if the

671
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,679
sleep is very reduced

672
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,720
and and you'll love this one and i i a

673
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,080
lot of people are gonna

674
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,360
you know might be critical of this so i

675
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,000
just want to make sure that so this was

676
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,279
work done

677
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,319
out of harvard medical it was um

678
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,839
bob stickgold's lab and emily hoagland

679
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,759
did this study that showed

680
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,678
looking at ochem performance on ochem

681
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,440
scores okay so organic chemistry

682
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,480
harvard's pretty tough subject highly

683
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,558
motivated

684
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,839
a number of very good control groups in

685
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,079
this study

686
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:59,918
what she showed was that consistency of

687
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,480
total sleep duration

688
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,200
was far more important for performance

689
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,640
on these

690
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,640
exams than total sleep duration itself

691
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,159
so it's not that just getting more sleep

692
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,320
allows you to perform better

693
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,600
consistently getting about the same

694
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,759
amount of sleep

695
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,359
is more is better for performance at

696
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,919
least in on okim

697
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,119
yeah than just getting more that's

698
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,600
interesting so that's

699
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,359
referring to more that there should be a

700
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,480
consistent habit

701
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:31,119
versus the total amount to me like the

702
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,640
entirety of the picture of sleep

703
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:38,239
is uh it's similar to nutrition in that

704
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,080
it feels like it's

705
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,319
there's so many variables involved and

706
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,639
it's so person specific

707
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,839
so you know a lot of studies i mean this

708
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,960
is the way of science

709
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,439
has to look and aggregate the effects on

710
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,240
sleep

711
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,720
it doesn't focus on high performers and

712
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,319
which are

713
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,519
individuals ultimately like the question

714
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,038
isn't

715
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,960
uh so it's a very important question

716
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,158
it's like what kind of diet

717
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,400
fights obesity reduces obesity

718
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,240
it's another question what kind of diet

719
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,600
allows david goggins to be the best

720
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,038
version of himself so

721
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:13,119
these high performers in different

722
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,000
avenues and the same thing with sleep

723
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:18,479
like people that tell me that i should

724
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
get eight hours of sleep

725
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,558
it's like it's i i

726
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
mean i i get it and they may be right

727
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,839
but they may be very wrong

728
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,359
and there's no evidence that eight is

729
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,480
better than six

730
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,359
that you could very well do better on

731
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,798
six than on eight

732
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,199
there are a few other things that um

733
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,679
turn out to be strong parameters for

734
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,240
success in this domain for instance

735
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,159
your entire life waking or asleep is

736
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,159
broken up into these 90-minute altradian

737
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,559
cycles if you look at ability to attend

738
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,840
or do math problems or do anything

739
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:54,000
drive drive performance tends to

740
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,199
ramp up slowly within a 90-minute cycle

741
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,720
peak and then come down

742
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,880
at the end of that 90-minute cycle and

743
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,278
in sleep we go through these

744
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,720
stage one two three four rem etc we'll

745
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,278
talk more about that if you like those

746
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,360
on 90-minute ultradian cycles as well

747
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,159
ending your sleep after a 90-minute

748
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,719
cycle at the

749
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,400
at the near the end of a 90-minute cycle

750
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,120
say at the end of six hours

751
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,038
in many cases is better for you than

752
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,158
sleeping an additional hour seven hours

753
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,278
and waking up in the middle of an

754
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,400
altradian cycle

755
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,400
and there are a few apps that can

756
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,840
measure this based on body movements and

757
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,080
things like that that

758
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,759
have you your alarm go off at the end of

759
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,359
an ultraviolet cycle

760
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,519
and if you wake up in the middle of an

761
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,000
altradian cycle sometimes not always you

762
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,319
can be very

763
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,159
groggy for a long period of time i

764
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,439
certainly do better on six hours than i

765
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,600
do on seven

766
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,880
i happen to like an eight hour sleep it

767
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,879
feels great but i

768
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,000
haven't slept an entire eight hours

769
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,120
without waking up in the middle of the

770
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,960
night at some point

771
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,239
in i don't know forever i can't remember

772
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,720
it's probably some point in

773
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,240
infancy but and i function well during

774
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,558
the day i think that

775
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,240
that's a big that's an important

776
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:58,798
parameter is how do you feel during the

777
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,558
day

778
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,879
almost everybody experiences some sort

779
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:03,918
of dip in energy in the late afternoon

780
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,200
or what would correlate to their

781
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,520
temperature peak

782
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,558
and that's a good time of day to get

783
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,359
either a 90

784
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,319
90 minute or less nap or if you're not a

785
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,839
napper

786
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:18,879
or you can't nap feet elevated

787
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:20,798
has been shown to be good for clear out

788
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,320
of some of this

789
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,679
the glymphatic system is this kind of

790
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,639
like sewer system of the brain you can

791
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,759
clear stuff out

792
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,278
so legs elevated or one thing that i've

793
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,720
um i'm a big proponent of and that my

794
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:34,079
lab has been studying is what i

795
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,558
i now call nsdr non-sleep deep breast

796
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,839
and this is just lying down there are

797
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:38,798
some scripts that we're going to put out

798
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,798
there soon as

799
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,240
a free resource there's some hypnosis

800
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:43,918
scripts that my colleague david spiegel

801
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,159
has put out there as a free resource

802
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,640
but non-sleep deep rest is allowing your

803
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,720
system to drop into states of

804
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,400
of real calm that allow you to get

805
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,839
better at falling asleep later

806
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,440
and they can be very restorative for

807
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,439
cognitive and motor function

808
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,440
there's at least one study out of

809
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,919
denmark that shows that

810
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,120
the basal ganglia which is an area of

811
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,159
the brain that's involved in motor

812
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,239
planning and action

813
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,278
one of these 20-minute non-sleep deep

814
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,278
breast protocols

815
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,359
resets levels of neuromodulators like

816
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,359
dopamine in the basal ganglia to

817
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,199
the same levels that they were right

818
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:18,639
after a long night's sleep

819
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,480
so i also respectfully

820
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,400
uh or semi-respectfully disagree with

821
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,960
the idea that you can't recover lost

822
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
sleep

823
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,159
what does that mean i mean that there's

824
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,559
no irs for sleep

825
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,278
so what does it mean to be in debt for

826
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:30,639
sleep

827
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,400
if you're falling asleep during the day

828
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,520
and you're sleepy like you're falling

829
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,679
asleep that's

830
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,960
a good sign of insomnia means you're not

831
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,720
sleeping enough at night

832
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,640
if you're fatigued during the day but

833
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,839
you're not falling asleep so you're just

834
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,520
exhausted but you're not finding

835
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,038
yourself falling asleep in meetings and

836
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,440
in conversation

837
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,798
then chances are you're fatiguing your

838
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,679
system through something else

839
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,079
like a long run in the middle of the

840
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,440
night

841
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,439
boston or whatever it is that you're up

842
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:59,679
to lately at uh 3 a.m

843
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,519
yes there is a magic to the nap and

844
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,880
maybe you could speak to the because you

845
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,599
mentioned these protocols

846
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,720
that don't necessarily so they're

847
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,158
non-sleep

848
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,000
but to me the nap

849
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:16,400
one or two a day can

850
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
almost irrespective of how much sleep i

851
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,880
get the night before

852
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,440
i have a fundamental change in my mood

853
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,120
and my

854
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,960
performance for the better for the

855
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,719
better for the better yeah likewise

856
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,679
so uh i do tend to kind of experiment

857
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,519
with durations

858
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:36,559
it's it's consistently surprising to me

859
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,759
how like a nap of like 10 minutes i

860
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,599
don't know maybe you can speak to the

861
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:43,038
perfect duration of a nap

862
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:46,719
but i find that it's like magic

863
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:49,440
that a short nap does as much good

864
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,960
and often better than a longer one for

865
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,840
me for me subjective what would be a

866
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,399
longer one

867
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,079
longer than 90 minutes no no like 90

868
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,079
minutes or but longer than 90

869
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,079
like two hours yeah that's dropping you

870
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,839
starting to drop you into rem sleep and

871
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,199
even if it's a tiny amount of rem sleep

872
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,480
people can come out of those naps kind

873
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,399
of disoriented

874
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,720
i mean remember in sleep space and time

875
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:11,759
are are totally uncoupled and so

876
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,200
they that's an odd state to re-enter the

877
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,319
world in if you're not going to stay

878
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,120
there for a while like for a good

879
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,839
night's sleep

880
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,798
i think a 20-minute nap is pretty

881
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,240
fantastic

882
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:21,918
would you say that's the op if you were

883
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,720
to recommend to the general and

884
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,320
it's very weird to recommend anything to

885
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,278
the general populace because

886
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,519
obviously it's very person specific but

887
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,798
what's a good one we say to friends is

888
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,879
20 minutes ago

889
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,079
30 minutes 20 or 30 minutes because

890
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,278
you're going unless you're sleep

891
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:39,918
deprived

892
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,519
you're going to stay out of rem sleep

893
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,120
rapid eye movement sleep if you're sleep

894
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,319
deprived you'll drop right into it if

895
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,000
you've ever traveled and you're really

896
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:47,278
jet lagged you go to the hotel you lay

897
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,720
down for one second all of a sudden

898
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,159
you're just like

899
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,519
you're you're in a psychedelic dream um

900
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,320
which can be pretty great too but i

901
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,759
think that

902
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,480
uh 20 30 minutes and if you can't sleep

903
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,119
some people have

904
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,960
trouble napping then learning to relax

905
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,519
the body as much as possible like trying

906
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,000
to remove

907
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,918
all expression from your face completely

908
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,240
letting your body kind of float

909
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,200
if people have a hard time relaxing when

910
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,679
they're awake

911
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,399
there's some terrific clinically and

912
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,320
research tested hypnosis protocols

913
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,239
that we could provide links to that are

914
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:24,480
cost-free and that teach you how to just

915
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,880
completely

916
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,519
release the alertness button and you

917
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,440
just start drifting now the problem is

918
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,558
if you don't have an alarm or something

919
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,960
to go off you

920
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,000
the other day i did one and i'm almost

921
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,038
embarrassed to say this but there's a

922
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,480
component of it where you actually are

923
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:39,519
supposed to let your hand float up

924
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,679
because it's a

925
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,119
hypnosis script so they it's my

926
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,840
colleague david spiegel in the script he

927
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,558
says

928
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,558
um let your hand float up i woke up an

929
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,639
hour later my hand was still floating

930
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,079
wow yeah and i was and i was completely

931
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,200
relaxed

932
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,119
so hypnosis is hypnosis is just a matter

933
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,159
of going deep relaxation narrowing of

934
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,678
context

935
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,200
and it's all self-imposed a lot of

936
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,038
people think that hypnosis is like the

937
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,600
stage thing with the pendant and the

938
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:05,679
chicken

939
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,439
you know people [ __ ] like chickens

940
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,919
but real hypnosis

941
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,558
is self-hypnosis you're learning to it

942
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,880
involves

943
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,960
some shifts in the way that you the the

944
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,799
hypnotic induction involves looking up

945
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,038
closing your eyes slowly deep breath and

946
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:22,319
then imagine yourself floating

947
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,879
and people vary on a scale of about one

948
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:25,519
to four

949
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,720
for being the most easily hypnotized

950
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,879
there are a few people who it's very

951
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,038
hard for them to allow themselves to to

952
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,240
go into these states but for most people

953
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:36,240
they just they're gone and it's nice if

954
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,839
if you can have access to those states

955
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,079
because when you come out of it

956
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,359
you feel amazing you feel like you slept

957
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,759
the whole night at least

958
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,439
most people report that so refresh alert

959
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,599
ready to go i mean basically

960
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,519
you're ready yeah i know you have this

961
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,879
um interesting challenge coming up and

962
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,240
i'm curious what you're gonna do to

963
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,880
reset in the hours

964
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,480
it that the frequency of running is um

965
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,919
every four hours it's not going to allow

966
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,519
you to get any more than

967
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,960
a couple hours sleep in between flowers

968
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,919
so we should we should tell to people

969
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,759
i'd be curious

970
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,960
to get your thoughts and advice on it

971
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:09,038
i'm uh

972
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,240
on march 5th running 48 miles with mr

973
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,119
david goggins

974
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,640
so four miles every four hours and

975
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,518
people should join us

976
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,278
he's uh that madman is going to be live

977
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,359
on instagram

978
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:25,278
starting at 8 p.m pacific on march 5th

979
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,119
so you're gonna join him in person in

980
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,519
person undisclosed location

981
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,278
undisclosed location and i was i was

982
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,038
trying to clarify like okay so we're

983
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,278
gonna

984
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,200
like there'll be like friendly people

985
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:38,960
around or something no it's just me and

986
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,000
him friendly people i don't know

987
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,480
like i just feel it's very difficult to

988
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
be

989
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,360
with david alone in the room i imagine

990
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,278
his i mean i've done some work with

991
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,879
david his energy is infectious

992
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:55,119
yeah that's an intense schedule um

993
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,080
and the the periodicity of that those

994
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,158
four hour

995
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,599
every four hours four miles means that

996
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,720
there's no chance of catching an

997
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,038
extended

998
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,079
block of sleep so it's about three hours

999
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,679
that you have

1000
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,918
non-exercising every time and of course

1001
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,759
it takes time to try to fall asleep and

1002
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,519
there's an intensity to the whole thing

1003
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:17,038
i mean it's probably impossible to get

1004
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,278
anything more

1005
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:21,919
than uh two hours of sleep if you wanted

1006
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,079
to so the optimal thing is probably

1007
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,120
from the sound of it i'd be curious to

1008
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,158
see what you think

1009
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,879
but like it's getting a few 90 90-minute

1010
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,360
naps okay well i thought about this a

1011
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,840
bit

1012
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,678
before we met up today so i think there

1013
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:38,558
are two general approaches

1014
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,320
that could work neither one necessarily

1015
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:44,000
better than the other

1016
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,720
one would be just to hammer through the

1017
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,720
whole thing

1018
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,240
just to get your level of alertness and

1019
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,480
adrenaline

1020
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,319
ramped up so that you don't expect

1021
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,839
yourself to sleep

1022
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,439
there are certain advantages there one

1023
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,079
is a subjective kind of emotional

1024
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,600
advantage

1025
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,359
which is if you can't sleep you're not

1026
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,678
gonna be stressed about that yes

1027
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,199
and if you do fall asleep it's a bonus

1028
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,559
provided you wake up and you don't look

1029
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,360
up and you realize david's been out

1030
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,440
running for

1031
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,959
half an hour and you're behind right but

1032
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,759
chances are that's not the way it'll go

1033
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,079
you set an alarm so that's one approach

1034
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,038
yeah and and i grabbed that from you

1035
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:17,199
know a

1036
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,640
couple friends who were um who are in

1037
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,759
the seal teams and they'll say that you

1038
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,278
know during buds there's this

1039
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:23,519
infamous hell week and there's this five

1040
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,079
hour five days excuse me definitely five

1041
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,519
days

1042
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,599
of no sleep although there is a

1043
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,120
component where they offer a nap at one

1044
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,158
particular point

1045
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,000
and a lot of people will say that it's

1046
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,399
worse to go down for that nap

1047
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and then be woken up 20 minutes later

1048
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,079
than to just stay up

1049
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,558
so so that's one option let's call it

1050
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:44,798
the um full blitz hammer through

1051
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,798
option and if you happen to fall asleep

1052
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,759
you do bonus yeah the bonus

1053
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,679
the other one would be to really anchor

1054
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:52,798
in these ultradian cycles so coming back

1055
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,798
from a run

1056
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,079
you pr unless you're thoroughly

1057
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,440
exhausted you're probably going to have

1058
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:58,798
a few minutes where you're

1059
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,240
going to want to stay awake it's going

1060
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:01,200
to be hard to just immediately fall

1061
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,079
asleep

1062
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,278
and getting as much sleep as you can in

1063
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,519
the intervening

1064
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:09,358
periods provided that you guys aren't

1065
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,000
posting constantly or doing something

1066
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:10,960
else you also

1067
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,320
there's a question whether or not you

1068
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,398
want to nourish whether or not you want

1069
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,320
to eat or not in that time

1070
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:17,759
anytime we put food in our gut i don't

1071
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,879
care if it's meat

1072
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,200
or oatmeal or

1073
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,319
broccoli or cardboard you're drawing

1074
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,638
blood into the gut

1075
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,480
and so you are going to divert some

1076
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,838
energy towards digestion and it's going

1077
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,599
to make you sleepy there's a reason why

1078
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:33,519
the rest and digest the parasympathetic

1079
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,079
nervous system is called that

1080
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,679
so you could decide that you were only

1081
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,000
going to sleep in certain

1082
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,440
in between certain blocks that would be

1083
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,719
another way to think about that

1084
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,838
that because i did this last year

1085
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,519
uh i ran very slow some of it was

1086
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,838
walking i was listening audiobooks and

1087
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,719
one of the biggest mistakes i did is to

1088
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:57,039
overeat during that time right it was uh

1089
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,719
made the experience very unpleasant so i

1090
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,079
have been considering basically eating

1091
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,559
almost nothing

1092
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,000
throughout the day being fasted will

1093
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,358
increase alertness because

1094
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,599
high levels of epinephrine in your

1095
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,358
system from fasting you just think about

1096
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,960
fasting or being thirsty

1097
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,000
before you get exhausted people always

1098
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,720
think if i don't eat i'm going to be

1099
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,358
tired

1100
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,639
no the the energy that you derive from

1101
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,039
food is going to be

1102
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,799
uh used from glycogen and after a long

1103
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,320
storage and conversion process so

1104
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,560
the food that you eat is going to

1105
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,240
consume energy to digest

1106
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,838
and so a lot of people feel better

1107
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,439
fasted and

1108
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:30,960
presumably throughout history people

1109
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,200
have fasted for long periods of time and

1110
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,199
had to stay up for two or three days and

1111
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,399
you know god forbid if a family member

1112
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,039
is sick you can stay awake in the

1113
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,960
hospital

1114
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,679
without any trouble so that alertness

1115
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,119
system and you know it's all mental

1116
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:46,879
um actually and then there's a third

1117
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,320
so you could try and sleep or or take

1118
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,079
care in between yes

1119
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,039
yeah and then there's a third approach

1120
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,480
oh yeah but i didn't come up with it

1121
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:58,480
but david did so i actually texted him

1122
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,599
earlier because i had a feeling that i

1123
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,880
heard that you were going to do this

1124
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,280
challenge

1125
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,280
so i asked david um

1126
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,519
so these are david goggins words not

1127
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:13,279
mine okay

1128
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,920
one okay being organized is super

1129
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,720
important

1130
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,680
two you want to waste as little time as

1131
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:21,199
possible

1132
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:23,279
three you need to eat sleep and rehab

1133
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,439
in as little time as possible so you can

1134
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,560
sleep as much as possible oh interesting

1135
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,119
by the way this is the first time i'm

1136
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,559
reading this

1137
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,800
yeah um four meal prep

1138
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:33,679
and gear prep etc are very important

1139
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,119
that's um

1140
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,199
that's consistent with everything i know

1141
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,720
about military they they don't

1142
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,799
they don't leave too much to chance five

1143
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,799
again these are david's words all that

1144
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,640
said he's [ __ ] on most all that

1145
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,440
because he'll be interviewing me before

1146
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:53,199
or after i will also be interviewing him

1147
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,000
oh [ __ ] five long story short the only

1148
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,000
thing that might help

1149
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,358
is a very special pill this is

1150
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,639
interesting

1151
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,639
they're called s-i-u pills hard to get

1152
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:05,920
but i believe he can get them s-i-u

1153
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:08,159
stands for suck it up

1154
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,039
tell him to grab his balls he'll find

1155
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,039
those pills there

1156
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,599
that's number six all right and then the

1157
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:18,639
last one yeah stay hard brother

1158
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,920
stay hard brother amen i

1159
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,000
you know that was one of the other

1160
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,320
things that i think makes

1161
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,920
this challenging is that it'll be doing

1162
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,599
a podcast throughout

1163
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,400
so first of all i'll do a long one

1164
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,720
before and after but also

1165
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,240
i'll have to come up with things to talk

1166
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:36,799
to him about

1167
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,479
so like it's a different thing to do

1168
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,519
something

1169
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,159
privately and then publicly i know it

1170
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,599
doesn't

1171
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,559
seem that way but like one of the

1172
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,280
hardest

1173
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,000
the hardest thing i had to do last time

1174
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,320
was to turn

1175
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,199
on the camera and talk to the camera

1176
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,160
because i

1177
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,759
uh last time i did it i recorded um

1178
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:00,000
every single time i did a leg

1179
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,079
i recorded something i'm grateful for

1180
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,800
it's just kind of unrelated i'm not a

1181
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,119
fan of like

1182
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,560
talking about like how i'm feeling or

1183
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,640
how they're on is going

1184
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,239
i want to do something totally unrelated

1185
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,078
to the run

1186
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:14,159
and with the run as the background you

1187
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,920
know sort of something i'm grateful for

1188
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,679
just any kind of uh interesting

1189
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,639
discussion gratitude

1190
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,879
i mean i hate the word hack like oh it's

1191
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,559
a dopamine hack or it's a serotonin i i

1192
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,240
don't like the word hack because

1193
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,679
it's disrespectful to hackers who do a

1194
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:31,118
real thing and

1195
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:32,078
b a hack implies that it's some sort of

1196
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,880
trick that you're

1197
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,599
you're you're kind of gaming the system

1198
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,559
you know what

1199
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,760
what works is mechanism right biological

1200
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,838
mechanisms

1201
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,040
were designed to work and they were

1202
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,078
selected for

1203
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:47,519
to work under variable conditions and as

1204
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,200
you know and i know and

1205
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:50,800
we have great appreciation for the fact

1206
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,239
that the nervous system was designed to

1207
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,320
be an adaptive machine

1208
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:55,679
so that you don't have to sleep eight

1209
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,119
hours every night

1210
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:01,759
you can do this thing and things like

1211
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,358
gratitude allow you to tap into chemical

1212
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,599
resources

1213
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,358
and that's not a hack the fact that

1214
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,640
being grateful for something external to

1215
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,960
the event

1216
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,960
happens to release serotonin and have a

1217
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,039
certain soothing effect or

1218
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,720
dopamine and give you more epinephrine

1219
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,559
and let you go further

1220
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,799
that's not a hack that's actually what

1221
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:23,039
allowed the human machine

1222
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,160
to evolve to the point that it is now

1223
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,639
every time

1224
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,159
you know an inventor eventually created

1225
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,920
something that worked and felt great

1226
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,159
about it you can imagine that the

1227
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,200
the first you know air flight felt

1228
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,960
pretty awesome

1229
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,358
and motivated those people to go on and

1230
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,119
do more they they didn't just go uh you

1231
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:43,039
know yawn and go have a beer

1232
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,920
so being able to access the genuine in

1233
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,800
internal states of gratitude and reward

1234
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,880
works

1235
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,320
you can't trick the system you can't

1236
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,920
pretend that you're grateful for

1237
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,079
something but if you can identify or

1238
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,838
attach yourself to some larger

1239
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,320
goal or something that's deeply

1240
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:59,119
gratifying to you or place it in service

1241
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,200
to

1242
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,039
a relative that passed away that you

1243
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:06,078
care a lot about

1244
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,599
that's not a hack that's accessing the

1245
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,000
deepest components of your nervous

1246
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,680
system and um to steal your kind of

1247
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,199
lingo you know there's real beauty there

1248
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:17,039
right yeah but for an introvert like

1249
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:18,799
myself and i think david i don't know if

1250
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,400
he's an introvert but like

1251
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,440
he's not despite the fact that he has

1252
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,519
written a great book

1253
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,880
and he communicates he puts himself out

1254
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,759
there he's not really

1255
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,838
a fan of communication he's not i don't

1256
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,319
know if he's energized by

1257
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,199
speaking his mind i don't know well

1258
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:36,639
enough to know i mean

1259
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,239
we've done a little bit of work together

1260
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,759
and um you know we're in communication

1261
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,639
now and again he's obviously super

1262
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,119
impressive

1263
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,719
um i don't know it seems that he's a pr

1264
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,599
seems like he's a pretty private guy

1265
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,719
yeah you know so i don't have access to

1266
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,400
that so for me

1267
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,759
i'll just speak to myself and i think

1268
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,559
david is the same but i'll speak to

1269
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,319
myself that

1270
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:58,318
it was a hugely draining thing not

1271
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,318
to experience the gratitude experiencing

1272
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:03,679
the gratitude just like you're saying

1273
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:05,039
is really energizing and it's it's a

1274
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:08,239
powerful thing it's a

1275
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:11,279
it's a it can lift up your mood

1276
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:14,078
but to turn on the camera and have to

1277
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,720
use words which is very difficult to do

1278
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,880
to explain

1279
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,559
like what you're feeling and do it in

1280
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,760
the way that you know a bunch of people

1281
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,318
will be watching

1282
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,240
is really draining and one of the things

1283
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:30,000
i'm concerned about

1284
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:33,519
that in this whole process how do i

1285
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,960
keep my mind sharp while also

1286
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,440
keeping the performance the physical

1287
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,800
performance shop and that's a little bit

1288
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,200
scary because

1289
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,440
talking to david like actual

1290
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:46,559
intellectually sharp like

1291
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,679
thinking being charismatic and as much

1292
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:50,159
as i can be

1293
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,118
and like being still maintaining a sense

1294
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:53,199
of humor too

1295
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,160
because i can be i i become with sleep

1296
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,799
deprivation

1297
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:59,118
with exhaustion you start being the

1298
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,440
russian bear comes out you start being

1299
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,960
such a d like you i become a david

1300
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,559
goggins essentially like

1301
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,720
oh it makes you irritable sleep

1302
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,719
deprivation makes us irritable

1303
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,480
yeah there's it's clear so that in the

1304
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,480
early part of the night we get a higher

1305
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,119
percentage of those old trading cycles

1306
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,519
are

1307
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,200
occupied by slow wave sleep sometimes

1308
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:21,119
just called non-rem sleep

1309
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:23,838
and those early night sleep bouts

1310
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,358
are great for muscular repair and for

1311
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,358
certain forms of learning

1312
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,279
but rem sleep the rapid eye movement

1313
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,199
sleep which it starts to accumulate

1314
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,319
and occupy more of those 90-minute

1315
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,960
ultradian cycles

1316
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:35,519
toward the late part of a sleep bout so

1317
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,079
toward

1318
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,239
typically toward morning but toward

1319
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,680
after you've been asleep a while

1320
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,399
that's when you do the emotional

1321
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:46,799
processing that's when

1322
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,039
we recover the ability to feel refreshed

1323
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,720
and not irritated by things and

1324
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,800
if you deprive people of rem sleep they

1325
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:56,559
become selectively

1326
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,920
uh bad at uncoupling the emotion from

1327
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,599
things that happened in the previous

1328
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,480
days so the little things start to seem

1329
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,240
like big things

1330
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,599
i always know i'm rem sleep deprived

1331
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,719
when um

1332
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,200
i'm irritable and when um i look at like

1333
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,318
the word

1334
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,679
the and it doesn't look like it's

1335
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:11,279
spelled right and i'm kind of pissed off

1336
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:14,480
about it like something's off and

1337
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,720
we actually are becoming slightly um

1338
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,838
psychotic when we're rem sleep deprived

1339
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,439
you're not going to get a lot of rem

1340
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:20,880
sleep in this thing except as you

1341
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,159
fatigue more if you do fall asleep

1342
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
you're going to drop more and more into

1343
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:24,719
rem so that

1344
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,640
those 90-minute cycles you won't have to

1345
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,759
go through stage one stage two stage

1346
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,239
three and then rem

1347
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,520
you're just gonna drop right into ram so

1348
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:33,598
you can count on your system to

1349
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,000
compensate for you

1350
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,760
but i think that just the knowledge that

1351
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,318
you tend to get irritable as the time

1352
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,240
goes on

1353
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:42,000
just that third personing of yourself

1354
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,919
that awareness the observer

1355
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,079
that can be very beneficial because

1356
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,920
there may be bouts during this event

1357
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,079
when you just should probably say

1358
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,440
nothing and maybe you just

1359
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,240
um i don't know smile and record or not

1360
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,318
smile or do

1361
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,239
do whatever it is because you're gonna

1362
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:58,719
be conserving energy if it feels like a

1363
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,358
grind

1364
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,959
that's epinephrine being released that's

1365
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:03,519
epinephrine that you could devote to the

1366
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,240
physical

1367
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,519
effort but humor is an amazing anecdote

1368
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,919
for this because

1369
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,719
it resets that it's that dopamine

1370
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,200
release

1371
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:15,279
that gives us that fresh perspective and

1372
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,679
it's a it's a real chemical thing

1373
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,560
it's not a it's not a hack it's not a

1374
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,519
it's not a trick

1375
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,559
it's not a visualization it's biology in

1376
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:26,000
action

1377
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:29,119
well but i think the act

1378
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,920
of uh interviewing of conversation in

1379
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,318
these processes

1380
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,358
even if you don't want to do it the

1381
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:36,719
right thing to do

1382
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:39,598
even when you're feeling irritable is to

1383
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:41,439
to do the third person view and be able

1384
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,800
to express with words that you're

1385
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,559
feeling irritable

1386
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,920
like express what you're going through

1387
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,440
ex you know

1388
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,000
use words which i hate doing i honestly

1389
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,679
i think my

1390
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,599
ultimate thing would be just to never

1391
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,118
say a single word to david gagas and

1392
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,440
just go through hell

1393
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,160
it doesn't matter what we do but to do

1394
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,240
it quietly to also express it

1395
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,199
that's my ultimate hell and he's

1396
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,039
definitely gonna be

1397
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,879
if i know david at all he's he's going

1398
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,519
to try and find your buttons like he's

1399
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,920
gonna

1400
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:10,960
he i mean he even though he knows he can

1401
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,800
complete this

1402
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,000
and i i believe that he trusts that you

1403
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,839
can complete too i

1404
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,119
i believe you can you will complete it

1405
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,000
you know you will complete it right

1406
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,838
there's no question about

1407
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,199
that but he's not gonna make it easier

1408
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,679
for you he's gonna make it harder

1409
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:25,919
well i'm afraid so i'm like you know

1410
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,399
it's very difficult for me so 48 miles

1411
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,159
is not

1412
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,160
easy i have not been trading that much

1413
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:34,000
so i'm not ramping up

1414
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:35,838
but it's not like going to kill me

1415
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,519
we'll see what happens of course for him

1416
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,599
he might almost get bored because i

1417
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:42,960
think the 48 miles for him

1418
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:45,599
is easy i think i don't know

1419
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,318
that i don't know that ever gets easy i

1420
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,559
have a friend

1421
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,519
casey corgill who works with david he's

1422
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,358
a does some

1423
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:53,920
um physical uh rehab type stuff with him

1424
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:56,400
and he

1425
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,400
took casey on a 50 miler and he said

1426
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,039
it's like 16 miles into it he was just

1427
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,920
like

1428
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,639
he had hit his wall yeah but they he

1429
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,039
found it they

1430
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,000
they find it to get you know you find

1431
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:07,358
that portal

1432
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,920
there is one thing i want to mention

1433
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,519
there's some very good physiology

1434
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,519
that can perhaps support the actual

1435
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,400
running effort part these are very new

1436
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:16,880
data

1437
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,240
and we have a study going on with david

1438
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,680
spiegel at stanford looking at how

1439
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:21,838
different patterns of breathing

1440
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,199
can affect heart rate variability heart

1441
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,199
rate variability is good

1442
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:26,239
there's this interesting mechanism i

1443
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,919
think most people might

1444
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,679
not realize but that medical students

1445
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,000
learned that your breathing and your

1446
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,759
heart rate and your brain are in this

1447
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,239
really remarkable interplay it goes like

1448
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,160
this

1449
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,279
when you inhale this isn't breath work

1450
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:40,159
we're not going to do breath work

1451
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,160
but when you inhale the diaphragm moves

1452
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:43,358
down

1453
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:44,480
the heart gets a little bigger because

1454
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:45,598
there's a little more space in the

1455
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,079
thoracic cavity

1456
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,440
and as a consequence blood flows a

1457
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,640
little bit more slowly through that

1458
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,400
larger volume

1459
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:53,679
there's a category of neurons the

1460
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,720
sinoatrial node

1461
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,519
that sees that that recognizes that that

1462
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:59,838
slower

1463
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:01,199
rate through that larger volume sends a

1464
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:02,799
signal to the brain stem and the brain

1465
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,159
stem sends a signal back to the heart to

1466
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,599
speed the heart up

1467
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:07,199
so every time you inhale you're speeding

1468
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,720
the heart up when you exhale

1469
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,480
the diaphragm moves up the heart gets a

1470
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:11,759
little smaller the volume is smaller

1471
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,920
blood flows more quickly through the

1472
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,280
heart a signal sent up to the brain and

1473
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,639
the brain sends a signal back

1474
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,480
to slow the heart down this is the basis

1475
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,078
of heart rate variability

1476
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,000
so at any point if you feel like your

1477
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,359
heart is racing and you feel like you're

1478
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,400
working too hard per unit of effort

1479
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:32,480
focus on making your exhales longer or

1480
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,160
more intense than your inhales

1481
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,079
if ever you feel like you're truly

1482
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,838
flagging you do not have the energy to

1483
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,359
get up it's like okay it's time to go

1484
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:42,000
and you're exhausted

1485
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:44,239
you want to draw more oxygen into the

1486
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,599
system get your heart rate going faster

1487
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:46,719
now some people when they hear this

1488
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,079
probably thinking well this is really

1489
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:49,759
obvious but there's so much out there

1490
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,880
about breath work and how to breathe and

1491
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,520
all this stuff but no one talks about

1492
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,760
how to do it in

1493
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:56,000
real time while you're exerting effort

1494
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,880
so this is something like almost like

1495
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,440
second by second you can adjust things

1496
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,599
to just

1497
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,440
in real time based on how you're feeling

1498
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,880
but based on the heart rate that's right

1499
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,880
the experience of the heart rate

1500
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,559
that's right so one thing that could

1501
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,079
could be very efficient and we're doing

1502
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,480
some work with athletes now

1503
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,318
these are unpublished data but if you

1504
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,639
while you're running

1505
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:18,239
if you want to get into a nice cadence

1506
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:21,838
of heart rate variability

1507
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:21,838
do double inhales

1508
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,440
while you're running what this will do

1509
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:26,078
is when you do the double inhale has the

1510
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,800
effect of

1511
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,240
of reopening the avioli of the lungs

1512
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,200
your lungs are filled with tons of

1513
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:33,039
little sacs

1514
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,480
when you they tend to collapse as you

1515
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,920
fatigue when you

1516
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,960
and carbon dioxide builds up in the

1517
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,240
bloodstream and that's when we start

1518
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,760
getting stress if you've ever been

1519
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:41,358
sprinting you start getting beat and

1520
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,800
you're going as hard as you can what

1521
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:44,639
what you really need to do is double

1522
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,240
inhale and reinflate these sacs in the

1523
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:46,960
lungs and then offload a lot of carbon

1524
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:48,558
dioxide

1525
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,480
so when you're at a steady cadence and

1526
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,040
you're feeling good double inhale

1527
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,920
exhale double inhale exhale is a

1528
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:56,159
terrific

1529
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,358
way to breathe while you're in ongoing

1530
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,558
effort by the way

1531
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:03,838
any recommendations or differences in

1532
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,880
nose or mouth breathing so nasal

1533
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:06,239
breathing there's

1534
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,519
a lot of excitement now obviously about

1535
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:08,799
nasal breathing because of james

1536
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:11,039
nestor's book breath

1537
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,960
um there was also if people are gonna

1538
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,679
know about that book that i do feel like

1539
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,800
out of respect for my colleagues there

1540
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,199
was a book by

1541
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,800
sandra um khan and paul ehrlich at

1542
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:21,439
stanford both professors at stanford

1543
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,760
with a

1544
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,720
forward by um jared diamond and robert

1545
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,400
zapalski so

1546
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:27,838
some heavy hitters in this book and the

1547
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,680
book is called jaws

1548
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:32,078
a hidden epidemic and it's all about how

1549
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,239
nasal breathing is better for

1550
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,640
us especially kids than being mouth

1551
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:38,479
breathers under most conditions

1552
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,078
for sake of improving immunity it turns

1553
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,920
out there's a microbiome in the nose

1554
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,680
like all sorts of good stuff about nasal

1555
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,039
breathing preferentially

1556
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:48,719
but when we exercise you can

1557
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:50,480
you can do pure nasal breathing but the

1558
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,558
problem is once you get up to kind of

1559
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,159
third and fourth and fifth gear effort

1560
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,839
you can't nasal breathe and be at

1561
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,279
maximum capacity unless you've been

1562
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:58,880
training it for a very long time

1563
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,040
so i would say double inhale through the

1564
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,519
nose offload through the mouth so double

1565
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,920
inhale

1566
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,358
exhale while you're in steady effort and

1567
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,800
then if you really feel like you need to

1568
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:09,358
gas it and you're pushing

1569
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,400
the data show that then just use

1570
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:12,480
whatever's there

1571
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,760
right just go into kind of default mode

1572
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,280
because

1573
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,880
bringing too much concentration to

1574
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,680
something is also going to spend

1575
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,760
epinephrine

1576
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,519
the goal is to get into that i don't

1577
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,800
like the word but the flow state

1578
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,719
where you're not thinking too much

1579
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,160
you're just in exertion

1580
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,838
so these are so these are things that

1581
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,239
can help in the transitions

1582
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,759
um but i don't think there's any secret

1583
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,118
breathing technique you know anyone

1584
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,440
who's been in the seal teams will kind

1585
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,480
of

1586
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,119
you know they'll tell you like there's

1587
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,280
no breathing technique right

1588
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,200
there's a there's tools that you can

1589
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,800
look to from time to time

1590
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:44,719
and these double inhale exhales can be

1591
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,960
great for setting heart rate variability

1592
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:46,558
in

1593
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,400
very quickly and getting into a steady

1594
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,839
cadence while you're exercising but if

1595
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,960
there's a sprint like if suddenly you

1596
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,279
guys are sprinting

1597
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,880
ditch the ditch the double inhale exhale

1598
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,720
and just sprint

1599
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,400
one thing you mentioned he's probably

1600
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,919
gonna push my buttons

1601
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,480
it's a good place to ask a question

1602
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,400
about anger so i'll probably get pissed

1603
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,519
off at him at some point

1604
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:11,039
i'm guessing and

1605
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,838
do you have thoughts from a scientific

1606
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:13,920
perspective

1607
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,920
or also just the personal philosophical

1608
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,960
perspective about the role of anger and

1609
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,559
all of this in

1610
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,880
in managing alertness performance

1611
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,800
i think about this a lot because there's

1612
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,358
so much out there about how important it

1613
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,160
is to do things from a place of love

1614
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:30,960
you know i tweet about it all the time

1615
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,440
and i think and

1616
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,119
love is powerful right you know it is

1617
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,720
interesting that autonomic arousal

1618
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,200
alertness let's just make use simple

1619
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,838
language

1620
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:41,118
alertness physiologically looks

1621
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:45,119
identical

1622
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:47,440
for love and excitement as it does for

1623
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,680
anger and frustration and wanting to

1624
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,240
defeat your opponent

1625
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:53,199
or whoever that opponent happens to be

1626
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,598
they're identical

1627
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,239
except that the love component does tend

1628
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,519
to

1629
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,679
be associated with the release of

1630
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:00,960
neurochemicals of the serotonin and

1631
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:02,838
dopamine type

1632
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,119
that do have this replenishment

1633
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:05,440
component i don't think one wants to be

1634
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,880
in

1635
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,400
constant anger and friction but

1636
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,838
i mean i'll come clean a bit there have

1637
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,720
been portions of my career where some of

1638
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:16,000
my best work

1639
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:18,078
my extra two hours my ability to nail a

1640
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,440
really hard deadline or problem has come

1641
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,920
from not wanting to get out competed or

1642
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,000
from

1643
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:29,119
wanting to prove something these days i

1644
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,519
i don't i'm not oriented from that place

1645
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,960
toward my work quite as often but i

1646
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,358
think we should be really honest

1647
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,240
anger is powerful provided it's

1648
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:38,318
channeled

1649
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,239
it's very very powerful and it can give

1650
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:43,759
you a ton of fuel

1651
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:47,199
and gas to push when otherwise you'd

1652
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,839
tap yeah joe rogan has

1653
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:52,318
aside from being a fan of his has been

1654
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:55,199
an inspiration to sort of be

1655
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:55,599
to have a kind of loving view on the

1656
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:58,078
world

1657
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,960
in the way you approach the world to me

1658
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,280
so i've

1659
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,960
tended to want to approach the world

1660
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,319
that way but in the same way

1661
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,838
david goggins has been an inspiration to

1662
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:11,119
like

1663
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:14,400
uh yeah be angry at stuff and

1664
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:17,200
uh use it as fuel like he almost

1665
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,838
uh conjures up artificial demons in his

1666
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:22,159
mind just so he can fight them

1667
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,759
i you know but at the same time i tried

1668
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:24,879
that because i did a challenge in the

1669
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,280
summer

1670
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,880
of for 30 days i was doing a lot of

1671
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,680
push-ups and

1672
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,838
it was uh over time it was

1673
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:38,719
counterproductive for me

1674
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:40,838
like i found that it was easier to just

1675
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:42,000
like the roller coaster that the

1676
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:44,558
emotional

1677
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,079
like being angry at stuff takes you can

1678
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,640
also be exhausting

1679
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,440
oh absolutely and it can take you down

1680
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,078
like the

1681
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,039
the ups of it are good but the downs are

1682
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,240
bad

1683
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,920
and what i found is better to get to use

1684
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:59,439
it as a boost every once in a while but

1685
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,519
mostly to get lost

1686
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,119
in the you're talking about the breath

1687
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,199
work that

1688
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,480
like getting lost in the ritual of it

1689
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:08,639
like that the be

1690
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,719
like that as opposed to going on the big

1691
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,920
roller coasters of emotion

1692
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:14,239
yet this brings us into the realm of

1693
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,358
neuroendocrinology

1694
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:17,118
is that there's a fascinating

1695
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,159
relationship between the hormone system

1696
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,039
and the nervous system

1697
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,558
and yeah hormones work in general on

1698
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:23,759
slower time scales the definition of a

1699
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,280
hormone is something the chemical

1700
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,200
released at one location in the body

1701
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,280
goes and acts at multiple locations

1702
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:31,838
far away and within the body pheromone

1703
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,760
would be between two bodies

1704
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:35,039
neurochemicals like dopamine serotonin

1705
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,640
tend to work a little more quickly there

1706
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:38,880
are hormones like adrenaline

1707
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:41,199
and cortisol that can work very fast but

1708
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,480
here i'm referring mainly to

1709
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:45,919
testosterone prolactin prolactin tends

1710
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,719
to be in men and women tends to make

1711
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,680
people kind of

1712
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:51,598
lazy and want to take care of young it

1713
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:52,558
tends to throw down body fat so we can

1714
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,240
stay up late

1715
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,319
it's secreted in response to having

1716
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:58,719
children these are all

1717
00:54:56,318 --> 00:55:00,639
in humans and in animals there's a very

1718
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:02,819
interesting relationship between

1719
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:04,000
testosterone and dopamine

1720
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,480
[Music]

1721
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,519
that speaks directly to what we're

1722
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,199
talking about now

1723
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:14,159
so dopamine and testosterone are closely

1724
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:16,078
related in the pituitary system

1725
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:18,399
and obviously testosterone comes from

1726
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:21,839
the adrenals and from the testes

1727
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:25,119
but the the major effect of testosterone

1728
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:27,039
is to make effort feel good that's what

1729
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,440
testosterone does it has other effects

1730
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:29,759
too

1731
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,440
right reproductive effects androgenizing

1732
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,559
parts of the body etc

1733
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,639
but it makes effort feel good the

1734
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,079
testosterone molecule is synthesized

1735
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:40,400
from cholesterol

1736
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,160
cholesterol can either be made into

1737
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,119
cortisol a stress hormone or

1738
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:45,039
testosterone

1739
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,480
but not both so you have a limited

1740
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:49,039
amount of cholesterol

1741
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,760
and it gets diverted towards stress or

1742
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:53,358
towards tests

1743
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,200
or this pathway where effort feels good

1744
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:56,880
that's the pathway you want to get into

1745
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:57,759
the anger pathway if we were to just

1746
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,280
kind of

1747
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:03,200
play a mind experiment here the anger

1748
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,599
eventually is going to divert more of

1749
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:07,358
that cholesterol molecule to cortisol

1750
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,359
and stress and you will be slowly

1751
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,400
depleting testosterone now going into

1752
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:11,920
this

1753
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,000
you'll have plenty of testosterone but

1754
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,358
after a couple days there have been very

1755
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,079
interesting studies showing that

1756
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:17,920
testosterone

1757
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,240
doesn't necessarily drop with sleep

1758
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,920
deprivation that's a bit of a myth

1759
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,439
you need it to replenish to stop you

1760
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,318
need sleep to replenish testosterone

1761
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,000
eventually

1762
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,759
but the real question is are you

1763
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,079
enjoying what you're doing

1764
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,000
and here that the work was uh some of

1765
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,079
the major work on this was done

1766
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,760
by duncan french who runs the ufc

1767
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,079
training center he did his phd

1768
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,799
at uconn um stores did a really

1769
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,798
beautiful

1770
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:43,039
phd thesis looking at the relationship

1771
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:46,798
between stress hormones testosterone

1772
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:49,279
and dopamine really interesting work and

1773
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,358
the the takeaway from all of this is if

1774
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,319
you can just convince yourself or

1775
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:56,400
ideally if you can just enjoy yourself

1776
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:58,318
you are going to maintain or maybe even

1777
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,880
increase testosterone stores

1778
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:01,838
which will make effort feel good and to

1779
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,358
me

1780
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:05,119
aside from neuroplasticity where

1781
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:06,400
everything becomes automatic after this

1782
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,519
experience

1783
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,880
to me that's the holy grail when effort

1784
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:12,960
feels good

1785
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,798
life just gets way better and we're not

1786
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,318
talking about achieving the reward i'm

1787
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,159
not talking about the end of this thing

1788
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:20,239
i'm talking about the process of it

1789
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:23,118
feeling really good yeah the you know

1790
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:24,558
there is a magic to uh

1791
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,119
i don't know if you can comment on this

1792
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:29,599
but i find myself

1793
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,720
being able to if i just say i'm feeling

1794
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,680
good like this

1795
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,798
this old hack of like smiling while

1796
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:37,279
you're running

1797
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:38,400
if i just tell myself i'm feeling really

1798
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,880
good right now

1799
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,480
no matter how i'm actually feeling i'll

1800
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,039
start feeling way better and the whole

1801
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,318
thing

1802
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:48,719
there's the cascading effect that uh

1803
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:50,318
allows me to maximize the effort it's

1804
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:52,879
it's quite fascinating

1805
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:54,159
it's weird hormones are powerful the

1806
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,000
relationship between thoughts and

1807
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:56,879
hormones and these physiological things

1808
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,719
is enormous

1809
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,000
i had a colleague that a few years ago

1810
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,558
he was dying of

1811
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,679
pancreatic cancer and i was interviewing

1812
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,119
him just because i

1813
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:06,960
he's an important figure in our

1814
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,119
community and i was a friend

1815
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,960
and there was one day where he he told

1816
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,880
me he said you know i don't want to

1817
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,960
make it past the new year i just and it

1818
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,318
was it was crushing for me to hear

1819
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,240
and i knew that he had been on some

1820
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,159
androgen therapy

1821
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,439
for for a whole set of other things and

1822
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,239
i i said you know

1823
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,599
um have you taken your andro androgen

1824
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:27,118
cream and he was like no i haven't done

1825
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,200
it go get it for me

1826
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,720
i have this on film he takes it he puts

1827
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:31,519
the andrew cream on i'm not suggesting

1828
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,000
people take

1829
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:34,880
androgens by the way ten minutes later

1830
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,480
he says

1831
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,240
you know what i think i want to live

1832
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,000
into the new year and i'm going to write

1833
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:41,039
12 letters of recommendation he went to

1834
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,960
mit by the way

1835
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,719
he said i'm going to write 12 letters of

1836
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,240
recommendation and he did

1837
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,838
and so there's something about these

1838
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:51,199
molecules that in an

1839
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:52,558
ancient way in all organisms all mammals

1840
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:54,879
as far as we know

1841
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,119
are linked to the will to live they're

1842
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,880
linked to effort and making effort feel

1843
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,240
good which has been fundamental to the

1844
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,000
evolution of our species

1845
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,000
i always say people think that the

1846
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,880
opposite of testosterone is estrogen but

1847
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,400
it's not

1848
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,960
the opposite of testosterone is

1849
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:12,160
prolactin which makes us feel quiescent

1850
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,559
and not in pursuit of things etc

1851
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:15,519
testosterone makes effort feel good

1852
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,040
estrogen makes

1853
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:22,000
emotions feel okay

1854
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,880
and and and they are in mixed amounts in

1855
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,639
um

1856
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,240
in all people as i say of all

1857
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:28,960
chromosomal backgrounds yeah

1858
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:30,798
yeah i mean you also mentioned fasting

1859
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,440
potentially through this uh two day

1860
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:33,679
thing

1861
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,400
it'd be cool to get your thoughts about

1862
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:39,279
fasting in general do you think

1863
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,920
uh on a personal level and at a higher

1864
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,760
sort of

1865
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,280
level of studies that you're aware of

1866
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,200
and physiology

1867
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,960
and so on what do you think about

1868
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:49,759
intermittent fasting of like

1869
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,440
not eating for 16 hours and then having

1870
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,960
an eight-hour window

1871
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,559
or something i've been doing a lot

1872
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,920
recently which is

1873
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,040
eating only once a day so that's 24-hour

1874
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,280
fast i guess

1875
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:05,440
one meal a day or something i've um

1876
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,760
been thinking about doing haven't done

1877
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,880
yet or doing like 72 hours or some

1878
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,760
people do like

1879
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,318
five day fasts in general so this would

1880
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,960
be

1881
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:15,838
for this particular run will be at a 48

1882
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,079
hour fast

1883
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:20,078
if i don't need it at all what do you

1884
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,240
think about that for performance from

1885
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,599
mood for all those kinds of things i can

1886
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:25,199
speak a little bit to the science

1887
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,960
and a little bit of my own experience

1888
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:27,519
and then some anecdotes of people that

1889
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,358
have done

1890
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,798
very hard very long duration things and

1891
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:32,239
what they've told me so i just want to

1892
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:34,000
make sure i'm separating those out so

1893
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:36,479
people know my sourcing

1894
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,199
i think now none of this is about the

1895
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,440
actual

1896
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,399
long-term nutritional benefits of one

1897
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,519
thing or the other

1898
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,680
but if you look at the science on

1899
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:44,960
intermittent fasting it's pretty

1900
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:46,480
remarkable

1901
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,760
before i was at stanford my lab was in

1902
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,199
san diego one of my colleagues was

1903
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,640
sachin panda

1904
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:53,838
at the salk this phenomenal biologist

1905
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:55,679
and researcher wrote a book called the

1906
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:56,000
circadian code it's very very good and

1907
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,399
and

1908
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,159
kind of popularized intermittent fasting

1909
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,000
although there were others that had

1910
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:04,078
um talked about this before ori

1911
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,559
hofmeckler talked about the warrior diet

1912
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,559
people probably might not know who or he

1913
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,359
is but he's he's sort of the originator

1914
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,880
of the

1915
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:12,400
this business of intermittent fasting

1916
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,039
even once a day are limited

1917
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,559
anyway sachin has published papers

1918
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,358
peer-reviewed papers and very good

1919
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,839
journals

1920
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:20,880
like cell and elsewhere showing that

1921
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:24,000
limiting the

1922
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,240
consumption of calories to eight

1923
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,559
you know four six or eight or even ten

1924
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:31,439
hours of every 24 hour cycle

1925
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,400
and keeping that more or less correlated

1926
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,079
with the

1927
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:38,880
light with when the sun is out leads to

1928
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,519
less liver disease improved metabolic

1929
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,480
markers

1930
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:43,759
less body fat etc in the mouse studies

1931
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,440
they even gave the mice the choice to

1932
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,720
eat whatever they wanted as much as they

1933
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,079
wanted as long as they restricted it to

1934
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:50,399
a certain period

1935
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,359
within the 24 hour cycle they they did

1936
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,880
great they

1937
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:54,480
they maintained a healthy weight or even

1938
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,079
lost weight when they took the same

1939
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,159
amount of food and they stretched it out

1940
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,680
across the 24 the entire 24 hour cycle

1941
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:00,159
so this is eating every hour or two

1942
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,399
hours

1943
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,399
the animals got fat and sick so it's

1944
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,920
pretty remarkable data

1945
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,760
how much of that translates to humans

1946
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,838
isn't clear but one thing that's really

1947
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,200
clear with humans is adherence

1948
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:13,199
right we could talk a lot about

1949
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,639
nutrition and some of the problems with

1950
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:16,078
the studies on nutrition is that what

1951
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:18,558
people will do in a laboratory

1952
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,160
is often hard to do in the real world

1953
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,240
low carbohydrate diets

1954
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,000
just they tend because they tend to

1955
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:26,959
focus on foods that have

1956
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,838
high amino acid content like meats

1957
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,000
generally people

1958
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:31,920
are less hungry on their those than they

1959
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,920
are on calorie matched

1960
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,119
diets of fruits and vegetables and

1961
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,280
carbohydrates because

1962
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,400
when the insulin goes up you get hungry

1963
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,720
and you want to eat more

1964
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,400
so this is not a push for carnivore or a

1965
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:45,679
push against one thing or the other

1966
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:49,358
it's just there are a lot of factors but

1967
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:50,798
we know for sure that when you're fasted

1968
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:52,558
or when you have low amounts of

1969
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:53,519
carbohydrate in your system complex

1970
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,760
carbohydrate

1971
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,559
your alertness is going to go up fast

1972
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,920
increases

1973
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:01,440
increases alertness and epinephrine

1974
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,280
for the sole purpose of getting you to

1975
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,159
go out and find food can you imagine if

1976
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,760
our ancestors

1977
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:07,679
got hungry and they were like oh i'm too

1978
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,359
tired to go find food we wouldn't be

1979
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:11,519
here you'd be like robots or some

1980
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:12,558
one of your alien one of your alien

1981
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:16,000
buddies will be like

1982
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,720
running so i think that if you want to

1983
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,440
be alert

1984
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:20,318
fasting or keeping complex carbohydrates

1985
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,039
to a minimum

1986
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:24,480
is very valuable if you want to sleep

1987
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,400
and you want to be sleepy

1988
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,240
ingesting foods that have a lot of

1989
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,000
tryptophan which is the precursor to

1990
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:32,558
serotonin so complex carbohydrates

1991
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
like rice and grains turkey white meats

1992
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,240
those things do create a sense of

1993
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,639
sleepiness however there is a caveat and

1994
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:39,038
this is

1995
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:40,239
one problem with the once a meal once a

1996
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,240
day meal

1997
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:44,558
is that anytime you have a lot of food

1998
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:46,078
in the gut you're increasing sleepiness

1999
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,720
because you're diverting blood to the

2000
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:50,720
gut it's going to trigger the vagus to

2001
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:53,199
signal to the brain to shut down your

2002
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:53,439
system and utilize those nutrients can

2003
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:55,598
you

2004
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,880
digest and utilize those nutrients so

2005
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,960
i've done the once

2006
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,079
a day eating thing the problem is i eat

2007
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,079
so much in that meal that i'm exhausted

2008
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,599
and so it doesn't always lend itself

2009
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,519
well to the schedule

2010
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,920
but so in a six or eight hour eating

2011
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:11,599
block for me is a little bit better

2012
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,960
i do eat carbohydrates i'm probably one

2013
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,640
of the few people left on the west coast

2014
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,039
that actually consumes carbohydrates and

2015
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:16,639
will

2016
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:18,240
say that out loud people eat carbs

2017
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,000
anymore that's weird they don't where do

2018
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:22,000
you even find carbs what do you buy

2019
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,679
i like oatmeal i like rice the other

2020
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,880
time is if people are doing very high

2021
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:26,318
intensity weight training they need to

2022
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,559
replenish glycogen

2023
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:30,558
on the alertness side i do feel like

2024
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:34,240
it's probably person independent for me

2025
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:34,798
alertness being alert makes my life

2026
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:37,279
better

2027
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,639
in a lot of ways more than just the

2028
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,798
alertness itself

2029
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:43,038
like for example one of the things that

2030
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:45,679
discovered with fasting

2031
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,599
is that when i was training twice a day

2032
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:48,719
in jiu jitsu for example and competing

2033
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:51,440
and so on

2034
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:53,118
i performed way better at things that

2035
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,000
you traditionally would say you need

2036
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,039
carbs for which

2037
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,440
is explosive movements and all that i

2038
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,160
don't

2039
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:01,039
know if i actually perform better in

2040
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:05,440
terms of like

2041
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:08,240
the the force of the explosion

2042
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,400
the explosiveness what i do know is the

2043
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:13,358
alertness resulted in me

2044
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,960
uh doing the technique more precisely

2045
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:16,400
that's the dopamine and epinephrine

2046
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,720
system in action

2047
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,680
and there's a you know there are some

2048
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:23,598
other just

2049
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:25,038
purely uh physical aspects to one diet

2050
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:26,559
versus the other that

2051
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,559
can be complicated if you're ingesting

2052
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,000
carbohydrates complex carbohydrates

2053
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,880
you're going to replenish glycogen which

2054
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,480
is great

2055
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,280
but they also tend to be bulky and

2056
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,039
fibrous and i've never rolled jiu jitsu

2057
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,880
but running when you have a lot of bulky

2058
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,160
fibrous food in your in your gut or in

2059
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,358
your intestine

2060
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:43,440
it can be a barrier it can be

2061
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:45,440
uncomfortable and so some people do

2062
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,358
really well on low carbohydrate meat

2063
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,679
rich diets because they're just not

2064
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:51,279
as bloated they're not carrying as much

2065
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,798
water and other stuff

2066
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,960
carbohydrate carries a lot of water

2067
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:56,318
molecules with it so there are aspects

2068
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,079
to being able to train and being really

2069
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:00,719
explosive because you feel light

2070
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,160
one anecdote that really again i'm not

2071
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,038
encouraging any one particular kind of

2072
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:07,440
diet but i have a friend who is in the

2073
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,720
uh in the seal teams um i happen to know

2074
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,240
a number of people in that community and

2075
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,318
he told me that he did this

2076
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:13,919
very long fast it was so fast that i

2077
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:16,000
think they you get to eat a little bit

2078
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,280
of soup and or broth and there's like a

2079
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,280
bar or something but it's like a

2080
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:22,079
nine-day thing and he's

2081
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,039
he's a very strong athlete and he said

2082
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,160
that

2083
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,480
on day six or seven he was running up

2084
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:27,679
some

2085
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,159
hills or something while he was on

2086
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:32,558
deployment and he

2087
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:34,000
felt amazing he kind of hit this other

2088
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:35,119
level he was somebody who had boxed in

2089
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,920
the naval academy

2090
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:39,119
he was somebody who was had he knew

2091
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,200
knows a new

2092
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,318
high output and he felt like he

2093
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:44,480
discovered the

2094
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:45,519
the 13th floor that there was another

2095
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,199
floor to this

2096
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:48,719
performance space that he hadn't

2097
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:50,798
experienced

2098
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,159
except while he had fasted and he said

2099
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,480
that that was a remarkable

2100
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:55,358
clarity of mind energy it's a little bit

2101
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,960
of what you described

2102
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:58,798
he described a kind of suppleness and

2103
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,318
explosiveness so there's probably

2104
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:03,119
something there on which day

2105
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:04,318
uh at once he was in the fifth or sixth

2106
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,920
day of the february see this is the

2107
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:08,719
thing is i've never been there

2108
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,838
uh on the second third fourth fifth day

2109
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:14,959
that kind of thing

2110
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:18,000
but when i just don't eat for 20 hours

2111
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,720
many times through my training the

2112
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,039
clarity

2113
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,038
it's like you feel like everyone is

2114
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,359
moving super slowly

2115
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,520
and you're able to like dominate people

2116
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:29,598
you weren't able to before it's like

2117
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:32,400
well you might have slipped into or

2118
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:35,280
switched over rather into full ketosis

2119
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,240
and ketogenic diets done properly can be

2120
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,599
great for people

2121
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:39,439
the problem is if you do it wrong you

2122
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,960
can really mess it up i tried it once

2123
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,480
and i basically got psoriasis i thought

2124
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,159
my scalp was going to fall off i was

2125
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,920
like slothing off all this

2126
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:47,679
and i stopped and i was taking the

2127
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,880
liquid ketones and then all of a sudden

2128
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:52,000
i felt better again

2129
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:54,400
but i was told that i just did it wrong

2130
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,159
yes um that's so i think there's a right

2131
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,720
way and a wrong way and you have to get

2132
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,639
it right

2133
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:59,919
definitely and so i've experimented

2134
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:01,759
quite a bit with keto too

2135
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,039
to see how my body feels and doing it

2136
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,680
the right way and following all the

2137
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,559
instructions

2138
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:07,358
there's definitely a huge difference

2139
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,798
that

2140
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:10,558
like for example one of the things i

2141
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:13,759
discovered everyone always said this

2142
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:17,039
and but i tried this uh recently

2143
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:19,759
over the past year as i started drinking

2144
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:21,439
when i don't feel great if i'm fasting

2145
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,439
uh bone broth

2146
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,599
chicken bone broth oh yeah and for some

2147
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:27,678
reason like magically it could be

2148
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,520
this is the other thing the mind i don't

2149
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:32,719
know but it makes me feel

2150
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:35,040
really good well it could be the salt

2151
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:36,798
so i mean neurons the action potential

2152
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:37,920
neurons as you know is sodium's rushing

2153
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:39,600
into the cell you need enough

2154
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,199
extracellular sodium

2155
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,759
in order for your brain and nervous

2156
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:46,158
system to function and so salt i mean

2157
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:47,439
unless people have hypertension salt is

2158
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:49,519
great there was an article in science

2159
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:51,439
magazine about a decade ago about how

2160
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,880
salt had been demonized unless people

2161
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,919
have hypertension provided you drink

2162
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,920
enough water

2163
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,679
salt is great you need sodium magnesium

2164
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,359
and potassium to function

2165
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:01,119
and for your nerve cells to work i mean

2166
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,759
people who over drink water and don't

2167
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:05,679
consume enough electrolytes die

2168
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:07,119
now hydration is really important i know

2169
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:08,640
david's really into hydration

2170
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:10,158
he's mentioned that a few times i mean

2171
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,159
hydrating

2172
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:13,278
properly is key and so you definitely

2173
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,719
want to make sure that you're

2174
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,719
drinking enough water and getting enough

2175
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,759
electrolytes that i mean we should have

2176
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,480
actually talked about that at the

2177
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,000
beginning because

2178
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,158
that's going to keep your nervous system

2179
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,319
functioning well and a lot of people

2180
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,000
they'll get shaky or jittery

2181
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,920
and when they're fasting and they'll

2182
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,520
think they need sugar

2183
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,440
and if they just put some salt in some

2184
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,000
water they feel fine and like the other

2185
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:33,678
stuff from

2186
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,198
potassium magnesium whatever the other

2187
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:38,719
electrolytes are but yeah

2188
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:41,919
the yeah those three so i mean salt yeah

2189
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:43,520
before sleep um salt

2190
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,640
i mean this is a vast space and we're

2191
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,759
kind of talking about the overlap

2192
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,000
between

2193
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,920
neurochemicals hormones and nutrition

2194
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,560
and it's a fascinating space and it's

2195
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,440
one that

2196
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,560
the academic community has gems up

2197
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,639
within the textbooks

2198
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,600
it hasn't really made it into the public

2199
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,119
sphere yet

2200
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,039
and i think that's because people get so

2201
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:03,439
caught up in the you know

2202
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:05,760
being are you vegan or are you carnivore

2203
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:07,198
and there's a vast space in between too

2204
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,960
that people can explore like i'm not a

2205
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:11,839
competitive athlete so

2206
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,239
i eat meat and i also eat vegetables and

2207
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,239
i eat

2208
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:15,519
fruits and it's just about timing them

2209
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:16,879
but i tend to eat carbohydrates when i

2210
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,640
want to be sleepy i eat them at night

2211
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,560
and everyone said that's the worst thing

2212
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,560
you can't do that you sleep great after

2213
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,239
eating a big bowl of pasta i'll tell you

2214
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,320
and by the way i should i should give

2215
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:26,799
you a big thank you for connecting me

2216
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:30,639
with

2217
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:33,520
belcampo farms they send me some meat

2218
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,400
i think because of you and it's

2219
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,120
delicious

2220
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:38,719
so i i really i really appreciate that i

2221
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:39,599
mean it also connected me with this

2222
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:42,880
whole

2223
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,960
world of people who are doing farming in

2224
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,679
this ethical way and like really love

2225
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,920
the whole process and like and as uh

2226
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,960
from a both like a human level but also

2227
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,560
scientific

2228
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:56,800
level and the result is um

2229
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,600
it's like ethical but also it's

2230
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,239
delicious

2231
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,760
and it makes you think about your diet

2232
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:03,439
in a whole new kind of way

2233
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,960
yeah i've known um i don't have any

2234
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:06,479
commercial relationship to bill campbell

2235
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,119
so i can be very clear i've known

2236
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:10,799
anya fernald who who's one of the found

2237
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:12,479
is the founder and ceo of el campo i've

2238
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,239
known her since the ninth grade

2239
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:15,599
it is true that her parents are faculty

2240
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:16,079
members at stanford they're colleagues

2241
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,079
of mine

2242
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:19,600
but she's just a serious academic of

2243
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:21,920
nutrition but also

2244
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,280
of sustainable agriculture of you know

2245
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,679
all sorts of things and also the meat

2246
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,119
just

2247
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:27,039
it's awesome it tastes really good and

2248
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:27,840
no i'm not getting paid to say that no

2249
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:29,920
they're not a

2250
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,079
sponsoring my podcast it's just if you i

2251
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,319
feel like if you're gonna eat animals

2252
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:35,600
if that's in your framework and you're

2253
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:36,559
gonna eat animals knowing that the

2254
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,920
animals were

2255
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,320
raised as happy as could be until you

2256
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,800
know

2257
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:43,599
time of slaughter is is at least

2258
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,000
important to me and

2259
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,679
and actually uh talk to her so i i will

2260
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
talk to her on this podcast actually and

2261
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,039
she

2262
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,039
invited me uh like a week ago out to

2263
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,158
to visit the farm in may or june or

2264
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:55,439
whatever yeah they have the farm up at

2265
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:56,879
the oregon board i haven't been there

2266
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:57,359
yet but i've seen the pictures and it

2267
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,679
just looks

2268
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,279
awesome and i was like yes it looks

2269
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:03,600
beautiful let me know when you're going

2270
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:06,238
yeah let's go together you'll probably

2271
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:09,600
run there but i'll drive there

2272
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:10,000
yeah but that all that said i do want to

2273
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,920
because

2274
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,279
a lot of people who are vegan write to

2275
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,119
me

2276
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:17,039
and i do want to seriously in the same

2277
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:20,000
seriousness that i approached keto

2278
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:22,079
i do want to go like on a few months to

2279
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,960
switch to a vegan diet at some point to

2280
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:24,719
really try it

2281
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,920
yeah i haven't done it yet because i'm

2282
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:31,039
afraid i'm gonna function better

2283
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,359
i'm argentine by my dad's side and i i i

2284
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:34,158
don't

2285
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:34,880
eat i don't eat meat super often but

2286
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:36,399
well

2287
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,920
for most people would it would seem

2288
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:41,039
often but um but i

2289
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,560
i do love steak i do um so i'm afraid

2290
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:44,000
i'm gonna feel better there's a social

2291
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,400
element to stake you're right because

2292
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,119
coming from a russian background like i

2293
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:50,719
can't imagine going to visit my folks

2294
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:53,359
like my parents for thanksgiving or

2295
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:56,158
something to say mom and dad i'm

2296
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,279
uh you know i don't eat meat so is that

2297
01:12:56,158 --> 01:12:57,920
you know well i think if you're gonna

2298
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:00,238
eat meat

2299
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,279
getting it from sources that are

2300
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:04,079
compatible with

2301
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:04,479
um you know continuation of the planet

2302
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,640
is

2303
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:07,678
good i mean there are some some real

2304
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,119
problems with the

2305
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,560
factory farm meat you know you drive up

2306
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:12,238
and down the five and you pass that

2307
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,360
point where other all those cows

2308
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:18,959
i mean as somebody who loves animals

2309
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:20,559
um it's it's clear that it's

2310
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,079
you know you want to limit the amount of

2311
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,000
suffering of those animals

2312
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,000
whenever i hear about um you know we

2313
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,119
have we know people that hunt and that

2314
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,479
go and get their own meat i

2315
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:30,559
i really admire that i admire that

2316
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:31,519
people do that we don't we don't tend to

2317
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,520
do that in the

2318
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,880
hills around stanford you know there are

2319
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,000
mountain lions back there but that's

2320
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,159
about it and i'm

2321
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,679
i'm certainly i admire the vegan mindset

2322
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:43,599
of being of just making that decision

2323
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:45,600
you're just not going to consume other

2324
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,280
beings but you know i haven't gone that

2325
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,199
way but performance-wise i'm just

2326
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:52,158
curious because

2327
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:52,960
i was surprised i was certain that

2328
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:54,799
eating five

2329
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,239
six seven meals a day is the right thing

2330
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,880
to do for all

2331
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:01,039
if you want to be perform your best when

2332
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,279
i was like 20 or whatever

2333
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:05,439
and i would eat oatmeal like i thought

2334
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:07,198
it's obvious i have to have a really

2335
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,439
a lot of carbs in the breakfast i had a

2336
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:11,919
lot of preconceived notions and then

2337
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:13,919
when i started eating like once a day

2338
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,760
this was at the peak of my competing jiu

2339
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:18,158
jitsu

2340
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,679
it was like everything i know about

2341
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:21,519
nutrition is wrong

2342
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,279
yeah you realize that like you have to

2343
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,199
become a scientist first of all you have

2344
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:26,960
to read literature you have to learn you

2345
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:28,960
experiment but you also have to

2346
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,319
become a scientist of your own body and

2347
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,079
in the same way

2348
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:33,920
i have a lot of preconceived notions of

2349
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:37,039
what performance is like

2350
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:40,319
under vegan diet and i want to do it

2351
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:42,238
right like seriously not not

2352
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:44,479
necessarily for the ethical reasons but

2353
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:46,559
to see if it's performance wise

2354
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:49,599
like can i remember there's like a

2355
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:52,080
fruitarian diet where you eat fruit only

2356
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,440
you know these extremes are like they're

2357
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,238
pretty they're interesting because

2358
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:56,639
people have

2359
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:57,519
this need the extremes are informative

2360
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,800
though right i mean

2361
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,640
well-controlled experiments you

2362
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,480
eliminate as many variables as you can

2363
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,800
except the one you're interested in so

2364
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:07,198
people are running these experiments i i

2365
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,079
think that

2366
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:11,759
it's hard to imagine getting i know

2367
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:12,479
people say you can get enough amino

2368
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,480
acids

2369
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:15,599
from plant-based sources and i believe

2370
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:16,959
that i

2371
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,600
think it probably takes a little more

2372
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,520
work one thing that's really clear is

2373
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,920
that the benefit of these

2374
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,280
omega-3 omega-6 ratios like fish oils

2375
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,640
and things like that there are some data

2376
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:28,479
that showed that the

2377
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,920
getting at least a thousand milligrams

2378
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:31,678
of the epa

2379
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,199
which is in high in fish oils but other

2380
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,480
things too even some meats

2381
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:40,000
and other plants it in

2382
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:41,599
double you know in matched uh placebo

2383
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,279
double blind controlled studies

2384
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,480
placebo-controlled double-blind studies

2385
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:46,479
have shown that

2386
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:48,319
those can offset anti-depressive

2387
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:50,079
symptoms as much as some of the

2388
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:52,880
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

2389
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:54,559
like prolactins the prozac and zoloft so

2390
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,319
that's pretty impressive and in

2391
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,560
scandinavia people know

2392
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:00,238
especially in winter to consume a lot of

2393
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,280
those omega-3s

2394
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:03,359
because they're good for you they're

2395
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:05,359
good for the brain that's the other

2396
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,839
question

2397
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:08,639
wise what kind of stuff have you come

2398
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,760
across that's

2399
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,239
useful like i basically only take fish

2400
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,960
oil

2401
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:15,919
like you said electrolytes electrolytes

2402
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,880
with water

2403
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:21,279
the david goggins diet fish oil plus

2404
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,840
fish oil and then uh

2405
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:26,000
again the sponsor they made it so easier

2406
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,840
the the sponsor your podcast and and

2407
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,520
mine

2408
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:32,239
athleticgreens.com slash huberman

2409
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,440
support it i don't i don't know like

2410
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:35,678
it's it's great stuff

2411
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:37,279
for sure but also just takes away the

2412
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,719
headache of like i don't have to think

2413
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:40,079
about like yeah you're gonna get a bunch

2414
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,158
of vitamins and minerals

2415
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:45,039
it'll co it does that sounds like a plug

2416
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:46,960
but i have genuinely been buying it

2417
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:48,319
you know no discount no affiliation or

2418
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,439
anything since 2012.

2419
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:50,719
i think i heard about it on the tim

2420
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:51,839
ferriss podcast was like oh i'm going to

2421
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,359
try that stuff

2422
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,520
and i liked it i mean when i was

2423
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:56,079
starting my lab i was working insane

2424
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,040
hours

2425
01:16:56,079 --> 01:17:00,479
i still work very long hours and getting

2426
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:02,800
sick

2427
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:03,839
limits productivity and i also wanted to

2428
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,039
train and i wasn't

2429
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,800
doing much training back then um

2430
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:10,399
now i try and get you know three four

2431
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,920
sessions in a week i'm not doing nothing

2432
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:13,039
like what you and david are doing or

2433
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,880
what you know

2434
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:17,039
joe does or like you guys are way more

2435
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,520
regimented and consistent than i am

2436
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:21,198
um but i think that being healthy and

2437
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,080
feeling good

2438
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:24,319
is one of the great benefits to a career

2439
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,000
is

2440
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:31,119
having energy and just being not sick

2441
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,359
can we take a step back to uh uh sleep

2442
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:34,880
for

2443
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:38,158
sure yeah so people should definitely

2444
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:41,359
uh look through your podcast the first

2445
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:43,119
five episodes were on sleep or

2446
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:44,880
no i guess the first opening episode

2447
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:46,719
wasn't uh first one was sort of how the

2448
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,840
brain works generally is to give people

2449
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,239
some background

2450
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,520
and then we did four episodes on sleep

2451
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:53,678
including some stuff about food

2452
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,040
temperature exercise jet lag shift work

2453
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,480
for the jet lag

2454
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:58,158
folks and shift workers yeah it's like a

2455
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:01,279
master class on sleep and then you're go

2456
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:03,599
you're going on to a next uh

2457
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:04,960
topic in the next few episodes which is

2458
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,120
incredible well

2459
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,480
neuroplasticity we'll talk about it but

2460
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:11,198
on sleep

2461
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:14,399
one of the cool things about the human

2462
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:18,559
mind when it sleeps is dreaming

2463
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:21,679
uh what do you think we understand about

2464
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:24,000
the contents of dreams like what do

2465
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,279
dreams mean all the stuff we see when we

2466
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,560
dream

2467
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:29,039
is there something that we understand

2468
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,560
about

2469
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:34,319
uh the contents of dreams some of it is

2470
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:37,920
very concrete so

2471
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:39,519
matt wilson who mit um

2472
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,960
showed in rodents and it's been shown in

2473
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:42,719
non-human primates and now it's been

2474
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:46,158
shown in humans that

2475
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:47,359
there is replay of spatial information

2476
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:50,319
during sleep

2477
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:50,639
so initially what matt showed was that

2478
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:52,399
as

2479
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,679
these little rodents navigate through a

2480
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,759
maze they're the cells in the

2481
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:56,239
hippocampus called place cells that fire

2482
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,640
when the

2483
01:18:56,238 --> 01:18:59,279
animal encounters a turn or a corridor

2484
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,679
and

2485
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:02,559
that same exact same sequence is replay

2486
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:05,600
during sleep

2487
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:08,800
and it turns out this is true in

2488
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,880
london taxi cab drivers before phones

2489
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,279
and gps were what they are today

2490
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:15,840
the london taxi cab drivers were famous

2491
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:18,960
for knowing the routes through the city

2492
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,719
through these mental maps and their

2493
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,719
analysis of their place cell firing

2494
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:24,158
during sleep and during wakefulness and

2495
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,760
so we are essentially

2496
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:27,439
taking spatial information about the

2497
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,280
location of things and replaying it

2498
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:31,198
during sleep however

2499
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,920
it's not replayed so that you remember

2500
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:36,399
it all it's replayed so that if

2501
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:39,039
there's a reason to remember it the

2502
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:41,039
links to the emotional system to the

2503
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:42,560
components of the limbic system and

2504
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:44,238
hypothalamus that are

2505
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,920
relevant like you got into a car crash

2506
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:47,198
or a particular location or you lost a

2507
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,960
bunch of money because you were

2508
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:50,960
a cab driver uber driver we'd say

2509
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,198
nowadays and you were stuck at one

2510
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,480
particular avenue all day and frustrated

2511
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:57,279
and you're getting yelled at by your

2512
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:59,359
spouse that information gets encoded

2513
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,559
so that you never forget that at that

2514
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:02,158
particular time of day in that

2515
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,120
particular time of year

2516
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:06,719
and this thing happened so context

2517
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,158
starts getting linked to experience so

2518
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,560
there's spatial information

2519
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:12,479
that's absolutely replayed during sleep

2520
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,639
and we experience this sometimes as

2521
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:16,238
dreams the dreams that happen early in

2522
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:18,480
the night when slow wave sleep or

2523
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:21,198
non-rem sleep dominates

2524
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:23,599
tends to be sleep of very kind of

2525
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:25,919
general themes and kind of um

2526
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,840
location it's a it can feel a little bit

2527
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,679
eerie and kind of strange ins

2528
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,199
not so incidentally the early phase of

2529
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:32,158
the night is when growth hormone is

2530
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:34,158
released

2531
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:36,000
in the 80s and 90s there was a drug that

2532
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:38,638
was very popular it's very illegal now

2533
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,039
called ghb

2534
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,800
you could actually buy it at gnc or

2535
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:44,719
store then i never took it but it was a

2536
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,039
popular party drug and some people

2537
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:47,760
some famous celebrities died while on

2538
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:48,960
ghb

2539
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,159
they were also on a bunch of other

2540
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,679
things so it's not clear what killed

2541
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:53,920
them but ghb

2542
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:56,158
was very big in certain communities

2543
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:58,560
because it promoted a massive release

2544
01:20:56,158 --> 01:21:00,399
of growth hormone and gave people these

2545
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,760
very hypnotic states so people go to

2546
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:03,599
clubs and they were in these very

2547
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,119
hypnotic states it was part of a whole

2548
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:08,880
culture

2549
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:10,880
that's early night and those dreams

2550
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,800
tend to not have a lot of emotional

2551
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,960
content or load

2552
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,920
that phase of dreaming is associated

2553
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,840
with

2554
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,000
the occasional jolting yourself out of

2555
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:22,239
sleep because somewhat lighter sleep

2556
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,679
this the dreams that occur during rem

2557
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:25,198
during rapid eye movement sleeping that

2558
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:28,319
dominate towards mourning

2559
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:30,638
are very different they tend to have

2560
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:31,840
very little epinephrine is available in

2561
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:33,359
the brain at that time

2562
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,119
epinephrine again being this molecule

2563
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:37,359
stress fear and excitement

2564
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:39,679
you are paralyzed during these rem

2565
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:43,439
dreams you're you cannot move

2566
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:45,600
there's intense emotion at the level of

2567
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:46,879
what you're feeling and their so-called

2568
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,480
theory of mind

2569
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,039
theory of mind is an idea that was put

2570
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:52,319
forward by simon baron cohen sasha baron

2571
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:53,920
cohen's cousin

2572
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:56,079
i think on the podcast i mistakenly said

2573
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,920
that he was at oxford it's like the

2574
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:59,519
cardinal sin he's at cambridge forgive

2575
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,760
me i'm not british but

2576
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:02,800
so the dreams in rem have are heavily

2577
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,960
emotionally laden

2578
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,800
and it's very clear that those dreams

2579
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,119
and rem sleep if you deprive yourself of

2580
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,840
them

2581
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:10,639
for too long you become irritable and

2582
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,679
you start

2583
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,560
linking generally negative emotions to

2584
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,199
almost

2585
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,440
everything rem the dreams that occur in

2586
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:21,678
rem sleep are when we divorce emotion

2587
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:24,000
from our prior experiences

2588
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,960
and it's when we extract general rules

2589
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,679
and themes

2590
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,079
uh mit seems to come up a lot today but

2591
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,560
it's

2592
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:31,920
it's highly relevant susumu tonagawa

2593
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,560
nobel prize for

2594
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,000
immunoglobulin but obviously fantastic

2595
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,920
neuroscientists as well

2596
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,520
has shown that the replay of neurons in

2597
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,239
the hippocampus and elsewhere in the

2598
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,719
brain

2599
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:44,158
is kind of an approximation of the

2600
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:46,880
previous episode

2601
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:47,839
and a lot of fear unlearning of

2602
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,639
uncoupling

2603
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,400
emotion from hard or traumatic events

2604
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,679
that happened previously occurs

2605
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:55,439
in rem sleep so you don't want to

2606
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,920
deprive yourself of rem sleep for too

2607
01:22:55,439 --> 01:22:57,519
long

2608
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,199
and those dreams tend to be very intense

2609
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,120
now epinephrine is low

2610
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:02,238
so that you can't suddenly act out your

2611
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:04,479
dreams

2612
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:06,479
but what's interesting is sometimes

2613
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:08,319
people will wake up suddenly

2614
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:10,399
while in a rem dream and their heart

2615
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:11,920
will be beating really really fast

2616
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:13,759
that's a surge of epinephrine that

2617
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,600
occurs as you exit

2618
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,360
rem sleep so you were having this

2619
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,000
intense emotional experience without the

2620
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:19,119
fear

2621
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,119
you were essentially going through

2622
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:21,840
therapy in your sleep self-induced

2623
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:23,439
therapy

2624
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,880
it's like trauma therapy where you try

2625
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:25,919
and divorce the emotion from the

2626
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,079
experience

2627
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,239
and then you wake up and some people

2628
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:33,198
also have the other component of rem

2629
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:34,559
which is atonia which is paralysis pot

2630
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:36,238
smokers

2631
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,719
experience this a lot more than non-pot

2632
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:40,079
smokers there's an invasion of paralysis

2633
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:41,520
into the waking state

2634
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:43,519
i'm not a pot smoker but i have

2635
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,280
experienced this and when you wake up

2636
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,679
and you're paralyzed for a second it's

2637
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:48,719
terrifying but then you jolt yourself

2638
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:52,480
alert

2639
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:54,800
so the rem sleep is important for

2640
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:56,718
kind of the self-induced therapy and

2641
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,800
forgetting the bad stuff

2642
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,079
it's good for uncoupling the emotions

2643
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,400
from bad experiences

2644
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:04,399
and just there are two therapies i move

2645
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:07,039
into sensitization reprocessing

2646
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:08,000
which is a eye movement thing that shuts

2647
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:10,000
down the amygdala

2648
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,319
during therapy not during sleep and

2649
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
ketamine which is a dissociative

2650
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:17,679
analgesic it's actually very similar to

2651
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
pcp and ketamine is now being used as a

2652
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:21,760
trauma therapy when someone comes into

2653
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,279
the er for instance and they were in a

2654
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,639
terrible car accident these are horrible

2655
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:26,158
things to describe but you know

2656
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:28,159
they saw a relative impaled on the

2657
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:29,839
driving steering column or something

2658
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:31,679
and they will give this drug to try and

2659
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,880
shut off the emotion system

2660
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:35,279
so that because they're not going to

2661
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,400
forget let's be honest you don't forget

2662
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:39,039
the bad stuff but

2663
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:39,599
it is possible to uncouple the bad

2664
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:41,760
events

2665
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,960
from the emotional system and there's

2666
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,480
all sorts of ethical issues about

2667
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,880
whether or not that's good or bad to do

2668
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,359
but

2669
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,079
ptsd is a failure to uncouple the

2670
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:50,479
emotion

2671
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:52,319
from these intense experiences so the

2672
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:54,638
goal of this kind of therapy

2673
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:55,439
is in the uncoupling for that to be

2674
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:58,000
permanent

2675
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:59,279
yeah to uh to separate so they can

2676
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,880
recount the event

2677
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:02,960
and they can describe it without it

2678
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,480
triggering the same somatic experience

2679
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:07,279
of terror and dread

2680
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:09,079
um because terror those feelings can be

2681
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:11,759
debilitating obviously you're saying

2682
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:13,279
physiologically in uh rem sleep a

2683
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,840
similar process is happening that's

2684
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,079
right

2685
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,279
the thematically rem sleep is about

2686
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:20,238
experiencing

2687
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:21,439
or replaying intense emotions without

2688
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:23,119
experience the

2689
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:24,638
somatic the physical component of the

2690
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:26,880
emotion either the acting out

2691
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:28,079
or the accelerated heart rate and

2692
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,960
agitation

2693
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:32,399
likewise with things like ketamine

2694
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,639
therapies that's the idea is you're

2695
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:37,039
uncoupling the physical sensation from

2696
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,760
the mental events what is rem sleep and

2697
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:40,479
why is it

2698
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,159
so special maybe we can comment on that

2699
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:43,759
rabbit eye movement sleep

2700
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:45,439
yeah discovered in the 50s at the

2701
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,440
university of chicago it's

2702
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:49,039
intense brain activity high levels of

2703
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:51,119
metabolic activity

2704
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:52,479
dreams in which people report a lot of

2705
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:54,880
the theory of mind we were talking about

2706
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:56,399
uh simon baron cohen theory of mind is

2707
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,920
was actually something that he developed

2708
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:01,039
for the diagnosis of

2709
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:03,600
autism if you take kids most

2710
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:04,719
kids of age five six seven you put them

2711
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,840
in front of a tv screen

2712
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,119
in the laboratory and you have them

2713
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,800
watch a video where a kid is playing

2714
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:10,719
with a ball or a doll

2715
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,159
and then the kid puts it into a drawer

2716
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:13,679
shuts the drawer and walks away and

2717
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:15,039
another kid comes in and you ask the

2718
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,119
child who's observing this

2719
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:19,119
little movie you say what does this

2720
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:22,000
second child think and they

2721
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:23,279
a typical kid would say uh they want to

2722
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,479
play and they don't know where the ball

2723
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:26,399
or doll is or they

2724
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:27,678
they they're upset or they're sad they

2725
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:30,719
want the doll

2726
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:32,319
autistic children tend to say the doll's

2727
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:34,480
in the drawer

2728
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:35,439
the the toys in the drawer they tend to

2729
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:37,279
fixate

2730
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:39,119
they can't get in on the event they

2731
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:40,800
can't get into the mind of that they

2732
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:43,198
don't have a theory of mind

2733
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,039
dreams in rem have a heavy theory of

2734
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,759
mind component people are after me

2735
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:48,319
trying to get

2736
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,199
me you can assign motive to other people

2737
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:52,479
i'm afraid

2738
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:54,399
but it's because there's an expectation

2739
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:56,000
that doesn't tend to happen in slow wave

2740
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:57,679
sleep dreams now all this of course is

2741
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,880
by waking people up and asking them what

2742
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:01,679
they were dreaming about which

2743
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,480
from a standpoint of a ai guy or a

2744
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,119
machine learning

2745
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:05,839
or a is kind of like but it's the best

2746
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:08,399
we've got

2747
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:10,239
yes but brain imaging what in waking

2748
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:11,839
states while people view a movie

2749
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:13,279
and then brain imaging while people are

2750
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,279
sleeping supports the idea that that's

2751
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:17,679
basically what's going on

2752
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:19,519
so rem sleep is amazing and you're not

2753
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:22,000
going to get much of it during your

2754
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,040
about with uh goggins but you will

2755
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,399
afterward

2756
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:28,719
why so to comment why won't i

2757
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:30,238
so is it not possible to get into it

2758
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:32,800
real quick

2759
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:34,319
only if you're very very sleep deprived

2760
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,400
but because you're going to be at

2761
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:38,479
high muscular output that's going to

2762
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:41,920
bias you towards more slow wave sleep

2763
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:44,638
overall and your body

2764
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,679
and brain are smart they it will know

2765
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:49,199
they will know

2766
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:50,880
that your main goal is to recover

2767
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:52,638
so you can keep going so you can keep

2768
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,639
firing neuromuscular contractions and

2769
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:56,239
you can keep running so that you can

2770
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:57,840
i mean it's amazing to think like why do

2771
01:27:56,238 --> 01:28:00,238
we ever stop

2772
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,880
unlike weight training where i can't do

2773
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:04,319
a 500 pound deadlift i just can't

2774
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,279
i could train for it but i certainly

2775
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:10,158
can't do a 600 pound i can't do that

2776
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:10,800
what causes us to stop an endurance

2777
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:12,799
event

2778
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,480
is usually not a physical barrier it's

2779
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,199
almost always a purely mental

2780
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:18,638
barrier and that's a very interesting

2781
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:20,158
problem i mean neuroscientists don't

2782
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:22,359
tend to think about those sorts of

2783
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:24,479
problems because it sounds so

2784
01:28:22,359 --> 01:28:25,519
non-neuroscientific but that's

2785
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:28,158
fundamentally

2786
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,040
related to the question of you know what

2787
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:31,519
is pursuit

2788
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:32,319
why what is the the desire to push and

2789
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,320
to and to

2790
01:28:32,319 --> 01:28:35,920
carry on is there a neuroscientific

2791
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:37,840
answer for that question you think

2792
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,239
i think the closest thing is this um

2793
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,920
paper from uh

2794
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:44,319
from genealia farms the howard hughes

2795
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:47,679
campus showing that if you put

2796
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:48,399
uh animals into a simulated environment

2797
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:50,158
where

2798
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:51,759
you can measure their effort and the

2799
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:53,039
forces on while they're running and you

2800
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,480
can look at them and you can control the

2801
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:56,079
visual environment and you can create a

2802
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:56,718
scenario where the animal thinks that

2803
01:28:56,079 --> 01:28:59,439
it's

2804
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:00,880
output is futile it thinks it knows it's

2805
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:02,479
running and it's actually running

2806
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,800
but you change the frequency of the

2807
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:06,238
stripes going by in their visual world

2808
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,159
such that they think they're not getting

2809
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:10,479
anywhere and eventually they

2810
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:11,439
quit and the thing that determines

2811
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:13,519
whether or not they quit

2812
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:15,359
is a threshold level of epinephrine in

2813
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,400
the brain stem if you drop that level

2814
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:18,238
back down or you

2815
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:20,319
or you give the animals dopamine

2816
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:23,359
essentially they keep going

2817
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:24,880
if you take dopamine down they

2818
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:26,639
they're like this isn't worth it it's

2819
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,319
helpless they're just this isn't worth

2820
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:29,840
my time and energy but this is where the

2821
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:32,639
difference between humans

2822
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,960
and non-human animals is interesting

2823
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:34,880
because

2824
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:36,840
it does feel like humans have an extra

2825
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:40,000
level of cognitive

2826
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:42,960
ability that might

2827
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,639
be relevant here well you can pull from

2828
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,880
different time references

2829
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:48,560
so if you're in that moment you're gonna

2830
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,359
need a kit of things to

2831
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:53,600
pull from so you can think this is in

2832
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:56,479
honor of someone else that passed away

2833
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,760
right and you will find a gas reserve

2834
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:00,158
that's amazing

2835
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,840
right now whether or not mice are like i

2836
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:03,359
remember my brother back in the other

2837
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:06,480
cage when i was a little mouse

2838
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:08,479
you know we don't know but it's

2839
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:10,000
very likely that they don't do that that

2840
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:10,959
they're so present they're in the

2841
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,960
experience of

2842
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:14,800
there and then and now that they aren't

2843
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,279
able to extract

2844
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:19,039
from the past and they're not able to

2845
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:20,559
project into the future like how great

2846
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:23,679
it's going to feel when i get to the end

2847
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,960
of this really lame vr corridor i don't

2848
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:28,560
think they think about that

2849
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:30,319
and and think about like if i quit now

2850
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,760
how would i have what kind of effect

2851
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:33,359
will have on the rest of my life in the

2852
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,119
future difficult times

2853
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:36,799
like if you allow yourself to quit in

2854
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:38,800
this particular moment you'll become a

2855
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,639
quitter more and more in life and then

2856
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,320
you're going to not get the the other

2857
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:45,440
nice uh

2858
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:46,079
the opposite sex mammals that's pretty

2859
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:48,879
severe

2860
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:50,559
you went there the whole way to

2861
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,159
evolution and back again i mean but

2862
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,960
that's that's really it i mean our

2863
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:55,519
ability

2864
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:57,520
to time reference in the past present or

2865
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:59,840
future i do believe that we can be in

2866
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,560
the present and the past or the present

2867
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,960
and the future

2868
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:04,480
or only in the present or only in the

2869
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,840
future only in the past but i don't

2870
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:08,079
think that we can really think about

2871
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:10,319
past present and future all at once

2872
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:12,079
and this has a similarity to covert

2873
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:13,599
attention like we can split our visual

2874
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:15,760
attention into two things

2875
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,719
we really can duo task even though we

2876
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,159
can't multitask

2877
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:19,920
or we can bring those two spotlights of

2878
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:21,519
attention to the same location

2879
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,440
but it's very hard to split our

2880
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,199
attention and really well into

2881
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:26,479
three domains excuse me into three

2882
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:28,479
domains

2883
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:30,319
i think that that's very very

2884
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:32,959
challenging and time

2885
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:33,840
our time referencing scheme tends to be

2886
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,880
just

2887
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:39,679
one or two time references

2888
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,039
so lisa feldman barrett i'm not sure if

2889
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:41,600
you've done work together but at least

2890
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:43,840
you're

2891
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,520
i found out about her because of you

2892
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,199
your podcast with her and i brought her

2893
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,239
onto instagram doing an instagram live

2894
01:31:47,198 --> 01:31:50,079
about emotion

2895
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:52,238
and it was fascinating and she's a very

2896
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:54,639
spirited and very very smart

2897
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:55,279
woman and uh fearless yeah and uh

2898
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:58,239
brilliant

2899
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:58,880
so i love her she's amazing uh she kind

2900
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:01,119
of

2901
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:03,440
sh she's not a scholar of hallucigens

2902
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:06,559
hallucinogens or dreams but

2903
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:07,439
she had this intuition that there may be

2904
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,159
a connection

2905
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:11,759
between the kind of dissociation that

2906
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:14,799
happens in dreaming

2907
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:18,800
and that happens in um

2908
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:22,400
like psychedelics i because of my

2909
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:25,440
previous conversation with you uh on

2910
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:27,920
on this podcast uh matthew johnson from

2911
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:28,960
johns hopkins reached out and he said

2912
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,760
but

2913
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:33,520
he he commented i think on something

2914
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:35,199
that we commented i don't even remember

2915
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:38,400
exactly what but that there's not

2916
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:40,079
many studies it's not being

2917
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:42,238
psychedelics and not being rigorously

2918
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:43,039
studied in academic setting like with

2919
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:45,599
the

2920
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:46,158
full rigor of science and he said well

2921
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,920
actually

2922
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:50,079
uh that's exactly what we're doing and

2923
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:52,399
they're extremely well funded now

2924
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:54,000
and it was been a long battle to get it

2925
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:57,039
accepted as a serious

2926
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,439
uh scientific pursuit so um

2927
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:00,560
but and i'd like to ask you a little bit

2928
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:03,599
about that but

2929
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,039
do you have a sense about

2930
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,120
connection between dreams and

2931
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:09,359
psychedelics or these uh

2932
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:11,599
different explorations of mind studies

2933
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:12,479
that are outside of the standard normal

2934
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:15,360
one that's

2935
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:16,718
the wake mindset yeah i loved your

2936
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:18,719
discussion with matthew i

2937
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:20,719
knew of the hopkins group and the stuff

2938
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:22,480
they were doing but i didn't know

2939
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:24,319
much about it at all and i learned a ton

2940
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:25,519
from that podcast i reached out to him

2941
01:33:24,319 --> 01:33:26,719
just to say

2942
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,560
i love what you're doing i think it's

2943
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,239
incredible so yeah your podcast has been

2944
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:33,120
a great source of

2945
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:35,198
serious academic and intellectual um

2946
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:37,279
conversation for me

2947
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:38,238
i think what they're doing at hopkins is

2948
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:40,319
amazing

2949
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:42,079
um he has a collaborator there actually

2950
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:44,238
they had a very popular paper i just

2951
01:33:42,079 --> 01:33:46,399
throw out there for fun

2952
01:33:44,238 --> 01:33:47,678
who was a postdoc at stanford her name

2953
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:50,960
is ghoul um

2954
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:53,440
she's turkish i believe um and

2955
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,960
her and i i apologize her last name

2956
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:56,238
escapes me at the moment but that's just

2957
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:59,198
a function of my brain

2958
01:33:56,238 --> 01:34:00,399
um she had a paper showing that uh she

2959
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:03,279
put octopi

2960
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:04,158
on mdma on ecstasy and found out this

2961
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:06,399
was published in

2962
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:08,319
in a in current biology showing it was a

2963
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:08,799
great journal showing that the octopi

2964
01:34:08,319 --> 01:34:10,238
then

2965
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,239
wanted to spend more time with other

2966
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:14,959
octopi they started cuddling

2967
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,319
yeah so their colleagues out there but

2968
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,960
um

2969
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:19,599
the hopkins project is super interesting

2970
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,039
because

2971
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,120
i think they were initially supported

2972
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:25,039
mainly through private philanthropy

2973
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:26,719
and now you're starting to see some more

2974
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:29,760
interest at the level of nih

2975
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:30,960
about psychedelics it's a complicated

2976
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,719
space because

2977
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:36,560
the psychedelics are always looked at

2978
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:37,840
through the lens of the 60s and people

2979
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,239
losing their mind and

2980
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:41,920
there's a you know in i always say you

2981
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:43,519
know you don't want to ken keezy out of

2982
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,960
the game you know ken kizu was amazing

2983
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:47,280
right about the whole beat generation

2984
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,800
thing and he was actually at the va

2985
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:50,479
near stanford that's where he eventually

2986
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,279
in menlo park he wrote one flew over the

2987
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:53,118
cuckoo's nest or

2988
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:55,039
maybe that was about him anyway the

2989
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:56,960
comments will tell me how wrong i am

2990
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:58,639
but it's i think i'm tossing these words

2991
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,520
in the general in the right general

2992
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:02,639
direction

2993
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:06,400
but you know huxley

2994
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:08,480
keyse they did a lot of lsd and they

2995
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,079
all lost their jobs right they lost

2996
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:11,599
their jobs at big institutions like

2997
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:15,600
harvard and stanford and elsewhere

2998
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:18,000
or they left because they

2999
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,679
they made themselves the experiments yes

3000
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,600
hopkins as far as i know

3001
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,719
is when the first place is not the first

3002
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,800
place where

3003
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:26,480
whatever matt may or may not be doing in

3004
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,679
his own life i don't know

3005
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:29,839
it's really about the patients and

3006
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:32,239
whether or not the patients in these

3007
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:33,520
um institutional review board approved

3008
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:34,000
studies whether or not they're getting

3009
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:37,119
better

3010
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,960
in situations like depression i think

3011
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:40,158
it's clear that there's a very close

3012
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:42,319
relationship

3013
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:44,399
between hallucinogenic states and

3014
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:45,599
dreaming of the sort that would describe

3015
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:48,319
for rem dreaming

3016
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,920
and there's a a terrific set of books

3017
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:51,439
and body of scientific literature from a

3018
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,840
guy named alan hobson

3019
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:56,158
who was an md is it harvard med and he

3020
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:57,440
wrote books like dream drug store

3021
01:35:56,158 --> 01:35:59,599
one of the first neuroscience books i

3022
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:00,000
ever read was about hallucinations and

3023
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,520
how

3024
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,039
psychedelics and dreaming are very

3025
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,719
similar that was way back when i was in

3026
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:06,399
high school i was just curious

3027
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:08,880
and he really understood the

3028
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:10,000
relationship between lsd and rem dreams

3029
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,760
and how similar they

3030
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,118
are i think psychedelics and matt knows

3031
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,600
way more about this than i do of course

3032
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:18,799
but

3033
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,520
psychedelics have some very interesting

3034
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:21,199
properties

3035
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,760
they are certainly not for everybody

3036
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:25,519
right and kids it's a problem you know

3037
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,119
i think the major issues right now

3038
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,280
around the psychedelic

3039
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:30,479
conversation is that it's clear that

3040
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:32,079
they can

3041
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:33,919
unveil certain elements of

3042
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:36,079
neuroplasticity they make the brain

3043
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:38,000
amenable to change changing up

3044
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:39,920
space-time relationships changing up the

3045
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,359
emotional load of an event and being

3046
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,679
able to reframe that

3047
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:45,118
it's clear that happens but there's two

3048
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,840
major issues

3049
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:50,079
one is that people talk about plasticity

3050
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,079
as if plasticity is the goal

3051
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:53,679
but plasticity is a state within which

3052
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:54,559
you can direct neurology and the

3053
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,880
question is

3054
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,639
what changes are you trying to get to so

3055
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:00,639
people are just taking psychedelics to

3056
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,880
unveil plasticity

3057
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:04,400
without thinking about what circuits

3058
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,880
they want to modify and how

3059
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:09,039
i think that's a problem i think there's

3060
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:12,000
great potential however for people

3061
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:13,439
opening up these states of plasticity

3062
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,319
with psychedelics or otherwise

3063
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:18,238
and directing the plastic changes toward

3064
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,719
a particular endpoint and there's an

3065
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:21,919
absolutely spectacular paper out of uc

3066
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:23,679
davis

3067
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,359
published as a full article in nature

3068
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:28,399
just a couple months ago

3069
01:37:25,359 --> 01:37:30,639
showing that there are psychedelics that

3070
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:32,238
are now can be modified so chemists have

3071
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:33,520
gotten into the game now and modifying

3072
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:34,319
to take away the hallucinogenic

3073
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,600
component

3074
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:37,599
where you still get the neural

3075
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,520
plasticity components wow

3076
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,600
and for a lot of people to be like oh

3077
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:43,760
that's no fun that's not giving you the

3078
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,440
the wild experience but i do think that

3079
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:47,199
that holds great potential for people

3080
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:48,879
that wouldn't otherwise

3081
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:50,879
orient towards some of these drugs so i

3082
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,800
think it's really marvelous what's

3083
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:54,159
happening and what's about to happen and

3084
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:57,360
i think there

3085
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:58,238
there is one drug in that kit of drugs

3086
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:01,198
that's

3087
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:04,079
very unusual like psilocybin lsd those

3088
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:06,799
promote heavy heavy serotonin release

3089
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,158
and lateralized connections ramp up etc

3090
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,199
matt talked about all that

3091
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:13,839
but mdma ecstasy

3092
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:14,799
is a very unusual situation where

3093
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,199
dopamine is

3094
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,639
very very high because of the the way

3095
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:20,399
the drug is designed

3096
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:22,079
dopamine release it goes through the

3097
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:23,920
roof so people feel

3098
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:25,118
great and they want to move and they

3099
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:27,600
have a lot of energy

3100
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:30,319
but serotonin levels are also high and

3101
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:34,079
that's a very unnatural state

3102
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:37,279
and why mdma may may and i want to

3103
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:39,439
highlight may have particularly

3104
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:41,279
high potential for the treatment of

3105
01:38:39,439 --> 01:38:43,919
certain forms of depression

3106
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:44,960
is an interesting question because never

3107
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,679
before in

3108
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,960
as far as we know in human history has

3109
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:51,279
there been

3110
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,880
a possibility of opening up dopaminergic

3111
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:54,559
and serotonergic states at the same time

3112
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,239
dopamine being the molecule pursuit and

3113
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:58,639
reward and more and more

3114
01:38:56,238 --> 01:39:00,079
and serotonin being one of bliss and

3115
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:01,440
being content right where you're at so

3116
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:03,198
it's almost like those two things wrap

3117
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:04,399
back on themselves and create this very

3118
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:06,399
unusual state

3119
01:39:04,399 --> 01:39:08,158
and i think the bigger conversation is

3120
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:11,198
what to do with a state like that

3121
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:12,960
like do you is it about self-love

3122
01:39:11,198 --> 01:39:15,118
is it about developing love for another

3123
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,279
person is it about forgetting hate

3124
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:19,118
like these are powerful molecules and i

3125
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:20,238
think if the academic community

3126
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:21,839
and the clinical community is going to

3127
01:39:20,238 --> 01:39:22,479
move forward with them in any serious

3128
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,239
way

3129
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:26,158
i think there needs to be a conversation

3130
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:29,359
about what

3131
01:39:26,158 --> 01:39:31,519
they're being used for right and and

3132
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:32,799
coupled with that i think similar to

3133
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,480
what you're saying

3134
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,840
like matt has talked about is others

3135
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:39,198
have talked about

3136
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:40,639
some of the biggest benefits of like

3137
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:42,799
progress whether it's like quitting

3138
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:45,520
smoking and all those kind of stuff

3139
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:47,520
is in the is in the days after it's the

3140
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,679
integration of the experience

3141
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,360
so maybe you open up the brain to the

3142
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:52,239
neuroplasticity but then there's like

3143
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:54,559
work to be done

3144
01:39:52,238 --> 01:39:55,839
it's not you're like you shake up

3145
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:58,239
something in it

3146
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,199
in the biology of the brain but you have

3147
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:01,519
to do then

3148
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:02,638
it's work absolutely now a friend of

3149
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:05,920
mine who's a

3150
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:08,079
physician he says um who's quite open to

3151
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,880
this idea that psychedelics could play a

3152
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:12,399
real role in in real medicine says

3153
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,319
better living through chemistry still

3154
01:40:12,399 --> 01:40:16,000
requires better living

3155
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:17,599
and and i think it's it's a beautiful

3156
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,960
statement i wish i had said it

3157
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,960
be um but he gets the credit but

3158
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,399
the plasticity window opens and then as

3159
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,760
you said what are you gonna do in the

3160
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:27,198
two weeks three weeks four weeks

3161
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:28,079
afterward because that's the real

3162
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:30,000
opportunity

3163
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:32,000
but those psychedelic experiences are

3164
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,600
really a case of an amplified experience

3165
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,960
inside of an amplified experience so

3166
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:38,400
much so that

3167
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:40,960
everything seems relevant and it's um

3168
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,839
it's it's fascinating i mean i my hope

3169
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:44,000
is that

3170
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,520
the ai and machine learning and the

3171
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,560
brain machine interface and all that

3172
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:49,520
will eventually be

3173
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:50,480
merged with the psychedelic treatments

3174
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:53,280
so that you

3175
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:54,879
an individual can go in take whatever

3176
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:56,000
amount of whatever's safe for them

3177
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,000
working with a clinician

3178
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,359
and really direct the plasticity while

3179
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,800
maybe stimulating

3180
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:02,639
the orbital frontal medial orbital

3181
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,639
frontal cortex or increasing the

3182
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,359
observer or decreasing the observer in

3183
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,359
the brain or

3184
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:09,198
decreasing the amygdala i mean it's

3185
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:11,118
doable it's doable with

3186
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:13,118
transcranial magnetic stimulation and

3187
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:15,198
it's for shutting down activity and it's

3188
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:16,719
doable with ultrasound ultrasound now

3189
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:19,039
allows very focal

3190
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:19,840
activation of particular brain regions

3191
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:22,000
through the skull

3192
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,360
non-invasively so it's approaching the

3193
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,600
same kind of uh

3194
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:27,359
therapy from different angles one ai is

3195
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:30,800
the computational side so

3196
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:31,198
injecting like the robotics injecting

3197
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,639
like

3198
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:35,678
maybe you can even think about it as

3199
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:38,159
like electricity the electrical approach

3200
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:39,760
versus then like the the chemical

3201
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:41,359
approach absolutely and then the psycho

3202
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,119
and then the psychology is

3203
01:41:41,359 --> 01:41:44,559
is subjective right so it's going to

3204
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:47,519
take some real

3205
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:48,400
um understanding of what that person's

3206
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,719
um

3207
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:52,559
lexicon is like you know that wasn't a

3208
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:55,439
pun

3209
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,719
i'm sorry it's terrible that's the one

3210
01:41:55,439 --> 01:41:57,279
thing i know from the feedback on my

3211
01:41:56,719 --> 01:41:58,800
podcast

3212
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:01,118
my jokes are terrible but i never

3213
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:03,760
claimed to be funny the

3214
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:04,559
the uh but somebody who they really

3215
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,960
trust

3216
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,000
and understands when somebody says you

3217
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,600
know

3218
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,600
for a very stoic person like i'm

3219
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,400
imagining you interviewed the great dan

3220
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,760
gable

3221
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:15,439
right i don't know anything about dan

3222
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,639
but can you imagine like you asked dan

3223
01:42:15,439 --> 01:42:18,158
like you know how you feel about

3224
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:18,800
something while on one of these drugs

3225
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:23,039
and like

3226
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:24,960
i mean his languaging might if he says

3227
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:26,639
that was troubling it might mean that it

3228
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,279
was very troubling or not troubling at

3229
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:30,319
all

3230
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:32,800
so people are language is a poor

3231
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:34,479
guide because if i say i'm upset how

3232
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:35,199
upset is that well that's very

3233
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:37,839
subjective

3234
01:42:35,198 --> 01:42:39,439
so you need we need can you build a tool

3235
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,239
for that can you build a ai tool for

3236
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:42,000
that yeah deeper

3237
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:44,799
yeah maybe that's the eye maybe that's

3238
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,479
our that's what the eyes could reveal

3239
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,920
so language is not just words it's

3240
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:49,919
everything together and that's

3241
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,840
one of the fascinating things about the

3242
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:54,239
eyes in the window to the soul i mean

3243
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,440
they express so much the face the eyes

3244
01:42:54,238 --> 01:42:57,599
the body

3245
01:42:55,439 --> 01:42:59,118
uh i mean lisa talks about that the

3246
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:02,239
communication of emotions

3247
01:42:59,118 --> 01:43:02,799
it's a super complex perhaps it's a bit

3248
01:43:02,238 --> 01:43:06,319
of a

3249
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:10,400
side fun tangent but matt

3250
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:14,079
matthew johnson brings up dmt

3251
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:16,960
and the experience of dmt is a as a

3252
01:43:14,079 --> 01:43:19,198
as from a scientific perspective just

3253
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:21,039
just a mystery in itself

3254
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:22,839
over its intensity what happens to the

3255
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:26,880
brain and of course

3256
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:29,440
joe rogan and others bring it up as a

3257
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,880
very different special kind of

3258
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:34,719
experience

3259
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:36,800
uh and elves seem to come up often

3260
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:38,239
i've never tried dmt what allows for a

3261
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,639
hallucinogenic states

3262
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:41,919
yes and it i mean dmt is a really

3263
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:43,760
interesting molecule

3264
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,359
there there are a lot of people

3265
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:49,600
experimenting now

3266
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:52,000
with um dmt um and

3267
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,639
they just the way they've described it

3268
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,880
is

3269
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:56,000
as a kind of a freight train through

3270
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,199
space and time

3271
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,960
very different than the way people

3272
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:00,158
describe lsd type experiences or

3273
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,319
psilocybin where

3274
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:04,158
time and space are very fluid but it

3275
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:07,519
tends to be a kind of a slower

3276
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:08,238
role if you will um so it's clear that

3277
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,639
dmt

3278
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:11,839
is tapping into a brain state that's

3279
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:14,960
distinctly different

3280
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:16,960
than the other psychedelics and

3281
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,880
and you mentioned jiu jitsu and these

3282
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:21,118
other communities i mean it's

3283
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:22,719
i think it's interesting because jiu

3284
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:24,238
jitsu is a non-verbal

3285
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:26,399
activity and people get together and

3286
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:27,759
talk about this non-verbal activity

3287
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:30,158
and they show great love for it in the

3288
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:32,719
same way that surfers you know i

3289
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:34,879
known some surfers in my time and they

3290
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:36,639
will get up at the crack of dawn

3291
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,079
and drive really really far to sit in

3292
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:40,719
the water and wait for this wave to come

3293
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:44,559
i have to imagine it's pretty fantastic

3294
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:45,840
i think that human beings now

3295
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,199
some of whom are in the scientific

3296
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,000
community are starting to feel

3297
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:50,319
comfortable enough

3298
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,158
to talk about some of these other loves

3299
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:54,158
and other endeavors because

3300
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:55,839
they do reveal a certain component about

3301
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:59,439
our underlying neurology

3302
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,960
i'm fascinated by the concept of

3303
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:04,158
wordlessness

3304
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:06,079
activities in which language is just not

3305
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:09,839
sufficient to capture

3306
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:11,760
and in which feel so vital as a reset as

3307
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,279
important as sleep you know i think

3308
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,400
that's one of the dangers of the phone

3309
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:15,920
is not that you're going to get into

3310
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:17,679
some online battle or that you're always

3311
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:18,960
staring at the phone is that it's a word

3312
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:20,880
so as we read things we're

3313
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:22,239
hearing the script in our head and i

3314
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:24,880
think getting into

3315
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:26,399
states where we are in a state of

3316
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:29,520
wordlessness

3317
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:30,079
is is very renewing and replenishing and

3318
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:33,040
just

3319
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:35,118
can feel amazing for and i believe also

3320
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:36,960
can help us tap into

3321
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:38,639
creative states and allow our neurology

3322
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:41,679
to access creative states

3323
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:45,279
and sleep is one such wordlessness

3324
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:47,199
period so one of the most interesting

3325
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:50,000
things to me are states that one can

3326
01:45:47,198 --> 01:45:51,198
approach in waking non-sleep depressed

3327
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,039
wordlessness

3328
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:54,719
through maybe it's jujitsu maybe it's

3329
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:56,479
for some people surfing maybe it's

3330
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:58,158
dancing maybe it's just i don't know

3331
01:45:56,479 --> 01:46:01,039
staring at a wall who knows

3332
01:45:58,158 --> 01:46:03,039
but where the language components of the

3333
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:05,279
brain are completely shut down

3334
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:06,479
and it has to be the case that drugs are

3335
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:09,439
no drugs

3336
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:10,079
that the brain is entering and starting

3337
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:12,000
to

3338
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:13,359
states and starting to use algorithms

3339
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,639
that are distinctly different than when

3340
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:16,319
we're trying to

3341
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:17,679
compose things in any kind of coherent

3342
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:19,279
way for someone else to understand

3343
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:20,880
there's no interest in anyone else

3344
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:22,238
understanding what you're experiencing

3345
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:25,359
in that moment

3346
01:46:22,238 --> 01:46:26,799
and that's beautiful and i think uh i

3347
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:27,599
think it's not just beautiful because it

3348
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,960
feels good

3349
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,119
i think it's beautiful because it's

3350
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:32,560
important and it's clearly fundamental

3351
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:34,960
to our neurology

3352
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,560
and your sense is there's a connection

3353
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,639
between dreams and dmt and like

3354
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:41,760
psychedelic like all of the

3355
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:44,079
uh you can you can understand one by

3356
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:46,159
studying the other so for example dreams

3357
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:47,118
are also very difficult to study right

3358
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:49,839
but they're

3359
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:51,679
more accessible it's safer to study and

3360
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,360
we're told we need to get more of it

3361
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:54,800
whereas with psychedelics there's this

3362
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:56,238
big question mark is it going to make

3363
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,480
everyone crazy

3364
01:46:56,238 --> 01:47:00,000
is it is it going to be legal i mean

3365
01:46:58,479 --> 01:47:02,718
it's kind of interesting how

3366
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
if one looks on instagram one could

3367
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:05,439
almost think that these drugs are

3368
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,719
already legal based on the way that

3369
01:47:05,439 --> 01:47:07,839
people commute but they're not yet

3370
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:09,359
they're still a lot of them are

3371
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:10,400
scheduled there's a lot of questions

3372
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:14,399
yeah uh

3373
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:17,839
i mean and but nevertheless it's like

3374
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:21,439
uh my my hope is that uh science

3375
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:23,199
opens up to these uh drugs a little bit

3376
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:24,399
more it's just i have this intuition

3377
01:47:23,198 --> 01:47:26,399
that

3378
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:28,399
like a lot of people share that they

3379
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:31,118
would be able to

3380
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:33,118
uh unlock a deeper understanding of our

3381
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:35,679
own mind it's it's any kind of

3382
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:38,399
same as studying dreams absolutely well

3383
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:41,279
creativity is in the non-linearities

3384
01:47:38,399 --> 01:47:43,279
right but productivity is in the

3385
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:43,599
implementation of linearities i mean

3386
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:45,840
that's

3387
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,199
that's what is absolutely clear this is

3388
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,679
why i think we were talking earlier

3389
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:49,439
about

3390
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:50,800
why a formal rigorous training in

3391
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:52,158
something where other people are looking

3392
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:53,920
at you and telling you no not good

3393
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:55,599
enough go back and do it again

3394
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,960
there's real value to that because

3395
01:47:55,600 --> 01:48:00,239
otherwise it's just ideas

3396
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:01,118
it's just vapors you know one thing that

3397
01:48:00,238 --> 01:48:04,319
matt mentioned

3398
01:48:01,118 --> 01:48:06,319
as the study that they're working on

3399
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:07,599
is as opposed to i think most of the

3400
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:10,639
psychedelic studies

3401
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:11,920
they've done is on how to treat

3402
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:13,279
different conditions

3403
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:16,079
and one of the things they're working on

3404
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:18,960
now is to try to do a study where

3405
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:19,600
uh for creatives for people that don't

3406
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,239
have a

3407
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,880
condition to try and treat but instead

3408
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:25,198
see how

3409
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,319
this how psychedelics can help you

3410
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:28,158
create so like

3411
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:29,840
goodness if you take creatives and you

3412
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:31,599
give them more psychedelics they're not

3413
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:34,239
gonna be able to get out of their room

3414
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:36,079
i don't know well but this is the i

3415
01:48:34,238 --> 01:48:38,399
maybe you can speak to that

3416
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:40,399
psychedelics or not or dreams or tools

3417
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:43,359
in general how to be better creatives

3418
01:48:40,399 --> 01:48:45,359
that's an interesting i don't often see

3419
01:48:43,359 --> 01:48:48,000
studies of this nature of like

3420
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:49,198
how to take high performance in the

3421
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,920
mental

3422
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:52,719
creative space and get them to perform

3423
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:55,600
even

3424
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,158
uh better so it's not average people

3425
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,800
it's like

3426
01:48:56,158 --> 01:49:00,960
masters of their craft like taking i

3427
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:03,039
mean his examples was taking an elon

3428
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,800
musk which is in the engineering space

3429
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:05,439
and maybe musicians and all that kind of

3430
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,480
stuff

3431
01:49:05,439 --> 01:49:11,759
and studying that that's a i mean that's

3432
01:49:08,479 --> 01:49:13,759
weird i usually the science

3433
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,800
the scientific exploration there has

3434
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,039
been done in

3435
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:19,039
uh by the musicians themselves as has

3436
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:21,679
been documented like jazz is like

3437
01:49:19,039 --> 01:49:22,158
all non-linearities yeah right but if

3438
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:23,760
it's

3439
01:49:22,158 --> 01:49:25,598
but the people still have to know how to

3440
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,880
play their instruments right right

3441
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:29,599
there's some early

3442
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,560
early skill building that's critical i

3443
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:32,079
mean

3444
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:33,599
when you mention someone like elon i

3445
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:35,439
mean virtual i mean he's already a

3446
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:36,319
virtuoso right because he and in so many

3447
01:49:35,439 --> 01:49:38,638
different domains

3448
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:40,079
i've never met him but it's it's clear

3449
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:41,920
right he

3450
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:43,599
it's not just that he's ambitious and

3451
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,239
bold and brave and all that it's all

3452
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:47,920
that

3453
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:49,598
and there's there's clearly

3454
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,039
a different way of looking at the same

3455
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:51,440
problems that everyone else is looking

3456
01:49:51,039 --> 01:49:52,960
at

3457
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:54,319
and people are probably banging their

3458
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:55,359
head against the refrigerator thinking

3459
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:57,359
like think differently things

3460
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:59,759
it doesn't work that way it involved

3461
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:01,439
there's a certain anxiety in

3462
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:03,760
for the i'm not talking about for elon

3463
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:06,158
but i don't have no idea

3464
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:08,480
but i think for somebody who's very

3465
01:50:06,158 --> 01:50:10,319
structured very regimented very linear

3466
01:50:08,479 --> 01:50:11,919
the anxiety comes from letting go of

3467
01:50:10,319 --> 01:50:13,920
those linearities

3468
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,760
and for the person that's very creative

3469
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,319
the anxiety comes from

3470
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,800
trying to impose linearities right the

3471
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:21,118
the

3472
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:22,239
really creative artist or musician

3473
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:23,679
they're they seem

3474
01:50:22,238 --> 01:50:25,919
nuts they seem like they can't get their

3475
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:27,520
life together because they can't

3476
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:29,440
and they you know we look at people who

3477
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:31,280
are kind of pseudo aspergers or

3478
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:31,759
aspergers or some forms of autism and

3479
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:33,840
they are

3480
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:36,320
so hyper linear but you take away those

3481
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:37,760
linearities and they freak out

3482
01:50:36,319 --> 01:50:40,559
and that's kind of the essence of some

3483
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:42,239
of those syndromes so i think that

3484
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:43,520
the ability to toggle back and forth

3485
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:44,559
between those states is what's

3486
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:45,840
remarkable i mean

3487
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:47,599
because we're here and we're having this

3488
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,719
discussion i mean steve jobs is a good

3489
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:50,319
example he

3490
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:52,560
probably the best example somebody who

3491
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:55,039
actually talked about his own process

3492
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:56,080
about the merging of art and science art

3493
01:50:55,039 --> 01:50:58,639
and engineering

3494
01:50:56,079 --> 01:50:59,920
humanities and science very few people

3495
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:02,239
can do that

3496
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,118
well i you seem to have a capacity to do

3497
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:05,919
that

3498
01:51:03,118 --> 01:51:07,039
like you you know poetry and you are a.i

3499
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,639
guy like you

3500
01:51:07,039 --> 01:51:10,158
there's nothing linear about poetry as

3501
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:12,319
far as i can tell i mean i

3502
01:51:10,158 --> 01:51:14,158
i do wonder just like we've been talking

3503
01:51:12,319 --> 01:51:15,679
about if there's any ways to push that

3504
01:51:14,158 --> 01:51:18,638
to its limits to

3505
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:18,960
explore further i don't like leaning

3506
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:20,480
this

3507
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,319
this is why i'm bothered there's not

3508
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:25,678
more science and psychedelics is

3509
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:29,840
i haven't done almost so i've

3510
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:32,480
eaten mushrooms a few times uh allegedly

3511
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,000
but that's it you know and i the reason

3512
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:34,879
i don't do more the reason i haven't

3513
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,439
done dmt

3514
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:37,920
is because it's illegal and it's like

3515
01:51:37,439 --> 01:51:41,039
not

3516
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:43,359
well studied and it you know i

3517
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:45,118
i'm in those things i'm not usually at

3518
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:47,839
the cutting edge but i'm very curious

3519
01:51:45,118 --> 01:51:50,158
and it feels like

3520
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:51,119
there could be tools to be discovered

3521
01:51:50,158 --> 01:51:54,399
there

3522
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:58,238
not for fun not for recreation but for

3523
01:51:54,399 --> 01:52:00,238
like encouraging whether you're a linear

3524
01:51:58,238 --> 01:52:01,678
thinking to go non-linear or it's

3525
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:03,759
non-linear to go linear

3526
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:04,880
like to to shake things up you mentioned

3527
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:06,880
dan gable

3528
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,560
the idea of dan gable on psychedelics is

3529
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:12,079
fascinating to me because

3530
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:14,320
he's such a control freak i mean

3531
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:16,238
that i would show up for that that would

3532
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:18,158
not show up for but like so much of

3533
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:18,559
these psychedelic experiences it feels

3534
01:52:18,158 --> 01:52:20,238
like

3535
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:21,840
is for letting go that's right you don't

3536
01:52:20,238 --> 01:52:24,559
want to resist but that's

3537
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:25,119
supposedly where the growth is in in

3538
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:28,080
giving

3539
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:29,198
oneself over to the process and that's

3540
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:31,679
for people who are

3541
01:52:29,198 --> 01:52:33,198
like master controllers he's one of the

3542
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:34,800
greatest coaches of all time it's

3543
01:52:33,198 --> 01:52:35,598
fascinating to see what that battle

3544
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:38,560
looks like

3545
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:39,199
of resistance and then of letting go uh

3546
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:42,560
yeah i mean

3547
01:52:39,198 --> 01:52:44,638
i i can't wait to uh to to see where

3548
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,360
these studies takes us what's clearly

3549
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:46,560
happening

3550
01:52:45,359 --> 01:52:47,759
you know i've asked there i have a

3551
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,199
couple colleagues at stanford who are

3552
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,520
doing animal studies

3553
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:52,879
i've asked around you know it's there's

3554
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:54,639
a lot of discussion

3555
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:56,719
in the neuroscience community about what

3556
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:59,760
the perception of a laboratory is

3557
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:02,319
if they work on psychedelics i mean

3558
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:04,079
i i have to tip my hat to the folks at

3559
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:06,319
hopkins they are pioneers

3560
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:07,920
and as um terry signowski he's a

3561
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:09,198
computational neuroscientist down at

3562
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,480
salk says i don't think he was the first

3563
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:12,399
person to say he says uh

3564
01:53:10,479 --> 01:53:13,598
you know how to spot the pioneers

3565
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:14,479
they're the ones with the arrows in

3566
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:17,039
their backs

3567
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:18,238
yeah and you know it's it's an unkind

3568
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:20,719
world

3569
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:22,638
to a scientist that's trying to do

3570
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:24,079
really cutting-edge stuff my colleague

3571
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:26,079
david spiegel who studies medical

3572
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:28,000
hypnosis it's he's got

3573
01:53:26,079 --> 01:53:29,840
dozens of studies now showing that

3574
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,760
hypnosis can be beneficial for pain

3575
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,480
management anxiety management cancer

3576
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:35,280
outcomes

3577
01:53:32,479 --> 01:53:36,718
it's finally you know at the point where

3578
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:38,319
there's so much data

3579
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:39,760
but people hear hypnosis and they think

3580
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:41,920
of stage hypnosis which is like the

3581
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:44,960
furthest thing from what he's doing

3582
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:47,920
and i think mind body

3583
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:51,118
type stuff hypnosis respiration and

3584
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:53,039
breathing i think the hard science

3585
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:55,839
walk into the problem is always going to

3586
01:53:53,039 --> 01:53:59,279
be best to get the community on board

3587
01:53:55,840 --> 01:54:01,279
and then it's up to people like matt and

3588
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:02,639
to really you know take it to the next

3589
01:54:01,279 --> 01:54:04,399
level and as i say not

3590
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,679
keysi out of the game because keysi

3591
01:54:04,399 --> 01:54:07,519
basically was taking

3592
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:09,520
too much of his own stuff and he started

3593
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,320
dressing crazy at banana hats and like

3594
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:12,800
you see him he had

3595
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:14,319
the magic bus so you know the day so

3596
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,440
like the day i start driving to work in

3597
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:17,840
the magic bus

3598
01:54:15,439 --> 01:54:19,039
that's the day i lose my job i'm not

3599
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,279
into buses or

3600
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:22,880
or wearing fruit but you're going to get

3601
01:54:21,279 --> 01:54:24,639
a phone call from me and i hope you do

3602
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:26,960
the same for me it's like

3603
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:28,319
like dude what are you doing well what's

3604
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,599
interesting earlier we're talking about

3605
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:30,479
the challenge with david that you're

3606
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:34,000
about to do

3607
01:54:30,479 --> 01:54:35,759
i mean that is a psychedelic experience

3608
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,079
of sorts because you're biasing your

3609
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,920
mind

3610
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:39,679
towards a pretty extreme neurochemical

3611
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,560
state and you don't know what you're

3612
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:42,079
going to find there

3613
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:44,080
and that's kind of the excitement at

3614
01:54:42,079 --> 01:54:45,359
least for me as an observer it's like i

3615
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:48,880
want to know

3616
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:50,960
what what the experience is like

3617
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:52,239
afterward i want to know like how was it

3618
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,439
i mean i'm sure you're going to get

3619
01:54:52,238 --> 01:54:55,118
something like you said you're going to

3620
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:56,638
grow the question is how and not

3621
01:54:55,118 --> 01:54:58,238
resisting i mean it's the same as with a

3622
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:01,359
psychedelic experience it's like

3623
01:54:58,238 --> 01:55:02,479
not like giving yourself over completely

3624
01:55:01,359 --> 01:55:03,839
to the experience and

3625
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:06,319
not resisting and going through the

3626
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:08,719
whole mental journey of whether it's

3627
01:55:06,319 --> 01:55:09,759
anger or excitement or exhaustion the

3628
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:13,118
whole thing

3629
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:16,480
it's uh i mean uh

3630
01:55:13,118 --> 01:55:18,559
that's in the entirety of the process

3631
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:18,959
that david goes through when he does his

3632
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,960
own

3633
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,079
challenges and so on is that whole

3634
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:25,359
journey he finds

3635
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:28,880
purposely like missile seeks

3636
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:31,439
the limits of the mind that whenever

3637
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:33,440
the resistance is felt runs up against

3638
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:35,598
it and then goes to the full journey of

3639
01:55:33,439 --> 01:55:36,479
going beyond it and seeing what's there

3640
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:38,079
on the other side

3641
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:39,598
well stress has these two sides the

3642
01:55:38,079 --> 01:55:41,599
limbic friction of being

3643
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,440
tired and needing to get more energized

3644
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:45,360
that's one form of stress

3645
01:55:43,439 --> 01:55:46,799
and then there's the feeling too amped

3646
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:48,479
up and needing to calm down

3647
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:50,000
the the typical discussion around

3648
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:52,000
stresses is one thing

3649
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,439
but it's all limbic friction it's just

3650
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,960
that when i say lymbic friction

3651
01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:56,638
that's not a real scientific term i just

3652
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,319
mean the limbic system wanting to pull

3653
01:55:56,639 --> 01:55:59,279
you down into sleep or wanting to put

3654
01:55:58,319 --> 01:56:02,000
you into panic

3655
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:02,479
and you using top-down processing using

3656
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,599
that

3657
01:56:02,479 --> 01:56:07,839
evolved forebrain to say

3658
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:08,960
i'm not going to go to sleep and i'm not

3659
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,800
going to freak out

3660
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:14,000
and those top-down control mechanisms

3661
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:16,239
are i mean when those get honed

3662
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,920
that's beautiful because then you real

3663
01:56:16,238 --> 01:56:19,519
you're increasing capacity for

3664
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:22,319
everything

3665
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:23,679
you uh this month on the podcast you're

3666
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:25,118
talking about neuroplasticity you

3667
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:27,279
mentioned a bunch already

3668
01:56:25,118 --> 01:56:28,158
is there something you're looking

3669
01:56:27,279 --> 01:56:30,479
forward to

3670
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:31,439
specifically like something maybe you're

3671
01:56:30,479 --> 01:56:33,439
fascinated

3672
01:56:31,439 --> 01:56:34,559
by that jumps to mind about

3673
01:56:33,439 --> 01:56:37,439
neuroplasticity

3674
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:38,960
this fascinating property of the brain

3675
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:40,638
yeah i think that

3676
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:42,079
it's clear there's one facet of

3677
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:44,880
neuroplasticity that

3678
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:45,279
is very well supported by the research

3679
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:47,920
data

3680
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:48,800
that hardly anyone has implemented in

3681
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:50,560
the real world

3682
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:52,079
and that's the release of acetylcholine

3683
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,520
from these neurons in the forebrain

3684
01:56:52,079 --> 01:56:55,840
called nucleus basalis

3685
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:57,199
this is mainly the work of mike murzenik

3686
01:56:55,840 --> 01:56:58,960
who used to be at ucsf

3687
01:56:57,198 --> 01:57:01,118
and some of his scientific offspring

3688
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:03,198
greg reckenzone and michael kilgaard and

3689
01:57:01,118 --> 01:57:05,759
others what they showed was

3690
01:57:03,198 --> 01:57:07,519
increases in acetylcholine this molecule

3691
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:10,239
associated with focus

3692
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:11,119
in concert meaning at the same time as

3693
01:57:10,238 --> 01:57:14,399
some

3694
01:57:11,118 --> 01:57:18,399
event motor event or music event or

3695
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:20,719
any kind of sensory event immediately

3696
01:57:18,399 --> 01:57:22,638
reorganizes the neocortex so that

3697
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:24,480
there's a permanent map representation

3698
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:26,880
of that event and i

3699
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:27,759
i absolutely believe that this can be

3700
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:30,400
channeled toward

3701
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:31,760
accelerated skill learning and my friend

3702
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:34,559
and colleague eddie chang is

3703
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:36,480
now the chair of neurosurgery at ucsf

3704
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,599
but also a fine scientist in his own

3705
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:40,238
right

3706
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:42,560
not just a clinician he's doing studies

3707
01:57:40,238 --> 01:57:44,079
looking at rapid acquisition of language

3708
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:45,679
using these principles he trained with

3709
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:47,439
mersnick

3710
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:48,800
it's clear we have these gates on

3711
01:57:47,439 --> 01:57:51,359
plasticity in the forebrain

3712
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:52,719
and they are gated by nicotinic

3713
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:55,519
acetylcholine

3714
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:56,000
transmission and why that hasn't made it

3715
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:58,400
into

3716
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,760
protocols for motor learning sport

3717
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:00,319
learning language learning music

3718
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:02,800
learning

3719
01:58:00,319 --> 01:58:04,158
emotional learning i don't know i think

3720
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:06,239
part of the reason has been

3721
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:07,679
kind of cultural is that scientists

3722
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:08,959
publish their paper and they move on

3723
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:11,039
merzianic

3724
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:13,039
talked a lot and still can be found from

3725
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:15,359
time to time talking about

3726
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:16,560
how these plasticine mechanisms can be

3727
01:58:15,359 --> 01:58:18,799
leveraged

3728
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:20,480
but uh he had a commercial company and

3729
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,920
so then people kind of backed away from

3730
01:58:20,479 --> 01:58:24,079
it a little bit i think he was

3731
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,118
to be honest i think merzenik was ahead

3732
01:58:24,079 --> 01:58:27,599
of his time

3733
01:58:25,118 --> 01:58:29,598
and i think the timing is right now for

3734
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:31,520
people to understand these mechanisms of

3735
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:32,880
plasticity and start to implement them

3736
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:35,040
also you know it all sounds like

3737
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,840
becoming superhuman or optimizing or

3738
01:58:35,039 --> 01:58:37,920
whatever

3739
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:39,840
all that yes but also what about kids

3740
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:40,880
with language learning deficits or with

3741
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,679
dyslexia

3742
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:44,880
or just performance in school in general

3743
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:47,118
you know i have a deep

3744
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:48,880
interesting concern for the future of

3745
01:58:47,118 --> 01:58:50,639
science and mathematics and

3746
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,239
in not just in this country but all over

3747
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:54,800
the world and

3748
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:56,079
more plasticity equals faster better

3749
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:58,400
deeper learning

3750
01:58:56,079 --> 01:59:00,000
and if we don't do this i don't think

3751
01:58:58,399 --> 01:59:01,920
we're going to get the full

3752
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,039
reach out of all the machine learning

3753
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:04,800
tools either

3754
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:07,198
because everyone talks about these huge

3755
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:09,520
data sets and but those huge data sets

3756
01:59:07,198 --> 01:59:11,039
funnel into human interpretation i mean

3757
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:12,320
we don't just like stare at the numbers

3758
01:59:11,039 --> 01:59:15,679
and bask right

3759
01:59:12,319 --> 01:59:17,679
so some the human brain i think needs to

3760
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:19,440
leverage these plasticity mechanisms to

3761
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:20,960
keep up with the thing that's happening

3762
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:21,598
very very fast which is technology

3763
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:24,000
development

3764
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:26,079
so that's a long-winded way of saying

3765
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,960
basal forebrain cholinergic transmission

3766
01:59:26,079 --> 01:59:29,118
and plasticity

3767
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:30,158
it allows for plasticine adulthood and

3768
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:31,839
allows for it in

3769
01:59:30,158 --> 01:59:33,198
single trial learning which is

3770
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:36,239
incredible

3771
01:59:33,198 --> 01:59:38,319
but how do we leverage that like in the

3772
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:42,238
physical space taking actions or is

3773
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:42,238
there some chemicals that can stimulate

3774
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:46,639
stimulate neuroplasticity like what i

3775
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:48,320
think it's the intersection of the two

3776
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:50,800
i think it's being engaged in a physical

3777
01:59:48,319 --> 01:59:52,799
practice while enhancing pharmacology

3778
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:54,560
it has to be done safely and this is

3779
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,199
full of open questions this is the very

3780
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:57,840
beginning

3781
01:59:55,198 --> 01:59:58,799
of it like you're saying yeah a pill

3782
01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:00,639
that's safe

3783
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:01,840
that increases nicotinic transmission i

3784
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:03,679
mean i know a number of people that

3785
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:05,520
chew nicorette actually they have an i

3786
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:08,399
have a nobel prize winning colleague

3787
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:10,000
at columbia not to be named um who

3788
02:00:08,399 --> 02:00:11,759
choose like six pieces of nicaragua in a

3789
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,520
half hour conversation with him

3790
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:16,159
and he started doing that as a

3791
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:18,800
replacement for smoking because smoking

3792
02:00:16,158 --> 02:00:21,198
is nicotine nicotinic stimulation of the

3793
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:23,199
cholinergic system so smokers have long

3794
02:00:21,198 --> 02:00:23,919
known that increases focus and attention

3795
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:26,079
and learning

3796
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:26,960
it's just that the lung cancer thing is

3797
02:00:26,079 --> 02:00:28,479
a barrier

3798
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,960
now i'm not suggesting people take

3799
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:33,519
nicorette but it's clear that we need

3800
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:34,800
better directed pharmacology but you can

3801
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,520
imagine next time you go in for a

3802
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:37,920
learning bout

3803
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:39,679
if it's really essential you might want

3804
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:42,000
to stimulate the nicotinic system

3805
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:43,599
if that's safe for you again i'm a

3806
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,679
doctor so again i'm not telling people

3807
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:47,440
to do this but that's where it's going

3808
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:49,840
until we start merging machines with

3809
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:52,158
pharmacology and behavior

3810
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:54,319
it's it we're just kind of walking

3811
02:00:52,158 --> 02:00:57,519
around in the circle over and over again

3812
02:00:54,319 --> 02:01:01,359
and it's going to happen do you find

3813
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:03,840
computer vision machine learning

3814
02:01:01,359 --> 02:01:06,399
from the perspective of tooling as an

3815
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:08,719
interesting tool for

3816
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:10,879
analyzing for processing all the data

3817
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:13,840
from the neuroscience world from the

3818
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:15,359
neurobiology biology the camera ever all

3819
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:17,039
the different data sets that you can

3820
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:20,880
have about the mind the eye

3821
02:01:17,039 --> 02:01:23,359
the everything that's neck and above

3822
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:24,639
and also the central nervous system

3823
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:26,799
absolutely i mean

3824
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:28,560
i think that computer science and

3825
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:31,920
engineering and chemistry

3826
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:32,560
bioengineering is that's what's creating

3827
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,920
the

3828
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:36,080
acceleration and progress in

3829
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:38,560
neuroscience right now i think

3830
02:01:36,079 --> 02:01:39,679
it's actually one place where science

3831
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:43,119
i'm very reassured

3832
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:44,639
science has invited in psychologists

3833
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:46,399
computational biologists at least at

3834
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:48,719
stanford mit and

3835
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:51,359
other places too of course it's clear

3836
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:52,000
that it's a everyone's invited kind of

3837
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:54,799
party

3838
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:56,238
right now the the major issue in the

3839
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:57,599
field of neuroscience at least

3840
02:01:56,238 --> 02:01:59,678
through my view is that there's no

3841
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:01,279
conceptual leadership no one is saying

3842
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:02,639
we need to work on and solve this

3843
02:02:01,279 --> 02:02:05,840
problem or that problem

3844
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:08,239
it's very fragmented right now now the

3845
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:09,760
good news is people are communicating so

3846
02:02:08,238 --> 02:02:11,439
computer scientists and people who work

3847
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,520
on ai machine vision are talking to

3848
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:16,079
biologists and vice versa

3849
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:17,920
but it's very dispersed is there a lot

3850
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:19,599
of different data sets like

3851
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:21,840
in your work that you've just come

3852
02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:24,079
across is a huge

3853
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:26,079
number of disparate data sets around

3854
02:02:24,079 --> 02:02:27,760
neuroscience and so on or

3855
02:02:26,079 --> 02:02:30,079
well there's a lot of cell sequencing

3856
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:32,639
stuff so the broad over it you know

3857
02:02:30,079 --> 02:02:34,319
on in boston and then on this coast the

3858
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:37,679
chen zuckerberg initiative

3859
02:02:34,319 --> 02:02:39,198
um what you know um they did you know

3860
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:41,599
three billion dollars to

3861
02:02:39,198 --> 02:02:43,118
sequence every cell type in humans and

3862
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:45,039
in animals and try and

3863
02:02:43,118 --> 02:02:46,319
i think their goal is to cure every

3864
02:02:45,039 --> 02:02:48,079
disease by

3865
02:02:46,319 --> 02:02:50,479
some date i don't know in the in the

3866
02:02:48,079 --> 02:02:50,479
future

3867
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:54,719
huge data sets of gene expression and

3868
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:57,520
protein expression

3869
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:59,760
that's valuable i think no one really

3870
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:02,800
knows how to think about neural circuits

3871
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:05,360
and what what is a neural circuit um

3872
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:06,480
is it one structure is it two structures

3873
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:08,719
communicating

3874
02:03:06,479 --> 02:03:10,000
i think this is where i actually think

3875
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:13,520
that the robotics

3876
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:15,439
is going to tell us how the brain works

3877
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,920
because it it's tempting to think that

3878
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:20,158
the brain has all these cell types

3879
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:21,039
and circuits in order to solve specific

3880
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:22,399
problems but

3881
02:03:21,039 --> 02:03:24,479
it might be that the fundamental

3882
02:03:22,399 --> 02:03:25,679
algorithm is to create cells and

3883
02:03:24,479 --> 02:03:28,158
circuits that can solve

3884
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:30,158
variable problems we know in the retina

3885
02:03:28,158 --> 02:03:31,598
just a very simple example is that

3886
02:03:30,158 --> 02:03:33,359
we've always heard about like cones are

3887
02:03:31,599 --> 02:03:35,039
for color vision and high acuity and

3888
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:38,799
rods are for night vision and

3889
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:39,599
and non-color vision but at the dusk

3890
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:42,000
dawn

3891
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:43,279
transition certain cell types switch to

3892
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,479
do completely different have a

3893
02:03:43,279 --> 02:03:46,238
completely different function for

3894
02:03:44,479 --> 02:03:48,559
viewing starry night versus

3895
02:03:46,238 --> 02:03:50,000
what they do during the daytime so

3896
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:52,560
neurons multiplex

3897
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,679
and i think building machines that can

3898
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:56,480
multiplex

3899
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:58,078
and can evolve themselves is going to

3900
02:03:56,479 --> 02:03:58,559
help us really understand what the brain

3901
02:03:58,078 --> 02:04:00,479
is doing

3902
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:02,480
we need to tease out the fundamental

3903
02:04:00,479 --> 02:04:03,839
algorithms we know they're like motion

3904
02:04:02,479 --> 02:04:05,118
detection and

3905
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:06,560
spatial vision and things like that i

3906
02:04:05,118 --> 02:04:08,158
think machines are going to be much

3907
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:11,360
faster at that than

3908
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:13,519
our understanding of biology and how the

3909
02:04:11,359 --> 02:04:15,118
brain does that

3910
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:16,639
basically i'll be out of a job and

3911
02:04:15,118 --> 02:04:17,118
people like you will have a job no well

3912
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:19,679
no though

3913
02:04:17,118 --> 02:04:20,960
i think the main idea is that uh there

3914
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:23,599
won't be a job

3915
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:24,319
that's machine learning or computer

3916
02:04:23,599 --> 02:04:27,279
vision it's just

3917
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:27,599
it's a it's a tool that neuroscientists

3918
02:04:27,279 --> 02:04:30,719
will

3919
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:32,480
use more and more and more and uh

3920
02:04:30,719 --> 02:04:34,078
biologists would use i mean this whole

3921
02:04:32,479 --> 02:04:38,399
idea that it will just be a

3922
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:40,559
a tool that allows you to start

3923
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:41,519
expanding the kind of things you can

3924
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,440
study

3925
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:44,719
and well the next generation coming up i

3926
02:04:43,439 --> 02:04:46,719
can say this because i now i'm

3927
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:48,800
blessed to have a bioengineering student

3928
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:51,439
they think about problems so differently

3929
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:53,279
than biologists do we realized the other

3930
02:04:51,439 --> 02:04:54,719
day we both came up with a set of ideas

3931
02:04:53,279 --> 02:04:55,439
around a certain project and we realized

3932
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:57,279
that

3933
02:04:55,439 --> 02:04:59,279
her version of it was the exact opposite

3934
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:00,479
of mine you know and hers was far

3935
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:02,238
far more rational it's just an

3936
02:05:00,479 --> 02:05:02,638
engineering perspective like why would

3937
02:05:02,238 --> 02:05:04,879
we

3938
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:06,880
do that last we should do that first i

3939
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:09,039
think that the next generation is

3940
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:10,960
really interested in solving practical

3941
02:05:09,039 --> 02:05:12,960
problems so a lot like computer science

3942
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:13,599
and engineering was in the late 90s it

3943
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:15,760
was like

3944
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:16,960
you can go do a phd in computer science

3945
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:18,239
and engineering maybe

3946
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:20,000
or you go work for a company and

3947
02:05:18,238 --> 02:05:21,439
actually build stuff that's useful

3948
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,800
i think neuroscientists and people

3949
02:05:21,439 --> 02:05:23,678
interested in neuroscience are starting

3950
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:25,599
to think

3951
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:27,760
how can i build stuff that's useful and

3952
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:28,800
this statement is supported by the fact

3953
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:30,880
that many

3954
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:32,000
people in my business leave their

3955
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:33,359
academic labs

3956
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,639
fortunately not all of them but they

3957
02:05:33,359 --> 02:05:36,319
leave their academic labs and they go

3958
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:38,880
work for companies

3959
02:05:36,319 --> 02:05:40,158
like neural link like neural link this

3960
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:44,800
is something i think with

3961
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:47,519
we've spoken a few times offline about

3962
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:48,079
as speaking of computer vision i'm

3963
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,159
fascinated

3964
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:51,359
by the eye i did a bunch of work on the

3965
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:53,039
eye so from

3966
02:05:51,359 --> 02:05:55,118
there's the neuroscientist there's a

3967
02:05:53,039 --> 02:05:56,639
neurobiology way of studying the eye

3968
02:05:55,118 --> 02:05:58,799
and there's the computer vision way of

3969
02:05:56,639 --> 02:06:00,319
studying the eye and the computer vision

3970
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:02,960
way of studying the eye of just like

3971
02:06:00,319 --> 02:06:04,880
observing non-contact sensing of humans

3972
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:06,639
is really fascinating to me in studying

3973
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:07,279
human behavior in different contexts

3974
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:10,078
like

3975
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:12,078
in semi-autonomous vehicles it seemed

3976
02:06:10,078 --> 02:06:15,118
like there is a lot of signal that comes

3977
02:06:12,078 --> 02:06:17,039
from the eye that comes from blinking

3978
02:06:15,118 --> 02:06:19,198
that's not fully understood yet it's

3979
02:06:17,039 --> 02:06:20,000
been in the lab it's been used quite a

3980
02:06:19,198 --> 02:06:22,559
bit

3981
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,000
to study like the dilation of the pupil

3982
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:27,280
all those kinds of things are used

3983
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:29,679
for to uh to infer workload

3984
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:31,039
cognitive load all those kinds of things

3985
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:33,760
but the pictures

3986
02:06:31,039 --> 02:06:35,439
is murky it's not completely well

3987
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:37,280
understood especially in the wild

3988
02:06:35,439 --> 02:06:39,919
how much signal you can get from the eye

3989
02:06:37,279 --> 02:06:44,238
from the human face

3990
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:45,440
i've downloaded joe rogan's all the

3991
02:06:44,238 --> 02:06:48,879
podcasts he's ever done

3992
02:06:45,439 --> 02:06:51,839
video you have the youtube bank

3993
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:52,800
i have the youtube bank for for a reason

3994
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:56,400
that

3995
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:58,960
this was before he went with spotify

3996
02:06:56,399 --> 02:07:00,319
it you own the archive there's pubmed

3997
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:01,840
and then there's the joe rogan

3998
02:07:00,319 --> 02:07:04,880
experience owned by

3999
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:05,920
or maintained by lex yeah privately for

4000
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:08,480
my private

4001
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:09,118
collection no the reason i did it uh and

4002
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:11,118
i did the

4003
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:12,639
really like rigorous processing of it

4004
02:07:11,118 --> 02:07:15,920
which is like

4005
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:16,880
the i extracted all of the faces i did

4006
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,960
the really good

4007
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:19,920
blink track of the pupil tracking and

4008
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:22,800
the blink

4009
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:23,599
detection for the entirety that are oh i

4010
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:26,719
should say it's

4011
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:28,639
from episode like i forget what it is

4012
02:07:26,719 --> 02:07:31,679
but it's like episode 900 when

4013
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:33,440
they switched to 1080p video but it was

4014
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:35,118
like much crappier videos so

4015
02:07:33,439 --> 02:07:37,198
it's still kind of long when there was

4016
02:07:35,118 --> 02:07:38,000
marijuana consumption or when they were

4017
02:07:37,198 --> 02:07:41,118
drinking

4018
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:43,039
when they're i mean there's like

4019
02:07:41,118 --> 02:07:44,158
just it won't throw off the data but

4020
02:07:43,039 --> 02:07:47,439
it's relevant to the

4021
02:07:44,158 --> 02:07:50,479
the relatively competitive data

4022
02:07:47,439 --> 02:07:52,078
so let's just put it uh this way there's

4023
02:07:50,479 --> 02:07:53,598
a lot of fascinating computer vision

4024
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:57,039
problems involved but

4025
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:59,119
i only kept long sequences of data

4026
02:07:57,039 --> 02:08:00,319
where the eyes detected exceptionally

4027
02:07:59,118 --> 02:08:02,880
well

4028
02:08:00,319 --> 02:08:04,078
and uh i also removed people that were

4029
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:06,800
wearing glasses

4030
02:08:04,078 --> 02:08:08,559
i removed there are certain people that

4031
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:12,800
have a way

4032
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:16,880
of uh moving their eyes

4033
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:20,400
and squinting where it's harder to infer

4034
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:23,359
uh like concrete blinks

4035
02:08:20,399 --> 02:08:24,879
you know they'll kind of have a squint

4036
02:08:23,359 --> 02:08:28,238
the whole time

4037
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:31,679
and their blink is very light it's very

4038
02:08:28,238 --> 02:08:32,799
tough to know what's uh uh what's an

4039
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:35,039
actual bling so

4040
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:36,400
you got those baseball cap wearing guys

4041
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:38,078
yeah there are certain people that go on

4042
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:40,078
podcasts and wear baseball caps and

4043
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:41,519
and don't reveal their i don't know if

4044
02:08:40,078 --> 02:08:43,279
they realize it or not until

4045
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:44,800
it comes out but their face is

4046
02:08:43,279 --> 02:08:46,719
completely obscured from

4047
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:48,480
vision and from a computer vision

4048
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:51,198
perspective people that wear

4049
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:52,559
makeup and usually women on their eyes

4050
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:55,439
it complicates things

4051
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:55,679
like eyelashes all complicated things so

4052
02:08:55,439 --> 02:08:57,519
i

4053
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:59,279
you know you can clean stuff up just so

4054
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:01,520
you have really crisp signal

4055
02:08:59,279 --> 02:09:02,559
you don't have to you can you can deal

4056
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:04,000
with issues but

4057
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:06,480
you know there's so many hours of joe

4058
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,760
rogan video anyway i say all that

4059
02:09:06,479 --> 02:09:10,559
because i was

4060
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:11,920
searching for an interesting personal

4061
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:15,440
experiment for me because

4062
02:09:11,920 --> 02:09:15,760
uh i saw in drivers when i was looking

4063
02:09:15,439 --> 02:09:17,759
at

4064
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:19,199
eye movement and drivers it seemed to

4065
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:21,039
indicate

4066
02:09:19,198 --> 02:09:23,279
there seemed to be quite a lot of signal

4067
02:09:21,039 --> 02:09:26,238
there that indicates

4068
02:09:23,279 --> 02:09:28,800
amount of cognitive load but it's not

4069
02:09:26,238 --> 02:09:30,879
clear if there's something conclusive

4070
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:32,800
but if there is some signal that's a

4071
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:33,920
really powerful one because eye movement

4072
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:36,320
can be detected

4073
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:38,319
in the wild like you and i sitting here

4074
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:40,639
i can detect eye movement really well

4075
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:42,559
pupil dilation is a really crappy

4076
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:44,560
indicator and it's luminance dependent

4077
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:47,199
like if i turn toward a light it's

4078
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:48,960
it's a route it people change size

4079
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:50,479
depending on level of alertness arouse

4080
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:51,760
autonomic browser but also overall

4081
02:09:50,479 --> 02:09:54,799
levels of luminance

4082
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:56,400
it's very very hard but there are

4083
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:58,159
i mean you're sitting on a on a gold

4084
02:09:56,399 --> 02:10:00,879
mine um because

4085
02:09:58,158 --> 02:10:01,759
the there is a lot of interest right now

4086
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:03,760
in

4087
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:05,679
measuring state through non-contact

4088
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:07,440
sensing yes uh heart rate variability

4089
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:08,880
through changes in skin tone

4090
02:10:07,439 --> 02:10:10,559
but just off a camera can you imagine

4091
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:11,920
that at the point where you just look at

4092
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:13,360
some video and you're like oh they're

4093
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:15,039
they're getting more stressed or worked

4094
02:10:13,359 --> 02:10:16,559
up and they're not based on a heat map

4095
02:10:15,039 --> 02:10:17,679
of some little patch on their face

4096
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:19,360
because everyone's gonna

4097
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:20,880
have this slight you know sort of um

4098
02:10:19,359 --> 02:10:22,319
compartmentalize it slightly differently

4099
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:23,599
but you can learn it pretty quickly

4100
02:10:22,319 --> 02:10:24,719
we know this when someone's like giving

4101
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:25,440
a talk and we see them starting it

4102
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:27,520
blotching

4103
02:10:25,439 --> 02:10:28,559
on their on their neck you know this is

4104
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:31,280
the like uh

4105
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:32,000
the thesis defense response right we

4106
02:10:31,279 --> 02:10:34,479
know it and we're

4107
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:37,359
it's a stressful situation because if

4108
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:39,359
not passing your thesis defense is rough

4109
02:10:37,359 --> 02:10:40,719
and you can see that but cameras can

4110
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:42,799
pick that up really easily

4111
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:44,719
at much lower levels than the the

4112
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:48,239
blatant blotching kind of effect

4113
02:10:44,719 --> 02:10:49,920
and eye movements certainly are powerful

4114
02:10:48,238 --> 02:10:50,879
indications of the state of the

4115
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:52,960
autonomic

4116
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:54,560
system so what do you do you think there

4117
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:56,158
are things

4118
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,920
from a high level that you can pick up

4119
02:10:56,158 --> 02:11:00,078
from eye movement and and

4120
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:00,960
blinking well blink frequency is gonna

4121
02:11:00,078 --> 02:11:04,719
increase

4122
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:06,158
as people get tired right um i i've

4123
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:07,679
actually been teased a lot online

4124
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:08,559
because i don't blink much when i'll do

4125
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:10,399
a post

4126
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:11,840
and i and so i did a whole post about

4127
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:12,319
blinking about the science of blinking

4128
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:14,719
there's some

4129
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:15,759
data very strong data not from my lab

4130
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:17,359
that showed that

4131
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:18,880
every time you blink it resets your

4132
02:11:17,359 --> 02:11:21,439
perception of time they have people

4133
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:22,960
do these kind of track uh kind of a

4134
02:11:21,439 --> 02:11:24,719
doppler like thing and

4135
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:26,158
anyway blinking resets your perception

4136
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:27,359
of time and there's a dopaminergic

4137
02:11:26,158 --> 02:11:28,960
mechanism in a

4138
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:30,399
in the blink-related circuitry of the

4139
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:31,599
brain uh

4140
02:11:30,399 --> 02:11:33,039
when people are very alert they tend to

4141
02:11:31,599 --> 02:11:34,400
not blink very much when we're sleepy we

4142
02:11:33,039 --> 02:11:36,078
tend to blink more and our eyes

4143
02:11:34,399 --> 02:11:38,000
tend to close now some people are more

4144
02:11:36,078 --> 02:11:40,078
hooded in there the way their eyes

4145
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,599
sit some people are like this all the

4146
02:11:40,078 --> 02:11:43,039
time there are some very famous people

4147
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:44,880
i'm not going to name them because i

4148
02:11:43,039 --> 02:11:46,880
might run into them at some point who

4149
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:48,560
are like accused of being sociopaths

4150
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:49,920
because they don't blink very often

4151
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:51,760
but they might just have high levels of

4152
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:52,319
autonomic arousal they just don't blink

4153
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:54,480
very much

4154
02:11:52,319 --> 02:11:55,840
yeah also depends on how lubricated the

4155
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:58,319
eyes are so i think within

4156
02:11:55,840 --> 02:12:00,319
individual yes you can get a lot of

4157
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:01,840
information i don't think we can say

4158
02:12:00,319 --> 02:12:03,759
this person's blinking a lot they're

4159
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:05,039
lying this person or they're tired this

4160
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:08,480
person doesn't blink

4161
02:12:05,039 --> 02:12:10,399
they're they're stressed i think if you

4162
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:12,238
understand that person's baseline you

4163
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:13,839
can get it and presumably

4164
02:12:12,238 --> 02:12:15,118
uh well having been on the joe rogan

4165
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:16,319
experience i can say when you first sit

4166
02:12:15,118 --> 02:12:16,880
down there if you've never been in there

4167
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:19,439
before

4168
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:20,639
you're in my data set by the way oh my

4169
02:12:19,439 --> 02:12:22,559
well i bet you i i

4170
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:24,239
i will admit to being you know first

4171
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,719
time being sitting down there i mean joe

4172
02:12:24,238 --> 02:12:26,399
was

4173
02:12:24,719 --> 02:12:28,319
incredibly gracious made me feel very

4174
02:12:26,399 --> 02:12:30,238
comfortable there but yeah it's a

4175
02:12:28,319 --> 02:12:32,078
it's an intense experience um it's a

4176
02:12:30,238 --> 02:12:33,678
small space too anytime you enter a

4177
02:12:32,078 --> 02:12:37,920
small space from a big space

4178
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:39,199
in this old studio you're familiar with

4179
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:41,118
there's a breaking in period where

4180
02:12:39,198 --> 02:12:43,519
you're getting to know somebody and so

4181
02:12:41,118 --> 02:12:45,279
i'm sure my levels of autonomic arousal

4182
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:47,679
front of the podcast were higher than

4183
02:12:45,279 --> 02:12:50,078
later so but once you have a baseline

4184
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:50,800
established you can get a lot of data on

4185
02:12:50,078 --> 02:12:53,118
somebody

4186
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:54,639
simply from blinks um some people

4187
02:12:53,118 --> 02:12:56,319
averting gays too

4188
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:58,000
if you have both people that's really

4189
02:12:56,319 --> 02:13:00,238
powerful this is the holy grail

4190
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:01,520
another holy grail of neuroscience we've

4191
02:13:00,238 --> 02:13:03,439
mainly looked at subjects

4192
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:05,920
in isolation absolutely there hasn't

4193
02:13:03,439 --> 02:13:08,479
been much brain imaging of two people in

4194
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:10,560
interacting or even in animal models of

4195
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:11,118
two mice or two monkeys interacting it's

4196
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:13,599
all like

4197
02:13:11,118 --> 02:13:14,399
a person scanner bite bar i mean if

4198
02:13:13,599 --> 02:13:16,078
you've ever been in one of these

4199
02:13:14,399 --> 02:13:18,559
scanners like in a bite bar

4200
02:13:16,078 --> 02:13:20,719
it's very medieval and so you think in

4201
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:22,639
the interaction there's actually

4202
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:24,800
you can almost study them as a single

4203
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:26,159
brain or as a single system the two

4204
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:28,079
brains are a single system

4205
02:13:26,158 --> 02:13:29,598
i think with ai highly correlated yeah

4206
02:13:28,078 --> 02:13:30,319
maybe are your blinks triggering my

4207
02:13:29,599 --> 02:13:32,719
blinks like

4208
02:13:30,319 --> 02:13:35,118
you know or your non-blink epochs you

4209
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:37,439
know extending my non-blink epochs

4210
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:39,920
there's a fascinating space to explore

4211
02:13:37,439 --> 02:13:42,719
there and no one's done it

4212
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:44,319
and because everyone let the joe rogan

4213
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:46,078
experience archive disappear

4214
02:13:44,319 --> 02:13:47,679
except for you you've grabbed did you

4215
02:13:46,078 --> 02:13:48,639
get the comments too because i think the

4216
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:49,840
comments were

4217
02:13:48,639 --> 02:13:51,679
almost as entertaining as the

4218
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:53,440
conversation you know what you just made

4219
02:13:51,679 --> 02:13:54,960
me realize with the couplings i have a

4220
02:13:53,439 --> 02:13:57,118
better data set than the joe rogan

4221
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:59,439
podcast with high resolution video which

4222
02:13:57,118 --> 02:14:01,920
is the raw video for this podcast

4223
02:13:59,439 --> 02:14:03,359
so for example both cameras right now

4224
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:06,319
are recording you and i

4225
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:08,078
full full feed the final result will

4226
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:08,960
switch cameras back and forth but i have

4227
02:14:08,078 --> 02:14:11,118
the full feed

4228
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:12,560
right so i can have the blinking for

4229
02:14:11,118 --> 02:14:15,118
both you and i the whole time

4230
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:16,320
i bet you people trigger blanks and in

4231
02:14:15,118 --> 02:14:18,639
one another

4232
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:20,238
you know and there's also like the the

4233
02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:21,920
simplest way to think about the blinks

4234
02:14:20,238 --> 02:14:24,399
and the attentional thing and the

4235
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:25,359
alertness is two fighters in the in the

4236
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:26,879
standoff

4237
02:14:25,359 --> 02:14:28,719
there's this whole lore around who

4238
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:29,440
blinks first yeah it's like they blink

4239
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:30,639
first well

4240
02:14:29,439 --> 02:14:32,479
what are what are we really asking

4241
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:33,440
they're asking whether or not one person

4242
02:14:32,479 --> 02:14:36,638
can maintain

4243
02:14:33,439 --> 02:14:39,519
focus longer than the other person

4244
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:40,960
which is an important parameter it's not

4245
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:43,040
the only parameter but

4246
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:44,560
it's an important parameter and so that

4247
02:14:43,039 --> 02:14:46,639
blinking contest even though they don't

4248
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:48,880
square off as a blinking contest

4249
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:49,760
it's well known that the first to blink

4250
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,760
is revealing

4251
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:53,520
something about their capacity to hold

4252
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:56,079
attention

4253
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:57,520
you've started an amazing podcast that

4254
02:14:56,078 --> 02:14:59,679
we mentioned a few times

4255
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:01,040
uh people should definitely check it out

4256
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:05,199
it's called the human

4257
02:15:01,039 --> 02:15:08,880
lab podcast it uh it does your

4258
02:15:05,198 --> 02:15:11,118
it's basically you it embodies

4259
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:12,480
the personality of andrew huberman which

4260
02:15:11,118 --> 02:15:15,839
is like

4261
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:19,759
makes science accessible um

4262
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:23,440
but also uh fascinating

4263
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:27,280
and giving it like what do you call it

4264
02:15:23,439 --> 02:15:29,839
you give tools for everyday life meaning

4265
02:15:27,279 --> 02:15:32,000
it kind of grounds in like what the hell

4266
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:34,560
does this mean for my life

4267
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,000
but then also does the beauty of science

4268
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:39,280
at the same time so i

4269
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,800
love i love both the the rigor and the

4270
02:15:39,279 --> 02:15:41,920
openness of the whole thing plus the

4271
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,800
whole corrections things that we

4272
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:46,078
mentioned

4273
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:47,440
anyway what's uh been the hardest part

4274
02:15:46,078 --> 02:15:51,198
of this whole process

4275
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:54,238
you're one of already one of

4276
02:15:51,198 --> 02:15:57,598
the only and one of the best

4277
02:15:54,238 --> 02:15:58,559
science podcasters out there so in that

4278
02:15:57,599 --> 02:16:00,078
process

4279
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:01,599
what's been the hardest what's been the

4280
02:16:00,078 --> 02:16:04,158
most exciting part

4281
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:05,679
well well first of all thanks for the

4282
02:16:04,158 --> 02:16:06,879
kind words about the podcast it was

4283
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:10,000
inspired by you

4284
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:13,118
i i absolutely it's um

4285
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:14,719
that's no bs i the last time we met to

4286
02:16:13,118 --> 02:16:16,319
do an interview for your podcast we

4287
02:16:14,719 --> 02:16:17,439
talked a little bit about it and you

4288
02:16:16,319 --> 02:16:20,479
gave me the

4289
02:16:17,439 --> 02:16:22,000
um subtle nudge that maybe there was a

4290
02:16:20,479 --> 02:16:23,598
there was a podcast there and i thought

4291
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,039
about it and i left and i was just like

4292
02:16:23,599 --> 02:16:26,400
i gotta do this thing and

4293
02:16:25,039 --> 02:16:28,960
you really gave me the encouragement to

4294
02:16:26,399 --> 02:16:30,158
do it now your podcast this podcast has

4295
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:34,159
really forged the way

4296
02:16:30,158 --> 02:16:36,239
you've been tip of the spear on serious

4297
02:16:34,159 --> 02:16:38,398
scientific intellectual yet fun

4298
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:41,599
accessible conversation and so

4299
02:16:38,398 --> 02:16:44,718
i as your colleague and

4300
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:45,760
friend and but i just even if those

4301
02:16:44,718 --> 02:16:47,759
things weren't true like

4302
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:49,599
this this podcast was and is the

4303
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:52,960
inspiration there's no question so much

4304
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:55,040
yeah i really like 100 percent and

4305
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:56,879
when i decided to do the podcast the

4306
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:58,080
huberman lab podcast i thought really

4307
02:16:56,879 --> 02:16:59,358
long and hard about what

4308
02:16:58,079 --> 02:17:01,280
would work best and would be most

4309
02:16:59,359 --> 02:17:02,079
beneficial turned out to be the hardest

4310
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:04,880
thing

4311
02:17:02,079 --> 02:17:06,718
which is to stay on a single topic for

4312
02:17:04,879 --> 02:17:08,558
three or four or more episodes before

4313
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:12,159
switching to a new topic

4314
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:15,039
because i know from the experience of

4315
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:15,760
university and teaching in university as

4316
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:18,719
you know

4317
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:20,639
as well that there's always the

4318
02:17:18,718 --> 02:17:22,959
temptation to pivot to something else

4319
02:17:20,638 --> 02:17:24,159
but the drilling into something really

4320
02:17:22,959 --> 02:17:26,959
deeply is where the

4321
02:17:24,159 --> 02:17:28,318
where the gems reside and the the

4322
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:29,919
challenge has been

4323
02:17:28,318 --> 02:17:32,398
how to make it interesting how to keep

4324
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:34,318
people on board how to give people tools

4325
02:17:32,398 --> 02:17:36,239
along the way

4326
02:17:34,318 --> 02:17:37,519
but also stay close to the scientific

4327
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:38,959
data um

4328
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:41,040
i like to think that we're headed in the

4329
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:44,079
right direction it still needs to evolve

4330
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:47,599
but that's been a challenge

4331
02:17:44,079 --> 02:17:49,200
i think i also am challenged by the fact

4332
02:17:47,599 --> 02:17:50,639
that there's a tremendous range of

4333
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:53,439
backgrounds of listeners

4334
02:17:50,638 --> 02:17:53,759
so some people have asked for more names

4335
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:55,200
like

4336
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:57,439
more bits and parts of the nervous

4337
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:58,479
system and cellular molecular mechanisms

4338
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:00,000
and all that kind of thing

4339
02:17:58,478 --> 02:18:01,519
and other people said i don't understand

4340
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,638
any of that stuff but i think i'm

4341
02:18:01,519 --> 02:18:04,239
keeping up and so

4342
02:18:02,638 --> 02:18:06,079
unlike a university course where there

4343
02:18:04,239 --> 02:18:07,439
are prerequisites and everyone's coming

4344
02:18:06,079 --> 02:18:08,239
to the table with more or less the same

4345
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:10,079
knowledge

4346
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:11,760
i have a very limited sense of what the

4347
02:18:10,079 --> 02:18:13,439
audience knows and doesn't know

4348
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:15,679
so that's why i incorporated the feature

4349
02:18:13,439 --> 02:18:18,800
of the comment section on youtube

4350
02:18:15,679 --> 02:18:21,280
being a source of feedback and i

4351
02:18:18,799 --> 02:18:23,039
do a kind of an office hours like

4352
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:23,840
episode every third or fourth episode

4353
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:26,160
where i address

4354
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:27,280
common questions and i think that the

4355
02:18:26,159 --> 02:18:29,679
podcast space

4356
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:31,599
in my mind um at least for the sort of

4357
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:35,439
podcast i'm doing

4358
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:37,280
needed a venue for the listeners to be a

4359
02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:39,120
more integral part of the experience as

4360
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:40,319
opposed to just commenting on what they

4361
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:41,760
liked or didn't like

4362
02:18:40,318 --> 02:18:43,279
so while i like to hear what people

4363
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:44,079
liked and didn't like i also really like

4364
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:46,239
to hear about

4365
02:18:44,079 --> 02:18:47,599
hey tell me more about temperature

4366
02:18:46,239 --> 02:18:48,959
minimums and how they can be used to

4367
02:18:47,599 --> 02:18:50,159
phase shift circadian rhythms or

4368
02:18:48,959 --> 02:18:51,759
whatever it is

4369
02:18:50,159 --> 02:18:54,159
and i realized that i'm probably losing

4370
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:56,639
some people along the way but hopefully

4371
02:18:54,159 --> 02:18:57,439
at the end of each month and because of

4372
02:18:56,638 --> 02:18:59,438
the way that the

4373
02:18:57,439 --> 02:19:00,559
episodes are archived people will come

4374
02:18:59,439 --> 02:19:02,000
away feeling

4375
02:19:00,558 --> 02:19:03,599
as if they've learned a ton and they

4376
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,959
have tools that they can implement

4377
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:07,599
and perhaps most importantly that

4378
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:09,518
they're starting to think scientifically

4379
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:10,639
about the tons of other stuff that's out

4380
02:19:09,519 --> 02:19:12,639
there

4381
02:19:10,638 --> 02:19:14,398
so that's been the challenge and it's

4382
02:19:12,638 --> 02:19:17,199
still really early days

4383
02:19:14,398 --> 02:19:18,558
but um and and of course there's also an

4384
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:19,359
intentional challenge i realize that

4385
02:19:18,558 --> 02:19:21,438
people are busy

4386
02:19:19,359 --> 02:19:23,920
not everyone has two hours to listen to

4387
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:26,719
a podcast about jet lag and shift work

4388
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:28,079
and raising kids and sleep and that kind

4389
02:19:26,718 --> 02:19:29,759
of thing i'm not raising kids but i did

4390
02:19:28,079 --> 02:19:30,318
a whole thing about babies and sleep

4391
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:31,920
with

4392
02:19:30,318 --> 02:19:33,760
you know and how parents can manage

4393
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:37,040
their sleep when kids aren't sleeping

4394
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:37,840
so it's been um i'm hacking through the

4395
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:40,080
jungle of

4396
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:41,359
all this stuff but and i'll come right

4397
02:19:40,079 --> 02:19:45,519
back to i

4398
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:48,720
my inspiration and my my my uh

4399
02:19:45,519 --> 02:19:52,159
north star on this is

4400
02:19:48,719 --> 02:19:54,159
getting to a point where the audience

4401
02:19:52,159 --> 02:19:56,239
that listens to this feels the same way

4402
02:19:54,159 --> 02:19:58,239
that i do when i listen to your podcast

4403
02:19:56,239 --> 02:19:59,520
thank you so much like when i tune into

4404
02:19:58,239 --> 02:20:00,879
your podcast i'm gonna embarrass you a

4405
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:02,960
little bit more by complimenting you a

4406
02:20:00,879 --> 02:20:05,920
little bit more um

4407
02:20:02,959 --> 02:20:06,478
but not out of a sadistic thing but just

4408
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:08,559
because

4409
02:20:06,478 --> 02:20:09,679
when i tune into your podcast or joe's

4410
02:20:08,559 --> 02:20:11,359
podcast

4411
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:13,680
i have the same sensation that other

4412
02:20:11,359 --> 02:20:16,318
people have like i feel like

4413
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:17,280
i'm home of sorts i'm like i'm familiar

4414
02:20:16,318 --> 02:20:19,519
with the space

4415
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:21,120
and i'd like people to feel comfortable

4416
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:23,200
in the space that is the hubert lab

4417
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:26,000
podcast whatever that ends up being

4418
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:27,600
yeah that's the magic of podcasting it's

4419
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,159
like i feel like i'm part of your life

4420
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:33,040
now in a way that as a fan

4421
02:20:30,159 --> 02:20:33,920
that i wouldn't be otherwise and you

4422
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:36,000
know like

4423
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:37,200
i never was able to have that with carl

4424
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:40,079
sagan for example

4425
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:40,720
you know uh and that's a whole nother

4426
02:20:40,079 --> 02:20:43,120
level

4427
02:20:40,719 --> 02:20:44,159
of connection with a human being that

4428
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:47,200
gets you excited

4429
02:20:44,159 --> 02:20:50,799
and then i share your excitement about

4430
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:54,640
uh different topics in neuroscience or

4431
02:20:50,799 --> 02:20:56,239
just uh biology in general

4432
02:20:54,639 --> 02:20:58,398
and then i don't have to actually

4433
02:20:56,239 --> 02:21:01,439
understand everything you're saying

4434
02:20:58,398 --> 02:21:03,279
to uh to really enjoy it so

4435
02:21:01,439 --> 02:21:05,439
that that's the magic of podcasting is

4436
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:06,960
like you can go through like 10 minutes

4437
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:08,239
not understanding what the hell a person

4438
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:11,438
is saying

4439
02:21:08,239 --> 02:21:12,959
and then you uh enjoy the excitement

4440
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:15,200
and then you reconnect to a thing that

4441
02:21:12,959 --> 02:21:19,119
you do understand what they're saying

4442
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:22,000
and you know that's uh that personal

4443
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:23,840
coupled with the scientific rigor is

4444
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:25,920
magic and finding the right

4445
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:27,840
it's exploration like joe found

4446
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:29,200
something that works for comedians which

4447
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:31,280
is like

4448
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:32,720
you know having a good laugh but also

4449
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:36,399
every once in a while

4450
02:21:32,719 --> 02:21:40,079
talking seriously about difficult topics

4451
02:21:36,398 --> 02:21:43,119
the scientific space it was unclear i

4452
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:44,959
you haven't had guests on not yet but uh

4453
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:46,640
maybe you'll come on as a that's right

4454
02:21:44,959 --> 02:21:48,079
i'm just gonna invite my i was gonna try

4455
02:21:46,639 --> 02:21:50,079
to follow myself

4456
02:21:48,079 --> 02:21:52,000
i am i'm officially inviting you now

4457
02:21:50,079 --> 02:21:55,520
will you come on the podcast

4458
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:57,600
fantastic but it was it was hard

4459
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:59,600
it's still a little bit difficult to

4460
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:01,359
tell people

4461
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:03,760
that no you don't get it we're not going

4462
02:22:01,359 --> 02:22:05,920
to talk for 10 minutes

4463
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:07,200
we're going to talk for three or four

4464
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:09,760
hours

4465
02:22:07,200 --> 02:22:10,960
it's a different for scientists for like

4466
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:12,239
they're like what i

4467
02:22:10,959 --> 02:22:14,159
don't what are we going to talk about

4468
02:22:12,239 --> 02:22:18,318
they think it's like the npr interview

4469
02:22:14,159 --> 02:22:20,239
yes and they don't realize first of all

4470
02:22:18,318 --> 02:22:21,760
i think at his best if you're like at

4471
02:22:20,239 --> 02:22:22,959
the level of joe rogan

4472
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:25,600
who i think is an excellent

4473
02:22:22,959 --> 02:22:27,679
conversationalist

4474
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:29,600
it you just lose track of time it can be

4475
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:30,239
three four five hours and you lose track

4476
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:32,960
of time

4477
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:34,000
i'm still not there i find that it's

4478
02:22:32,959 --> 02:22:35,358
still painful

4479
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,680
like the conversation is still

4480
02:22:35,359 --> 02:22:39,359
challenging sometimes you don't lose

4481
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:41,040
quite as much of track of time it's

4482
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:42,159
still an intellectual effort and i think

4483
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:43,760
it might always be

4484
02:22:42,159 --> 02:22:45,680
as it would be with you because you're

4485
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:48,159
talking about difficult topics

4486
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:48,800
maybe that require more brand you're not

4487
02:22:48,159 --> 02:22:50,799
just

4488
02:22:48,799 --> 02:22:52,639
shooting the [ __ ] with like a brian red

4489
02:22:50,799 --> 02:22:53,358
band or somebody like comedians or just

4490
02:22:52,639 --> 02:22:56,239
joking

4491
02:22:53,359 --> 02:22:57,359
what's like uh remember those shows um

4492
02:22:56,239 --> 02:22:59,119
like where

4493
02:22:57,359 --> 02:23:00,720
those shows where someone would come out

4494
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:02,319
and like spin plates and they're running

4495
02:23:00,719 --> 02:23:04,799
back and forth

4496
02:23:02,318 --> 02:23:05,600
really good scientific discussion is

4497
02:23:04,799 --> 02:23:07,920
like that

4498
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:09,520
you have to be maintaining three or four

4499
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:10,639
different logical arguments and jumping

4500
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:12,239
back and forth

4501
02:23:10,639 --> 02:23:13,760
it's occasionally getting to like a real

4502
02:23:12,239 --> 02:23:16,719
streak of linearity

4503
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:17,760
but as we found today that typically

4504
02:23:16,719 --> 02:23:19,039
there's three or four different things

4505
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:21,040
that we're bouncing back and forth

4506
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:23,120
and that requires a lot of updating of

4507
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:23,439
these you know forebrain circuits it's

4508
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:25,760
not

4509
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:28,000
it's not a passive listening experience

4510
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:28,639
but i like to think that the brain likes

4511
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,920
that

4512
02:23:28,639 --> 02:23:33,920
i i do want to ask just because we all i

4513
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:36,960
don't want to forget

4514
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:40,559
the the question came up to me is your

4515
02:23:36,959 --> 02:23:41,039
podcast has the same kind of rigor that

4516
02:23:40,559 --> 02:23:43,600
i

4517
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:46,720
think like a dan carlin podcast has a

4518
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:48,720
history podcaster well that's a

4519
02:23:46,719 --> 02:23:50,159
definitely a compliment thank you it's a

4520
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:51,840
handstand way

4521
02:23:50,159 --> 02:23:53,280
you know he's something for me to aspire

4522
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:55,600
to so he goes through

4523
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:58,239
hell to prepare he spends months

4524
02:23:55,600 --> 02:24:00,079
preparing it feels like

4525
02:23:58,239 --> 02:24:01,920
you've had to really prepare for your

4526
02:24:00,079 --> 02:24:06,398
podcast i definitely

4527
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:09,040
prepare hard how does that are you okay

4528
02:24:06,398 --> 02:24:09,519
yeah i mean how much effort does that

4529
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:11,439
take

4530
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:13,760
it feels like a conference presentation

4531
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:15,200
yeah so we record once a week and in the

4532
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:18,800
intervening time

4533
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:18,800
i listen to

4534
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:23,439
many university level lectures so nih

4535
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:26,398
has a

4536
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:28,880
a bank of lectures i have some sources

4537
02:24:26,398 --> 02:24:30,959
of recorded university seminars

4538
02:24:28,879 --> 02:24:33,039
i'm trying to find the the points of

4539
02:24:30,959 --> 02:24:34,478
intersection so like for four episodes

4540
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:36,800
on sleep it's not like i'm gonna

4541
02:24:34,478 --> 02:24:38,000
just regurgitate a popular book or take

4542
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:39,759
one lecture and just

4543
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:41,200
you know poach the content i'm gonna

4544
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:44,478
find the overlap

4545
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:45,040
in the different elements i also so what

4546
02:24:44,478 --> 02:24:48,079
i'll do is

4547
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:50,479
i'll generally read 10 or 15

4548
02:24:48,079 --> 02:24:51,920
papers and generally those are good

4549
02:24:50,478 --> 02:24:53,599
reviews annual reviews

4550
02:24:51,920 --> 02:24:55,359
interview of neuroscience annual review

4551
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:57,120
of physiology those kinds of things

4552
02:24:55,359 --> 02:24:58,960
i'll chase a few references i'll listen

4553
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:00,399
to some youtube videos but of university

4554
02:24:58,959 --> 02:25:02,559
level lectures

4555
02:25:00,398 --> 02:25:04,559
and then i throw all that on a

4556
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:05,600
whiteboard usually while i work out in

4557
02:25:04,559 --> 02:25:07,279
the morning

4558
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:09,200
i'll just be working out i have a gym in

4559
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:10,640
my house and i'll just put up

4560
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:12,240
all these random ideas i want to cover

4561
02:25:10,639 --> 02:25:13,920
that dreams hallucination

4562
02:25:12,239 --> 02:25:15,600
and then i take that and i start

4563
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:17,280
eliminating i draw lines between the

4564
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:20,079
common points of intersection

4565
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:21,200
and then from that i i distill out an

4566
02:25:20,079 --> 02:25:24,239
outline

4567
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,880
and then i basically think about what i

4568
02:25:24,239 --> 02:25:27,920
want to say

4569
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:29,358
on my walks with my dog and i bother a

4570
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:30,478
couple people and blabbed to them so i

4571
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:33,600
would say each podcast

4572
02:25:30,478 --> 02:25:36,159
yeah i put in 10 to 15 hours at least of

4573
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:37,040
passive listening preparation and maybe

4574
02:25:36,159 --> 02:25:39,920
five or six of

4575
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:40,720
active preparation so i do prepare quite

4576
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:43,200
a lot

4577
02:25:40,719 --> 02:25:43,760
but it has a certain reward component

4578
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:46,000
for me

4579
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:48,000
i to come up at the end with something

4580
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:50,799
that's somewhat crystallized

4581
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,318
for me is just so satisfying it feels

4582
02:25:50,799 --> 02:25:54,398
like there's something about my dopamine

4583
02:25:52,318 --> 02:25:57,600
circuits that just love that

4584
02:25:54,398 --> 02:25:59,199
and uh the the only pain is that a year

4585
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:00,880
later after i've talked about the stuff

4586
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:02,560
a bunch of times it's so much more

4587
02:26:00,879 --> 02:26:04,398
succinct

4588
02:26:02,559 --> 02:26:06,559
but that's life you you know at some

4589
02:26:04,398 --> 02:26:09,119
point you got to pull the trigger well

4590
02:26:06,559 --> 02:26:10,478
i don't know what you think but for me

4591
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:12,479
youtube

4592
02:26:10,478 --> 02:26:14,239
is uh that's why i'm sad that joe left

4593
02:26:12,478 --> 02:26:16,239
youtube there's a

4594
02:26:14,239 --> 02:26:18,559
archival nature to youtube that's kind

4595
02:26:16,239 --> 02:26:21,760
of magical so i'm really glad you're now

4596
02:26:18,559 --> 02:26:23,680
you're you you're uh

4597
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:25,280
doing a lot of educational content on

4598
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:28,479
instagram before

4599
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:29,040
but now on doing this podcast thing on

4600
02:26:28,478 --> 02:26:31,358
youtube

4601
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:32,319
i it's like a you know it's like feynman

4602
02:26:31,359 --> 02:26:34,479
lectures

4603
02:26:32,318 --> 02:26:35,760
like well that's very no i'm not saying

4604
02:26:34,478 --> 02:26:37,920
every podcast right

4605
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:39,680
but there will be there you will have

4606
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:40,719
some i could already tell there will be

4607
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:44,079
some

4608
02:26:40,719 --> 02:26:47,199
lectures which are like

4609
02:26:44,079 --> 02:26:49,840
definitive like really special ones

4610
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:52,240
that's the hope and the there's some

4611
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:54,719
aspect that's archival to youtube where

4612
02:26:52,239 --> 02:26:56,559
at least i hope like 20 years from now

4613
02:26:54,719 --> 02:26:59,679
some kid is going to watch

4614
02:26:56,559 --> 02:27:01,519
uh watch a lecture yours and um

4615
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:03,439
you know it'll it'll create the next

4616
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:06,720
nobel prize right it'll create

4617
02:27:03,439 --> 02:27:08,559
it'll create another uh you know a dream

4618
02:27:06,719 --> 02:27:10,639
that then becomes a reality and that

4619
02:27:08,559 --> 02:27:12,799
that's a that's a special thing

4620
02:27:10,639 --> 02:27:14,000
that um that youtube provides i'm really

4621
02:27:12,799 --> 02:27:16,239
excited that you're on youtube

4622
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:17,359
and at the same time i'm excited to see

4623
02:27:16,239 --> 02:27:21,680
where this thing goes

4624
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:23,520
because um it seems like change is the

4625
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:27,120
uh the cliche thing the change is the

4626
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:29,840
only constant in these times because

4627
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:30,319
you're paving uh with this podcast with

4628
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:31,760
this

4629
02:27:30,318 --> 02:27:34,239
creativity what you were doing on

4630
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:34,800
instagram as well you're paving the new

4631
02:27:34,239 --> 02:27:37,439
era

4632
02:27:34,799 --> 02:27:39,358
of what it means to do science so

4633
02:27:37,439 --> 02:27:41,760
actively doing research

4634
02:27:39,359 --> 02:27:44,399
and actively explaining that research in

4635
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:47,120
new media it's it's very interesting

4636
02:27:44,398 --> 02:27:49,119
inspired and genuinely inspired by you

4637
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:52,240
we we had this discussion last time

4638
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:54,479
after the podcast recording and it was

4639
02:27:52,239 --> 02:27:55,600
it's clear that communication of science

4640
02:27:54,478 --> 02:27:58,719
cannot be left

4641
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:59,920
to the the existing institutions and i'm

4642
02:27:58,719 --> 02:28:00,799
gonna talk about universities i just

4643
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:03,600
mean that the

4644
02:28:00,799 --> 02:28:05,759
science section of newspapers is

4645
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:08,800
sometimes there's some gems there but

4646
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:11,280
generally it goes you know and yeah i

4647
02:28:08,799 --> 02:28:12,959
think you really have to know a field

4648
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:15,439
in order to extract the best things from

4649
02:28:12,959 --> 02:28:17,279
that field and my hope is that other

4650
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:19,040
practicing scientists and people

4651
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:20,560
finishing their phd in postdoc and

4652
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:22,000
people who are running labs or working

4653
02:28:20,559 --> 02:28:23,359
at companies will start to do this

4654
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:25,359
i mean how amazing would it be for

4655
02:28:23,359 --> 02:28:28,720
instance if if someone

4656
02:28:25,359 --> 02:28:31,040
at neural link was

4657
02:28:28,719 --> 02:28:32,719
giving us hints about not necessarily

4658
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:35,439
what they're developing because that's

4659
02:28:32,719 --> 02:28:36,079
complicated for all sorts of reasons but

4660
02:28:35,439 --> 02:28:39,040
would

4661
02:28:36,079 --> 02:28:40,079
talk to us about what the real

4662
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:42,560
challenges of

4663
02:28:40,079 --> 02:28:43,840
building futuristic brain machine

4664
02:28:42,559 --> 02:28:46,000
interface are like and

4665
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:47,760
and what the what it means to understand

4666
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,478
a clinical problem and address it i mean

4667
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:49,680
i

4668
02:28:48,478 --> 02:28:51,679
my hope is somebody there might

4669
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:52,479
eventually do that that somebody in the

4670
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:55,200
world of

4671
02:28:52,478 --> 02:28:56,719
um chemistry or synthetic materials or

4672
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:58,159
whatever it is we'll do this in a way

4673
02:28:56,719 --> 02:28:58,478
that i could understand because i don't

4674
02:28:58,159 --> 02:29:01,359
have

4675
02:28:58,478 --> 02:29:02,159
expertise in those i think it would be

4676
02:29:01,359 --> 02:29:04,239
marvelous

4677
02:29:02,159 --> 02:29:05,840
and um your tip of the spear you were

4678
02:29:04,239 --> 02:29:08,959
out first and

4679
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:10,639
i'm just uh happily trying to

4680
02:29:08,959 --> 02:29:12,318
to move along in the direction i'm going

4681
02:29:10,639 --> 02:29:15,519
but i i think the future of science

4682
02:29:12,318 --> 02:29:17,519
education is online

4683
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:19,600
and i think that's going to be scary to

4684
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:20,399
a lot of existing institutions but it's

4685
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:22,000
not about

4686
02:29:20,398 --> 02:29:24,000
disrupting anything it's just about

4687
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:28,239
trying to do things better yeah

4688
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:30,079
you know some of the best interviews

4689
02:29:28,239 --> 02:29:32,318
uh some of the best investigative

4690
02:29:30,079 --> 02:29:33,200
journalism is done by people inside the

4691
02:29:32,318 --> 02:29:35,199
field

4692
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:37,439
uh comes to mind a guy by the name of

4693
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:39,680
elon musk who

4694
02:29:37,439 --> 02:29:41,920
who uh i love the the possibility that

4695
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:44,000
he gets the pulitzer for that interview

4696
02:29:41,920 --> 02:29:45,359
but uh he grilled the crap out of vlad

4697
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,120
the uh ceo of

4698
02:29:45,359 --> 02:29:48,399
uh robin hood i'm not sure if you know

4699
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:50,000
on um

4700
02:29:48,398 --> 02:29:51,680
on the clubhouse clubhouse the other

4701
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,840
night yeah i saw you guys in there

4702
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:55,840
i was kept out i wasn't quick enough my

4703
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:57,040
thumbs don't go fast enough so i was and

4704
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,359
i wasn't about to sit in the waiting

4705
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:58,880
room

4706
02:29:57,359 --> 02:30:00,559
have you tried that social network by

4707
02:29:58,879 --> 02:30:02,879
the way the clubhouse i've gone in there

4708
02:30:00,559 --> 02:30:04,799
a few times and checked some things out

4709
02:30:02,879 --> 02:30:07,839
i'm there i have a few questions about

4710
02:30:04,799 --> 02:30:10,398
it that um like if i'm in there

4711
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:11,439
how one can participate or not

4712
02:30:10,398 --> 02:30:13,119
participate i

4713
02:30:11,439 --> 02:30:14,639
i like being a fly on the wall for those

4714
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:15,920
conversations i've been very curious as

4715
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:17,760
to what's going on in there oh

4716
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:19,680
it's quite i mean i have a lot of

4717
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:20,880
thoughts i've maybe it's useful to

4718
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:24,159
comment

4719
02:30:20,879 --> 02:30:26,799
i also have a discord server uh that uh

4720
02:30:24,159 --> 02:30:28,159
you know has a few tens of thousands of

4721
02:30:26,799 --> 02:30:31,759
people on it and then

4722
02:30:28,159 --> 02:30:34,799
they have also a voice chat capability

4723
02:30:31,760 --> 02:30:35,840
so they have these get-togethers and i i

4724
02:30:34,799 --> 02:30:38,719
was using in

4725
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:41,439
in the spring and summer like actively

4726
02:30:38,719 --> 02:30:43,438
uh on those voice discussions and it's

4727
02:30:41,439 --> 02:30:44,880
anywhere from 10 to like a thousand

4728
02:30:43,439 --> 02:30:47,280
people

4729
02:30:44,879 --> 02:30:48,239
all together in voice like you you

4730
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:50,560
anyone can speak

4731
02:30:48,239 --> 02:30:52,239
anytime right but there's this weird

4732
02:30:50,559 --> 02:30:54,159
dynamic that people stay quiet

4733
02:30:52,239 --> 02:30:55,760
only one person speaks at a time because

4734
02:30:54,159 --> 02:30:57,439
they're all like respectful and it's the

4735
02:30:55,760 --> 02:31:00,159
community of like

4736
02:30:57,439 --> 02:31:01,760
uh like fundamentally respectful people

4737
02:31:00,159 --> 02:31:04,799
even though they're all anonymous

4738
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:06,960
so like except like me and a few others

4739
02:31:04,799 --> 02:31:08,159
it's all anonymous people so interesting

4740
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:12,000
and it works it's

4741
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:15,439
but the the magical thing to me about

4742
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:19,600
that community was how intimate

4743
02:31:15,439 --> 02:31:22,639
voice only communication can be it felt

4744
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:25,760
as intimate as like a

4745
02:31:22,639 --> 02:31:27,599
like a small get-together at a home with

4746
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:29,760
close friends

4747
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:31,520
it felt like there's a calmness to it

4748
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:34,318
and you're revealing

4749
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:35,359
things about you know somebody suffering

4750
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:38,159
from depression

4751
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:39,840
or being suicidal so those are the dark

4752
02:31:38,159 --> 02:31:41,119
things or being super excited getting a

4753
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:44,159
new girlfriend or

4754
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:46,800
boyfriend like just the the depth of

4755
02:31:44,159 --> 02:31:47,680
human experience shared on voice without

4756
02:31:46,799 --> 02:31:49,840
video

4757
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:51,920
is uh i was really surprised how

4758
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:53,520
intimate that is for human connection

4759
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:55,120
especially in this time of kobe to

4760
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:57,359
replace that so that

4761
02:31:55,120 --> 02:31:58,479
so that so just to give you some context

4762
02:31:57,359 --> 02:32:00,000
there's something there

4763
02:31:58,478 --> 02:32:01,840
there there's definitely something there

4764
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,359
one thing that comes to mind is

4765
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:05,040
when like in clubhouse you have your

4766
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:06,239
little icon so they don't actually you

4767
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:08,720
don't see your face moving

4768
02:32:06,239 --> 02:32:10,359
i think when people see their own image

4769
02:32:08,719 --> 02:32:11,920
it puts them in a state of

4770
02:32:10,359 --> 02:32:14,079
self-consciousness that

4771
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:15,280
is eliminated by just having an icon or

4772
02:32:14,079 --> 02:32:18,398
an avatar yes

4773
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:20,640
right so like zoom is dreadful

4774
02:32:18,398 --> 02:32:21,920
because if i'm not used to talking to

4775
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:24,239
people and seeing a little image of

4776
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:26,559
myself staring back at me in the mirror

4777
02:32:24,239 --> 02:32:28,079
and it's just i know there are ways that

4778
02:32:26,559 --> 02:32:30,559
you can adjust that but it's

4779
02:32:28,079 --> 02:32:32,318
really awful yeah and i think that when

4780
02:32:30,559 --> 02:32:33,279
i get on zooms now i say hello and then

4781
02:32:32,318 --> 02:32:35,119
i shut down

4782
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:36,800
the video component and then i just talk

4783
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:37,120
in the end i come back on just to show

4784
02:32:36,799 --> 02:32:39,438
that

4785
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:40,479
it's still there it's still me but i

4786
02:32:39,439 --> 02:32:42,398
think that

4787
02:32:40,478 --> 02:32:43,840
voice only is really interesting eddie

4788
02:32:42,398 --> 02:32:44,959
chang would be an interesting person to

4789
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:46,880
talk to about this because he

4790
02:32:44,959 --> 02:32:48,159
understands so much about how inflection

4791
02:32:46,879 --> 02:32:50,318
communicates

4792
02:32:48,159 --> 02:32:52,159
emotionality and deeper state but

4793
02:32:50,318 --> 02:32:53,760
there's a balance between

4794
02:32:52,159 --> 02:32:55,359
i think just like you said this the

4795
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:59,120
privacy

4796
02:32:55,359 --> 02:33:00,640
uh somehow uh allows for the intimacy so

4797
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:02,720
like being able to

4798
02:33:00,639 --> 02:33:04,799
uh as opposed to put on putting on an

4799
02:33:02,719 --> 02:33:06,159
act which i realize we do when we're

4800
02:33:04,799 --> 02:33:08,398
visually presenting ourselves

4801
02:33:06,159 --> 02:33:10,079
right in remote communication but i

4802
02:33:08,398 --> 02:33:10,799
think that there's so few places where

4803
02:33:10,079 --> 02:33:13,520
people can

4804
02:33:10,799 --> 02:33:14,159
actually communicate without the fear of

4805
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:18,159
penalty

4806
02:33:14,159 --> 02:33:19,920
yes those that's you know woefully

4807
02:33:18,159 --> 02:33:21,840
absent these days and so maybe people

4808
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:22,879
are just relieved to be in a place where

4809
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:24,719
they feel like

4810
02:33:22,879 --> 02:33:26,318
i can say what i want or not say

4811
02:33:24,719 --> 02:33:28,559
anything and it's okay

4812
02:33:26,318 --> 02:33:30,478
and so so clubhouse as you answer your

4813
02:33:28,559 --> 02:33:32,559
kind of uh question is

4814
02:33:30,478 --> 02:33:33,599
uh it was a big improvement to me over

4815
02:33:32,559 --> 02:33:36,639
discord which is

4816
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:38,720
it has tears is it has a stage

4817
02:33:36,639 --> 02:33:40,239
where people the person that created the

4818
02:33:38,719 --> 02:33:42,478
room can invite people up

4819
02:33:40,239 --> 02:33:44,000
that would like to speak potentially

4820
02:33:42,478 --> 02:33:45,760
have the opportunity to speak and then

4821
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,600
there's a bigger audience

4822
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:50,079
that don't get a chance to speak unless

4823
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:53,439
they click raise their hand and they get

4824
02:33:50,079 --> 02:33:54,478
called on so there's like a tier system

4825
02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:57,840
that allows

4826
02:33:54,478 --> 02:34:01,679
for there to be a group of like 5

4827
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:04,000
10 20 30 people talking and a lot larger

4828
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:05,359
amount in the audience which in discord

4829
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,079
was the problems that everybody could

4830
02:34:05,359 --> 02:34:07,840
talk

4831
02:34:06,079 --> 02:34:09,359
and the other thing about clubhouse is

4832
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:11,040
everybody

4833
02:34:09,359 --> 02:34:12,640
is strongly encouraged to represent

4834
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:14,800
themselves so you're using your real

4835
02:34:12,639 --> 02:34:16,719
name it's not anonymous

4836
02:34:14,799 --> 02:34:18,719
and how many people were in that um

4837
02:34:16,719 --> 02:34:22,159
gamestop discussion

4838
02:34:18,719 --> 02:34:23,840
they currently uh limit

4839
02:34:22,159 --> 02:34:25,840
rooms to five thousand so i'm sure we

4840
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:27,600
maxed out at five thousand there's a lot

4841
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:29,439
of overflow rooms

4842
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:31,280
this is the cool thing about clubhouse

4843
02:34:29,439 --> 02:34:33,439
really big people were on there

4844
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:34,640
all tuned in and having a conversation

4845
02:34:33,439 --> 02:34:37,200
having all

4846
02:34:34,639 --> 02:34:37,840
from all you know all these different uh

4847
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:40,240
worlds

4848
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:42,478
being able to connect even though

4849
02:34:40,239 --> 02:34:44,239
without the niceties of like arranging

4850
02:34:42,478 --> 02:34:45,039
the meeting you could just show up and

4851
02:34:44,239 --> 02:34:48,318
leave which is

4852
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:51,760
nice but uh the reason i'm

4853
02:34:48,318 --> 02:34:53,600
for my lessons from discord i'm

4854
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:55,920
going to mostly stay away from cole

4855
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:58,000
house and i think

4856
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:59,280
we're going there under another name

4857
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,600
right uh

4858
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:02,560
uh i'll pretend i know the actual your

4859
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:05,680
actual name

4860
02:35:02,559 --> 02:35:06,879
yeah it's i've learned it's quite

4861
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:09,280
addicting

4862
02:35:06,879 --> 02:35:10,879
it's uh it's a time sink it's so the

4863
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:13,200
intimacy of it

4864
02:35:10,879 --> 02:35:14,079
is you find yourself wasting quite a bit

4865
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:16,640
of time on there

4866
02:35:14,079 --> 02:35:17,920
it pulls you in well it's interesting

4867
02:35:16,639 --> 02:35:20,000
they

4868
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:21,680
would in sort of going back to the

4869
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,318
podcast or earlier we're talking about

4870
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:24,720
books

4871
02:35:22,318 --> 02:35:27,119
or creating a technology one thing

4872
02:35:24,719 --> 02:35:30,239
that's absolutely clear is that anything

4873
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:31,120
that's easy to reproduce is probably not

4874
02:35:30,239 --> 02:35:35,840
worth

4875
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:39,120
much effort and time yes right i mean

4876
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:40,239
most posts could be easily reproduced

4877
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:43,120
you just repost them

4878
02:35:40,239 --> 02:35:44,799
yeah so um now there are some original

4879
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:46,399
posts that for which the attribution

4880
02:35:44,799 --> 02:35:47,920
goes to the original person it's clear

4881
02:35:46,398 --> 02:35:49,439
it came from you

4882
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:52,159
but anything that can be easily

4883
02:35:49,439 --> 02:35:55,120
reproduced is doesn't really expand us

4884
02:35:52,159 --> 02:35:56,879
very much as individuals or or as groups

4885
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:58,319
and most of what i see on social media

4886
02:35:56,879 --> 02:36:01,358
is stuff that

4887
02:35:58,318 --> 02:36:05,199
is is purely reproduced yes right

4888
02:36:01,359 --> 02:36:07,200
but i think clubhouse i mean

4889
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:08,800
it could be that some real magic emerges

4890
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:10,960
on there so

4891
02:36:08,799 --> 02:36:13,119
in moderation it could be good the magic

4892
02:36:10,959 --> 02:36:15,759
is this is another thing that i've

4893
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:17,280
found through kovid that maybe you can

4894
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:21,359
think about

4895
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:24,479
is uh live i used to be

4896
02:36:21,359 --> 02:36:26,399
not understand the appeal of live video

4897
02:36:24,478 --> 02:36:30,478
or live connection or like in this

4898
02:36:26,398 --> 02:36:32,398
clubhouse live events because clubhouse

4899
02:36:30,478 --> 02:36:33,920
is technically for the most part it's

4900
02:36:32,398 --> 02:36:35,519
not supposed to be recorded

4901
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:38,559
most people don't record most

4902
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:40,800
conversations it's a one-time live event

4903
02:36:38,559 --> 02:36:41,680
and there's a magic to that there is

4904
02:36:40,799 --> 02:36:45,438
that's not

4905
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:48,000
captured by a like your podcast or

4906
02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:49,280
my podcast produced video that's like

4907
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,600
recorded

4908
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:52,319
like packaged up well anything can

4909
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:54,559
happen

4910
02:36:52,318 --> 02:36:56,079
it's that anything can happen and those

4911
02:36:54,559 --> 02:36:59,039
though that's the kind of thing like

4912
02:36:56,079 --> 02:37:00,318
live concerts right i definitely i love

4913
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:02,240
live music

4914
02:37:00,318 --> 02:37:03,600
and it's the idea that because you can

4915
02:37:02,239 --> 02:37:05,680
always listen to the album actually the

4916
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:07,200
album usually sounds cleaner and better

4917
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:09,359
but it's just this idea that anything

4918
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:10,159
can happen and then you listen to like

4919
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:12,720
the parts

4920
02:37:10,159 --> 02:37:14,318
i don't know you uh like costello did

4921
02:37:12,719 --> 02:37:16,318
something weird uh your dog does

4922
02:37:14,318 --> 02:37:17,600
something weird and then you have to go

4923
02:37:16,318 --> 02:37:19,600
god damn it you have to go to the

4924
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:21,359
kitchen or something to get something

4925
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:23,439
and then you come back

4926
02:37:21,359 --> 02:37:24,479
and it's funny i watch a live video like

4927
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:26,239
that of people

4928
02:37:24,478 --> 02:37:27,920
and i'll be there for the whole time

4929
02:37:26,239 --> 02:37:28,639
i'll wait for them to go to the kitchen

4930
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:30,879
and come back

4931
02:37:28,639 --> 02:37:32,799
it's not like i tune out right and that

4932
02:37:30,879 --> 02:37:35,039
makes it like a richer experience for

4933
02:37:32,799 --> 02:37:36,318
some reason it's weird well it humanizes

4934
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:38,160
it yeah

4935
02:37:36,318 --> 02:37:39,680
and i think there is this weird effect

4936
02:37:38,159 --> 02:37:41,119
of whether or not it's a podcast

4937
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:41,520
instagram or twitter or anything else

4938
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:44,000
there is

4939
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:45,439
kind of like two people shouting into a

4940
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,959
tunnel and then a bunch of people with

4941
02:37:45,439 --> 02:37:49,040
ears at the other end of those tunnels

4942
02:37:46,959 --> 02:37:50,559
and shouting some things back

4943
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:52,800
you know that's that's kind of the

4944
02:37:50,559 --> 02:37:54,318
format we're in i think

4945
02:37:52,799 --> 02:37:55,599
i'll check out clubhouse again i've gone

4946
02:37:54,318 --> 02:37:56,959
in there a few times during the day and

4947
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:58,399
i was surprised to see how many people

4948
02:37:56,959 --> 02:37:59,519
were in there in the middle of the day

4949
02:37:58,398 --> 02:38:01,519
i was like don't aren't these people

4950
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:03,359
supposed to be working exactly but maybe

4951
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:04,159
that is their work well be very careful

4952
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:07,600
about the

4953
02:38:04,159 --> 02:38:09,600
um the time sync of it but yeah if you

4954
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:10,720
want to you and i go together we have a

4955
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:12,399
conversation on there

4956
02:38:10,719 --> 02:38:14,478
but one of the things you have to figure

4957
02:38:12,398 --> 02:38:17,599
out i don't still know

4958
02:38:14,478 --> 02:38:18,318
how to do it but how to exit which is

4959
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:20,239
you just do the

4960
02:38:18,318 --> 02:38:22,079
isn't there the leave quietly button

4961
02:38:20,239 --> 02:38:24,879
yeah no but like when you and i are on

4962
02:38:22,079 --> 02:38:28,000
stage having a conversation

4963
02:38:24,879 --> 02:38:30,879
uh like and okay uni is harder but

4964
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:31,120
like uh you really if it's just you and

4965
02:38:30,879 --> 02:38:33,039
i

4966
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:35,200
then it's the usual human communication

4967
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:38,399
of like all right i gotta go

4968
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:40,000
like but when it's like four people

4969
02:38:38,398 --> 02:38:41,439
you you don't want to interrupt everyone

4970
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:41,920
announce you're leaving you just have to

4971
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:43,439
i mean

4972
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:45,439
there's a weird dynamic that i haven't

4973
02:38:43,439 --> 02:38:47,120
quite figured out

4974
02:38:45,439 --> 02:38:49,760
of the etiquette isn't clear the

4975
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:52,079
etiquette is not clear well

4976
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:54,000
the etiquette on different platforms and

4977
02:38:52,079 --> 02:38:56,318
how that changes is really interesting

4978
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,040
you know how youtube has one etiquette

4979
02:38:56,318 --> 02:38:58,959
which is kind of

4980
02:38:57,040 --> 02:39:00,640
it's a lot of harshness is tolerated on

4981
02:38:58,959 --> 02:39:03,039
youtube video comments

4982
02:39:00,639 --> 02:39:03,840
um twitter seems a bit harsher than

4983
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:05,200
instagram

4984
02:39:03,840 --> 02:39:07,359
instagram there's kind of it seems to be

4985
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:09,439
a little nice really nice

4986
02:39:07,359 --> 02:39:10,479
people are really nice on instagram for

4987
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:13,600
the most part

4988
02:39:10,478 --> 02:39:15,760
um except for those uh phishing things i

4989
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:17,600
actually know someone who had their

4990
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:19,600
quite sizable account poached by those

4991
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:21,840
copyright they come in with those like

4992
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:23,359
you violated copyright things there's

4993
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:24,719
all sorts of harshness in there

4994
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:26,640
that if you think about it in the real

4995
02:39:24,719 --> 02:39:28,159
world i like to think about instagram as

4996
02:39:26,639 --> 02:39:29,680
if it was the real world

4997
02:39:28,159 --> 02:39:31,600
someone that comes over is basically

4998
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:32,880
saying like hey can i hold your wallet

4999
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:34,000
and go into the bank and i'll get some

5000
02:39:32,879 --> 02:39:35,839
money out for you and like

5001
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:37,120
but there's this trust based on the

5002
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:39,040
format it comes in

5003
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:40,800
that it can almost get past your radar

5004
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:43,439
unless you're suspicious

5005
02:39:40,799 --> 02:39:43,840
if if you took comments like you know

5006
02:39:43,439 --> 02:39:45,280
your

5007
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:46,880
posts get a lot of comments and use it

5008
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:48,800
you just walk past

5009
02:39:46,879 --> 02:39:50,398
500 random people on the street and just

5010
02:39:48,799 --> 02:39:52,239
listen to what they say

5011
02:39:50,398 --> 02:39:53,760
it something like that's ridiculous i

5012
02:39:52,239 --> 02:39:55,359
don't have time for that yeah but the

5013
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:56,719
comments somehow take on this importance

5014
02:39:55,359 --> 02:39:59,280
and this relevance yes

5015
02:39:56,719 --> 02:39:59,840
and you feel we we feel obligated to

5016
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:02,560
give them

5017
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:03,520
value right and so the online

5018
02:40:02,559 --> 02:40:06,079
communities

5019
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:06,560
the the rules really are different yeah

5020
02:40:06,079 --> 02:40:07,680
um

5021
02:40:06,559 --> 02:40:09,199
and they evolve with tom which is

5022
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:10,960
fascinating with clubhouse it's a new

5023
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:13,600
social network so it's evolving

5024
02:40:10,959 --> 02:40:15,519
and people are figuring out as you go

5025
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:18,000
and the same thing with podcasting

5026
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:19,359
on video and like scientific podcasting

5027
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:22,799
this is the cool thing when i

5028
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:24,960
look at what you've created i'm learning

5029
02:40:22,799 --> 02:40:26,239
i'm thinking like hmm that's interesting

5030
02:40:24,959 --> 02:40:28,159
to do it this way

5031
02:40:26,239 --> 02:40:29,279
because like nobody i have nobody to

5032
02:40:28,159 --> 02:40:30,879
copy

5033
02:40:29,279 --> 02:40:32,720
not many people to copy you know what i

5034
02:40:30,879 --> 02:40:34,159
mean if you threw out an idea i'm not

5035
02:40:32,719 --> 02:40:35,920
going to put it out here now because i

5036
02:40:34,159 --> 02:40:37,359
i don't want to because knowing you

5037
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:38,879
you'll hold yourself to it no matter

5038
02:40:37,359 --> 02:40:41,680
what but when we talked about

5039
02:40:38,879 --> 02:40:43,119
um this issue of the challenge of

5040
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:43,840
staying on a particular topic for a

5041
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:45,279
while

5042
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:47,040
i mean you do have some cool stuff

5043
02:40:45,279 --> 02:40:48,720
brewing in there oh no no not separate

5044
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:49,840
from this format and i love your

5045
02:40:48,719 --> 02:40:52,159
interview format

5046
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:53,920
but um when you told me about that i got

5047
02:40:52,159 --> 02:40:55,119
really excited that you might go forward

5048
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:57,600
i'm not going to tell your audience what

5049
02:40:55,120 --> 02:40:59,760
it is it but i will say this it is

5050
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:00,960
super cool i would have never thought

5051
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:02,559
about it it's distinctly different than

5052
02:41:00,959 --> 02:41:03,199
what i'm doing or what lex is currently

5053
02:41:02,559 --> 02:41:07,359
doing

5054
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:09,520
and if you decide to do that podcast

5055
02:41:07,359 --> 02:41:10,720
i will be your first and your number one

5056
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:11,680
fan and i know there are going to be

5057
02:41:10,719 --> 02:41:13,840
millions of other

5058
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:16,159
people interested that would be amazing

5059
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:16,799
so if you decide to go forward with the

5060
02:41:16,159 --> 02:41:19,600
idea

5061
02:41:16,799 --> 02:41:21,039
no um that would be awesome i was gonna

5062
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:22,239
say what it is but now i'm not going to

5063
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:24,160
because

5064
02:41:22,239 --> 02:41:25,359
because that's even more interesting uh

5065
02:41:24,159 --> 02:41:28,318
i i brought up the

5066
02:41:25,359 --> 02:41:30,479
the clubhouse thing actually in elon um

5067
02:41:28,318 --> 02:41:33,039
because i just wanted to

5068
02:41:30,478 --> 02:41:34,639
uh get your thoughts about something

5069
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:37,840
he's said a few times to me

5070
02:41:34,639 --> 02:41:40,000
and to me and in general is that he's

5071
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:43,680
under a huge amount of stress

5072
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:46,639
and i'm thinking of doing a startup

5073
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:47,840
now and kind of thinking about all of

5074
02:41:46,639 --> 02:41:49,680
this

5075
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:51,359
because i you know i enjoy podcast i

5076
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:54,720
enjoy science

5077
02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:56,159
but he says that his life is basically

5078
02:41:54,719 --> 02:41:58,639
hell

5079
02:41:56,159 --> 02:41:59,760
very difficult he looks happy but he's

5080
02:41:58,639 --> 02:42:03,039
probably very good at

5081
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:04,079
he's fulfilled he's fulfilled but the

5082
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:07,359
stress levels

5083
02:42:04,079 --> 02:42:08,318
the constant fires that he has to put

5084
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:10,000
out

5085
02:42:08,318 --> 02:42:11,519
and he says that most people wouldn't

5086
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:15,359
want to be me

5087
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:17,520
and that basically the reason he does

5088
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:19,040
what he does is because

5089
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:20,560
there's probably something wrong with

5090
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:23,920
him like it's not

5091
02:42:20,559 --> 02:42:26,559
uh he can't help it but do that

5092
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:27,359
it's kind of beautiful in a kind of

5093
02:42:26,559 --> 02:42:30,719
russian

5094
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:33,840
masochistic way well i i just wonder

5095
02:42:30,719 --> 02:42:35,599
the stress i mean i'm sure you can

5096
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:37,040
you can imagine the kind of stress he's

5097
02:42:35,600 --> 02:42:40,000
under because so

5098
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:41,680
it's running three plus companies and

5099
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:45,040
there's constant

5100
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:47,920
like he he says that you know every

5101
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:50,479
single meeting is a is not about like

5102
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:50,960
should we install a coffee maker in the

5103
02:42:50,478 --> 02:42:54,000
in the

5104
02:42:50,959 --> 02:42:56,079
in the kitchen it's like

5105
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:57,600
you know this rocket is going to blow up

5106
02:42:56,079 --> 02:42:59,840
and i don't we're all [ __ ]

5107
02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:01,040
i don't know what to do and we have to

5108
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:02,960
you have to fix

5109
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:04,880
you have to fix the real like big

5110
02:43:02,959 --> 02:43:07,519
problems that are and like how do you

5111
02:43:04,879 --> 02:43:08,719
uh oh yeah how do you deal with that

5112
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:09,279
what do you think about that kind of

5113
02:43:08,719 --> 02:43:11,760
life one

5114
02:43:09,279 --> 02:43:13,840
one is there a way to go you know walk

5115
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:17,200
through that fire

5116
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:19,600
and two should you

5117
02:43:17,200 --> 02:43:22,000
should you walk through that fire well i

5118
02:43:19,600 --> 02:43:25,359
mean without knowing i've never met elon

5119
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:28,239
but certainly we have common friends in

5120
02:43:25,359 --> 02:43:29,520
you and in other people that uh he

5121
02:43:28,239 --> 02:43:32,879
worked with long ago

5122
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:33,920
in the paypal days um all of whom speak

5123
02:43:32,879 --> 02:43:37,438
very highly of him

5124
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:39,120
and show express immense admiration for

5125
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:39,920
the number of things that he can

5126
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:41,520
maintain

5127
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:43,040
i think it's fair to say that he

5128
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:47,520
accomplishes more

5129
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:50,000
before 9 a.m than most people do in in

5130
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:50,720
a decade it's clear and that what he

5131
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,478
does would

5132
02:43:50,719 --> 02:43:56,318
dissolve most people into a puddle of

5133
02:43:52,478 --> 02:44:00,398
tears mostly because of this whole thing

5134
02:43:56,318 --> 02:44:02,159
about the brain working hard equates to

5135
02:44:00,398 --> 02:44:04,478
thinking about duration path and outcome

5136
02:44:02,159 --> 02:44:07,039
and anticipating outcomes given a b

5137
02:44:04,478 --> 02:44:08,159
c or d a lot of very scripted linear

5138
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:10,960
thinking

5139
02:44:08,159 --> 02:44:12,799
and prediction and that is hard it's

5140
02:44:10,959 --> 02:44:14,159
stressful it requires intense

5141
02:44:12,799 --> 02:44:15,599
neurochemical output

5142
02:44:14,159 --> 02:44:17,920
and he's doing that for multiple

5143
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:18,559
projects so presumably he's buffered

5144
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:20,398
himself

5145
02:44:18,559 --> 02:44:22,239
from the coffee maker issues and the

5146
02:44:20,398 --> 02:44:23,760
little tiny issues but he is

5147
02:44:22,239 --> 02:44:25,680
himself unless there's something i don't

5148
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:26,398
know he's walking around in a biological

5149
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:29,520
system

5150
02:44:26,398 --> 02:44:31,199
he is that's uh allegedly yes yeah

5151
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:33,520
allegedly so

5152
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:34,560
um and i don't want to reveal too much

5153
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:38,000
here but i have

5154
02:44:34,559 --> 02:44:39,600
a common um

5155
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:41,200
a co-worker and colleague through some

5156
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:43,600
contract work i do

5157
02:44:41,200 --> 02:44:45,760
that what i can tell you is that he's

5158
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:46,000
accessing the best resources in terms of

5159
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:49,520
how

5160
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:51,439
to optimize his biology and

5161
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:53,359
he's thinking about that not just for

5162
02:44:51,439 --> 02:44:55,680
himself but for all of neural link

5163
02:44:53,359 --> 02:44:56,960
because i think i'm not trying to dodge

5164
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:58,398
the question but i think

5165
02:44:56,959 --> 02:45:00,239
there's the there's the scale of the

5166
02:44:58,398 --> 02:45:01,358
individual but then there's the

5167
02:45:00,239 --> 02:45:03,520
companies that

5168
02:45:01,359 --> 02:45:04,479
he's creating and you've got people

5169
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:06,159
there that

5170
02:45:04,478 --> 02:45:08,639
you could imagine if they're working at

5171
02:45:06,159 --> 02:45:11,279
ten percent better capacity or can focus

5172
02:45:08,639 --> 02:45:12,239
five percent better for twenty percent

5173
02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:14,880
of the day

5174
02:45:12,239 --> 02:45:16,239
you're looking at a enormous increase in

5175
02:45:14,879 --> 02:45:18,000
productivity and

5176
02:45:16,239 --> 02:45:20,239
a reduction in the time to reach goals

5177
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:21,840
which will reduce the amount of stress

5178
02:45:20,239 --> 02:45:23,600
presumably on elon unless he goes and

5179
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:26,880
starts another endeavor

5180
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:28,640
right so i think it's certainly not

5181
02:45:26,879 --> 02:45:30,239
healthy for most people

5182
02:45:28,639 --> 02:45:31,920
it seems to be where he gets his

5183
02:45:30,239 --> 02:45:33,520
dopamine hits i'm also

5184
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:35,120
really struck by the fact that he has a

5185
02:45:33,520 --> 02:45:36,720
family and he has

5186
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:38,319
you know he maintains he's got kids

5187
02:45:36,719 --> 02:45:39,039
growing up in a relationship and all

5188
02:45:38,318 --> 02:45:42,559
that so

5189
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:45,840
it's super impressive i think that

5190
02:45:42,559 --> 02:45:48,879
um i don't know how old is elon yes 40

5191
02:45:45,840 --> 02:45:52,000
i'm pushing 50 i think 48

5192
02:45:48,879 --> 02:45:52,398
so even more impressive 29 because you

5193
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,639
know

5194
02:45:52,398 --> 02:45:56,000
many people who've been at exceedingly

5195
02:45:54,639 --> 02:45:59,199
high output for a decade

5196
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:59,840
or more don't do well their system

5197
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:02,880
breaks down

5198
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:05,760
well this is what he was saying he

5199
02:46:02,879 --> 02:46:07,519
uh actually the i mean i don't listen to

5200
02:46:05,760 --> 02:46:09,600
all of his interviews but

5201
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:11,200
on that live on the clubhouse he

5202
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:14,720
mentioned that

5203
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:18,640
he was kind of worried it's interesting

5204
02:46:14,719 --> 02:46:21,278
he was worried that like sometimes

5205
02:46:18,639 --> 02:46:22,478
what i think he said is i'm worried that

5206
02:46:21,279 --> 02:46:24,479
some

5207
02:46:22,478 --> 02:46:26,000
at some point my brain is just going to

5208
02:46:24,478 --> 02:46:28,719
fail

5209
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:29,120
because of the amount of load it's under

5210
02:46:28,719 --> 02:46:33,039
like

5211
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:36,079
how much i have to think through

5212
02:46:33,040 --> 02:46:38,399
throughout the day like how many like

5213
02:46:36,079 --> 02:46:39,200
problems you have to think through like

5214
02:46:38,398 --> 02:46:41,278
you know it's like

5215
02:46:39,200 --> 02:46:42,880
puzzles it's constant puzzle solving i

5216
02:46:41,279 --> 02:46:44,960
would be concerned about

5217
02:46:42,879 --> 02:46:46,559
taking somebody who's in that regime and

5218
02:46:44,959 --> 02:46:47,839
suddenly putting them into a regime

5219
02:46:46,559 --> 02:46:49,680
where they don't have enough to bite

5220
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:51,359
down into it's like my bulldog costello

5221
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:53,040
he's happiest when chewing and tugging

5222
02:46:51,359 --> 02:46:54,399
with a big whole neck of his

5223
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:56,160
and he is just not going to become a

5224
02:46:54,398 --> 02:46:58,879
retriever he's not going to

5225
02:46:56,159 --> 02:46:59,439
he does well and gets his dopamine hits

5226
02:46:58,879 --> 02:47:01,759
from

5227
02:46:59,439 --> 02:47:02,720
chewing and pulling and it it seems like

5228
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:05,920
elon has

5229
02:47:02,719 --> 02:47:07,278
ended up where he is by way of his

5230
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:10,879
natural leanings

5231
02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:12,720
i unless there's a backstory that's um

5232
02:47:10,879 --> 02:47:15,119
trauma-based or something and i don't

5233
02:47:12,719 --> 02:47:17,278
even begin to think that there is

5234
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:18,960
it seems that he has he's one of those

5235
02:47:17,279 --> 02:47:20,399
rare individuals in history that has an

5236
02:47:18,959 --> 02:47:22,559
immense drive

5237
02:47:20,398 --> 02:47:24,000
to create in all these different domains

5238
02:47:22,559 --> 02:47:26,159
i'm just saying the obvious here

5239
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:27,200
yeah but it seems like that's what makes

5240
02:47:26,159 --> 02:47:28,879
him tick

5241
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:31,040
i mean you're doing an awful lot too

5242
02:47:28,879 --> 02:47:34,478
well the problem is

5243
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:36,560
not really uh the the problem is um

5244
02:47:34,478 --> 02:47:38,079
about i've been on the verge of pulling

5245
02:47:36,559 --> 02:47:40,079
the trigger on on

5246
02:47:38,079 --> 02:47:41,600
on starting a company which will

5247
02:47:40,079 --> 02:47:45,200
increase the workload

5248
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:46,880
significantly and uh i'm attracted to

5249
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:49,920
that

5250
02:47:46,879 --> 02:47:51,920
because of a dream i have but it's a

5251
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:55,359
little bit scary

5252
02:47:51,920 --> 02:47:56,239
because it can destroy you in in a lot

5253
02:47:55,359 --> 02:47:58,318
of ways

5254
02:47:56,239 --> 02:47:59,680
there's two there's two sources of

5255
02:47:58,318 --> 02:48:03,840
destruction so

5256
02:47:59,680 --> 02:48:06,880
one source is uh

5257
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:10,318
i've for the first time in my life a few

5258
02:48:06,879 --> 02:48:13,438
um months ago i think

5259
02:48:10,318 --> 02:48:15,119
have gotten this feels like such a noob

5260
02:48:13,439 --> 02:48:16,800
thing to say but i've gotten some hate

5261
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:20,240
on the internet

5262
02:48:16,799 --> 02:48:22,239
no i know right no but like i am such an

5263
02:48:20,239 --> 02:48:25,520
idiot i'm so naive to

5264
02:48:22,239 --> 02:48:26,959
it was supr you i i had the question

5265
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:28,960
that i guess a lot of people

5266
02:48:26,959 --> 02:48:30,639
uh have when they get hate on the

5267
02:48:28,959 --> 02:48:32,879
internet it's like

5268
02:48:30,639 --> 02:48:35,039
like it's like mom why are these people

5269
02:48:32,879 --> 02:48:36,799
making up stuff about me

5270
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:38,960
you know that kind of feeling of like

5271
02:48:36,799 --> 02:48:42,478
why why are you saying that

5272
02:48:38,959 --> 02:48:43,278
and and the the the the reason i mention

5273
02:48:42,478 --> 02:48:45,278
that is like

5274
02:48:43,279 --> 02:48:46,880
well if you go if you want to go and

5275
02:48:45,279 --> 02:48:50,000
start a business and

5276
02:48:46,879 --> 02:48:50,478
do as i think people should when they

5277
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:54,000
start

5278
02:48:50,478 --> 02:48:55,679
a big ambitious business really try to

5279
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:58,079
go big

5280
02:48:55,680 --> 02:49:00,639
like what does success look like in

5281
02:48:58,079 --> 02:49:03,279
terms of your emotional journey

5282
02:49:00,639 --> 02:49:05,039
you're going to have a lot of people who

5283
02:49:03,279 --> 02:49:07,359
make up stuff about you

5284
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:09,120
who say negative thing i mean majority

5285
02:49:07,359 --> 02:49:11,439
hopefully if you do a good job

5286
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:13,680
will be supportive and but there's still

5287
02:49:11,439 --> 02:49:16,239
going to be this army of people there

5288
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:16,800
and like that that was scary to me

5289
02:49:16,239 --> 02:49:19,840
because

5290
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:20,398
of how much emotional impact they had on

5291
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:23,040
me

5292
02:49:20,398 --> 02:49:24,799
well and i also know a little bit i have

5293
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:26,000
some glimpse into the fact that you put

5294
02:49:24,799 --> 02:49:28,478
your heart and soul into

5295
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:29,680
everything you do you're not a you're

5296
02:49:28,478 --> 02:49:31,438
light-hearted about

5297
02:49:29,680 --> 02:49:33,040
certain things but you're even

5298
02:49:31,439 --> 02:49:36,398
light-hearted about being

5299
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:37,439
full gas pedal 24 7. there's kind of

5300
02:49:36,398 --> 02:49:40,478
this

5301
02:49:37,439 --> 02:49:42,159
you know uh was it um

5302
02:49:40,478 --> 02:49:43,760
laird hamilton always says you know the

5303
02:49:42,159 --> 02:49:45,680
big wave surfers uh

5304
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:47,120
he always says you know um bright light

5305
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:49,439
dark shadow

5306
02:49:47,120 --> 02:49:50,560
you know and uh i think it's that

5307
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:53,040
intensity

5308
02:49:50,559 --> 02:49:54,239
and when you do that and then suddenly

5309
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:56,240
people are starting to

5310
02:49:54,239 --> 02:49:57,600
like throw some paint on your picture

5311
02:49:56,239 --> 02:49:59,920
you're like wait hold

5312
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:01,279
you know you're going max capacity yeah

5313
02:49:59,920 --> 02:50:02,639
but i think the company

5314
02:50:01,279 --> 02:50:04,960
is an interesting one because you've

5315
02:50:02,639 --> 02:50:06,478
talked about doing this company before

5316
02:50:04,959 --> 02:50:08,559
i've been afraid i've just not been

5317
02:50:06,478 --> 02:50:10,318
pulling trigger uh

5318
02:50:08,559 --> 02:50:12,000
out of fear because i enjoy this life

5319
02:50:10,318 --> 02:50:12,398
this is this and starting to interrupt

5320
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,879
but

5321
02:50:12,398 --> 02:50:15,840
it's ultimately this question of taking

5322
02:50:14,879 --> 02:50:19,199
a leap

5323
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:22,159
is like uh say you're in academia

5324
02:50:19,200 --> 02:50:23,600
like you're at mit you're i really love

5325
02:50:22,159 --> 02:50:26,318
doing research at mit

5326
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:27,040
i really love that life why take a leap

5327
02:50:26,318 --> 02:50:29,760
out

5328
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:30,319
you know but i did because it's been a

5329
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:33,279
dream

5330
02:50:30,318 --> 02:50:34,000
but now accidentally along the way i

5331
02:50:33,279 --> 02:50:37,040
found this

5332
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:37,760
podcasting thing which is also really

5333
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:40,960
fulfilling

5334
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:44,079
and you know it's like why take a leap

5335
02:50:40,959 --> 02:50:46,478
because you have a huge lust for life

5336
02:50:44,079 --> 02:50:47,840
yeah i mean that's you i mean sometimes

5337
02:50:46,478 --> 02:50:48,239
when i'm on the internet and i think is

5338
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:50,239
this

5339
02:50:48,239 --> 02:50:52,000
you hear about it like oh it's addicting

5340
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:54,318
you know youtube's addicting all that

5341
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:56,079
actually sometimes i think maybe that's

5342
02:50:54,318 --> 02:50:58,559
true but a lot of times i just think

5343
02:50:56,079 --> 02:50:59,359
there's so much here there's a lot of

5344
02:50:58,559 --> 02:51:02,079
garbage

5345
02:50:59,359 --> 02:51:03,680
but there's so many gems out there in

5346
02:51:02,079 --> 02:51:06,478
the world now it's almost

5347
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:07,040
like sure how you allocate time is key

5348
02:51:06,478 --> 02:51:11,199
but

5349
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:13,520
i i think you can do it all

5350
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:14,399
yeah maybe not five more things yeah yes

5351
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:16,159
but all yes

5352
02:51:14,398 --> 02:51:18,079
and one thing i just had this idea and

5353
02:51:16,159 --> 02:51:19,760
this is not grounded in any scientific

5354
02:51:18,079 --> 02:51:22,398
paper but i think the answer might come

5355
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:24,239
to you during this um

5356
02:51:22,398 --> 02:51:25,920
this torture that you're about yourself

5357
02:51:24,239 --> 02:51:27,840
through with david because in those

5358
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:28,879
mental states you're really asking the

5359
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:30,880
question

5360
02:51:28,879 --> 02:51:32,559
right you're asking the question where

5361
02:51:30,879 --> 02:51:35,599
is my capacity

5362
02:51:32,559 --> 02:51:36,000
and am i even close to my capacity and

5363
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:38,000
if i

5364
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:39,840
am what's what's of the most value i

5365
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,239
think we find the answers to those

5366
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:43,439
things

5367
02:51:40,239 --> 02:51:46,799
in those non-verbal non-analytic states

5368
02:51:43,439 --> 02:51:51,040
it just comes to us i hope you're right

5369
02:51:46,799 --> 02:51:52,799
and i hope it's a profoundly fulfilling

5370
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:54,000
experience as opposed to one that leads

5371
02:51:52,799 --> 02:51:55,289
to my demise

5372
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:57,359
but yeah right

5373
02:51:55,290 --> 02:51:59,279
[Music]

5375
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:04,239
