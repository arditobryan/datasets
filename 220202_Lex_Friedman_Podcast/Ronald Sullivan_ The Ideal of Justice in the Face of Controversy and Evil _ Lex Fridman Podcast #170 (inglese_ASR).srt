to the pressure of a few harvard

sullivan's dean position

34
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,199
this created a major backlash in the

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,760
public discourse

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,960
over the necessary role of universities

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,920
in upholding

38
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,959

46
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:36,078
podcast as a side note let me say that

47
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,078
the free exchange of difficult ideas is

48
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,438
the only mechanism through which we can

49
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,798
make progress

50
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:46,239
truth is not a safe space truth

51
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,399
is humbling and being humbled can hurt

52
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,239
but this is the role of education not

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,280
just in the university but

54
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,839
in business and in life freedom

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,478
and compassion can co-exist but it

56
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,439
requires

57
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,718
work and patience it requires listening

58
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,599
to the voices

59
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,718
and to the experiences unlike our own

60
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,159
listening

61
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,118
not silencing this is the lex friedman

62
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,318
podcast

63
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:15,439
and here is my conversation with ronald

64
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,119
sullivan you were one of the

65
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,479
lawyers who represented the hollywood

66
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,360
producer harvey

67
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,238
weinstein in advance of a sexual assault

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
trial

69
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,319
for this harvard forced you to step down

70
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,119
as faculty deans

71
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,159
you and your wife of winter pals can you

72
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,599
tell the story of this

73
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:37,120
saga from first deciding to represent

74
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,119
harvey weinstein to the interesting

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,599
complicated events that followed

76
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,959
yeah sure so i got a call one morning

77
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:47,598
from a colleague at

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,800
the harvard law school who asked if

79
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:54,560
i would consent to taking a call from

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,560
from harvey uh he wanted to meet me and

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,400
and chat with me about representing him

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,439
i said yes and

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,640
one thing led to another i

84
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,239
drove out to connecticut uh where he was

85
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,679
staying and met with him and

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,158
some of his advisors and then a

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,040
day or two later i decided to to take

88
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,000
the case

89
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,439
this would have been back in uh january

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,360
of 2019

91
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,680
i believe so the sort of cases i i have

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
a

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,840
very small practice most of my time is

94
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,120
teaching and and writing uh but i tend

95
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,039
to take cases that

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,000
most uh deem to be uh impossible

97
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,039
uh uh i take the challenging sorts of

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,759
cases and

99
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,239
and this was uh fit the bill it was

100
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,039
quite

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,959
challenging in the sense that uh

102
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,639
everyone had

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,560
pre-judged the case when i say everyone

104
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,359
i just mean the the general sentiment

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
and the public

106
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,560
uh uh had the case pre-judged uh even

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
though

108
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,680
the specific allegations did not regard

109
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,439
uh

110
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,200
the any of the people in the um

111
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,280
in the new yorker that's the new yorker

112
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,318
article that sort of uh

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,360
uh uh exposed uh everything that was

114
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,318
going on

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,360
uh allegedly with with harvey so i

116
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,959
decided to uh

117
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,840
to take the case and uh i did

118
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,399
is there a philosophy behind you taking

119
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,719
on these

120
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,039
very difficult cases like is it a set of

121
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
principles is it just your love of the

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
law or is it

123
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,679
is there like set of principles why you

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
take on the cases

125
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,079
yeah i do i take on i'd like to take on

126
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,199
hard cases and i like to take on the

127
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:39,039
cases

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,800
that uh are with unpopular

129
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,960
uh defendants unpopular clients

130
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,840
um and with respect to the latter that's

131
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,879
where harvey

132
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:52,079
weinstein fell it's

133
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,719
because uh we need

134
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,560
lawyers and good lawyers to take the

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,840
unpopular cases

136
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,839
because that those sorts of cases

137
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,439
determine what sort of criminal justice

138
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,839
system we have

139
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,639
uh if we don't protect the rights and

140
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,799
the liberties of those whom the society

141
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,360
deems to be the least and the last

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,960
the unpopular client and that's the the

143
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
camel's nose under the tent

144
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,638
if we let the camel's nose under the

145
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,439
temp the entire tent is going to

146
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,960
collapse

147
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,120
that is to say if we short circuit

148
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,159
the rights of a client like harvey

149
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,160
weinstein

150
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,439
then the next thing you know someone

151
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,280
will be at your door

152
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,800
knocking it down and violating your

153
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,239
rights there's a there's a certain

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
creep there with respect to um the way

155
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,360
in which

156
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,720
the the state will respect the civil

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,400
rights and civil liberties

158
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,160
of people and these are the sorts of

159
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,839
cases that that tested

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,600
so you know for example uh there's a

161
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,000
there was a young man many many years

162
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,039
ago named ernesto miranda

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,160
by all accounts he was not a likable guy

164
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,279
he was a

165
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,400
you know three-time knife thief

166
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,279
and not a likable guy but lawyers

167
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,519
stepped up

168
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,638
and took his case and because of that we

169
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,478
now have the

170
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,680
miranda uh warnings you have the right

171
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,478
to remain silent

172
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,038
those those warnings that uh officers

173
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,000
are

174
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:18,719
are forced to give to people so it is

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,038
through these cases that we express

176
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,560
oftentimes the best values in our

177
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,918
criminal justice system so i

178
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,759
i proudly take on these sorts of cases

179
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,918
in order to vindicate not only the

180
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,038
individual rights of the person whom i'm

181
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:36,719
representing but the rights of citizens

182
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,879
writ large who most of whom

183
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,319
do not experience the criminal justice

184
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,360
system and it's

185
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,240
partly because of lawyers who

186
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,960
take on these sorts of cases and

187
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,079
establish

188
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,239
rules that protect us uh for

189
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,359
average everyday ordinary concrete

190
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,199
citizens as

191
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,400
from a psychological perspective just

192
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,520
you as a human

193
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,038
is there is there fear is there stress

194
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,279
from all the pressure because if you're

195
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,159
facing i mean the whole point a

196
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,359
difficult case

197
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,439
especially in the latter that you

198
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,479
mentioned of the going against popular

199
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,560
opinion

200
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,519
you have the eyes of millions

201
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,199
potentially looking at you with anger

202
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:19,198
as you try to defend uh you know this

203
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,598
these set of laws that this country is

204
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,720
built on no it doesn't stress me out

205
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,439
particularly

206
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,280
it uh you know it sort of comes with the

207
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,719
the territory i try not to

208
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,279
get uh too excited in either

209
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,000
direction so a big part of my practice

210
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,598
is

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,639
wrongful convictions and i um i've

212
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,680
gotten uh over 6 000 people out of

213
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,038
prison who've been

214
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,038
wrongfully incarcerated and a subset of

215
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,800
those people have been convicted and

216
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:50,399
you know if people have been in jail 20

217
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
30 years

218
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:53,598
who have gotten out and those are the

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,800
sorts of cases where people

220
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:59,839
uh praise you and and that sort of thing

221
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,319
and so look i i do

222
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,598
uh the work that i do i'm proud of the

223
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,639
work that i do

224
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,560
and in that sense i'm uh sort of a

225
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,240
part-time taoist you know the

226
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,879
expression reversal was the movement of

227
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,840
the dow uh so i don't get too high i

228
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,400
don't get too

229
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,839
low i just try to do my work and and

230
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,478
represent people to the best of my

231
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,399
ability

232
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,639
so one of the hardest cases of recent

233
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,638
history would be the harvey weinstein in

234
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,519
terms of popular opinion or unpopular

235
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,879
opinion

236
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:31,038
so well if you continue on that line

237
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,120
uh what was that where does that story

238
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,439
take you of taking on this case

239
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,320
yeah so i i took on the case and then

240
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,240
there was some

241
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,599
uh some a few students at the college so

242
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,839
let me back up i had an

243
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,360
administrative post at harvard college

244
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,040
which is a separate entity from the

245
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
harvard law school harvard college is

246
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,559
the undergraduate

247
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,000
portion of harvard university and the

248
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,199
law school is obviously

249
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,839
the law school and i um

250
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,000
initially was appointed as master of one

251
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,200
of the houses we did a name change five

252
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,519
or six years

253
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,560
into it and and were called faculty

254
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,240
deans

255
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,479
but the houses at harvard are based on

256
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,600
the college system of oxford in

257
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,519
in cambridge so when uh students go to

258
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
harvard after their first year

259
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,519
they're assigned to a particular house

260
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,278
uh or college and that's where they live

261
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,039
and eat and so forth these are

262
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,080
undergraduates these are undergraduate

263
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,399
students so

264
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
i was responsible for one of the the

265
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,240
houses that's

266
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,680
as its faculty dean so it's an

267
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
administrative appointment at the

268
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,838
college

269
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,160
and some students who didn't

270
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,920
clearly didn't like harvey weinstein

271
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:41,679
began to

272
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:44,799
protest about the representation

273
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:47,919
and from there it just

274
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:51,120
mushroomed into one of the most craven

275
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,919
cowardly acts by

276
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,519
any university in modern history it's a

277
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,479
just a complete

278
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,278
and utter repudiation of academic

279
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,680
freedom

280
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:06,320
uh and it is a decision

281
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,759
that harvard certainly will live to

282
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,120
regret it's frankly it's an

283
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,600
embarrassment

284
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,240
we expect students to do what students

285
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
do

286
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,440
and and i've encouraged students to have

287
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,120
their voices heard and to protest

288
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,160
i mean that's what students do what is

289
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,919
vexing are the adults

290
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,639
the dean of the faculty of arts and

291
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,278
sciences claudine gay

292
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,399
absolutely craven and cowardly the dean

293
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,360
of the college

294
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,039
same thing rakesh karana kraven and

295
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,278
cowardly

296
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:42,159
they capitulated to the loudest voice in

297
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,360
the room

298
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,838
and ran around afraid of 19 year olds oh

299
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,600
my 19 year olds are upset that i i need

300
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,600
to i need to do something

301
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,360
and uh it appeared to me that they so

302
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,360
so desired the approval of students that

303
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,240
they were afraid to make uh the tough

304
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,000
decision

305
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,759
and the right decision it really could

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,399
have been an important teaching

307
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,679
exactly moment teaching moment yeah very

308
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,360
important teaching moment

309
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,679
so they they forced you to step down

310
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,320
from that uh faculty dean position at

311
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,879
the house

312
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,079
it um i would push back on the

313
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,078
description a little bit

314
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:22,078
so so so i so i i don't write the the uh

315
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,359
you know the references to the op-ed i

316
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,519
did the new york times

317
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,519
harvard made a mistake by making me step

318
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,759
down or or something like that

319
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,799
so i i don't write those things uh i did

320
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,519
not step down

321
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,278
and and refused to step down uh harvard

322
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,679
declined to renew

323
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,278
my my my contract and you know and i

324
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,479
made it clear that i i was

325
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,439
not going to resign as a matter of of

326
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,879
principle and

327
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,519
and force them to um do the

328
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,000
the cowardly act that they in fact uh

329
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,639
did

330
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,078
and you know the the the worst thing

331
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,680
about this uh

332
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,958
they did uh the college uh uh dean gay

333
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,359
and dean corona

334
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,319
uh commission this survey they've never

335
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,399
done this before

336
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,320
survey from the students you know how do

337
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,839
you feel at winthrop house

338
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,879
yeah and the funny thing about the

339
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,279
survey is they never release the results

340
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,399
why did they never release the results

341
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,759
they never

342
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,480
released the results because i would bet

343
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,600
my salary that the results came back

344
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,519
positive for me

345
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
and it didn't fit their narrative

346
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,360
because most of the students were fine

347
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,278
yes most of the students were fine it

348
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,278
was the the loudest voice in the room

349
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,720
so they never released it and you know i

350
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,679
challenge them to this day

351
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,240
release it yes release it but no but you

352
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,519
know they

353
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,799
wanted to uh uh

354
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,240
create this narrative uh and

355
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,039
um when the data didn't support the

356
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,839
narrative

357
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,958
then they just got got silent oh we're

358
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,399
we're not going to release it the

359
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,879
students demanded it

360
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,519
i demanded it and they wouldn't release

361
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,799
it because

362
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:02,480
i am i i just i just know

363
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:04,639
in my heart of hearts that it it was um

364
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,159
uh it came back in my favor that most

365
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,039
students at winthrop house

366
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,919
said they were fine there was a group of

367
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,278
students that

368
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:16,719
weaponized the a term uh unsafe

369
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:20,320
they said we felt unsafe and they they

370
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,839
banted this term about uh but i'm again

371
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,200
i'm confident that

372
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,040
that the majority of students at

373
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,240
winthrop house said they felt

374
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,120
completely uh fine and the uh felt safe

375
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,759
and so forth

376
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,639
and the supermajority i am confident

377
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,919
either said

378
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,360
i feel great at winthrop or you know i

379
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,599
don't care one way or the other

380
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,639
and then there was some minority who had

381
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,920
had a different view

382
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,959
but um you know uh lessons

383
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,120
learned uh i um

384
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,359
it was a wonderful opportunity at

385
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,278
winthrop i met some amazing students

386
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,320
over the uh my 10 years

387
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,639
as master and then faculty dean and i'm

388
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,360
still in touch with a number of students

389
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,560
some of whom are now my students at the

390
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,919
at the law school

391
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:09,278
so uh in the end i thought it was a

392
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,838
it ended up being a great uh experience

393
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,120
uh

394
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,440
the national media was just wonderful

395
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,720
and it's just wonderful people wrote

396
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,040
such wonderful

397
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,560
articles and accounts and wagged their

398
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,159
finger appropriately

399
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:26,399
at harvard uh uh

400
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,000
compared me to john adams which i don't

401
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,159
think is an app comparison but it's

402
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,720
always great to read something like that

403
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,278
uh yeah but but anyway that that was the

404
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,320
harvard

405
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,278
uh the harvard uh versus harvey uh

406
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,959
situation

407
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,320
so that that seems like a seminal

408
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,919
mistake by

409
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
harvard and harvard is one of the great

410
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,198
universities in the world

411
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,719
and so sort of its successes and its

412
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,278
mistakes are really important for the

413
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,160
world

414
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,278
uh as a beacon of like how we make

415
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,159
progress

416
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,799
so what lessons for the bigger academia

417
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,838
that get

418
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:03,278
that's under fire a lot these days

419
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,600
uh what bigger lessons do you take away

420
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,799
like

421
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,360
how do we make harvard great how do we

422
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,039
make

423
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,120
uh other universities yale mit great

424
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,078
in the face of such mistakes well i

425
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,879
think that we have moved into a model

426
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,519
where we the the we have the

427
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:26,958
consumerization

428
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:30,000
of education uh that is to say

429
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:33,518
we have feckless administrators

430
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,039
uh who make policy based on

431
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,000
what the students say

432
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,439
now this comment is not intended to

433
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,958
suggest that students have

434
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,519
no voice in governance but it is

435
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,078
to suggest that the faculty are there

436
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,799
for a reason they are among the greatest

437
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,078
minds on the planet earth in their

438
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,278
particular fields at schools like

439
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,278
harvard and

440
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,958
yale stanford the schools that you

441
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,958
mentioned mit

442
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,239
quite literally the greatest minds on

443
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:06,479
earth they're there for

444
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,198
a reason things like curriculum and so

445
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,240
forth

446
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:13,599
uh are rightly in the province of

447
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,799
faculty and while you take input and

448
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,800
critique and so forth ultimately the

449
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,879
grown-ups in the room have to be

450
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:24,000
sufficiently responsible to take

451
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:27,039
uh to take charge and to

452
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,240
uh direct the course of a student's

453
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,439
education

454
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,759
and um you know you know my situation is

455
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,160
one example where it really could have

456
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,159
been an excellent teaching moment about

457
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,838
the value of the sixth amendment about

458
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:43,120
what it means to treat

459
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,360
um what it means to treat people who

460
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,480
are in the crosshairs of the criminal

461
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,919
justice system

462
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,079
but rather than having that conversation

463
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,799
um

464
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,278
it's just this consumerization model uh

465
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,838
well

466
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,399
there's a lot of noise out here so we're

467
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,800
going to react in this sort of way

468
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,599
higher education as well unfortunately

469
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:08,879
has been commodified in other

470
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:12,159
uh sorts of ways that has reduced

471
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,120
or or impeded hampered these schools

472
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,640
commitments

473
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:19,599
to uh free and robust and open

474
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,240
dialogue so to the degree that academic

475
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,198
freedom

476
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,720
uh doesn't sit squarely at the center of

477
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,120
the academic mission

478
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,240
uh any school is going to be in trouble

479
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:33,439
and i really hope that

480
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:36,558
that we weather

481
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:41,279
this current

482
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,279
political moment where um

483
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,439
19 year olds without degrees or running

484
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,038
universities

485
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,960
and get back to a a system

486
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:56,240
where faculty where adults

487
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,840
make decisions in the best interests of

488
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,720
the university in the best interests of

489
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,639
the student

490
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,440
even to the degree though some of those

491
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,200
decisions may be

492
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:12,480
unpopular and that

493
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,480
is going to require a certain courage

494
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:19,678
and hopefully

495
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:22,558
in time and i'm confident that in time

496
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,240
um administrators are going to begin to

497
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,160
push back on these

498
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,000
current trends uh harvard's been around

499
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,679
for a long time it's been around for a

500
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,839
long time for a reason and

501
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,080
one of the reasons is that it

502
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,879
understands itself not to be static so i

503
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,439
have

504
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,440
every

505
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:46,480
view that uh

506
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,839
harvard is is going to adapt

507
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,720
and get itself back on course and be

508
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,678
around another

509
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,400
400 years at least that's my goal so i

510
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,400
mean

511
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,400
what this kind of boils down to is just

512
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,360
having difficult conversation difficult

513
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,919
debates

514
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,439
uh when you mention sort of 19 year olds

515
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,559
and it's funny i've seen this even at

516
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,720
mit

517
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,000
it's not that uh they shouldn't have a

518
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,038
voice

519
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,558
they should they they do seem to i guess

520
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,679
you have to experience it and just

521
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,399
observe it

522
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,960
they have a strangely disproportionate

523
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,600
power

524
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,558
right right it's very interesting to uh

525
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,639
to basically

526
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,000
i mean you say yes there's great faculty

527
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,480
and so on

528
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,160
but you know it's not even just that the

529
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,519
faculty is smart or

530
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,160
wise or whatever it's that they're just

531
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,639
silenced so the terminology that you

532
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,080
mentioned

533
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,240
is weaponized as sort of safe spaces

534
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:43,119
or that certain conversations make

535
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,200
people feel unsafe

536
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,879
what do you think about this kind of

537
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,480
idea

538
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,039
you know is is there some things that

539
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
are

540
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:55,279
unsafe to talk about in the university

541
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
setting

542
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,200
is there lines to be drawn somewhere and

543
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,798
uh just like you said on the flip side

544
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,038
with a slippery slope

545
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,400
is it too easy for the lines to be drawn

546
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,798
everywhere

547
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
yeah that's a great question so this

548
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,879
idea of unsafe

549
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,759
space at least the vocabulary derives

550
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
from

551
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:20,158
some research uh academic research

552
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,520
about feeling psychologically uh

553
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,400
unsafe and so the notion here is that

554
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,319
there is

555
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:32,159
uh there are forms of uh

556
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:35,038
psychological disquiet that impedes

557
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,840
people from uh experiencing the

558
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,480
educational

559
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,480
environment to the greatest degree uh

560
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,480
possible and that's the uh

561
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,120
argument uh i

562
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,798
and assuming for a moment that uh people

563
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,558
do have these feelings of

564
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:55,918
of of disquiet at

565
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:58,720
elite universities like mit and like

566
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,919
harvard that's probably the safest space

567
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,319
people are going to be in

568
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,520
for their their their lives because when

569
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,480
they get out into the

570
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,279
the quote unquote real world uh they

571
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,720
won't have

572
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,480
the um the sorts of uh nets that these

573
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,919
schools provide safety nets that these

574
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,319
schools provide

575
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,440
uh so to the extent that research is

576
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,240
descriptive

577
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,880
of a psychological feeling i think that

578
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,440
the duty of the universities uh are to

579
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,760
challenge

580
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,798
people it seems to me that it's a shame

581
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,440
to go to a place

582
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,000
like harvard a place like mit yale any

583
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,360
of these

584
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,599
uh great institutions and come out

585
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,558
the same person that you were when you

586
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,639
went in

587
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,918
uh that seems to be a horrible waste of

588
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,038
four years and

589
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,559
and money and and resources rather we

590
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,919
ought to challenge

591
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:49,119
students that they grow challenge some

592
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,400
of the

593
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:55,038
their most deeply held assumptions

594
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,960
they they may continue to hold them but

595
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:00,079
the point of an education

596
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,558
is to rigorously interrogate um

597
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,519
these fundamental assumptions that have

598
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,558
guided you

599
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:09,038
uh thus far and to do it uh

600
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,079
fairly and and civilly so the extent

601
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,240
that there are

602
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,359
lines that should be drawn there's a

603
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,759
long tradition

604
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,038
in the university of civil discourse so

605
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,519
you should

606
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,519
draw a line somewhere between civil

607
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,918
discourse and uncivil

608
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,798
discourse the purpose of a university is

609
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,080
to talk

610
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:31,279
difficult conversations tough issues

611
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:35,038
uh talk directly and frankly

612
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:37,839
but do it civilly and you know so to

613
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,679
you know yell and cuss at somebody and

614
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:43,119
that sort of thing well you know

615
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,840
do that on your own space but observe

616
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,239
the

617
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,359
norms of civil discourse at the

618
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,919
university

619
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:55,359
uh so look i think that the presumption

620
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,240
ought to be that uh the most

621
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,319
difficult topics are appropriate to talk

622
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,679
about at a universe that that ought to

623
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,519
be the presumption

624
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:09,120
now you know should uh

625
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:12,879
um mit for example give its

626
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,839
prom imprimatur to someone who is

627
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,720
espousing

628
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,079
uh the flat earth theory you know the

629
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,558
earth is flat

630
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:26,000
right so there if if certain ideas

631
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:29,678
uh are are so

632
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,960
uh contrary to the scientific

633
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,240
uh and and cultural thinking of the of

634
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,640
the moment

635
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,359
yeah there's space there to draw a line

636
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,000
and say yeah

637
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,199
we're not going to uh give you this

638
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,759
platform to

639
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,960
uh tell our students that the earth is

640
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,079
is flat

641
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,679
uh but you know it's a topic that's

642
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,798
controversial

643
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,798
but contestatory that's what

644
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,839
universities are for if you don't like

645
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,720
the idea

646
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,399
present better ideas and articulate them

647
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,759
and i i think there needs to be a

648
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,679
mechanism

649
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,119
outside of the space of ideas of

650
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,360
humbling like i've done

651
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,959
martial arts for a long time i got my

652
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,199
ass kicked a lot

653
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,000
i think that's really important i mean

654
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,480
the in the space of ideas

655
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
i mean even just in engineering just all

656
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,240
the math classes

657
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,319
my memories of math which i love

658
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,200
is kind of pain is basically coming face

659
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,720
to face with

660
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,278
with the idea that i'm not special

661
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,159
that i'm much dumber than i thought i

662
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,919
was

663
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:40,000
and that anything accomplishing anything

664
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,880
in this world requires really hard work

665
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,519
that's really humbling that makes you

666
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,120
that

667
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,119
that puts you because i remember when i

668
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,439
was 18 and 19 and i thought

669
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,558
i was gonna be the smartest the best

670
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,960
fighter the the

671
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,000
nobel prize winning uh you know all

672
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,319
those kinds of things

673
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,319
and then you come with face to face with

674
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,399
reality and it hurts

675
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,158
and it feels like there needs to be

676
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,840
efficient mechanisms from the best

677
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,960
universities in the world

678
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:08,158
to without abusing you it's a very

679
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,519
difficult line to

680
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,120
to walk without like uh mentally or

681
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,480
physically abusing you

682
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:18,239
be able to humble you and that's what i

683
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,919
felt was missing in these very difficult

684
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,839
very important conversations

685
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,400
is the 19 year olds when they spoke up

686
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,519
the mechanism for humbling them with

687
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,720
ideas

688
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:33,759
was missing i got kind of gotten broken

689
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,440
broken down because as you say there

690
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,480
does

691
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,278
like i sensed fear

692
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,079
ever everything was permeated with fear

693
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,200
and fear

694
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,879
is uh paralyzing fear is destructive

695
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,278
especially in a place that's supposed to

696
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,080
be all about freedom of ideas

697
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,000
right and i mean i don't know if you

698
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,839
have anything um

699
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,519
any thoughts to say on this whole idea

700
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,558
of cancer culture

701
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,000
where people um

702
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,079
a lot of people use it it's become

703
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,880
political so saying maybe outside of the

704
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:10,399
world to politics

705
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,840
is this uh uh uh you have do you have

706
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,080
thoughts about it does it bother you

707
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:17,199
that people are sort of put in this bin

708
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,879
and uh labeled us something and then

709
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,720
thereby you can ignore everything they

710
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,039
say i mean stephen pinker there's a lot

711
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,000
of

712
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,839
harvard folks that are fighting against

713
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,679
i guess these set of ideas but

714
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,278
do you have do you have thoughts i think

715
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,519
that we as a culture

716
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:36,839
are way way way too quick to cancel

717
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:40,079
uh people and it it's become

718
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:43,599
almost reflexive now uh

719
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,798
you know someone uh says something or

720
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,158
makes an

721
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:51,839
an offhand comment uh even a mistake

722
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,640
uh there's there's a move to simply uh

723
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,759
cancel

724
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,200
uh folks so i think that this uh

725
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,640
quote-unquote council

726
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,080
culture uh has really

727
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,200
gotten out of control at this point

728
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:10,879
it's forcing people to be robotic uh in

729
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,720
many ways robots

730
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,000
i will say not now i know i'm venturing

731
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,400
into your uh

732
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,558
intellectual domain for future robots

733
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,480
watching this no offense

734
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,240
and there are minute it's discouraging a

735
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,440
lot of good people from

736
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,599
um getting into public life in any sort

737
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,320
of way because you know who needs the

738
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,759
who needs the stress uh of it well in

739
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:32,558
some sense you're an inspiration that

740
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,079
you're able to

741
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,119
withstand the the pressure the pressure

742
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,558
of the masses

743
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:42,398
but it is as i said it's a sad

744
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,079
aspect of human nature that we kind of

745
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,558
get into these crowds and we get

746
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,079
we start chanting and it's fun for some

747
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,480
reason and then you forget yourself

748
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,038
and then you sort of wake up the next

749
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,640
day not

750
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,558
not having uh anticipated the

751
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,399
consequences of all the chanting

752
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,319
yeah and we get ourselves in trouble in

753
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:01,678
that i mean there's some responsibility

754
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,879
on the

755
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,840
on social networks and the mechanisms by

756
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,760
which

757
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,759
they make it more frictionless to do the

758
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,599
chanting to do the canceling to do the

759
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,278
outrage and all that kind of stuff so

760
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,759
i actually on the technology side have a

761
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:19,200
hope that that's fixable but

762
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:21,679
yeah it does seem to be

763
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,200
you know it almost like the internet

764
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,159
showed to us

765
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,880
that we have a lot of broken ways about

766
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,240
which we

767
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,679
communicate with each other and we're

768
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,120
trying to figure that out same with the

769
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,840
university

770
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,719
the this mistake by harvard showed that

771
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,599
we need to

772
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,960
reinvent what the university is and i

773
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,359
mean all of this is

774
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,240
it's almost like we're finding our baby

775
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,639
dear legs

776
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,759
and trying to strengthen the

777
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,159
institutions that

778
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,119
have been very successful for for a long

779
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,960
time you know

780
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,038
the really interesting thing about

781
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,880
harvey weinstein and

782
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,519
you choosing these exceptionally

783
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,200
difficult cases

784
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,200
is also thinking about

785
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:08,480
what it means to defend evil people

786
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,798
what it means to defend these we could

787
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,200
say

788
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,319
unpopular and you might push back

789
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,759
against the word

790
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:17,519
evil but bad people in society

791
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,798
um first of all do you think there's

792
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,798
such a thing as evil

793
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:23,918
or do you think all people are good and

794
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:26,960
it's just circumstances that create evil

795
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,720
and also is there somebody too evil for

796
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,399
the law to defend

797
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,880
and so that's a so the first question

798
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,759
that's a deep uh philosophical question

799
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,200
whether the

800
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:40,319
category of evil uh does any work

801
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,519
uh for me it does for me i

802
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:47,119
i do think that i do subscribe

803
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:49,679
to that category that there is uh evil

804
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,879
uh in the world as conventionally uh

805
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,120
understood so

806
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,640
uh so there are many who will say yeah

807
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:57,759
that just doesn't

808
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,480
doesn't do any work for me uh but

809
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,679
the category evil in fact does

810
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,480
intellectual work

811
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,278
for me and i i understand it as as

812
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,519
something that

813
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:11,278
uh that exists uh is it genetic or is it

814
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:12,720
the circumstance like

815
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,319
what kind of work does it do for you

816
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,120
intellectually i think that

817
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,000
it's uh it's highly contingent that is

818
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,599
to say that

819
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,880
the conditions in which one

820
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:28,240
grows up and so forth uh

821
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,120
uh uh begins to

822
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,399
create this category that we may think

823
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:35,918
of as evil

824
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,719
now there are um studies and and whatnot

825
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,159
that show

826
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,880
that uh certain um uh brain

827
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,480
abnormalities and so forth are are more

828
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,799
prevalent in say

829
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,360
serial killer so there may be a

830
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:52,480
biological predisposition

831
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:56,158
to certain forms of conduct but

832
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,120
uh i don't i don't have the

833
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,960
uh biological evidence to make a

834
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:04,479
statement that someone is born

835
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,440
evil in and you know i i'm not a

836
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,759
determinist

837
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,919
thinker in that way so you come out the

838
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,640
womb evil and you're destined to be that

839
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,159
way

840
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,519
um to the extent there may be biological

841
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:21,120
uh determinants uh there still require

842
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,120
some um uh nurture uh as well

843
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,879
uh so but do you still put a

844
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,439
responsibility

845
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,200
for the on the individual of course yeah

846
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,919
we all make choices

847
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,558
and so some responsibility on the

848
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,038
individual

849
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,038
indeed

850
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,880
we live in a culture unfortunately where

851
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:46,079
a lot of people

852
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,399
have a constellation of bad choices in

853
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:51,199
front of them and that makes me very sad

854
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,398
yeah um that the people grow up with

855
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,120
with

856
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,398
predominantly bad choices in in front of

857
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,719
them and that's unfair

858
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,038
and that's that that's on all of us but

859
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,600
yes i do think we make we make choices

860
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:04,798
wow that's so powerful the constellation

861
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,038
of bad choices

862
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,038
hey

863
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,359
that's such a powerful way to think

864
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,278
about

865
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:18,639
sort of equality which is

866
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,558
this the set of trajectories before you

867
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,679
that you could take if you just roll the

868
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,200
dice because uh

869
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,798
you know life is is a kind of

870
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,798
optimization problem

871
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,079
sorry to take us into math over a set of

872
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,200
trajectories

873
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:36,000
under imperfect information uh

874
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,640
so you're gonna do a lot of stupid [ __ ]

875
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,839
to put it

876
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,600
uh in technical terms uh

877
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,439
but uh the

878
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,678
the the fraction of the trajectories

879
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,679
that take you into into bad places

880
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,200
or into good places is really important

881
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,679
and that's ultimately what we're talking

882
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,159
about

883
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,399
and evil might be just a little bit of a

884
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,080
predisposition biologically but the rest

885
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,199
is just trajectories that you can take

886
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:03,439
i've been studying hitler a lot recently

887
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,200
i've been reading probably way too much

888
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,038
and it's it's interesting to think about

889
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,960
all the possible trajectories

890
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:13,038
right that could have avoided

891
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,720
the this particular individual

892
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,480
developing the hate that he did the

893
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,880
following that he did

894
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,399
the the actual final uh

895
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,000
there's a few turns in him

896
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,359
psychologically where he went

897
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,038
from being a leader that just wants to

898
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:34,158
conquer and to

899
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:35,759
somebody who allowed his anger and

900
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,799
emotion to take over

901
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:41,679
where he started making mistakes for uh

902
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:42,720
in terms of militarily speaking but also

903
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,000
started

904
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,159
doing you know evil things

905
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,919
and all the possible trajectories that

906
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,039
could have avoided that are fascinating

907
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,399
including

908
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:56,480
he wasn't that bad at painting a drawing

909
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:57,518
right that's that's true from the very

910
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,399
beginning

911
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,679
and uh and his time with vienna there's

912
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:02,959
all these possible things

913
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,278
to think about and of course there's

914
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,720
millions of others like him that never

915
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:07,440
came to power and all those kinds of

916
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,358
things

917
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,480
uh so but that goes to the second

918
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,838
question on the

919
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,358
on the side of evil do you think

920
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,279
and and hitler is often brought up as

921
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:21,519
like an example of somebody who is

922
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,000
like the epitome of evil do you think

923
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,199
you would if you got that same phone

924
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,079
call

925
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,078
after world war ii and hitler survived

926
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,960
uh during war you know at the trial for

927
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:38,159
war crimes

928
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,480
would you take the case defending uh

929
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,760
adolf hitler if you don't want to answer

930
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,719
that one

931
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,320
is there a line to draw for evil for who

932
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,398
to not to defend

933
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,359
no i think i think everyone i'll do the

934
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,838
second one first

935
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:52,878
everyone has a right to a defense if

936
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,039
you're charged

937
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,398
criminally in in the united states of

938
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,079
america so

939
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,639
i know i do not think that there's

940
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:04,960
someone so evil that they do not deserve

941
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:08,799
a defense process matters

942
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,599
process helps us get to results

943
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,000
more accurately than we would otherwise

944
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,079
so

945
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,960
it is important and it's vitally

946
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,599
important and indeed more important for

947
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
someone deemed to be evil to receive the

948
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,559
same

949
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,719
quantum of process and the same

950
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,799
substance of process that anyone

951
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:29,039
else would it's vitally important to the

952
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:33,200
health of our criminal justice system

953
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:36,320
for that to happen so yes uh everybody

954
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:38,078
uh hitler included were he

955
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,079
charged in the united states for a crime

956
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,280
that occurred in the united states

957
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,480
uh uh yes um

958
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,040
um whether i would do it if i were

959
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,719
a public defender and assign the case uh

960
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:51,519
yes i started my career as a public

961
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:55,439
defender

962
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:58,559
i represent anyone who was assigned

963
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:02,079
to me i think that is our uh our duty

964
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:05,279
uh in private uh

965
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:09,119
uh practice uh i have choices

966
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,720
uh and i i likely based on the hypo you

967
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,079
gave me and i would tweak it a bit

968
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,358
because it would have to be a

969
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,960
a u.s united states yeah and so but but

970
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:17,440
i get the broader point and don't want

971
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,880
to

972
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:24,240
bog down in technicalities i'd likely uh

973
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,280
pass right right now as i i see it

974
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,319
unless

975
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,720
um it was a case where no nobody else

976
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,760
would

977
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,319
would would represent him uh you know

978
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,800
then

979
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,760
uh i i would i would think that i have

980
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,039
some sort of duty

981
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,480
and an obligation uh to

982
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:45,358
to to do it uh but yes everyone uh

983
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,559
absolutely deserves a right to competent

984
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:48,880
counsel

985
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,838
that is a beautiful idea it's difficult

986
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,079
to think about it

987
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:57,599
in the face of public pressure it's just

988
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,000
i mean um it's kind of terrifying

989
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,680
to watch the masses during this past

990
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,880
year of 2020

991
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,759
to wash the power of the masses to make

992
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,838
a decision

993
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:12,320
before any of the data is out

994
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,838
if the data is ever out any of the

995
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,119
details

996
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:20,320
any of the processes and i and

997
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,000
there is an anger to the justice system

998
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,240
there's a lot of people that feel like

999
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,280
even though the ideal you describe

1000
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:31,598
is a beautiful one it does not always

1001
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,960
operate justly it does not operate to

1002
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,440
the best of its ideals

1003
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,159
it operates unfairly can we go to the

1004
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,358
big picture

1005
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:42,559
of the criminal justice system what

1006
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,960
do you given the ideal

1007
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:47,920
works about our criminal justice system

1008
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,920
and what is broken

1009
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,279
well there's a lot broken uh right right

1010
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:56,719
now and i usually focus on

1011
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,480
on that uh but uh in truth a lot

1012
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,799
uh works about our criminal justice

1013
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,320
system so there's a there's an old joke

1014
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,440
uh and it uh it it's funny but

1015
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,640
it it carries a lot of truth to it

1016
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,720
and the joke is that um in the united

1017
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,759
states we have the

1018
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,879
worst criminal justice

1019
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,680
system in the world except for every

1020
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,039
place else

1021
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:26,239
yeah and uh and yes we

1022
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,639
certainly have a number of problems uh

1023
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,279
and a lot of problems based on race and

1024
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:33,039
class

1025
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:36,079
and economic station but we have a

1026
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,719
process that privileges the liberty and

1027
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,519
that's a

1028
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,159
good feature of the criminal justice

1029
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,519
system

1030
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:45,118
so here's how it works the idea of the

1031
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,159
relationship between the individual and

1032
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,680
the state

1033
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:53,279
is such that in the united states

1034
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:56,480
we privilege uh liberty over and above

1035
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,359
very many values so much so that a

1036
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,240
statement by

1037
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:01,759
increased mather not you know terribly

1038
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:04,639
far from where we're sitting

1039
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,640
right now has gained traction uh over

1040
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,719
all these years and it's that better

1041
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,480
10 guilty go free than one innocent

1042
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,598
person convicted

1043
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,159
that is an expression of the way in

1044
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,599
which

1045
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,399
uh we understand liberty to operate in

1046
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,359
our collective

1047
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,480
consciousness we would rather a bunch of

1048
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,639
guilty people go

1049
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,119
free than to than to um

1050
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,639
impact the liberty interests of any uh

1051
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,880
individual person

1052
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,078
so that's a guiding principle in our

1053
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,119
criminal justice

1054
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:41,200
system uh liberty and so we

1055
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,680
set a process that makes it difficult

1056
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:44,879
to convict people we have rules of

1057
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,358
procedure

1058
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,320
that are cumbersome and that slow down

1059
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:52,639
the process

1060
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,079
and that um exclude otherwise reliable

1061
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,118
evidence and this is all

1062
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,280
because we place a value on

1063
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,320
uh liberty and i think these are good

1064
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,880
things and it

1065
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,400
uh and it says a lot about our criminal

1066
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,039
justice system

1067
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,240
some of the bad features have to do with

1068
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,159
the way in which

1069
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,559
uh this country sees color as a proxy

1070
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,598
for

1071
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,920
criminality and and treats uh people of

1072
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,000
color in radically different ways in the

1073
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,200
in the criminal justice system

1074
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,960
uh from arrests to

1075
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:29,519
charging decisions to sentencing

1076
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,880
people of color are disproportionately

1077
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,400
impacted

1078
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,519
on all sorts of registers one example

1079
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,880
and it's a

1080
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:42,559
popular one that

1081
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,599
although there appears to be no

1082
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:48,719
uh distinguishable difference between

1083
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,640
uh drug use by whites and blacks

1084
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:54,239
in the country um uh blacks though

1085
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:55,679
only 12 percent of the population

1086
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:59,199
represent 40

1087
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,719
of the uh the uh drug charges in

1088
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,318
in the country there's there's there's

1089
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,959
some disequities

1090
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,000
along uh race and class and the criminal

1091
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,440
justice system that

1092
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,079
we really have to have to have to fix

1093
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,358
and

1094
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,079
they've grown to more than than bugs in

1095
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:16,318
the system and

1096
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,280
have become features unfortunately of

1097
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:19,119
our system

1098
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,200
oh to to make it more efficient to make

1099
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,838
judgments so the racism makes it more

1100
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,679
efficient

1101
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:28,400
it uh it it efficiently uh

1102
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,039
moves people uh from society to the

1103
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,240
streets

1104
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,920
uh and that's uh

1105
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,439
and a lot of innocent people get caught

1106
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,760
up in that

1107
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,119
well let me ask in terms of the

1108
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,319
innocence

1109
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,920
so you've gotten a lot of people who are

1110
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:48,400
innocent

1111
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,680
uh you def uh i get i guess revealed

1112
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,760
their innocence

1113
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,879
demonstrated their innocence what's that

1114
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,240
process like

1115
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,318
what's it like emotionally

1116
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:59,118
psychologically what's it like legally

1117
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:02,239
to fight the system

1118
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,640
in uh through the process of revealing

1119
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,919
sort of

1120
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:07,759
uh the innocence of a human being

1121
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,960
yeah emotionally and psychologically it

1122
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,160
can be taxing

1123
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,000
uh i follow a model

1124
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,480
of uh what's called empathic

1125
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,199
representation and that is i i get to

1126
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,358
know

1127
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,879
my clients and their family that i get

1128
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:24,239
to know their strivings their

1129
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,760
aspirations their fears their sorrows

1130
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,759
so that certainly

1131
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,679
sometimes can do psychic injury uh on

1132
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:33,439
one

1133
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,919
uh if you you know you get really

1134
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,039
invested and really sad and

1135
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,480
and or happy and it uh it it

1136
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:45,920
it does become emotionally uh taxing

1137
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,358
but the idea of someone sitting in jail

1138
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,880
for 20 years

1139
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:51,598
completely innocent of a crime can you

1140
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,640
imagine sitting there every day for 20

1141
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,440
years knowing

1142
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,039
that you factually did not do the thing

1143
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,079
that you were convicted of

1144
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:01,759
by a jury of your peers it it's got to

1145
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,440
be the most incredible thing in the

1146
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,640
world

1147
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,318
what the but the people who do it and

1148
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:09,358
the people who make it and come out on

1149
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,358
the other side

1150
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:15,759
as productive citizens are folks who say

1151
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,000
they they've come to an inner peace in

1152
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,440
their own minds and they say these bars

1153
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,639
aren't going to define

1154
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,838
me uh that my my humanity

1155
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,118
is uh it is there and it's it's

1156
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,000
immutable

1157
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,079
and they uh are not bitter which is

1158
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,519
amazing i i would tend to think that i'm

1159
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,760
not that good of a person

1160
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,960
i would be bitter for every day of 20

1161
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,599
years if i were in

1162
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,358
in jail for something but you know but

1163
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,440
but people tell me that you know that

1164
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:44,559
they can't survive like that one cannot

1165
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,559
survive like that

1166
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,679
and you have to come to terms with it

1167
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,000
and uh

1168
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,078
and uh the the people whom i've

1169
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,280
exonerated i mean they they come out

1170
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,079
uh most of them uh come out and

1171
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,200
and they just uh really just take on

1172
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,240
life with a vim

1173
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:04,799
and and vigor without uh bitterness

1174
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,759
and it's it's a beautiful thing to see

1175
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,800
do you think

1176
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,720
it's possible to eradicate racism from

1177
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,000
the judicial system

1178
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:16,318
i do i think as uh i think that race

1179
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,960
insinuates itself in all aspects of our

1180
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,480
lives

1181
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,440
and the judicial system is not immune

1182
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,159
from that so to the extent we begin to

1183
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,159
eradicate

1184
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,679
dangerous and deleterious race thinking

1185
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:33,118
from society

1186
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:35,919
generally then it will uh be

1187
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,280
eradicated from the uh criminal justice

1188
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,039
system i think we've got a lot of work

1189
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,839
to do and i think it'll be

1190
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,880
a while but uh but i think it's it's

1191
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,920
doable i mean

1192
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,440
you know uh the

1193
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,000
country so historians will look back 300

1194
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,240
years from

1195
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,280
now and take note of the

1196
00:44:54,239 --> 00:45:00,959
incredible journey of uh

1197
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:04,560
diasporic africans in the in in the us

1198
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,760
an incredible journey from uh you know

1199
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:10,480
slavery uh to

1200
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,599
the the heights of politics and business

1201
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,159
and judiciary

1202
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,119
the academy and so forth and not a lot

1203
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,838
of time

1204
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,160
and actually not a lot of time and if we

1205
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:22,318
can

1206
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:24,799
have that sort of movement historically

1207
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,239
uh let's think about what the next 175

1208
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
years will look like i'm not saying it's

1209
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:29,838
going to be

1210
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,200
short but i'm saying that if we keep

1211
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:36,719
at it keep getting to know each other

1212
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:40,239
a little better keep enforcing laws

1213
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:41,598
uh that prohibit uh

1214
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,279
the the sort of race-based

1215
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,838
discrimination that people have

1216
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,480
experienced and

1217
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:52,078
provide as a society opportunities

1218
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,960
for people to thrive in this world then

1219
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,200
i think we can

1220
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,720
we can see a better world and if we see

1221
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,439
a better world we'll see a better

1222
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,000
judicial system so i think it's kind of

1223
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,358
fascinating

1224
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,519
if you look throughout history and race

1225
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,880
is just part of that is uh

1226
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:10,639
we create the other and

1227
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,920
uh treat the other with disdain

1228
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:13,679
through the legal system but just

1229
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,440
through human nature

1230
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:18,239
i tend to believe we mentioned offline

1231
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,000
that i work with robots

1232
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:21,199
it sounds absurd to say especially to

1233
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,679
you especially because we're talking

1234
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:26,960
about racism and it's so prevalent today

1235
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:29,598
i do believe that there will be

1236
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,358
almost like a civil rights movement for

1237
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,640
robots

1238
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,279
because uh with the i think there's a

1239
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,799
huge

1240
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:43,200
value to society of having

1241
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,760
artificial intelligence systems that

1242
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,399
are uh that interact with humans that

1243
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,280
are and

1244
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,720
are human-like and the more they become

1245
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,920
human-like

1246
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,919
you will they will start they will start

1247
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,680
to ask very fundamentally human

1248
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,960
questions about freedom

1249
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:03,118
about suffering about justice and they

1250
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,079
will will have to come face to face

1251
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,200
like look in the mirror in asking the

1252
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,318
question

1253
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:13,519
just because we're biologically based

1254
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:16,559
just because we're sort of uh

1255
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,639
well just because we're human does that

1256
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,000
mean we're the only ones that deserve

1257
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:23,199
the rights

1258
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,760
again giving forming another

1259
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:26,480
other group which is robots and i'm sure

1260
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,520
there could be

1261
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:34,240
along that path different

1262
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:36,800
versions of other that we form so racism

1263
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:37,519
race is certainly a big other that we've

1264
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,359
made

1265
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:41,280
as you said a lot of progress on

1266
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,598
throughout the history of this country

1267
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,720
but it does feel like we always create

1268
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,440
as we make progress

1269
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,078
create new other groups and of course

1270
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,400
the other

1271
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,599
the other group that perhaps is outside

1272
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:57,358
the legal system that people talk about

1273
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,760
is the essential no i eat a lot of meat

1274
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,759
but the torture of animals you know the

1275
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,280
people talk about when we look back from

1276
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,800
you know a couple centuries from now

1277
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,000
look back at the kind of things we're

1278
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,480
doing to animals

1279
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,838
we might regret that we might see that

1280
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,199
in a very different light and it's kind

1281
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:12,880
of interesting to see the future

1282
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:16,000
trajectory of

1283
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:17,680
what we wake up to about the injustice

1284
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,960
in our

1285
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,440
in our ways um but the robot one is the

1286
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,760
one i'm

1287
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,240
especially focused on because uh but at

1288
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,160
this moment in time it seems ridiculous

1289
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,759
but i'm sure most civil rights movements

1290
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:30,879
throughout history seem ridiculous at

1291
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,119
first

1292
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,400
well it's interesting sort of outside of

1293
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,440
my uh

1294
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,480
intellectual bailiwick uh robots as

1295
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,838
i understand the development of

1296
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:47,358
um artificial intelligence uh though

1297
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:50,799
the um the aspect

1298
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:50,799
that uh

1299
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,558
still is missing is this notion of of

1300
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,160
consciousness

1301
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:03,359
uh and that it's it's consciousness

1302
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:06,799
that is the the thing that uh

1303
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:08,880
will uh will move um

1304
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,400
if it were to exist and i'm not saying

1305
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,800
that it can or will

1306
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,519
but if it were to exist would move

1307
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,280
robots

1308
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:20,719
from uh machines to

1309
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,519
um something different

1310
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:24,000
that ex something that experienced the

1311
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,039
world

1312
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
in a way analogous to what how we

1313
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:32,239
experience it um and also as i

1314
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,440
understand the science there's a

1315
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,799
um unlike what you see on on television

1316
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,599
that we're not

1317
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,880
we're not uh there yet in terms of uh

1318
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,079
this notion of uh

1319
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:48,720
the machines having uh a consciousness

1320
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:49,760
um uh or a great general intelligence

1321
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,598
all those kinds of things

1322
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,359
yeah yeah a huge amount of progress has

1323
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,680
been made and

1324
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:57,759
there is it's fascinating to watch so

1325
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,199
i'm on both minds as a person who's

1326
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,760
building them

1327
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:03,759
i'm realizing how sort of quote-unquote

1328
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,960
dumb they are

1329
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,440
but also looking at human history and

1330
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,519
how

1331
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,519
poor we are predicting the progress of

1332
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,719
innovation and technology

1333
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:17,199
it's obvious that we have to be humble

1334
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:18,318
by our ability to predict coupled with

1335
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:22,159
the fact that we

1336
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,558
keep uh to use terminology carefully

1337
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:24,318
here

1338
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,240
we keep discriminating against the

1339
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:29,119
intelligence of

1340
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:31,519
artificial systems the smarter they get

1341
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,559
the more ways we find to dismiss

1342
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:36,318
the their intelligence so this this has

1343
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:40,160
just been going on throughout

1344
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:41,119
where i it's almost as if we're

1345
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,480
threatened

1346
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:47,280
in the most primitive human way

1347
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,318
animalistic way we're threatened by the

1348
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,040
power of

1349
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,239
other creatures and we want to lessen

1350
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,400
dismiss them

1351
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:57,358
so consciousness is a really important

1352
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,358
one but the one i think about a lot

1353
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:00,960
in terms of consciousness the very

1354
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:03,519
engineering question

1355
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,480
is whether the display of consciousness

1356
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,519
is the same

1357
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:11,358
as the possession of consciousness so

1358
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:14,960
if a robot tells you they are conscious

1359
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:17,598
if a robot looks like they're suffering

1360
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,720
when you torture them if a robot is

1361
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,440
afraid of death

1362
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,279
and says they're afraid of death and are

1363
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,280
legitimately afraid like

1364
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,440
for in terms of just uh everything we as

1365
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,319
humans

1366
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,679
use to determine the ability of somebody

1367
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:36,639
to be their own

1368
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:37,919
entity they're the one that loves one

1369
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:42,318
that fears

1370
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:45,358
one that hopes one that can suffer

1371
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:45,920
if if the robot like in the dumbest of

1372
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:49,279
ways

1373
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:51,280
is able to display that we

1374
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,400
it changed it starts changing things

1375
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,359
very quickly

1376
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,119
uh i'm not sure what it is but it does

1377
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,480
seem that there's a huge component to

1378
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,680
consciousness

1379
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:04,318
that is a social creation like we

1380
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,118
together create our consciousness like

1381
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,719
we

1382
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:10,640
believe our common humanity together

1383
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:11,759
alone we wouldn't be aware of our

1384
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:15,279
humanity

1385
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,839
and the law as it protects our freedoms

1386
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,640
seems to be a construct of the social

1387
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:22,400
construct

1388
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:24,400
and when you add other creatures into it

1389
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,639
it's not obvious to me that like you

1390
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,480
have to build

1391
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,879
there will be a moment when you say this

1392
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,800
thing is not conscious

1393
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,318
i think there's going to be a lot of

1394
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,400
fake it until you make it

1395
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,159
and there'll be a very gray area between

1396
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,119
fake and make

1397
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,879
that uh is going to force us to contend

1398
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,760
with what it means

1399
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,318
to be an entity that deserves rights

1400
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,200
where

1401
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:49,759
all men are created equal the the men

1402
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,519
part

1403
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,359
might have to expand in ways that we

1404
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,400
are not yet anticipating that's very

1405
00:52:55,358 --> 00:53:00,000
interesting i mean my favorite

1406
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,440
the fundamental thing i love about

1407
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,280
artificial intelligence is it gets

1408
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,880
smarter and smarter it challenges to

1409
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,599
think of

1410
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,519
uh what is right the questions of

1411
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,800
justice questions of freedom

1412
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:16,318
it basically challenges us

1413
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:21,039
to uh to understand our own mind

1414
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:22,719
to understand uh what uh like

1415
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,558
almost from an engineering first

1416
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,480
principles perspective to understand

1417
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,319
what it is that makes us human

1418
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,838
that is at the core of all the rights

1419
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:31,119
that we talk about and all the documents

1420
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:32,400
we write

1421
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,240
so even if we don't give rights

1422
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,400
artificial intelligence systems we may

1423
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:39,519
be able to construct

1424
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,800
more fair legal systems to protect us

1425
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:42,960
humans

1426
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,160
well i mean interesting ontological

1427
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,960
question uh

1428
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:48,480
between the the performance of

1429
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,880
consciousness and

1430
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,079
and and actual consciousness to the

1431
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,358
extent

1432
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:58,480
that it's um that actual consciousness

1433
00:53:55,358 --> 00:54:01,920
is anything beyond some contingent

1434
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,679
reality uh but you've posed a number of

1435
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,358
of interesting philosophical questions

1436
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:08,960
and then there's also

1437
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:10,719
it strikes me that that

1438
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,639
philosophers of religion would pose

1439
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:15,838
another set of questions

1440
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:19,679
uh as well when you um deal with uh

1441
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:23,119
uh issues of uh of structure versus soul

1442
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:26,318
body versus soul and and uh it

1443
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:29,519
it would be a it will be a

1444
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:32,318
complicated mix and i suspect i'll be uh

1445
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,519
dust by the time those questions get get

1446
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:36,000
worked out

1447
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:36,798
and uh so yeah the soul the soul is a

1448
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,960
fun one

1449
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:40,400
there's no soul i'm i'm not sure maybe

1450
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,639
you can correct me but

1451
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,480
there's very few discussion of soul in

1452
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:48,000
our legal system right

1453
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,920
right correct so uh but there is a

1454
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,798
discussion about what constitutes a

1455
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,280
human

1456
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,559
being and i mean you gestured at the

1457
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,920
notion of

1458
00:54:54,559 --> 00:55:02,079
uh the potential of the law uh widening

1459
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:05,200
the domain of uh so of of human being so

1460
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:07,760
and in that sense right uh you know

1461
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,639
people are very angry because they can't

1462
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,280
uh

1463
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,879
uh get uh sort of pain and suffering

1464
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,760
damages if someone

1465
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,079
negligently kills a pet because a pet is

1466
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,119
not

1467
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,680
a human being and people say well i love

1468
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,440
my

1469
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:26,639
pet but the law sees uh a pet as

1470
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,440
chattel as property like this this water

1471
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:31,838
bottle

1472
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:35,039
uh so the the current legal definitions

1473
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:37,759
um trade on a definition of

1474
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:39,679
humanity that may not be worked out in

1475
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,280
any sophisticated way but

1476
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:45,519
certainly um there's a there's a

1477
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,519
share broad and shared understanding of

1478
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:50,480
what what it what it means

1479
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:52,480
so probably doesn't uh explicitly

1480
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,798
contain a definition of something like

1481
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:59,760
soul but it's it's more robust than

1482
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,960
you know a carbon-based organism uh

1483
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,599
there's something

1484
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,480
uh a little more distinct about what the

1485
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,838
law

1486
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,719
thinks a human being is so if we can

1487
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:11,039
dive into

1488
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:11,919
uh we've already been doing it but if we

1489
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,358
can dive into

1490
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:20,480
more difficult territory so uh

1491
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:23,679
2020 had the tragic case of george floyd

1492
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,798
when you reflect on the protests on the

1493
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,838
racial tensions

1494
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:29,199
over the death of george floyd how do

1495
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:30,558
you make sense of it all

1496
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:34,159
uh what do you take away from these

1497
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:39,440
events well the george floyd

1498
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:43,519
moment occurred at at an historical

1499
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,798
moment where people were in

1500
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:49,920
quarantine for covid um

1501
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:52,960
and people um

1502
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,440
have these uh cell phones

1503
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,798
to a degree greater than we've ever had

1504
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,079
them before

1505
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:01,920
and this was a sort of the straw that

1506
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,920
broke the camel's back

1507
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,200
after a number of these sorts of cell

1508
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,760
phone videos

1509
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:12,879
uh surfaced people were fed up

1510
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:16,960
uh they there was unimpeachable

1511
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:20,318
uh evidence of um

1512
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,079
a form of of mistreatment

1513
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:23,440
whether it constitutes murder or

1514
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,079
manslaughter there

1515
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,519
the trial is going on now and jurors

1516
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,798
will figure that out but

1517
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:33,838
but there was widespread appreciation

1518
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:36,639
that a fellow human being was

1519
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,000
was mistreated that we were just talking

1520
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:41,519
about humanity

1521
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:45,039
that there was um not a sufficient

1522
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,719
recognition of this person's uh humanity

1523
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:48,880
the common humanity of this person the

1524
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:51,199
common humanity of this person well

1525
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,680
well said and people were fed up so we

1526
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:57,919
were already in this covet space where

1527
00:57:53,679 --> 00:58:00,879
we were exercising care for one another

1528
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,720
uh and it there was just an explosion

1529
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,720
the likes of which this country

1530
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:07,039
hasn't seen since the you know civil

1531
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:10,798
rights

1532
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:14,318
protests of the 1950s and 1960s and

1533
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:17,599
people uh simply said enough enough

1534
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:18,480
enough enough this has to stop we cannot

1535
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,280
treat

1536
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,000
uh fellow citizens in in this way and we

1537
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,480
can't do it with

1538
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,358
impunity and the young people say we're

1539
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,920
just we're just

1540
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:29,759
we're not gonna stand for it anymore

1541
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:33,599
they took to the streets

1542
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:37,119
but with the millions of

1543
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,119
people protesting there is nevertheless

1544
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,400
taking us back to the most difficult of

1545
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,079
trials

1546
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,880
you have the trial like you mentioned

1547
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:48,640
that's going on now of derek showing

1548
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:51,358
of one of the police officers involved

1549
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:53,519
uh what are your thoughts what are your

1550
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:56,558
predictions on this

1551
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:58,400
trial where the law the process of the

1552
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,920
law is trying to proceed

1553
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,440
in the face of so much racial tension

1554
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,960
yeah it's it's going to be an

1555
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,039
interesting trial i've i've been

1556
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,000
keeping an eye on it there in jury

1557
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,719
selection now

1558
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,079
today as we're we're talking uh so a

1559
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,639
lot's going to depend on what sort of

1560
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,000
jury

1561
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:18,639
gets elected uh yeah how sorry to take

1562
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,358
sorry to interrupt but uh so one of the

1563
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:21,279
interesting

1564
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:22,798
qualities of this trial maybe you can

1565
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,880
correct me if i'm wrong

1566
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:26,400
but uh the cameras are allowed in the

1567
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,599
courtroom at least during the juror

1568
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,079
selection

1569
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,280
so so you get to watch some of this

1570
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,079
stuff

1571
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,839
and the other part is the jury selection

1572
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,160
again i'm very inexperienced but

1573
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:39,199
it seems like selecting and what is it

1574
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:43,440
unbiased

1575
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:47,118
jury is really difficult for this trial

1576
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,440
it's it almost like i i

1577
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:52,400
i don't know uh me as a listener like

1578
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,798
listen you know listening to people

1579
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,039
that are trying to talk their way into

1580
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,960
the jury kind of thing

1581
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:00,159
trying to decide is this person really

1582
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,960
unbiased

1583
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:03,759
or are they just trying to hold on to

1584
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,159
their like

1585
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,280
deeply held emotions and trying to get

1586
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:09,039
onto the jury

1587
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,720
i mean it's incredibly difficult process

1588
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:13,199
i don't know if you can comment on

1589
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:14,959
a case so difficult like the ones you've

1590
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,598
mentioned before

1591
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,960
how do you select a jury that represents

1592
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,280
the people and doesn't

1593
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,480
and and carries the sort of the ideal of

1594
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,400
the law

1595
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,039
yeah so a couple things so first yes it

1596
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,119
is televised and it will be televised

1597
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:30,480
as they say gavel the gavel so the

1598
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,480
entire trial

1599
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,639
the whole thing is going to be televised

1600
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,760
so uh people are getting

1601
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:39,598
a view of how uh laborious jury

1602
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,680
selection can be

1603
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,119
i think as of yesterday they had picked

1604
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,558
six jurors and it's

1605
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,240
it's taken a week and they have to get

1606
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:49,280
to 14. uh

1607
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:50,239
so they've got you know uh probably

1608
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,359
another week or

1609
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,159
or more to to do i've been in jury

1610
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,639
trials where it

1611
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:58,318
took a month to choose a jury so that's

1612
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:00,879
the most important part you have to

1613
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:01,440
you have to choose the right uh sort of

1614
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,358
jury

1615
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,639
so unbiased in the criminal justice

1616
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:07,598
system has a

1617
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:08,879
particular meaning and it it means that

1618
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,760
um

1619
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:14,079
that uh let me tell you what it doesn't

1620
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:17,599
mean it doesn't mean that a person

1621
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:20,640
uh is not aware of the case

1622
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,838
it also does not mean that a person has

1623
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,118
informed an opinion

1624
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:26,078
about the case those are two popular

1625
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:27,798
misconceptions

1626
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,760
what it does mean is that

1627
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:31,358
notwithstanding whether

1628
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,119
an individual has formed an opinion

1629
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,880
notwithstanding whether an individual

1630
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:38,318
knows about the case

1631
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,480
that individual can set aside any prior

1632
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:42,480
opinions can set aside

1633
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,318
any notions that they've developed about

1634
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,159
the case and listen to the evidence

1635
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:48,000
presented at trial

1636
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:51,039
in conjunction with the judge's

1637
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,440
instructions on how to

1638
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:54,558
understand and view that evidence so if

1639
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,559
a person can do

1640
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:01,680
that then they're considered unbiased

1641
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:05,039
so you know as a long-time

1642
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:07,519
defense attorney i you know i would be

1643
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,799
hesitant in a big case like this to pick

1644
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:10,318
a juror who's never heard

1645
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:12,239
of the case or anything going around

1646
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:12,880
because i'm thinking well who is this

1647
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:14,879
person and

1648
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,400
what what what in the world do they do

1649
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,119
uh uh

1650
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:21,039
so uh or or are they lying to me i mean

1651
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:24,720
how can you not have heard about

1652
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:27,039
uh this case um so they may bring other

1653
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:28,719
problems so i you know i don't mind so

1654
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:32,000
much people who've heard about the case

1655
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:32,399
or folks who've formed initial opinions

1656
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,880
uh

1657
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,160
but you you what you don't want is

1658
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,880
people who

1659
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:39,838
uh have tethered themselves to that

1660
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,559
opinion

1661
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:42,960
uh in a way that uh you know they can't

1662
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,160
be

1663
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,480
convinced uh otherwise so um

1664
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:49,598
but you also have people who uh as you

1665
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,240
suggested who just

1666
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,920
lie because they want to get on the jury

1667
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:54,798
or lie because they want to get off the

1668
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,880
jury so

1669
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:58,480
sometimes people come and say you know

1670
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,760
the most ridiculous

1671
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,960
outrageous offensive things uh to know

1672
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,640
because they know that they'll get

1673
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,240
excused for pause

1674
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:11,038
and others who um you can tell

1675
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:11,679
uh really badly want to get on the jury

1676
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,000
so they're

1677
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:16,480
you know they're just they pretend to be

1678
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,440
the the most uh neutral

1679
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,358
unbiased person in the world uh what the

1680
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,679
law calls the reasonable person we have

1681
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:26,558
in law the reasonable person standard

1682
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:28,639
yeah and i would tell my class the uh

1683
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,319
you know the the reasonable person in in

1684
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,038
real life is the

1685
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:34,159
person that you would be least likely to

1686
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,280
want to have a drink with

1687
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:39,358
the most boring uh neutral

1688
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,720
not interesting sort of person in the

1689
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:45,920
world and so a lot of jurors

1690
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:47,679
engage in the performative act of

1691
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,760
presenting themselves as the

1692
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:50,879
most sort of even killed rational

1693
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,319
reasonable

1694
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,920
person because they really want to get

1695
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:54,480
on the jury yeah there's an interesting

1696
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,159
uh

1697
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,318
question i apologize that i haven't

1698
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:01,358
watched a lot because it is very long

1699
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:02,719
i've watched it uh you know there's

1700
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:04,400
there's certain questions you've asked

1701
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:06,078
in the juris you asked in the jury

1702
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,880
selection

1703
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,680
i remember uh i think one jumped out at

1704
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:14,079
me

1705
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:15,759
which is uh you know something like

1706
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,680
does the fact that this person is a

1707
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:21,280
police officer

1708
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:23,759
make you feel any kind of way about them

1709
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,039
so trying to get it that you know i

1710
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,960
don't know what that is i guess that's

1711
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,520
bias

1712
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:32,159
and that's such a difficult question to

1713
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:35,358
ask like i asked myself of that question

1714
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:37,838
like how much you know we all kind of

1715
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:38,480
want to pretend that we're not racist we

1716
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:41,279
don't

1717
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,760
uh judge we don't have we're like these

1718
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,920
per

1719
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,039
word the reasonable human but you know

1720
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,680
legitimately asking

1721
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,440
yourself like are you what are the what

1722
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:50,719
are the prejudgments you have in your

1723
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,798
mind

1724
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:56,318
uh is that even impossible for

1725
01:04:54,798 --> 01:04:58,318
a human being like when you look at

1726
01:04:56,318 --> 01:04:59,838
yourself in the mirror and think about

1727
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:00,798
it is it possible to actually answer

1728
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:04,159
that

1729
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:07,920
yeah i look i i do not believe

1730
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:08,960
that people can be completely unbiased

1731
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,480
we all have

1732
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:15,519
baggage and bias and bring it

1733
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,798
wherever we go including to court

1734
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,599
what you want is to try to find a person

1735
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:23,038
who

1736
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:26,880
can at least recognize yeah when

1737
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:29,280
a bias is working and actively

1738
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,400
try to do the right thing that's the

1739
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,119
best we can

1740
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,440
we can ask so if a juror says yeah you

1741
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,760
know

1742
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,639
i grew up in a place where i tend to

1743
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,880
believe

1744
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,239
what police officers say that's just how

1745
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,240
i grew up but

1746
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:43,439
if the judge is telling me that i have

1747
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:46,000
to listen to

1748
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,000
every witness equally then i'll you know

1749
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,798
i'll do my best and i won't

1750
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,199
weigh that testimony any higher than i

1751
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:52,719
would

1752
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:54,239
any other testimony if you have someone

1753
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:57,279
answer a question like that

1754
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:59,038
that sounds more sincere to me uh sounds

1755
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,200
more honest and if you want

1756
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,599
a person you want a person to try to do

1757
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:05,199
that and then in closing arguments right

1758
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,798
as the lawyer

1759
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,719
right i'd say something like ladies and

1760
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:11,759
gentlemen you know we chose you

1761
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:15,038
to be on this jury because you swore

1762
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:19,039
that you would do your level best

1763
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:21,440
to be fair that's why we chose you

1764
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,720
and i'm confident that you're going to

1765
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,400
do that here

1766
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,239
so when you heard that police officer's

1767
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,920
testimony the judge

1768
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:32,078
told you you can't give more credit

1769
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,358
to that testimony just because it's a

1770
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,599
police officer

1771
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:36,798
and i trust that you're going to do that

1772
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,200
and that you're going to look at

1773
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:40,798
witness number three you know john smith

1774
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:43,598
you're going to look at john smith

1775
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:47,119
john smith has a different recollection

1776
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:49,280
and you're duty-bound duty bound to

1777
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,480
look at that testimony and this person's

1778
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,160
credibility

1779
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,318
you know the same degree as that other

1780
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:55,279
witness right and now what you have is

1781
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:57,679
just a he said

1782
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,400
she said matter and this is a criminal

1783
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:01,199
case

1784
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,240
that has to be reasonable doubt right so

1785
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:04,399
you know so you

1786
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:05,759
and and really someone who's trying to

1787
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,599
do the right thing

1788
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,039
uh it's helpful but no you're not going

1789
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:11,519
to just find

1790
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,799
14 people with no biases that's that's

1791
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:15,119
absurd well that's

1792
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:16,639
that's fascinating that uh especially

1793
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,039
the way you're inspiring the way you're

1794
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:20,558
speaking now is uh i mean i guess you're

1795
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,000
calling on the jury that's kind of the

1796
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:22,880
whole system is you're calling on the

1797
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,318
jury

1798
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:29,358
each individual and the jury to step up

1799
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:31,519
and really think you know to step up and

1800
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:34,960
be their uh most thoughtful selves

1801
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:37,440
actually most introspective like

1802
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,720
you're trying to basically ask people to

1803
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,639
uh

1804
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:44,480
be their best selves and that's and they

1805
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:46,960
i i guess a lot of people step up to

1806
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,559
that yeah that's what this system works

1807
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,880
i'm very i'm very pro jury juries

1808
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,599
they they get it right it works a lot of

1809
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,079
the time

1810
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:57,920
most of the time and they really work

1811
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:00,079
hard to do it

1812
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,079
so

1813
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,039
what do you think happens i mean maybe

1814
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:09,358
i'm not so much on the legal side of

1815
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,920
things but

1816
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:15,199
on the social side it's like with the

1817
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,960
o.j simpson trial

1818
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:19,198
do you think it's possible that derek

1819
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,480
shawn does not get convicted of the what

1820
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:22,479
is the second degree murder

1821
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:26,719
how do you think about that how do you

1822
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,600
think about the potential social impact

1823
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:31,198
of that

1824
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:34,159
the the riots the protests the either

1825
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:35,039
either direction any words that are said

1826
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:37,599
the tension

1827
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:38,479
here could be explosive especially with

1828
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,798
the cameras

1829
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:42,158
yeah so yes there's certainly a

1830
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:48,000
possibility that he

1831
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:52,318
he'll be acquitted for homicide charges

1832
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,960
for the jury to convict

1833
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,400
they have to make a determination as to

1834
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,560
officer chovin's

1835
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:05,278
former officer chovin's state of mind

1836
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:09,440
whether he intended to cause some harm

1837
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:11,839
whether he was grossly reckless

1838
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,399
in causing harm so much so that he

1839
01:09:11,838 --> 01:09:15,920
disregarded a known risk of death or

1840
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:18,719
serious bodily injury

1841
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:21,359
and as you may have read in the papers

1842
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:24,880
yesterday the judge allowed a

1843
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:28,079
third degree murder charge in kentucky

1844
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:31,119
which is cons it's

1845
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:34,719
the mindset the state of mind there

1846
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:37,439
is not an intention but it's a

1847
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:39,198
depraved indifference uh and what that

1848
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:42,000
means is that the jury doesn't have to

1849
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:44,879
find that he intended to do anything

1850
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,079
uh rather they could find that he was

1851
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,359
just

1852
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:52,399
indifferent to a risk

1853
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:55,039
uh that's dark yeah

1854
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:56,399
yeah i'm not sure what's worse uh yeah

1855
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,880
well that's that's a good point

1856
01:09:56,399 --> 01:09:59,839
but uh but but it's another basis for

1857
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,239
the jury

1858
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,920
uh to convict but but look uh you never

1859
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:05,359
know what what happens when you go to a

1860
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,960
jury trial so there could be

1861
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:12,479
a um an acquittal

1862
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:14,319
and if there is i imagine there would be

1863
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:18,238
massive uh

1864
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:21,279
uh protests uh if he's convicted i

1865
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:23,198
i i don't think that would happen uh

1866
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:24,960
because i just don't see

1867
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:26,719
at least nothing i've seen or read

1868
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:30,319
suggest that there's a

1869
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:32,640
a big pro uh chauvin camp out there

1870
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:33,679
ready to protest well there could be a

1871
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,000
is there also

1872
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:37,440
uh potential tensions that could arise

1873
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,520
from the sentencing

1874
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:41,599
i don't know how that exactly works sort

1875
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,920
of not enough years kind of thing

1876
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,719
yeah it could be like all that kind of a

1877
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,560
lot could happen

1878
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,480
so it depends on what he's convicted of

1879
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,960
uh you know one count i think

1880
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:52,319
is like up to 10 years another counts up

1881
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,319
to 40 years

1882
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:56,479
uh so it depends what he's convicted of

1883
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:59,599
and yes it depends on how much

1884
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,959
of the how much time the judge gives him

1885
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,880
if he is convicted

1886
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,480
uh that there's a lot of space for

1887
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,440
people to be very angry

1888
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:08,959
and so we will we will see what happens

1889
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:11,599
i just feel like with the judge

1890
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,319
and and the lawyers there's an

1891
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,679
opportunity

1892
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:18,479
to have really important

1893
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,199
long-lasting speeches i don't know if

1894
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:20,959
they

1895
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:22,719
think of it that way especially with the

1896
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,560
cameras

1897
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:27,520
it it feels like they have the capacity

1898
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,560
to heal

1899
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,960
or to divide um do you ever think about

1900
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,560
that

1901
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:36,319
as a as a lawyer as a legal mind

1902
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,840
that your words aren't just about the

1903
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:40,799
case but about

1904
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,840
the they'll reverberate through history

1905
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,960
potentially

1906
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:49,199
um that is that is certainly a

1907
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:51,679
possible consequence of things you say

1908
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:52,479
i don't think that most lawyers think

1909
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,840
about that

1910
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:56,799
uh in the context of the case your role

1911
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,000
is much more

1912
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:02,320
narrow you're the partisan advocate

1913
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,198
as a defense lawyer partisan advocate

1914
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:05,759
for

1915
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:07,359
uh that client as a prosecutor you're a

1916
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,320
minister of justice

1917
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:11,519
um attempting to prosecute that

1918
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:14,079
particular case

1919
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,960
but the reality is you are absolutely

1920
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:18,238
correct that

1921
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:21,279
sometimes the things you say

1922
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:23,439
will have a shelf life and you mentioned

1923
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:24,479
o.j simpson before you know if the glove

1924
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:26,559
doesn't fit

1925
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:28,639
uh you must have quit it's gonna be you

1926
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,600
know just in in our lexicon

1927
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,239
for probably a long time now so so it it

1928
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,800
happens

1929
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:36,559
but that's not uh and and shouldn't be

1930
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,039
uh foremost on your mind

1931
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,880
right what what do you make uh what do

1932
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:43,039
you make of those jason trout

1933
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,079
do you do you have a thoughts about it

1934
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:45,840
he's uh

1935
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:48,319
he's out and about and on social media

1936
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,239
now he's a public figure

1937
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:52,158
is there uh lessons to be drawn from

1938
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:53,439
that whole saga

1939
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:55,439
well you know that was an interesting

1940
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:56,559
case i was a young public defender i

1941
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:59,198
want to say in my first

1942
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,480
year as a public defender when that

1943
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:02,319
verdict came out so

1944
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:03,759
that case was important in so many ways

1945
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:07,599
one

1946
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:10,079
it was the first dna case a major

1947
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,440
dna case and there were significant

1948
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:15,439
lessons learned from that

1949
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:19,198
one mistake that the prosecution

1950
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:20,479
made was uh that they didn't present the

1951
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:23,759
science in a way

1952
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:27,759
that a lay jury could understand it

1953
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:30,719
um and uh what johnny cochran did was

1954
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,440
he understood the science and was able

1955
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,719
to

1956
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:38,399
uh uh translate that

1957
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:41,679
into a into a vocabulary that he

1958
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:45,359
bet that that jury understood

1959
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:47,679
uh so so cochran was dismissive

1960
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,039
of a lot of dna they say you know he

1961
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,920
said something like oh you know they say

1962
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:53,198
they found

1963
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:54,319
you know uh such and such amount of dna

1964
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:56,000
that's just like me

1965
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:57,359
you know wiping my finger against my

1966
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,960
nose and

1967
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:03,279
and and just that little bit of dna and

1968
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:05,279
uh that was effective because the

1969
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:07,119
prosecution hadn't done a good job of

1970
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:09,920
establishing that

1971
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:10,319
yes it's microscopic you don't need that

1972
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,000
much

1973
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:13,920
yes wiping your hand on your nose and

1974
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,679
touching something you can transfer a

1975
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,399
lot of dna and that gives you good

1976
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,719
information

1977
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:20,559
yeah but you know it was the first time

1978
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,560
that the public generally

1979
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,400
and that jury maybe since high school

1980
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,480
science had heard you know

1981
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:28,319
you know nucleotide i mean it was just

1982
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:31,519
all these terms getting thrown

1983
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:32,479
at them and and but it was not weaved

1984
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,600
into a

1985
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:38,799
narrative so cochrane taught us

1986
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,560
that no matter what type of case it is

1987
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,279
no matter what science is involved it's

1988
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,360
still about

1989
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:45,679
storytelling it's still about a

1990
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:49,279
narrative and he was uh

1991
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:53,039
and he was great uh at that at that

1992
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:56,079
uh at that narrative and was consistent

1993
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:59,359
uh with his narrative all the way out um

1994
01:14:56,079 --> 01:15:01,760
another uh lesson that

1995
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:03,519
was relearned uh it's that you know you

1996
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:07,199
never ask a question to what you don't

1997
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:10,159
know the answer that's like uh

1998
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:10,719
trial advocacy 101 yeah and so when they

1999
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:13,198
gave

2000
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,920
uh o.j simpson the glove and it wouldn't

2001
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:16,158
fit

2002
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,440
you know you don't you don't do things

2003
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:18,960
where you just don't know how it's going

2004
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:21,919
to turn out it was

2005
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,880
way way too risky and then and and i

2006
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,039
think that's what

2007
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,600
acquitted him because that glove the

2008
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:29,840
glove just wouldn't fit and he got to

2009
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,199
do this and ham in front of the camera

2010
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,159
and all of that and

2011
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:35,519
uh and it was big do you think about do

2012
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:36,799
you think about representation of

2013
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,120
storytelling like you

2014
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,239
yourself and your absolutely absolutely

2015
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:44,479
we

2016
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:46,959
tell stories it is fundamental we

2017
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:48,559
uh since time immemorial we have told

2018
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:52,880
stories to help us make

2019
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:55,760
sense of the world around us so

2020
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,199
as a scientist you tell a different type

2021
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:00,239
of story

2022
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:04,559
but we as a public have

2023
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:06,559
told stories from time immemorial to

2024
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,760
to help us make sense of the physical

2025
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,920
and the natural

2026
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:15,119
uh world and uh we are still a

2027
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,319
a species that is moved by storytelling

2028
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:19,119
so that that's

2029
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:20,000
first and and last in trial work you

2030
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:23,519
have to tell

2031
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,880
a good story um and you know the basic

2032
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:29,360
introductory books about trial work uh

2033
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,719
teach young students young students and

2034
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:33,679
young lawyers to

2035
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:34,719
to start in opening with this case is

2036
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:36,560
about

2037
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:38,239
this case is about and then you fill in

2038
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,679
the blank and you know that's your

2039
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:40,238
narrative that's the narrative you're

2040
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,079
gonna

2041
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:44,079
you're gonna tell and of course you can

2042
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:46,319
do the ultra

2043
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:48,079
dramatic the glove doesn't fit kind of

2044
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:49,359
uh the climax and all those kinds of

2045
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:51,279
things

2046
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:52,639
yes but that's the best of narratives

2047
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:55,759
the best of stories

2048
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,440
yes speaking of

2049
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,119
other really powerful stories that you

2050
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:00,879
were involved with is the aaron

2051
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:03,279
hernandez trial

2052
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,159
and the whole story the whole legal case

2053
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:07,599
can you maybe

2054
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:09,359
overview the big picture uh story and

2055
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:14,400
legal case of aaron hernandez

2056
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:14,399
yeah so aaron whom i missed a lot

2057
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,000
so he was charged with a double murder

2058
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:20,960
in in

2059
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,039
in the case that i tried and this was a

2060
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,079
unique case in one of those impossible

2061
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:27,359
cases

2062
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,319
uh in part because aaron had already

2063
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:31,759
been

2064
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:32,319
uh convicted of a murder and so we had a

2065
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,360
client

2066
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:37,599
who was on trial for a double murder

2067
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,880
after having already been convicted of

2068
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:42,079
uh a separate

2069
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:45,279
murder and we had a jury pool uh

2070
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:48,399
just about all of whom uh knew

2071
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:50,238
that he had been convicted of a murder

2072
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:51,439
because he was a very popular football

2073
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:54,158
player in boston

2074
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:55,359
uh which is a big football town with the

2075
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:57,519
with the patriots

2076
01:17:55,359 --> 01:18:00,158
uh so you know so everyone knew that he

2077
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:03,199
was a convicted murderer and here we are

2078
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:04,079
uh defending for uh in a double murder

2079
01:18:03,198 --> 01:18:07,599
case

2080
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:10,479
um so that was the that was the context

2081
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,239
it was not a case in the sense that the

2082
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:15,599
this murder had gone

2083
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:18,799
gone unsolved for a couple of years

2084
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:21,760
and then a nightclub bouncer

2085
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:24,239
uh said something to a cop who was

2086
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:28,079
working at a club

2087
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:29,119
uh that uh aaron hernandez was somehow

2088
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:31,198
involved in that

2089
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,640
in that murder that happened in the

2090
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:34,479
theater district that's the district

2091
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,039
where all the clubs are in boston and

2092
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:38,079
where the

2093
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:41,039
the homicide occurred and once

2094
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,920
the police heard aaron hernandez's name

2095
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:44,800
then

2096
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,679
it was you know they went uh all out in

2097
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,880
order to

2098
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:50,640
to to do this and they found a guy named

2099
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:54,719
alexander bradley

2100
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:57,760
uh who uh was a

2101
01:18:54,719 --> 01:19:01,359
a very significant uh

2102
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:05,039
uh uh a drug dealer in the

2103
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:08,158
uh sort of uh connecticut area

2104
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:12,399
uh ver very significant very powerful

2105
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:15,599
um and uh he essentially

2106
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:17,599
in exchange for a deal uh

2107
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,719
pointed to aaron said yeah i was with

2108
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,000
aaron and

2109
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:24,319
uh and aaron was the

2110
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,158
uh was the murderer uh so that's how the

2111
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:28,319
case came came to court

2112
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:31,119
okay so that that says the context what

2113
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:34,840
was your involvement in this case

2114
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:36,479
like legally intellectually

2115
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,760
psychologically

2116
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:40,319
win this particular uh second charge of

2117
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,640
murder

2118
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:48,000
so a friend uh called me jose baez

2119
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:49,280

2120
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,960
to

2121
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:53,599

students how to try

2126
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:07,840
cases so jose called me

2127
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:10,719
and said hey uh

2128
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:11,600
i got a call from massachusetts aaron

2129
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,800
hernandez

2130
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,440
uh you want to go and and talk to him uh

2131
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,679
with me

2132
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:18,559
so i said sure so we went up to the to

2133
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:21,920
the prison

2134
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:25,760
and um uh and met

2135
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:28,079
uh aaron and uh spoke with him for two

2136
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,400
or three hours that first time and

2137
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:31,359
before we left he said he he wanted to

2138
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:33,599
uh retain us

2139
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:35,198
uh he wanted to work with us and and

2140
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,679
that started the representation

2141
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:38,879
what was he like uh what would in that

2142
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,199
time

2143
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,639
what was he worn down by the whole

2144
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:45,678
process was there still

2145
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,000
he wasn't light in that he was not he he

2146
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,760
had

2147
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,520
i mean more than just the light he was

2148
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,800
luminous almost uh

2149
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:55,920
he had a radiant million dollar smile

2150
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:58,239
uh whenever you walked in uh my

2151
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,039
first impression i distinctly remember

2152
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:00,959
was

2153
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:02,639
wow this is what a professional athlete

2154
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,439
looks like and he walked in and he's

2155
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:06,319
just

2156
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:06,719
just bigger and more fit than you know

2157
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:09,439
than

2158
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:10,480
anyone you know anywhere and it's like

2159
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:11,839
wow this

2160
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:13,678
and you know when you saw him on

2161
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,760
television he looked kind of little

2162
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:17,359
and i was like so i remember thinking

2163
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,679
well what what do those other guys look

2164
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:21,359
like

2165
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:25,279
in person and

2166
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:28,479
and he's extraordinarily polite uh

2167
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:32,000
young uh is that i

2168
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:35,439
was surprised by how young uh he

2169
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,760
was both in mind and uh on body

2170
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:39,439
but chronologically i was you know

2171
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,880
thinking he was in his you know in his

2172
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:42,799
early 20s i believe

2173
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,560
uh but there seemed to be like an

2174
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,960
innocent stone uh in terms of

2175
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,480
just the way he saw the world uh i think

2176
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,079
that's right they picked that up from

2177
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:50,559
the from the documentary just taking

2178
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:53,920
that in

2179
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:57,440
i think that's right yeah yeah uh so

2180
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,440
there is a netflix documentary titled

2181
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,879
killer inside the mind of aaron

2182
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:02,079
hernandez

2183
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,359
what are your thoughts on this

2184
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:04,079
documentary i know if you've gotten a

2185
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:06,158
chance to see it

2186
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,079
i i did not i have not seen it i did not

2187
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:08,559
participate in it i know i was in it

2188
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:11,760
because

2189
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:14,000
of uh there was news footage uh that but

2190
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,199
i did not participate in it i had not

2191
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,319
talked to aaron about uh

2192
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:23,198
about uh press or anything uh before

2193
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:24,960
he he died uh my strong view is that the

2194
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:27,759
attorney-client privilege survives

2195
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,520
death and so i was not inclined to talk

2196
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,880
about anything that aaron and i talked

2197
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,000
about so i just didn't

2198
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,480
uh participate and and and never watched

2199
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,560
not even

2200
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:40,079
watch huh is that does that apply to

2201
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,080
most of your work do you try to stay

2202
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:42,880
away from the way the press perceives

2203
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:46,319
stuff

2204
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,639
um during uh yes i try to stay away from

2205
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:49,359
it

2206
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:50,960
i will view it afterwards i just hadn't

2207
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:52,319
gotten around to watching uh

2208
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,000
aaron because it's kind of it's kind of

2209
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:55,920
sad yeah so i just

2210
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,039
haven't watched it but i definitely stay

2211
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,319
away from

2212
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:01,920
the press during trial uh and

2213
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:04,079
you know there are some lawyers who

2214
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,480
watch it religiously to see what's going

2215
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,960
on

2216
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,759
but you know i'm i'm confident in my

2217
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,960
years of

2218
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:14,560
training and so forth that and that

2219
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:17,679
i can uh actively sense

2220
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:21,280
what's going on in the courtroom and and

2221
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:24,480
that i really don't need advice from

2222
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:26,880
joe 476 at gmail

2223
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:27,599
uh you know some random guy on the

2224
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,760
internet

2225
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,960
telling me how to try cases so yeah it's

2226
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,800
just to me it's just

2227
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,719
confusing and i just i keep it out of my

2228
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,039
mind and even if you think you can

2229
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:39,039
ignore it just reading it will have a

2230
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:40,479
a little bit of an effect on your mind i

2231
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:43,519
think that's oh i think that's right

2232
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:48,479
over time i might uh accumulate

2233
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:51,840
uh so the the documentary but in general

2234
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:54,638
it mentioned or kind of

2235
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,760
emphasized and talked about aaron's

2236
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,719
sexuality

2237
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,520
or sort of they were discussing

2238
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:02,800
basically

2239
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:06,080
the idea that he was a homosexual

2240
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:09,360
and some of the trauma

2241
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:11,439
some of the suffering that he endured in

2242
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:15,279
his life had to do with sort of fear

2243
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:16,719
given the society of of what his father

2244
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:19,279
would think

2245
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,079
of what others around him sort of

2246
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:22,880
especially

2247
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:24,319
in sport culture and football and so on

2248
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,639
so

2249
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:27,439
i don't know in your interaction with

2250
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:31,199
him

2251
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:32,879
was do you think that maybe even leading

2252
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:36,399
up to a suicide do you think

2253
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:39,520
his uh struggle with

2254
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:43,359
coming to terms with the sexuality had a

2255
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:46,000
role to play in much of his difficulties

2256
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:46,960
well i'm not gonna talk about my

2257
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,880
interactions

2258
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,639
with them and anything i derive from

2259
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:54,800
from that um

2260
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:58,719
but you know what i will say is that um

2261
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:02,320
a story broke on the on the radio

2262
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:05,760
uh at some point

2263
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:07,359
uh during the the trial that aaron had

2264
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,840
been in the same sex

2265
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:12,479
relationship with someone and some sport

2266
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:16,400
local sportscasters local boston

2267
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:20,638
sports casters or we really mushroomed

2268
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:24,879
uh the the the story so um

2269
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:27,679
he and everyone was aware of it

2270
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,039
you'll you also may know from the court

2271
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,560
record that

2272
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:36,079
the uh prosecutors floated a

2273
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:38,159
uh specious theory um

2274
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:40,079
for a minute but then backed off of it

2275
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:43,039
that you know that aaron was

2276
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,439
um that there was some sort of uh i

2277
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:46,479
guess

2278
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:48,399
gay rage at work with him and that might

2279
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:51,599
be a cause

2280
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:53,599
a motive for the killing and

2281
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,679
uh luckily they they really backed off

2282
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:59,679
for that that was quite an offensive

2283
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:01,279
uh claim in in in theory so um

2284
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:02,800
but um to answer your question more

2285
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:05,920
directly i mean i have no idea

2286
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:07,279
why he he killed himself it was a a

2287
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:10,719
surprise and a shock

2288
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:12,960
um i was scheduled to go see him

2289
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:14,800
like a couple days after it happened i

2290
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:19,439
mean he was anxious

2291
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:20,800
uh for um jose and i to come in and do

2292
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:23,439
the appeal

2293
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,960
from the murder which he was convicted

2294
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:26,000
for he wanted us to take over that

2295
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,800
appeal

2296
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,399
um he was talking about going back to

2297
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,159
football i mean he said

2298
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:33,759
well you talk about this or you earlier

2299
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:36,799
you talked about the sort of

2300
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:38,719
innocent aspect of him he said you know

2301
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,560
well ron maybe not maybe not the

2302
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:42,880
patriots but you know i want to get back

2303
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:45,039
in the league and i was like you know

2304
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,279
aaron that's that's going to be tough

2305
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:47,279
man

2306
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:51,039
but he really but you know he really

2307
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,920
believed it and uh

2308
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:55,760
and then you know for a few days later

2309
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,520
that to happen it was just it was

2310
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,800
a real shock to me like when you look

2311
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,920
back at that

2312
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:05,600
at his story

2313
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:08,639
does it make you sad very very

2314
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:12,079
uh i i thought uh so

2315
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:13,279
so one i i believe he he he absolutely

2316
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:16,079
did not

2317
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:17,439
uh commit the the the crimes that we

2318
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:20,479
acquitted him on

2319
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:23,759
uh i think that was the right answer uh

2320
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:26,000
for for for that um uh

2321
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,400
i don't know enough about bradley the

2322
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,719
first case i'm sorry to make uh

2323
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:31,679
make an opinion on but but in our case

2324
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:34,719
uh

2325
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:37,600
you know uh it was just he had the

2326
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:39,840
misfortune of having a famous name

2327
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,719
and the police department just really

2328
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:44,159
just

2329
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:47,198
just just really got got on him there

2330
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:49,359
so um uh yes it's

2331
01:27:47,198 --> 01:27:51,519
it's i miss him a lot it was very very

2332
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:53,359
sad surprising

2333
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:54,880
yeah and and i mean just on the human

2334
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:56,559
side of course we don't know the full

2335
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,039
story but

2336
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,440
just everything that led up to suicide

2337
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:03,119
everything led up to

2338
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:04,559
an incredible professional football

2339
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:07,198
player you know

2340
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,239
that whole story if uh remarkably

2341
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:10,719
talented

2342
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:12,799
athlete remarkably talented athlete and

2343
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:14,639
it has to do with all the

2344
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,840
all the possible trajectories right that

2345
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:18,719
we can take through life

2346
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,760
as we were talking about before and some

2347
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:23,600
of them lead

2348
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:25,840
to uh to suicide sadly enough

2349
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,960
and it's it's always tragic when you

2350
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,159
have absolutely yeah

2351
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,600
some you know somebody with uh with

2352
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:34,719
great potential

2353
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:37,120
uh resulting in the things that happen

2354
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:38,319
right people love it when i ask about

2355
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:42,000
books i don't know if

2356
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:44,479
uh uh whether technical like

2357
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,760
legal or fiction non-fiction books

2358
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:47,919
throughout your life

2359
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:49,679
have had an impact on you if there's

2360
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:52,239
something you could recommend

2361
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:54,719
or something you could speak to about

2362
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:57,519
something that inspired ideas

2363
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,719
insights about this world complicated

2364
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:01,840
world of ours

2365
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:05,279
oh wow uh yeah so uh

2366
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:07,679
i i'll give you a a couple uh

2367
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:10,319
so one is uh contingency irony and

2368
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:12,800
solidarity by richard wardy he's a he's

2369
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:15,198
passed away now but was a

2370
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,679
philosopher at some of our major

2371
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:21,039
institutions princeton

2372
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:24,800
harvard stanford

2373
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:26,319
um contingency irony and solidarity at

2374
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,119
least that's a book that really helped

2375
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:30,158
me

2376
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:32,319
work through um

2377
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:33,359
a series of thoughts so it stands for

2378
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:36,880
the proposition that

2379
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:40,559
uh that our most deeply held beliefs

2380
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:43,119
uh are contingent that there

2381
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:45,280
there's nothing uh beyond history or

2382
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:48,238
prior to socialization

2383
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:49,759
that's definatory of the the the human

2384
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:53,279
being that's rory

2385
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:54,480
um and he says that uh our most deeply

2386
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:57,359
held beliefs

2387
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:58,559
are received wisdom and highly

2388
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:01,599
contingent along

2389
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:04,880
an uh a number of registers

2390
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:06,159
and he does that uh but then goes on to

2391
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:09,199
say that uh

2392
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:11,679
he nonetheless uh can hold

2393
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:12,799
strongly held beliefs recognizing their

2394
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,639
contingency

2395
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,679
but still believes them to be true and

2396
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:21,440
accurate it helps you to work through

2397
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:24,319
what could be an intellectual tension

2398
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:25,039
uh other words so so you don't delve

2399
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:28,000
into

2400
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:29,439
one doesn't delve into relativism

2401
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,679
everything is okay

2402
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:33,198
but he gives you a vocabulary to think

2403
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:36,239
about uh

2404
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:37,919
uh uh how to negotiate these these these

2405
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:40,559
realities uh

2406
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,679
do you share this tension i mean there

2407
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,679
there is a real tension

2408
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,840
it seems like even like the law the

2409
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,800
legal system is all just the construct

2410
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,199
of our

2411
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:54,880
human ideas and yet it seems to be

2412
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:58,000
uh almost feels fundamental

2413
01:30:54,880 --> 01:31:00,719
to what a uh what a just society is yeah

2414
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,119
i i definitely share the tension and and

2415
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:04,800
love

2416
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:05,599
the the uh uh his his vocabulary in the

2417
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,800
way he's

2418
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,199
uh helped me resolve the the the tension

2419
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,920
so

2420
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:12,319
right i mean yeah yeah so like you know

2421
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:16,639
uh

2422
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:18,960
infanticide for example perhaps it's uh

2423
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,760
socially contingent perhaps it's

2424
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,960
received

2425
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,480
wisdom perhaps it's anthropological uh

2426
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,359
you know we need to propagate the

2427
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,599
species

2428
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:29,119
and i still think it's wrong yeah and uh

2429
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,600
and and

2430
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:32,880
and rorty uh has helped me develop a

2431
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:36,719
category to say

2432
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:39,199
to to say that no i can't provide

2433
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,158
any in rorty's words non-circular

2434
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:43,119
theoretical

2435
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:44,000
backup for this proposition at some

2436
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:46,399
point it's going to run

2437
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,800
me into in a circularity problem but

2438
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:50,799
that's okay i'm i i i hold this

2439
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:53,199
nonetheless and full recognition

2440
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,920
of its contingency but what it does is

2441
01:31:53,198 --> 01:31:57,519
is is

2442
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:59,760
is makes you humble and

2443
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,560
and when you're humble that's good

2444
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,119
because

2445
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,800
you know this notion that ideas are

2446
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:08,158
always already in

2447
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:10,719
progress never fully formed uh i think

2448
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:11,279
is is is the sort of intellectual i

2449
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:14,800
strive

2450
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:17,840
to be and if i have a a

2451
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,719
a sufficient degree of humility that i

2452
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:21,840
don't have the

2453
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:23,439
final answer capital a

2454
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:26,159
then that's going to help me to get to

2455
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:28,238
better answers lowercase a and

2456
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:29,439
and and rorty does that and he talks

2457
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:32,718
about

2458
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:34,638
uh uh in in the solidarity part of the

2459
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:38,800
book he has this concept of

2460
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:42,239
imaginative uh the imaginative ability

2461
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:44,480
to see other different people as we

2462
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:46,000
instead of they and i just think it's a

2463
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:48,158
beautiful concept but he talks about

2464
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,119
this imaginative ability and it's this

2465
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:50,719
active

2466
01:32:49,119 --> 01:32:52,840
process so i mean so that's a book

2467
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:56,158
that's done a lot of work

2468
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:59,679
uh for me uh over the

2469
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:00,319
the years um uh souls of black folk by

2470
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:03,039
w.b

2471
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:05,359
du bois uh was absolutely pivotal

2472
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:06,560
pivotal in my intellectual development

2473
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:09,759
uh

2474
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:12,880
one of the uh premier

2475
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:16,400
uh set of essays in

2476
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:17,039
the western literary tradition and it's

2477
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:20,119
a

2478
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:21,920
deep and profound sociological uh

2479
01:33:20,119 --> 01:33:24,960
philosophical

2480
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:28,480
and historical analysis of

2481
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:29,439
the predicament of blacks in america

2482
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:31,839
from

2483
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:33,439
um one of our country's greatest

2484
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:37,039
polymaths

2485
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:40,079
it it's just a it's a beautiful text

2486
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:43,198
and uh and i go to it uh yearly

2487
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:45,679
um so for somebody like me

2488
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:46,238
so growing up in the soviet union the

2489
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:48,079
struggle

2490
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:50,799
the civil rights movement the struggle

2491
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:54,158
of race and all those kinds of things

2492
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:55,840
that that is you know this universal but

2493
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:57,599
it's also very much

2494
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,199
a journey of the united states it was

2495
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,239
kind of a foreign thing that i stepped

2496
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:01,919
into

2497
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:03,519
um is that something you would recommend

2498
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:08,399
somebody like me to read

2499
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:11,760
or is there other uh things about race

2500
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:13,920
that are good to connect because my my

2501
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,280
my flavor of suffering and just i'm a

2502
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:17,359
jew as well

2503
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:18,639
my flavor has to do with world war ii

2504
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:20,719
and the studies of that

2505
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:22,319
you know all the injustice is there so

2506
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:23,520
i'm now stepping into a new set of

2507
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:26,880
injustices

2508
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,280
and trying to learn the the landscape i

2509
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,400
would

2510
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:33,359
i would say anyone is

2511
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:34,000
is a better person for having read uh du

2512
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:36,799
bois

2513
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,439
it's just uh he's just a remarkable

2514
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,960
writer

2515
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:42,479
uh and thinker and it uh i mean and

2516
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,560
to the extent you're interested in

2517
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:45,359
learning another history he does it in a

2518
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,560
way

2519
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:49,279
that is uh quite sophisticated so it's a

2520
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,400
uh

2521
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:52,960
so um uh i it's interesting i was going

2522
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:56,238
to give you

2523
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:58,800
uh three books uh i i

2524
01:34:56,238 --> 01:35:00,638
noted the accent when i met you but i

2525
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:02,480
didn't know exactly where you're from

2526
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,159
but the the other book i was going to

2527
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:07,439
say is dostoevsky's

2528
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:09,039
crime and punishment and uh i mean i've

2529
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:12,879
always wanted to go to saint pete's

2530
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:16,158
uh just to sort of see with my own eyes

2531
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:16,880
what the word pictures that dostoevsky

2532
01:35:16,158 --> 01:35:19,118
created

2533
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,639
in crime and punishment and you know i

2534
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:22,639
love others of this stuff

2535
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:25,118
too the brothers care and myself and so

2536
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:25,600
forth but crime and punishment i first

2537
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:28,399
read

2538
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:30,639
in high school as a junior or senior and

2539
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:34,399
it is a

2540
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:37,760
deep and profound meditation

2541
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:38,719
on uh the the both the meaning and the

2542
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,760
measure

2543
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:44,880
of our lives and uh uh

2544
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:48,000
dostoevsky uh obviously in in

2545
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:51,279
in conversation with other uh thinkers

2546
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:54,399
um uh really gets at the

2547
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:56,960
uh the the crux of

2548
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:59,039
a fundamental philosophical problem what

2549
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:02,079
does it mean to be a human being

2550
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:04,238
and um and uh

2551
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:06,079
for that uh crime and punishment

2552
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:07,198
captured me as a teenager and that's

2553
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:10,559
another text

2554
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:13,279
that i returned to uh often

2555
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:16,800
we've talked about young people a little

2556
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:20,158
bit at the beginning of our conversation

2557
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:22,239
is there advice that you could give

2558
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:24,079
to a young person today thinking about

2559
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:27,118
their career thinking about their

2560
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:28,238
life thinking about uh making their way

2561
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:30,399
in this world

2562
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:32,399
yeah sure i'll share some advice it

2563
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:33,118
actually picks up on a question we

2564
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:35,279
talked about

2565
01:36:33,118 --> 01:36:36,158
earlier with in in the academy in

2566
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:38,319
schools

2567
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:39,198
but it's some advice that a professor

2568
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,960
gave to

2569
01:36:39,198 --> 01:36:45,759
me when i got to harvard and

2570
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:47,920
it is this that uh you have to be

2571
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:49,679
willing to come face to face with your

2572
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:53,039
intellectual limitations

2573
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:54,639
and keep going and that's it and it's

2574
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:55,920
hard for people i mean you mentioned

2575
01:36:54,639 --> 01:37:00,560
this earlier

2576
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:02,560
to to face really difficult tasks to

2577
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,560
uh and particularly in these sort of

2578
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,280
elite spaces where you've excelled all

2579
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,600
your life

2580
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:08,880
and you come to mit and you're like wait

2581
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,159
a minute i don't understand this

2582
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:14,719
yeah wait this is hard i've never had

2583
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:16,479
something really hard before and there

2584
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:17,279
are couple options and a lot of people

2585
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:20,000
will

2586
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:21,439
pull back and take the gentleman or just

2587
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,279
a woman's b

2588
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:27,678
and and just go on or risk

2589
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:29,679
going out there giving it your all and

2590
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:32,399
still not quite getting it

2591
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:34,000
and that that that's a risk but it's a

2592
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:35,599
risk well worth it

2593
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,600
uh because you're just going to be the

2594
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,920
better person the better student for it

2595
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,000
and

2596
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:42,639
you know and even outside of the academy

2597
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,760
i mean come come face to face

2598
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:48,000
with your uh fears and keep going

2599
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,199
and keep going in in life and you're

2600
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,319
going to be the better

2601
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:53,359
person the better human being yeah it

2602
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:55,039
does seem to be

2603
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:57,359
i don't know what it is but it does seem

2604
01:37:55,039 --> 01:38:00,560
to be that fear

2605
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:00,960
is a good indicator of something you

2606
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:04,159
should

2607
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:06,800
probably face

2608
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:07,439
yes like fear kind of shows the way a

2609
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,159
little bit

2610
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:12,638
uh not always you might not want to go

2611
01:38:10,158 --> 01:38:16,079
into the cage with a lion but

2612
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:19,840
uh but maybe you should

2613
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:20,479
maybe uh let me ask sort of a darker

2614
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,319
question

2615
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:25,198
because we're talking about dostoevsky

2616
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:25,198
we might as well

2617
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:32,479
do you uh do you

2618
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:32,479
and connected to the uh

2619
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:36,158
freeing innocent people do you think

2620
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,239
about mortality

2621
01:38:36,158 --> 01:38:39,759
do you think about your own death are

2622
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:42,559
you afraid of death

2623
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:43,360
i'm i'm not afraid of of death i do

2624
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,639
think about it

2625
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,759
more now uh because i'm now in my mid

2626
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:49,920
50s

2627
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:52,159
so i used to not think about it much at

2628
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:55,359
all but

2629
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:57,920
the harsh reality is that

2630
01:38:55,359 --> 01:38:59,118
i've got more time behind me now that i

2631
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,800
do in front of me

2632
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:02,719
and it kind of happens all of a sudden

2633
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:05,920
too you realize wait a minute i'm

2634
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:09,359
i'm i'm actually on the back nine now

2635
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,480
uh so uh yeah my mind moves to it from

2636
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:14,000
time to time i don't

2637
01:39:10,479 --> 01:39:16,000
uh dwell on it i'm not afraid of it uh

2638
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,560
my own personal religious commitments

2639
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:22,399
i'm i'm i'm christian and my

2640
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:25,600
religious uh uh commitments uh buoy me

2641
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:28,319
uh that uh you know that that death

2642
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:29,679
and i i believe this death is not not

2643
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:32,000
not the end

2644
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:33,279
so i'm not afraid of it now this is not

2645
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,719
to say that i want to

2646
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:37,359
i want to i want to rush to the

2647
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:40,239
afterlife i'm i'm good right here

2648
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:40,880
for a long time i hope i've got you know

2649
01:39:40,238 --> 01:39:44,158
30

2650
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:47,199
35 40 more years to go uh but

2651
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:49,839
um but uh but no i don't i don't really

2652
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:51,359
i don't fear death though we're we're

2653
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,440
we're finite

2654
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:55,519
creatures we're all gonna we're all

2655
01:39:53,439 --> 01:39:58,799
gonna die well the mystery of it

2656
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:01,119
uh you know for for somebody

2657
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:02,800
at least for me we human beings want to

2658
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:05,839
figure everything out

2659
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:07,679
uh whatever the afterlife is there's

2660
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:10,960
still a mystery to it

2661
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:11,760
that that uncertainty it can be

2662
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:14,000
terrifying

2663
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:16,639
if you ponder it but maybe uh what

2664
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,639
you're saying is

2665
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:21,118
uh you haven't pondered it too deeply so

2666
01:40:19,118 --> 01:40:24,238
far and it's worked out pretty good

2667
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:26,479
it's worked out yeah no no no complaints

2668
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:28,638
so you said uh again the sayevsky kind

2669
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:31,839
of

2670
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:33,920
was exceptionally good at getting to the

2671
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:37,360
core of what it means to be human

2672
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:41,359
do you think about like the why of why

2673
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:45,679
we're here the the meaning of this whole

2674
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:48,158
uh existence yeah no i i do i think uh

2675
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:50,960
and actually think that's the purpose of

2676
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:54,238
an education what does it mean to be a

2677
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:56,719
human being and in one way or another

2678
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:59,359
we set out to answer those questions and

2679
01:40:56,719 --> 01:41:03,439
we do it in a different way

2680
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:06,559
i mean some may look to

2681
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:08,879
philosophy to answer uh these

2682
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,239
questions why is it in one's personal

2683
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:14,560
interest

2684
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:19,279
to um to do good to do just

2685
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:22,159
uh to do justice uh some may uh

2686
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:22,559
look at it through the economists lens

2687
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:26,158
uh

2688
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:29,039
some may look at it through the

2689
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:30,079
microscope in the laboratory that the

2690
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:33,840
phenomenal

2691
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:37,840
world is uh is is the meaning

2692
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:41,360
uh of life uh others may say

2693
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:44,400
that that's one uh vocabulary that's one

2694
01:41:41,359 --> 01:41:46,799
description but the poet describes

2695
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:48,158
a reality to the same degree as a

2696
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:51,039
physicist

2697
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:51,839
but that's the purpose of an education

2698
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:53,840
it's to

2699
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,360
sort of work through these issues what

2700
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:58,800
does it mean to be

2701
01:41:55,359 --> 01:42:00,559
a uh what does it mean to be a human

2702
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,719
being and i think it's a fascinating

2703
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:05,119
journey and i think it's a lifelong

2704
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:06,560
uh endeavor to figure out what is the

2705
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:09,679
thing that nugget

2706
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:10,400
that makes us uh human do you still see

2707
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:13,520
