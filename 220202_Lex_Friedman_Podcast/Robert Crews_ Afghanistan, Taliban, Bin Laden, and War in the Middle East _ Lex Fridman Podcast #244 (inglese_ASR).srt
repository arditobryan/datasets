in the description and now here's my

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,000
conversation with robert cruz

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,039
was it a mistake for the united states

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,839
to invade afghanistan in 2001 20 years

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,279
ago

12
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,240
yes

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,719
as simple as yes why was it a mistake

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,799
i'm a historian so i say this with you

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,000
know some humility about what we can

16
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,679
though i think you know i'd still like

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,920
to know much more about what was going

18
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,159
on in the white house you know in the

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,440
hours days weeks you know after 9 11 but

20
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,519
i think

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,878
the george w bush administration acted

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
in a state of panic

23
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,320
and i think they wanted to show kind of

24
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,479
toughness they wanted to show

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,840
some kind of resolve you know this was a

26
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,078
horrific act

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,920
that played out you know on everyone's

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,039
television screens and i think it was

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,960
really uh

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,399
fundamentally a crisis legitimacy within

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,719
the white house the level offs and i

32
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,400
think they felt like they had to do

33
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,000
something and something dramatic

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,920
i think they didn't really think through

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,879
you know who they were fighting you know

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,359
who the enemy was what this geography

37
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,679
had to do with 911 i think looking back

38
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,359
at it i mean some of us not to say i was

39
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,280
you know clairvoyant or i could see in

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,200
the future but i think many of us were

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,159
from that morning skeptical about the

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,560
connections that people were drawing

43
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,280
between afghanistan as a state

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,799
as a place and the actions of al qaeda

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
in washington and

46
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,920
new york and pennsylvania

47
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,719
so as you watch the events of 9 11

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,040
the things that

49
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,640
our leaders were saying in the in the

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,159
minutes hours days weeks that followed

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
maybe you can give a little bit of a

52
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,079
timeline in

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,840
of what was being said when was the

54
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:56,559
actual invasion of afghanistan and also

55
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,680
what were your feelings in the minutes

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,840
weeks

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,000
after 9 11. i was in dc i was you know

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,600
on the way to american university uh

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,118
hearing on npr

60
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,359
what happened

61
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,878
and i thought of the

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,120
american university logo which is red

63
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,639
white and blue it's an eagle and i

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,159
thought you know washington is under

65
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,519
attack and

66
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,560
symbols of american power are under

67
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,200
attack

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,120
and so um yeah i was quite concerned and

69
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,639
at the time lived yeah just a few miles

70
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,959
from the capitol

71
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,919
and so um you know i i felt it you know

72
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,680
it was it was real so i appreciate the

73
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,439
you know the sense of anxiety and fear

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,439
and panic and for

75
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,719
two three years later in dc we were

76
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,639
constantly getting

77
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,719
reports you know mostly rumors and

78
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,958
unconfirmed about all kinds of attacks

79
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,120
before the city so i definitely

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
um appreciate the sense of being under

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
salt

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
but in watching television including

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,840
russian television that day because i

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
just

85
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,479
just installed a satellite thing so i

86
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,919
was trying to watch world news and get

87
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,598
different points of view and

88
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,439
that was quite useful to have an

89
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,598
alternative you know a set of eyes in

90
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,439
russian yeah in russian yeah okay so

91
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,199
your russians is good enough to

92
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,120
understand uh russian television the

93
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,318
news yeah the news and the visuals that

94
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,680
were coming that were not shown on

95
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:08,719
american television

96
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,280
i don't know how they had it but they

97
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,199
had they were not filtering anything

98
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
in the way that the major networks and

99
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,759
cable televisions were doing here so it

100
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,679
was

101
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,679
a very unvarnished view of the violence

102
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,480
of the moment you know new york city if

103
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
people

104
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,518
diving from the towers are being just

105
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,639
you know it was really

106
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,480
they didn't hold back on that which was

107
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,919
quite you know fascinating i think much

108
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,759
of the world saw much more than actually

109
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,598
the american public saw

110
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,598
but to your question you know amid that

111
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,000
feeling of imminent doom

112
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:39,039
i watch commentators start to talk about

113
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
al qaeda and then talk about afghanistan

114
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,919
and

115
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,318
one of the experts was um was barnett

116
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,679
rubin who's at nyu he's a you know kind

117
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,318
of long

118
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,760
very learned um afghanistan hand

119
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,119
and he's brought on peter jennings on

120
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,840
abc news to

121
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,200
to kind of lay this out for everyone um

122
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,120
and i thought you know he did a fine job

123
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,560
but i think it it was formative in

124
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,239
cementing the view that

125
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,920
somehow al-qaeda was synonymous with the

126
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,759
space afghanistan

127
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,639
um i think

128
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,399
again

129
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,518
i was no al-qaeda expert then and i'm

130
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,640
not now

131
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,438
but i think my immediate thought went to

132
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,598
war

133
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,120
and because my background had been with

134
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,519
at that point mostly afghans who had

135
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,040
been displaced from decades of war

136
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,639
whom i encountered in uzbekistan who

137
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,720
were refugees and so on

138
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,000
i thought immediately my mind went to

139
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,680
the suffering

140
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,720
of afghan people that this war was going

141
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
to

142
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,680
sweep

143
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,560
sweep up of course the the defenseless

144
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
people who have nothing to do with these

145
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,839
politics so we should give maybe a

146
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,120
little bit of context yeah you can speak

147
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,839
too yeah

148
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,879
so assume nobody's an expert at anything

149
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,638
yeah so let's just say yeah um

150
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,360
you and i are not experts in anything

151
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,160
right

152
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,000
what

153
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,080
as a historian were you studying at the

154
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,079
time and thinking about see

155
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:55,279
uh is it is it the full global history

156
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,279
of afghanistan is it the region

157
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,519
were you thinking about

158
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:04,159
the muji hadin and al qaeda and taliban

159
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,639
were you thinking about the soviet union

160
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,199
the proxy war through afghanistan were

161
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,160
you thinking about iraq and oil like

162
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,240
what what's the full space of things in

163
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,280
your heart in your mind at the time i

164
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,918
mean just the moment of course it was

165
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,359
you know there's the sense of

166
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,279
you know the suffering and the tragedy

167
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,240
of the moment of you know what the death

168
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,679
that was i think i was preoccupied by by

169
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,280
the violence at the moment

170
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,918
um but as the conversation turned to

171
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,439
afghanistan as a kind of theater does

172
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,279
not respond to this moment i think

173
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,560
immediately what came to mind was that

174
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,038
little i knew about al-qaeda the times

175
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,280
tested that the geography was was

176
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,199
inaccurate that this was a global

177
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,599
network a global threat

178
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,280
that this was a kind of you know

179
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
a movement that went beyond borders and

180
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,918
i think that

181
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,279
it felt early on that

182
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,198
afghanistan was going to be used as a

183
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,239
scapegoat and it's intellectually at the

184
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,560
time you know i was teaching at american

185
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,319
university my courses

186
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,478
you know touched on a range of subjects

187
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,120
but i was trying to complete a book on

188
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,959
um islam in the russian empire actually

189
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,600
but in doing that research which took me

190
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,478
across russia and central asia purely by

191
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,840
accident

192
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,839
i had developed an interest in

193
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,638
afghanistan because

194
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,478
uh just again a series of coincidences

195
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,560
i found myself in tashkent the capital

196
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,318
of jupiter without housing

197
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
through an american friend who was like

198
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,720
the king of the market in tashkent he

199
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,319
knew everyone he run into some afghan

200
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
merchants there

201
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,560
they found out i didn't have a place to

202
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,759
live

203
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,759
i didn't know where afghanistan was

204
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,199
honestly this was 1997. i had a big idea

205
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,199
it was next door well you lived in

206
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,199
uzbekistan yeah in tashkent doing doing

207
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,478
distinction research yeah because it was

208
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,478
you know hub of the russian empire in

209
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,240
central asia yeah so just by accident i

210
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,279
ended up with these young afghans who

211
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,560
took me in

212
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,799
as roommates

213
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,160
and that i think that the sense of that

214
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,478
community

215
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,439
shaped my idea of what afghanistan is it

216
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,038
was my

217
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,680
first exposure to them

218
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,639
they're part of a trading diaspora they

219
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,240
brought

220
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,280
they had brought matches from riga

221
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,120
latvia

222
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,119
they somehow brought um

223
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,240
flour and some agricultural products

224
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,800
from from egypt and they were sitting in

225
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,519
enclosed containers in tashkent waiting

226
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,120
for

227
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,959
these pakistani state to permit them to

228
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,399
trade so these guys are mostly hanging

229
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,159
out during the day they'll get dressed

230
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,318
up they put on suits and ties like

231
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,560
you're wearing they'd polish their shoes

232
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,080
and they would sit around offices

233
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,598
drink tea

234
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,519
pistachios

235
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,839
then they'd feast at lunch

236
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,198
and then at night we would go out so

237
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,198
part of my research because i also had a

238
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,680
bottleneck in my research i was going to

239
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,759
the state archives in tashken

240
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,439
and because of the state of uzbekistan

241
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,439
you know that was a very kind of

242
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,800
suspicious thing to do so it took a

243
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,560
while to get in so

244
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,160
i had down time in touchkin just like

245
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,478
these guys so i got to know them pretty

246
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,479
well and it was really just a an

247
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,159
accidental kind of thing but

248
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,240
grew quite close to them and i developed

249
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
an appreciation of um

250
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,918
which now i think again thinking of the

251
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,680
seeds of all this um these people had

252
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,198
already lived

253
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
young guys you know in the 20s they'd

254
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,080
already lived in 67 countries

255
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,598
they all spoke half a dozen languages

256
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,918
one of my best friends there had been a

257
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,240
um a kickboxer

258
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,359
and breakdancer trained in tehran his

259
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,199
father was a theater person in

260
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,759
afghanistan

261
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,680
he told stories of escaping death in

262
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,520
afghanistan during the civil war

263
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,639
going to his pakistan escaping death

264
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,079
there

265
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,038
and these were very you know real

266
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,839
stories

267
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,560
can you also just briefly mention yeah

268
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:29,758
geographically speaking yes afghanistan

269
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,240
uzbekistan tajikistan you mentioned iran

270
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,599
right what uh who are the neighbors of

271
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,639
all this what are we supposed to be

272
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,240
thinking about for people i i was always

273
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,158
terrible at geography and spatial

274
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
information so can you lay it off yeah

275
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,480
i'm sure sure so tashkent you know it's

276
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
a it's the capital of uzbekistan

277
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,320
it was um

278
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,560
a hub of russian imperial power in the

279
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
19th century the russians take the city

280
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,199
from a local

281
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,600
kind of muslim dynasty in 1865

282
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,399
it becomes the city the kind of hub of

283
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,200
um soviet power in central asia after

284
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,320
1917 it becomes the

285
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,640
center of

286
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
the soviet republic of uzbekistan

287
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,799
which becomes independent finally in

288
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,320
1991 when the soviet union collapses so

289
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:17,359
these are all like these uh republics

290
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,278
are the fingertips of soviet power in

291
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,240
central asia that's right

292
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,399
and

293
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,320
they've been independent since 1991 but

294
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,958
they have struggled to

295
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,080
disentangle themselves from moscow from

296
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,079
one another

297
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
and now they face very serious pressure

298
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,600
from china

299
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,440
to form a kind of periphery of

300
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,120
you know the great machine that is the

301
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,160
chinese economy and its

302
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,959
ambitions to stretch across asia

303
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,519
um for afghanistan where my roommates my

304
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,599
friends hailed from um

305
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,799
afghanistan had fallen

306
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
into

307
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,039
civil war in the late 1970s

308
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
when leftists tried to cease power there

309
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,719
in 1978

310
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,519
the soviet union then extended from

311
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,160
uzbekistan you know crossing the border

312
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,679
with its forces in 1979 to try to shore

313
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,240
up this leftist government that has

314
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,838
ceased power in 1978

315
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,399
um and so

316
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,079
for central asians in the wider region

317
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,320
you know their their fate had for some

318
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,719
decades been tied to afghanistan in a

319
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,200
variety of ways but it became much more

320
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,200
connected in 1980s when the soviet red

321
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,120
army occupied

322
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,640
afghanistan for 10 years

323
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,519
and here i refer your listeners and

324
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,559
viewers to um rainbow three as the guide

325
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,399
to

326
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,879
the historically accurate historically

327
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,639
accurate the bible the bible of african

328
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,278
history and rainbow three yeah yeah as

329
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,439
as a fantastic um window onto the

330
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,278
american view of the war right but for

331
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,279
us afghans you know there are people who

332
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,399
fought against the soviet army

333
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,320
um but of a certain generation

334
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,200
the guys i knew

335
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
you know

336
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,000
their mission was to survive and so they

337
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,519
fled in waves you know by the millions

338
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,159
to pakistan

339
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,720
to iran some went north into south

340
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,759
central asia later in the 1990s

341
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,600
and some were displaced across the

342
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,240
planet so california where we're sitting

343
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,839
today has a large community that came

344
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,278
in the 80s and 90s

345
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,600
in the east bay

346
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:14,958
um can i ask a quick question that's a

347
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,839
little bit of a tangent yep what is the

348
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,359
correct or the respectful way to

349
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,680
pronounce

350
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,200
afghanistan afghanistan

351
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,838
i

352
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,759
iran iran

353
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:33,360
so as a russian speaker afghanistan yeah

354
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,120
are the on versus the and yeah is it a

355
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,120
different country by country as an

356
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,759
english speaker in america

357
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,360
is it pretentious and disrespectful to

358
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,919
say afghanistan

359
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,120
or is it the opposite respectful to say

360
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,120
it that way what what are your thoughts

361
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,879
on that that's a fascinating question um

362
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,200
i defer to the

363
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,439
people from those countries to of course

364
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,240
sort out those politics i think

365
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,519
you know i think one of the fascinating

366
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,600
things about the region broadly is that

367
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,919
it is a place of so many cultures and

368
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,200
really quite cosmopolitan

369
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,278
so i think people are mostly quite

370
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,879
forgiving about how you say

371
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:05,759
afghanistan afghanistan it's not like

372
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:07,039
paris

373
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,639
yeah yeah right right the french are not

374
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,159
forgiving

375
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,399
exactly and i think people are very very

376
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,240
forgiving and i think that you know

377
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,360
iranians are a bit

378
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,839
you know

379
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,000
more instructive in suggesting iran

380
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,200
rather than iran right

381
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,839
iraq

382
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,000
iraq you know i i think there's this

383
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,440
there's come to be a fit between

384
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,720
certain ways of pronouncing these places

385
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,079
and

386
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,839
the position that americans take about

387
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,519
them right so

388
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,040
it's more jarring when

389
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,159
people say

390
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,838
iraq

391
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,600
and it comes with you know a claim that

392
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,680
a certain kind of person you know should

393
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,920
be the victim of violence or yeah right

394
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,759
so yeah it's kind of like talking about

395
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,000
the democratic party or the democrat

396
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,600
party it's sometimes using certain kind

397
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,799
of terminology

398
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,480
to make a little bit of a

399
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,559
sort of uh

400
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,480
implied statement about your beliefs

401
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,039
that's fascinating yeah i mean i think

402
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,120
when i hear iraq and iran i mean i think

403
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,039
it yeah is it intentional in the case of

404
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,240
a democrat or is it just a

405
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,000
you know innocent whatever i think again

406
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,440
i think most iranians and afghans people

407
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,879
i know have have been

408
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,920
very cool about that

409
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,439
what

410
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,799
annoys afghans now i can say i think

411
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,600
it's fair to say i don't mean to speak

412
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,919
for

413
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,360
maine's people

414
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,240
but i can just share with our our

415
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,240
non-afghan friends um

416
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,480
the term afghani

417
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,839
uh is is a kind of term of offense

418
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
because that's the name of the currency

419
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,680
and so

420
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,599
a lot of people ask you know why

421
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,359
having especially again it's more

422
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,480
addictive to americans because you know

423
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,639
we've been so deeply involved in that

424
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,600
country obviously for the last 20 years

425
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,360
right so

426
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,199
afghans ask why after 20 years are you

427
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,199
still calling us the wrong name

428
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:50,240
what is the right name this is somebody

429
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:52,159
they prefer afghans afghans yeah and and

430
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
afghani is the name of the currency and

431
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,919
so i just dodged the book because i was

432
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
going to say yeah i don't know yeah

433
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,519
that's really great to know yeah and

434
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,799
it's it's again i think but i would

435
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,039
emphasize that

436
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,599
people are quite open and and you know

437
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,879
it's a it's a whole region of incredible

438
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,278
diversity and

439
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,879
and respect for linguistic pluralism

440
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,320
actually so i think that

441
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,480
you know but i also appreciate that

442
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,639
during in this context um when there's a

443
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,720
lot of pain you know in the afghan

444
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,560
diaspora community in particular

445
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,199
you know being called the wrong name

446
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,958
after 20 years when they already feel

447
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,000
so betrayed at this moment you know just

448
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,838
kind of

449
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,278
if one follows us on social media

450
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,120
that is one

451
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,439
kind of

452
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,360
hot wire right yeah so the reason i ask

453
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,600
about pronunciation

454
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,839
is because yes it is true that there are

455
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,159
certain things where mispronounced

456
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,240
kind of reveal that you don't care

457
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,078
enough to pronounce correctly that's

458
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,399
right you don't know enough to pronounce

459
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,559
correctly right and you dismiss

460
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,320
the culture and the people which i think

461
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,879
that's right as per your writing is

462
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
something that

463
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,078
if it's okay i'll go with afghanistan

464
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,078
just because i'm used to i say iraq iran

465
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,799
but i say afghanistan yeah that's great

466
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,479
is as you do in your writing uh

467
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,919
afghanistan suffers from much

468
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,680
misunderstanding from the rest of the

469
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:15,120
world but back yeah to our discussion of

470
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,159
uzbekistan tajikistan the whole region

471
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,799
that

472
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,159
gives us context for the events of 9 11

473
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,679
right right

474
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,078
so yeah if we go back to that day in the

475
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,599
weeks you know that followed um in my

476
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,838
mind went to the community i knew in

477
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,959
tashkent

478
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,759
which was interesting it was i mean they

479
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,838
were

480
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,919
so islam was the focal point of our

481
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,519
conversation in the u.s about 9 11 right

482
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,120
everyone to know

483
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,120
was relationship between

484
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,440
the terrific violence and that religious

485
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,320
tradition with its

486
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,839
you know

487
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,040
one billion plus followers across the

488
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,360
globe right

489
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,360
that became the issue of course for

490
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
american security institutions

491
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,039
for you know

492
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,719
local state and police institutions

493
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,159
right i mean it became the i think it

494
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,440
was the question that most americans had

495
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,600
on their mind so

496
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,440
again i didn't imagine myself as someone

497
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,519
who had all the answers of course but

498
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,360
given my background and coming at this

499
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,198
from russian history coming at this from

500
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,759
studying empire and trying to think

501
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,958
about the region broadly

502
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,199
you know i was very alarmed at the way

503
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,518
that the conversation went can i ask you

504
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,958
a question what was your feeling

505
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,120
on that morning

506
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,039
uh of 9 11

507
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,959
who did this isn't that it's not a

508
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,879
natural feeling there's a it's coupled

509
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,719
with fear yeah of

510
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,198
what's next especially when you're in dc

511
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,199
yeah but also who is this is this an

512
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:34,319
accident yeah is this a deliberate

513
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,719
terrorist attack is this uh domestic

514
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,959
like what were your thoughts of the

515
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,759
options and the internal ranking given

516
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,439
your uh expertise i mean i suppose i i

517
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,879
was taken by

518
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,240
the narrative that this was

519
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,480
international

520
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,799
i mean i'd also lived in new york during

521
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,079
one of the first bombings in 94 of the

522
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,439
world trade center

523
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,039
so it was clear to me that a radical

524
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,639
community had

525
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,078
really fixed new york as part of their

526
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,360
imagination of

527
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:00,879
and i immediately you know thought it

528
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,800
was a it was a

529
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,119
kind of

530
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,798
blow to american power and

531
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,798
you know i was drawn

532
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,000
by the symbolism of about you know if

533
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:10,879
you think of it as an act it was a kind

534
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,160
of

535
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,720
um an act of speech if you will kind of

536
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,480
a way of speaking to

537
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,318
from a position of relative weakness

538
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,640
speaking to a you know

539
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,318
an imperial power and that i saw

540
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,559
i saw it as a kind of symbolic you know

541
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,918
speech act of that with horrific you

542
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,678
know real world

543
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,360
um consequences for

544
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,880
all his innocent victims for the firing

545
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,519
of the police and just the

546
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,880
you know the horror of the moment um

547
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,639
so i i did see it as as transcending

548
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,880
the united states but i did not see it

549
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,320
as really having anything necessarily to

550
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,640
do fundamentally about

551
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,918
afghanistan and the history

552
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,679
of the region that i've been studying

553
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,919
and the community people that i knew

554
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,600
who were optically religious right that

555
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,720
the the guys i hung out with actually

556
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,000
wore me out because they wanted to go

557
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,839
out every night

558
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,839
they wanted to party every night we had

559
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,759
drinking yep we had discussions about

560
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,639
alcohol i mean uzbekistan is famous for

561
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,640
its

562
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,160
drinking it's drinking you know it's

563
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,240
that's something to look forward to so i

564
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,160
i do want to travel to that part of it

565
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,279
when was the last time you were in that

566
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,279
part of the world

567
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:17,678
early 2000s well then mid-2000s

568
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,359
so by the way we're drinking vodka what

569
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,720
what's the pur yeah i mean that kind of

570
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,199
choice

571
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,079
uzbekistan has incorporated vodka as as

572
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,759
the um the choice um

573
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,359
and that and it informs you know and

574
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,400
it's but but the fascinating thing you

575
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,399
know as a student is what you're

576
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,640

578
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,480
all

579
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,000
you know

580
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,240
culturally

581
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,359
new to me and i'm you know a student of

582
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,359
all that right as a graduate student

583
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,519
doing my work there so you're like jane

584
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,599
goodall of vodka and russia that's right

585
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:50,240
just observing that's right yeah and

586
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:53,119
then you you get you get the summagon

587
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,960
the grass vodka you get you know i have

588
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,439
i've had some long nights on the

589
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,600
kazakhstani frontier yeah that i'm not

590
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,360
proud of um

591
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,839
you know but you got to know the people

592
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,519
and some of them from from yeah but

593
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,720
intellectually so the thing i mean the

594
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,839
the fascinating thing there was it and

595
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,279
just as a

596
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,918
i mean there's a whole you know i'm

597
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,079
historian right but there there are

598
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,520
great contributions by

599
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,119
you know anthropologists and biographers

600
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,639
who who've gone across the planet and

601
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,839
try to understand how muslims understand

602
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,520
the tradition

603
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,639
at different contexts

604
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,440
so

605
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,280
many uzbeks will say you know

606
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,600
this is part of our national culture to

607
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,399
drink and eat as we please right

608
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,399
and yet i'm a very devout muslim and so

609
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,519
of course you can encounter other muslim

610
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,519
communities who

611
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,918
won't touch alcohol right but it's

612
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,519
become kind of i think it's very much um

613
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,200
you know soviet culture left a deep

614
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,279
impression in each of these places and

615
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,480
so their ways of thinking

616
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,480
ways of

617
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,599
performing ways of you know enjoying

618
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,759
oneself

619
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,519
that are shared across

620
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,519
soviet and former soviet space to this

621
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,400
day right and you've written also about

622
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,359
muslims in the soviet union that's right

623
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
uh

624
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,639
there's an article

625
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,038
that uh there's a paywall so i couldn't

626
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,440
read it and i really want to read it is

627
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,839
uh happy to share with you yeah moscow

628
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,759
and the mosque or yeah something like

629
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,519
that right right um

630
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,599
by the way just another tangent on a

631
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,000
tangent yeah uh so i bought all your

632
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,240
books i love them very much

633
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,640
one of the reasons i bought them and

634
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,159
read many parts is uh because they're

635
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,840
easy to buy

636
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,159
unlike articles

637
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,319
every single website has a payload yeah

638
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,080
yeah so it's it's very here i'm sorry

639
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,119
very frustrating to read brilliant

640
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,038
scholars such as yourself no no no um

641
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,479
i wish there was one fee i could pay

642
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,079
everywhere i don't care what that fee is

643
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,759
that's what it

644
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,038
allows me to read some of your brilliant

645
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,000
writing i don't think i hear you no i

646
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:45,119
think

647
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
moving toward

648
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,479
more kind of open source

649
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,000
formatting stuff i think is what a lot

650
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,960
of journals are thinking about now and i

651
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,400
think it's

652
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,679
definitely for the kind of

653
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,280
democratization of knowledge and

654
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,480
scholarship that's definitely an

655
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,599
important thing that we should all think

656
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,880
about and

657
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,399
i think um

658
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,159
you know we need to exert pressure on

659
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,679
these publishers to do that so i

660
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,440
appreciate this is what i'm doing here

661
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,240
yeah yeah good good yeah i appreciate it

662
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,400
so uh yeah so your thought was

663
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,240
afghanistan is not

664
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,480
it's not going to be

665
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,240
the center this is the source exactly

666
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,919
where it's not the center of this and

667
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,919
invading that country isn't going to fix

668
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,080
isn't going to fix the

669
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,200
you know toxic milestone of politics

670
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,879
that produced

671
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,919
911 right

672
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,600
against thinking of some of the

673
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,280
personalities just thinking about going

674
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,599
back to the touchdown story which i'll

675
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,359
end with i mean just observing you know

676
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,959
real muslims doing

677
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,558
doing things and then asking questions

678
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,000
about it and and

679
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,678
trying to understand

680
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,720
through their eyes what tradition means

681
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,720
to them

682
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,120
and then you have a we had we had a very

683
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,200
narrow conversation about what islam is

684
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,119
that you know generated immediately

685
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,240
exploded in you know on the day of 9 11

686
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,158
right

687
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,759
and then of course um

688
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,039
i think the antipathy toward islam and

689
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,879
muslims

690
00:21:55,038 --> 00:22:00,000
it was informed by

691
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,520
by racism and formed by xenophobia so it

692
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
became a perfect storm i think of

693
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,679
demonization

694
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,200
that

695
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,798
didn't sit with you know what i knew

696
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,558
about the tradition and with the actual

697
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,400
people that i had known because then

698
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,839
going back to i mean there were other

699
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,519
friends and encounters and so on but

700
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,199
just thinking about afghanistan and and

701
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,480
tashkent from what i mean

702
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,159
just that

703
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,440
thought about my friends who had been

704
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,440
who had suffered a great deal in their

705
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,038
short lives who've been

706
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,120
you know cast aside

707
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,279
from country to country but had found a

708
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,558
place in tashkent with some relative

709
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,839
stability

710
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:30,960
and you know they wanted to go out every

711
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,038
night

712
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,558
and you know they explained you know one

713
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:35,919
friend we talked about the alcohol and

714
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,200
all that and he he didn't get crazy but

715
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,799
he was like

716
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,880
you can drink but just don't get drunk

717
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,759
that's that's permissible within islam

718
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
right

719
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,679
um

720
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,520
and he's

721
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,600
you know i think pashtun i think uzbek's

722
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,759
had a different view you know

723
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,439
often the more vodka the better you know

724
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,679
and it doesn't violate as i understand

725
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,880
islam so even yeah it's kind of a silly

726
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,080
example but it's just an illustration of

727
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,360
the ways in which

728
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,038
different communities different

729
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,359
generations different people can come at

730
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,679
this very complex tradition

731
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,639
in so many different ways so

732
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,159
obviously

733
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,159
if whatever kind of scholar you are any

734
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,919
kind of expert whatever you're you know

735
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,200
it's always

736
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,679
disconcerting to see your field of

737
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,400
specialization be flattened right and

738
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,640
then be flattened and then be turned to

739
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,360
arguments for for violence right mixed

740
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,640
up with the natural human right feelings

741
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:27,119
of hate yeah and uh and hurt depression

742
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,320
and pain so i you know i mean that day i

743
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:32,639
vividly remember i sat with um

744
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,879
other phd historians in different fields

745
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,640
we you know we oddly enough had lunch

746
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,960
that day and it kind of deserted

747
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,720
washington's place was open we went

748
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,840
um and we just thought you know this is

749
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,200
gonna kind of

750
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,678
open up like

751
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,840
a great mall of destruction

752
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:52,080
and you know the american state is going

753
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,599
to destroy and it's going to destroy in

754
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,199
this geography

755
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,719
and i thought that was

756
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,600
misplaced for lots of reasons and then i

757
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,038
think

758
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,319
if when you know

759
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,079
i'd

760
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,439
been doing some research on afghanistan

761
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,038
then i was kind of shifting to the south

762
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,360
and i had

763
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,960
been looking at the talbot on um from

764
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,479
afar for some years and you know i think

765
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,640
it's clear now that in respect there

766
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,480
were opportunities for alternative

767
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,799
policies at that moment

768
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,960
so what should

769
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,639
the conversation have been like what

770
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,200
should we have done

771
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,080
differently because

772
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,480
you know

773
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:32,480
from a perspective of the time the

774
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,360
united states was invaded by a foreign

775
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,519
force

776
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,199
what is the proper response or what is

777
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,879
the proper conversation about the proper

778
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,120
response at the time what do you think

779
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,880
you know i know my colleague at stanford

780
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,479
con lisa rice would tell me this is

781
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,240
above my pay grade

782
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,839
and um you know she makes a point in her

783
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,558
classes to talk about

784
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,000
how difficult decision making is under

785
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,960
such intense pressure

786
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,240
and i appreciate that um you know i am

787
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
an historian who sits safely in my

788
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,599
office

789
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,278
i don't like battlefields i don't like

790
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,959
taking risks um

791
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,038
so i can see all those limits you know

792
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,400
i'm not a military expert

793
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:07,519
i've been accused of being a spy

794
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,640
wherever i've gone because the way i

795
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,359
look and because of my nationality and

796
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,880
so on but i'm not a spy so i defer

797
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,719
you know i respect the expertise of all

798
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,960
those communities but i think

799
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,480
they acted out of ignorance

800
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,440
they acted i think because i mean if you

801
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,960
think of the

802
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,038
in a way there was

803
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,120
a compensatory aspect of this

804
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,079
decision-making i mean

805
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:30,000
the bush administration failed this was

806
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,519
an extraordinary failure right so if we

807
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,519
start way if we're going to break down

808
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,679
the fear of intelligence i mean if they

809
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,720
if you follow the story of richard clark

810
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,960
um

811
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,360
who's richard clark he was a

812
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,278
national security expert who was tasked

813
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,479
with following al qaeda

814
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,159
who had

815
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,360
produced a dossier

816
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,200
under the clinton administration that he

817
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,639
passed on to the george w bush

818
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,000
administration

819
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,679
and if you look at

820
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,119
the work of conor lisa rice she wrote a

821
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,120
very famous

822
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,558
i think unpaywalled foreign affairs

823
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,959
article that you can read

824
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,879
announcing the george w bush foreign

825
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,200
policy kind of outlook

826
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,360
and it was all about great powers it's

827
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,840
about the rise of china is about russia

828
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,918
i mean there's definitely a kind

829
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:14,720
of hangover of

830
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,919
those who missed having russia as the

831
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,519
boogeyman

832
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,520
who spoke you know the clinton's mission

833
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:22,720
repeated again again the idea of making

834
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:25,599
sure the bear stayed in his cage

835
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,759
which is why the united states

836
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,038
threw a lifeline to the central asian

837
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,960
states

838
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,119
hoping to have pipelines

839
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,120
hoping to shore up their

840
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,798
national sovereignty as a way of

841
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,119
containing

842
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,000
russia initially but also iran yeah

843
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,119
which sits to the south and west

844
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,240
and then peripherally looking down the

845
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,439
road to china to the east so the the

846
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,159
bear is

847
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,480
what like russia

848
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,960
or is is it kind of like some weird

849
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,480
combination of russia iran and china but

850
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,480
the bears russia and and russia is

851
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,919
this um i think i'm trying to

852
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,000
characterize the imagination of some of

853
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,919
these yeah bachelor figures

854
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,038
um this is an image formed in the cold

855
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,880
war

856
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,400
i mean it has deeper seeds and

857
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,840
european and western intellectual

858
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,679
thought that go

859
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,558
back at least to

860
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,880
the 1850s in the reign of zarnickels the

861
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,918
first when we first get this language

862
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,120
about um the russian empire is this kind

863
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,720
of evil

864
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,918
uh polity

865
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,480
obviously this was

866
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,480
a kind of pillar of reaganism

867
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,480
um but the clinton folks kept that a lot

868
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,720
alive they wanted to make sure that

869
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,960
you know american power would be

870
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,240
you know unmatched and they

871
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,480
being creatures of the cold war

872
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,679
themselves they looked to

873
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,720
russia as

874
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,559
a resurgent power well before putin was

875
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,079
even thought of yeah i mean this is you

876
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,038
mentioned one

877
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:54,639
deep uh profound historical piece in

878
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:56,000
rambo it's probably uh the this this

879
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,880
conflict has to do with another

880
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,119
celestial stone movie iraqi iv which is

881
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,919
also historically accurate and based on

882
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,879
uh

883
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,799
it's basically a documentary so um

884
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,240
there is something about the american

885
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,319
power even

886
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,480
at the level of condoleezza rice these

887
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,079
respected uh deep

888
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,319
kind of uh

889
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,519
leaders and thinkers about history in

890
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:20,558
the future

891
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,839
where they like to have competition with

892
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,278
other super powers right and almost

893
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,599
conjure up

894
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,480
super powers even when

895
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,558
those

896
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,720
countries don't maybe

897
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,240
at the time at least deserve the label

898
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,720
superpower that's right a great point

899
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,880
yeah they're all allow some points so

900
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,960
yeah i mean russia was i think many many

901
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,200
experts i mean my my mentor at princeton

902
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,798
um stephen kawkin you know

903
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,080
was then writing great things about how

904
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,679
you know

905
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,199
if you look at russia's economy the

906
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,278
scale of its gdp

907
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,600
you know its capacity to actually act

908
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:57,839
globally it's all quite limited

909
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:59,759
um but kanye rice and the people around

910
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,599
you know came into power with george w

911
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,440
bush thinking that you know

912
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,319
the foreign policy challenges of her era

913
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,880
would be

914
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,079
those of the past right richard clark

915
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,320
and others within the administration

916
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,398
warn that in fact there is this group

917
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,558
that has declared war against the united

918
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,398
states and they are coming for us

919
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,879
the fbi had been following these people

920
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,479
around for many months and so

921
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,679
you know by the time george w bush comes

922
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,440
to power

923
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,720
lots of al-qaeda activists are well not

924
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,960
lost but you know

925
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,600
perhaps a dozen or so are already you

926
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,120
know training in the united states right

927
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,398
i mean what we knew immediately from the

928
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,239
biographies of some of the characters of

929
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,079
the attackers of 9 11

930
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,079
it was a hodgepodge of people from

931
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,398
across the planet but most of they were

932
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,439
saudi right and that was known very

933
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,558
early on or presumed very long so again

934
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,880
if we go back to your big question about

935
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,480
the geography why afghanistan

936
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,480
it didn't add up right it seemed to me

937
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,399
that afghanistan was a kind of

938
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,200
soft target it was a place to

939
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:58,158
have explosions to

940
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,000
seemingly recapture american supremacy

941
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,679
um and also i think there was in many

942
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,240
quarters there was a deep urge for

943
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,679
revenge and this was the place to

944
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,278
have some casualties have some

945
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,038
explosions

946
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,440
and then i think you know restore the

947
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,839
legitimacy of the bush administration by

948
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,159
showing that we are in charge we'll pay

949
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,158
i think there's a very old-fashioned

950
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,080
punitive dimension which

951
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,440
rests upon the presumption that if we

952
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,599
intimidate these people

953
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,880
they'll know not to try this again right

954
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,398
all these i would suggest are all

955
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,520
misreadings of a

956
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,678
of an organization that was always

957
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,879
global it had no real center i mean

958
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,640
called itself the center that's one way

959
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,480
to translate al qaeda

960
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,559
but that center was really in the

961
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,319
imagination um

962
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,359
bin laden bounced around from country to

963
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,079
country

964
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,759
um and crucially i think

965
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,558
a dimension that i don't claim to know

966
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,480
anything new about but has endured as a

967
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,319
kind of doubt is the role of saudi

968
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,679
arabia and the fact that you know the

969
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,839
muscle in that operation of 9 11

970
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,200
was saudi right i mean this was a saudi

971
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,959
operation with

972
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,679
if one thing so again just on the basis

973
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,120
of nationalities saudis you know an

974
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,919
egyptian or two a lebanese guy and

975
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,359
the

976
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,399
egyptian guy you know had been studying

977
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,000
in germany he was an urban planner right

978
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,359
um so if one thinks of the imagination

979
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,960
of this i mean

980
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,879
and in fact if you look at the kind of

981
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,798
typology of

982
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,480
the figures who have led this radical

983
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:21,918
movement i mean if you think of the the

984
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,038
global jihadists

985
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,360
they are

986
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,519
mostly not religious scholars right but

987
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,199
london was not a political scholar

988
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,480
his training was an engineer you know

989
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,399
some biographers claim that he was a

990
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,360
playboy for much of his youth

991
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:37,038
but really the the these ideas i think

992
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,479
that's probably why they chose the twin

993
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,480
towers i mean

994
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,720
this is uh

995
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,159
an imagination fueled by

996
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,200
training and engineering i mean a lot of

997
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,640
the

998
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,558
you know the sociology if you do a kind

999
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,799
of post pornography of a lot of these

1000
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,480
leading jihadists

1001
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,319
their backgrounds are not in islamic

1002
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,839
scholarship but actually in engineering

1003
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,038
and kind of practical sciences and

1004
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,158
professions

1005
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,359
medical doctors are among their ranks um

1006
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,200
and so there's long been a tension

1007
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,278
between islamic scholars who devote

1008
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,840
their whole lives to study of texts and

1009
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,519
commentary and interpretation

1010
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,158
and then what some scholars call kind of

1011
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,640
new intellectuals new muslim authorities

1012
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,840
who actually have secular university

1013
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,200
educations

1014
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,199
often in the natural sciences or

1015
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,798
engineering and technical fields who

1016
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,480
then bring that kind of

1017
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:23,839
mindset if you will

1018
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,200
to

1019
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,558
what muslims college called the

1020
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,120
religious sciences

1021
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,839
which are you know a field of

1022
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,719
kind of ambiguity and of gradation

1023
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:37,199
and of subtlety and nuance and

1024
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,360
really of decades of training before one

1025
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,640
becomes authoritative to speak about

1026
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,278
issues like whether or not it's

1027
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,679
legitimate to take someone else's life

1028
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,278
with the relation to afghanistan who was

1029
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,480
bin laden

1030
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:53,599
milan was a a visitor um

1031
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,839
if you look at his whole life course

1032
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,199
part of it is an enigma still you know

1033
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:00,000
he

1034
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,038
is from a saudi elite family but a

1035
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,359
family that kind of has a yemeni

1036
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,879
arabian sea kind of

1037
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,839
genealogy

1038
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,159
so the family has no relationship to

1039
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:14,480
afghanistan pastor president except

1040
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,799
at some point in 1980s when he went like

1041
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,558
thousands of other young saudis

1042
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:20,558
first to pakistan to places like

1043
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:21,678
peshawar on the border

1044
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:23,918
where

1045
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,519
they wanted to aid the jihad in some

1046
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,038
capacity

1047
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,759
and for the most part

1048
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,398
the

1049
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,839
arabs who went opened up hospitals some

1050
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,439
opened up schools

1051
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:34,798
the bin laden family

1052
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,120
had long been

1053
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,319
based in engineering construction

1054
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,918
so it's thought that he used some of

1055
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,278
those skills and resources and

1056
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,679
connections to

1057
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,440
build things um

1058
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,559
you know we have images of him firing a

1059
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,798
gun

1060
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,879
uh for show right it's not clear that he

1061
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,639
ever actually fired a gun in what we

1062
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,760
would call combat

1063
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,440
um

1064
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,398
again i could be corrected by this and i

1065
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,399
think you know

1066
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,839
they're competing accounts of who he was

1067
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:01,439
so he's kind of a

1068
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,759
i mean these figures that he said at the

1069
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,399
pinnacle of this world are

1070
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,320
you know fictive heroes that people you

1071
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:09,358
know map their aspirations onto right

1072
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,720
and so

1073
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:13,199
people like mueller omar who was then

1074
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,678
head of the taliban

1075
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,519
was rarely seen in public

1076
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,440
the current head held on

1077
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:22,079
is almost never seen in public i mean

1078
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,838
this kind of studied air of um mystery

1079
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,000
that they've cultivated

1080
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,759
to make themselves available for

1081
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,159
all kinds of fantasies right do you

1082
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,159
think he believed so his religious

1083
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:38,960
beliefs you think he believed

1084
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,720
some of the more extreme things

1085
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,800
that enable him

1086
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,918
to commit terrorist acts maybe put

1087
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,919
another way

1088
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,638
what makes a man want to become a

1089
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:51,279
terrorist and what aspect of bin laden

1090
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,358
made him want to be a terrorist

1091
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,800
great um i mean let me offer some

1092
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,358
observations i think you know there are

1093
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,519
others who know more about bin laden and

1094
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,480
and have far more expertise in al qaeda

1095
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,119
so

1096
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,559
i'm coming this

1097
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,160
in an adjacent way kind of from

1098
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,759
afghanistan and from my historical

1099
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:09,440
training so

1100
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,440
this is my two cents so you know bear

1101
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,440
with me um i'm i don't have the

1102
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,358
authoritative account which in itself is

1103
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,720
fascinating because you're a historian

1104
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:21,358
of afghanistan and the fact that

1105
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,039
bin laden isn't a huge part of your

1106
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,759
focus of study

1107
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,639
just means that bin laden is not a keem

1108
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,040
part

1109
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,039
of the history of afghanistan except

1110
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,960
that america made him a key part of the

1111
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,400
history of afghanistan i would endorse

1112
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,960
that definitely that's it i mean you put

1113
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,960
it in a very pity pity way um

1114
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,320
yeah so listen he was he was a so he was

1115
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,960
an engineer

1116
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,880
he was said to be a playboy um he spent

1117
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,800
a lot of cash from his family

1118
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,320
you know like many young saudis

1119
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,400
and from some other countries he was

1120
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,640
inspired by this idea

1121
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,559
that that was jihad in afghanistan

1122
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,078
it was going to take down

1123
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,119
one of the two superpowers the soviet

1124
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,800
union

1125
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,480
who you know the red army did murder

1126
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,680
hundreds of thousands perhaps as many as

1127
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,559
two million

1128
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,759
um

1129
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,199
afghan civilians during that conflict

1130
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,560
it's very

1131
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,879
you know

1132
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,719
plausible and very you know completely

1133
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,838
understandable that many young people

1134
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,919
would see

1135
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:20,480
that cause as

1136
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,240
you know the righteous pious

1137
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,679
fighters for jihad who call themselves

1138
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,319
mujahideen

1139
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:29,919
arrayed against this evil empire right

1140
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,039
of a godless soviet empire that

1141
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,800
when there's even confusion about what

1142
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,000
soviets wanted right now now we know

1143
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,000
much more about like what the kremlin

1144
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,440
wanted what brezhnev wanted

1145
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,719
and how they elite thought about it

1146
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,480
because we have many more of their

1147
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,838
records but from the outside you know

1148
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,000
for jimmy carter

1149
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,880
and then for reagan it looked like

1150
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,639
the soviets were making a move on

1151
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,880
on south asia because they wanted to get

1152
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,480
to the warm water ports you know which

1153
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,640
russians always want supposedly right

1154
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,000
and it was kind of a move to take over

1155
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:58,400
our oil

1156
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,079
and you know to assert world domination

1157
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,358
right so there are lots of ways in which

1158
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,920
this looked like

1159
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,358
good resival in congress it looked like

1160
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,119
um

1161
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,039
you know kind of vietnam again but this

1162
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,680
time this is our chance to get them and

1163
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,880
there are lots of great quotes uh i mean

1164
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,719
disturbing but

1165
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,720
really revealing quotes that american

1166
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,879
possibilities made about wanting to give

1167
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,639
the soviets their vietnam

1168
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,400
so the cia

1169
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,358
funneled you know

1170
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,358
hundreds of millions of dollars into

1171
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,358
this project to back the mujahideen you

1172
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,279
know who reagan called freedom fighters

1173
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,559
and so milan was part of that universe

1174
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,280
he's part of that you know he's swimming

1175
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,838
in the ocean of these afghan mujahideen

1176
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,519
who out in size you know did 95 of the

1177
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:39,199
fighting they're the ones who died

1178
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,920
they're the ones who defeated the red

1179
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:44,719
army right the arabs that were there did

1180
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,320
a little fighting a lot of it was for

1181
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,559
you know their purposes it was to get

1182
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,240
experience it was to

1183
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,480
kind of create their reputations like

1184
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,039
bin laden began to forge for himself

1185
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,800
of being spokesman for a global project

1186
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,639
because by the late 80s

1187
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,760
when bin laden i think was more active

1188
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,598
and began

1189
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,240
conspiring with people from other arab

1190
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,240
countries the idea that you know

1191
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:08,000
gorbachev power in 85 he's like let's

1192
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,879
get out of here this is this is draining

1193
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,039
the soviet budget it's an embarrassment

1194
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,519
uh we didn't think about this properly

1195
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,119
let's focus on restoring

1196
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:19,119
um the party

1197
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,640
and strengthening the soviet union

1198
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,640
let's get out of this costly war you

1199
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,598
know it's it's it's a waste um it's not

1200
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:25,039
worth it

1201
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,240
we don't lose anything by getting out of

1202
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:30,559
afghanistan

1203
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:31,919
um and so their retreat was quite

1204
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,599
uh effective and successful from the

1205
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,440
soviet point of view right it's not what

1206
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,440
we're seeing now

1207
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,720
what year was the retreat um i mean it

1208
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,639
began

1209
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,719
so michael gorbachev kind of found out

1210
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,400
85 you know he was a generation younger

1211
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,399
than the other guys

1212
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,760
he was a critic of the system he didn't

1213
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
want to abolish it he wanted to reform

1214
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,720
it

1215
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,280
he was a true believer in in soviet

1216
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,159
socialism and in the in the party as a

1217
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,000
you know

1218
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,838
a monopolist right

1219
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,519
um but he's critical of the old guard

1220
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,759
and recognized that

1221
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:03,358
the party had to change and the whole

1222
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,400
system had changed to continue to

1223
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,159
compete

1224
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,280
and so afghanistan was one element of

1225
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,480
this

1226
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,920
and so he

1227
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,000
pushed

1228
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,119
the afghan elites that moscow was

1229
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,719
backing

1230
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,160
to basically say listen we're going to

1231
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,679
share power

1232
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,598
and so

1233
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:22,239
a figure named najibola

1234
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,599
who was a soviet trained

1235
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:27,358
intelligence specialist sitting in kabul

1236
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,160
agreed and he said we need to have a

1237
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:33,119
more kind of pluralistic

1238
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,078
accommodations approach to our enemies

1239
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,480
who are

1240
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,119
backed by the us mainly sitting in

1241
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,639
pakistan stated in iran

1242
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,760
backed by these arabs to agree getting

1243
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:45,838
money from saudi and he said let's draw

1244
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,280
some of them into the government and

1245
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:48,400
basically have a kind of unity

1246
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,640
government

1247
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,280
that makes some space the opposition

1248
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,519
and for the most part with u.s backing

1249
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,359
with pakistani backing with iranian

1250
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,280
backing and with saudi backing the

1251
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:00,480
opposition said no we're not going to

1252
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,480
reconcile

1253
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,719
we're going to push you off the cliff

1254
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,639
and so that story goes on from at least

1255
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:08,639
1987

1256
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,719
the last soviet red army troops leave

1257
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,960
early 1989

1258
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,118
um but the nigeria government

1259
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,119
holds on for three more years

1260
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,559
it is the um i mean they're still

1261
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,920
getting some help from the soviet union

1262
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:21,599
its enemies are still getting help from

1263
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,838
the us mainly

1264
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,960
and um it's not 1992 that that um that

1265
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:29,358
they lose

1266
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,639
and then the mujahideen come to power

1267
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:33,039
they immediately

1268
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,719
you know they're deeply fractured and

1269
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,400
that's where bin laden is watching all

1270
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,838
of this unroll that's right and he's

1271
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,800
he's part of the me he's also mobile so

1272
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,480
he he at one point you know goes um

1273
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,079
you know he's in sudan you know he's

1274
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,519
he's moving from place to place his

1275
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,920
people are all over the world in fact

1276
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,000
they i mean if you think of the

1277
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,358
once the mujahideen take power

1278
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,719
yeah they have difficulties with arab

1279
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,679
fighters too and they don't want them

1280
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,959
coming in and you know messing with

1281
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,318
mujahideen regardless as like you know

1282
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,519
this is an afghan national state that

1283
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:01,519
we're going to build it's going to be

1284
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,318
islamic it's going to be islamic state

1285
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,559
but

1286
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:05,838
you can't interfere with us and so

1287
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,199
there are always tensions and so the

1288
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,239
arabs are always kind of i would say

1289
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,480
they were

1290
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,318
bear fighters were always interlopers

1291
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,760
um yes the afghans are happy to take

1292
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:16,480
their money

1293
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,040
send patients their hospitals

1294
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,159
take their weapons but

1295
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,119
were never gonna let this be like a

1296
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,039
saudi or egyptian or whatever project

1297
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,079
um but then many of those fighters went

1298
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:27,679
home

1299
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,039
they went back to syria they were back

1300
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:30,480
to egypt

1301
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,679
some wanted to go back to saudi arabia

1302
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,440
the saudis was very careful i mean the

1303
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:34,719
saudis always used afghanistan as a kind

1304
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,000
of safety valve

1305
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:37,039
in fact they had you know fundraisers on

1306
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,960
television

1307
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:42,239
they chartered jets they filled them

1308
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,599
with people to fly to pakistan um

1309
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:45,598
get out in the shower and say you know

1310
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,800
go fight and it was one way that the

1311
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,680
monarchy the saudi monarchy

1312
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,359
very cleverly i think created a

1313
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,519
kind of escape valve for would-be

1314
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:58,078
dissidents in saudi arabia right just

1315
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,679
send them abroad you want to fight jihad

1316
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,039
go do that somewhere else don't don't

1317
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,440
bother the kingdom

1318
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,800
but all this became dicier um

1319
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,079
in the early 90s when some of these guys

1320
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,280
came back home

1321
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,519
and some of the scholars around them

1322
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,119
said you know let's we've defeated the

1323
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,719
soviet union which is a huge huge boost

1324
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,760
i think part of the dynamic we see today

1325
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:16,559
is that

1326
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,800
the taliban victory is a renewed

1327
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,559
inspiration for people who think look

1328
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,839
we beat the soviets now we beat the

1329
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,119
americans

1330
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:24,960
and so already

1331
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,119
watching the soviet retreat across this

1332
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,880
bridge back into uzbekistan if you see

1333
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,880
these dramatic images of the tanks you

1334
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,119
know moving a lot of people interpreted

1335
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,400
this as like you know we are going to

1336
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,400
change the world

1337
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,079
and now we're turning to the americans

1338
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,599
and our our local national governments

1339
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,839
are backed by the americans

1340
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,760
so let's start with some of those places

1341
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,358
and then let's go strike let's go strike

1342
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,119
you know the belly of the beast which is

1343
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:48,159
america which is new york

1344
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,800
and going back to bible you're

1345
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,519
questioning about you know what

1346
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,599
motivates him what motivated him

1347
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,960
you know again he was not

1348
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,200
a

1349
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,800
rigorously trained islamic scholar

1350
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,318
and that i think you know when i when

1351
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,760
this when this comes up in our classes

1352
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,358
you know i think especially young people

1353
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,880
i mean people weren't even born i mean

1354
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:06,559
they're shocked they see they see his

1355
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,160
appearance they see

1356
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,719
him pictured

1357
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:13,358
in front of a a giant bookshelf of

1358
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,879
arabic books he's got the klashnikov

1359
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,799
he's got what looks like a religious

1360
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,119
scholars library behind him right

1361
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,800
but if you look at his

1362
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,838
words i mean one fascinating thing about

1363
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,599
just our politics and just one thing

1364
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,480
that kind of sums us up i mean

1365
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,680
the fact that on 9 11 we had to have

1366
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,519
a few people

1367
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,039
a few experts

1368
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,559
people like bernard rubin who was an

1369
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,318
afghanistan expert so that was one way

1370
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,519
in which i think you know i'm not

1371
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,358
faulting him personally but it's just

1372
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,440
one way in which that relationship

1373
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,838
appeared to be you know

1374
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,880
formed right of linking afghanistan to

1375
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:43,920
that moment

1376
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,519
um

1377
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,119
if one looks actually you know what bin

1378
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:48,318
laden was saying and doing

1379
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,119
people like richard clark were studying

1380
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:50,719
this

1381
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,119
there were arab leaders the arab press

1382
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,719
was watching this because he gave some

1383
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,760
of his first interviews to

1384
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:59,279
a few arab newspaper outlets

1385
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,440
but speaking of our american kind of you

1386
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,440
know monolingualism a lot of what he was

1387
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,440
saying wasn't known and so i think

1388
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,519
for several years

1389
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,679
people weren't reading what bin laden

1390
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,800
said i mean experts are reading reading

1391
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,039
it in arabic

1392
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,880
but there was great anxiety around

1393
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:16,159
translating his works so you know we

1394
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,760
have my conf we have all this other

1395
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,279
stuff you can buy the collective works

1396
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,960
of lin and stalin mao whatever you want

1397
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,400
in whatever language you want

1398
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,240
but bin laden was taboo for american

1399
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,000
publishing so it was only a

1400
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,598
verso in the uk

1401
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,679
that published

1402
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,800
a famous volume called messages to the

1403
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:32,399
world

1404
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,640
which was the first combining compendium

1405
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,760
of of banan's writings so he has a

1406
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,039
mineconf he has a type does he have a

1407
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,920
thing where he's kind of collected works

1408
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:44,079
it's the collected works okay uh of his

1409
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,318
like a like a blog

1410
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,000
like yeah it's a collection of articles

1411
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,759
versus yeah these are interviews these

1412
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
are his his missives his his

1413
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,800
declarations his um

1414
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,838
his

1415
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,760
decrees right um it would but i think

1416
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,119
just in terms of if we zoom out for a

1417
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,200
second about you know american policy

1418
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,119
choices and so on the powers that be

1419
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,039
didn't trust us to know what he was

1420
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,640
really about i put it that way and i

1421
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:08,318
don't say that in a conspiratorial sense

1422
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:09,920
i just think that it was

1423
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,079
you know it was a

1424
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,760
a taboo i think people

1425
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,079
you know there were

1426
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,720
a kind of consensus that um

1427
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,079
you know trust us we know we know how to

1428
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,959
fight al-qaeda

1429
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,400
and you don't need to know what they're

1430
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,599
about because they're they're crazy

1431
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,519
they're they're fanatics they're

1432
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,760
fundamentalists they hate us remember

1433
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,559
that language yeah uh it's us versus

1434
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,160
them

1435
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,119
but if you read bin laden that's when it

1436
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:35,679
gets messy that's where the bin laden's

1437
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,960
argumentation is not fundamentally

1438
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,159
about islam

1439
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,559
and if you were sitting here with an

1440
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:42,318
islamic scholar he would say

1441
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,920
you know depending on which islamic

1442
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,440
scholar they would tend to go through

1443
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,639
and dissect

1444
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,119
and negate

1445
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:51,279
you know 99 of the arguments that milan

1446
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,280
claimed was in islam right but what

1447
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,519
strikes me as an historian who's again

1448
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,119
looking at this adjacently

1449
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,838
um is read bin laden i mean the

1450
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,358
arguments they make

1451
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:02,880
are first of all they're sophisticated

1452
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,920
they reflect

1453
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,200
a

1454
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,680
mind that

1455
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,759
is about geopolitics

1456
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:12,078
he uses terms like imperialism

1457
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,400
he knows something about world history

1458
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,240
he knows something about geography so

1459
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,160
imperialism is the enemy for him or

1460
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,759
what's the nature of the enemy it's a

1461
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:21,759
it's an amalgam and

1462
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,359
he like a good politician which is what

1463
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,720
i would call him

1464
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:26,239
he

1465
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:27,919
is adept at speaking

1466
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,358
in different ways to different audiences

1467
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,639
so if you look at

1468
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,799
the context in which he speaks if you

1469
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:34,480
look at messages to the world

1470
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,160
if you look at his writings

1471
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,679
and it would zoom out now and we now

1472
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:39,279
have compendia of the writings of

1473
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:41,279
al-qaeda more broadly

1474
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,880
you can purchase these

1475
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,240
you know they're basically primary

1476
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,119
source collections

1477
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,598
um

1478
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,358
we now have that for the taliban i mean

1479
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,318
what's fascinating about

1480
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:52,559
i think

1481
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:53,440
if you like this culture acknowledging

1482
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,599
it's very

1483
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,559
you know diverse internally

1484
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,240
is that

1485
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:59,759
these people are

1486
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,399
representatives of political movements

1487
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,680
who seek followers they speak

1488
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,200
they often

1489
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,199
are very

1490
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,118
i'd say skilled at

1491
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,318
visual imagery and especially now i mean

1492
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,720
what's fascinating is that i mean the

1493
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:15,519
taliban used to shoot televisions

1494
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:19,279
they used to you know blow up

1495
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:21,199
vcr um you know videotapes um

1496
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,599
they used to string

1497
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,919
audio and video cassettes from trees and

1498
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:29,119
kind of ceremonial hangings right that

1499
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,039
we're we're killing this nefarious

1500
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,680
infidel technology that is doing the

1501
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,960
work of satan and yet today

1502
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,879
and last i mean one of the keys to the

1503
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,720
top on success is that they got really

1504
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,559
good at using media

1505
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:41,439
i mean brilliant at using

1506
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,359
uh

00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:46,078
actually

1509
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,680
um and

1510
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,559

00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:52,960
standard and these guys have studied how

1512
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,880
to create drama how to speak to modern

1513
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,519
users i mean islamic state did this i

i am i follow and i am followed by

1517
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,720
senior top on leaders which is

1518
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,480
you know bizarre you know on twitter on

1519
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:11,358

1521
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:14,799
they follow you on twitter i don't know

1522
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,440
why this is no joke this is no joke so

1523
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,119
it's

1524
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,318
they are part of our modern world and

1525
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,400
how they talk is how they recruit and

1526
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,759
this is part of the this is why they are

1527
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,800
you know so bin laden if you're bin

1528
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,240
laden he

1529
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,440
he speaks multiple languages i would say

1530
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:26,479
it's uh

1531
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,000
it's

1532
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,000
environmentalism

1533
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,079
you know the west is bad because we

1534
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,400
destroyed the planet the west is bad

1535
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,400
because we abuse women

1536
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,639
so in class you know

1537
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,318
especially you know female students

1538
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,480
are very surprised to learn and actually

1539
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:44,639
say you know this this feminist argument

1540
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,159
is not

1541
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:47,199
you know we start with you know this is

1542
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,719
a murder

1543
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,279
this is a person who has taken human

1544
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:53,118
life innocent life over and over again

1545
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,079
and he is um

1546
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,920
you know

1547
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,960
aspirationally genocidal

1548
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,720
but let's try to understand what he's

1549
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,880
about so we walk through the text read

1550
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,639
them and people are

1551
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,559
shocked to learn that

1552
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,920
it's not just about

1553
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,160
you know quotations in the quran strung

1554
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,240
together in some irrational fashion

1555
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:11,358
he knows um

1556
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,799
i mean the core i'd say is the problem

1557
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,719
of human suffering

1558
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,240
and he has a geography of that that is

1559
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,919
mostly muslim but he talks about the

1560
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:19,358
suffering of kashmir all right so if you

1561
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,880
have a student in your class

1562
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:22,000
who's from south asia who knows about

1563
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,760
kashmir

1564
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,800
you know he or she will say

1565
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,119
that's not entirely inaccurate you know

1566
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,480
the indian state commits atrocities in

1567
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,800
kashmir

1568
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,119
uh you know pakistanis from that too

1569
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,240
you know palestine is an issue right so

1570
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,079
you have

1571
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,000
the american university setting people

1572
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,079
across the spectrum who

1573
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,280
get that you know palestinians have had

1574
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,640
a raw deal

1575
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,680
and so it's a

1576
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:50,078
victimhood is essential and it's

1577
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:50,879
muslim victimhood which is primary

1578
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,720
but

1579
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,800
as number scholars have written and i'm

1580
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:57,199
you know i definitely think this is

1581
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,960
a framework for what this useful i mean

1582
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,279
in this kind of vocabulary and this is

1583
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,519
framing this narrative um

1584
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,119
today in today's world if we think of

1585
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:06,480
today's world being

1586
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,720
post-cold war

1587
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,000
91 to the present

1588
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:13,199
looking at the series of gulf wars and

1589
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,639
seeing the visuals of that i think that

1590
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:15,679
you know i think the american public has

1591
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:19,440
been shielded from this but if you look

1592
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,879
at just the the carnage of the iraqi

1593
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,760
army

1594
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,240
that

1595
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,000
george h.w bush produced right or you

1596
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:27,679
think of you know the images of the

1597
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,480
suffering of

1598
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:33,279
iraqi children under george h.w bush's

1599
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,679
sanctions u.s british airstrikes

1600
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,440
then you have madeleine albright

1601
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:38,960
answer a question on 60 minutes saying

1602
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,599
do you think you know the deaths of

1603
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,358
half a million iraqi kids is is worth it

1604
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,480
he was that justified to contain saam

1605
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,558
hussein

1606
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,679
and she says on camera yes that it's

1607
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,599
worth it to me

1608
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,039
if you put that all together

1609
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,480
i mean american kids and of course the

1610
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,239
american public

1611
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,760
they're not always aware of those those

1612
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:59,118
facts of global history

1613
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,240
but these guys are and they they very

1614
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,880
capably

1615
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,318
use these images use these tropes

1616
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,760
and use facts i mean in fact i mean so

1617
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:06,719
many things are not are not deniable i

1618
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,920
mean the

1619
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,480
i mean these estimates about the number

1620
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,000
of iraqi civilian children dead you know

1621
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,440
that that came from i think the lancet

1622
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,639
and it came from yeah those are those

1623
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,119
are estimates but

1624
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:20,400
looking at the point of view of

1625
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,440
of oman of you know jaffa

1626
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,400
of

1627
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,480
nairobi you just think around the planet

1628
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,519
um and if you see yourself as the victim

1629
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,519
of this

1630
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,719
great imperial power

1631
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:33,199
you know you see why especially young

1632
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:35,519
men would be drawn to

1633
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,118
a road of of

1634
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,838
of self-sacrifice

1635
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,838
and the idea is that

1636
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:43,440
in in killing others

1637
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:44,400
you are

1638
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,039
making

1639
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,240
them feel how you feel yeah because they

1640
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,239
won't listen to your arguments

1641
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,558
reasonably because they won't you know

1642
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:54,639
recognize palestinian suffering

1643
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,760
bosnian suffering right chechen

1644
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:57,519
suffering

1645
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,839
you go across the planet right because

1646
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,199
they don't recognize our suffering

1647
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:02,880
we're going to speak to you in the only

1648
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,679
language you understand and that's

1649
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,440
violence and look at the violence of of

1650
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,239
the post-1991

1651
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,119
world right in which american air power

1652
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:13,919
really

1653
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,160
becomes a global you know kind of

1654
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,639
fact in the lives of so many people

1655
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,879
um and then the big mistake after 9 11

1656
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,799
among many i mean fundamentally was

1657
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,720
taking the war on terror

1658
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,880
to some you know 30 or 40 countries

1659
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:28,879
right so that you have a

1660
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,640
more and more of the globe feel like

1661
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,000
they're under attack right

1662
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:34,078
and then the logic is essentially it's

1663
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,679
not it's not it's rebin law and it's not

1664
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,280
we're going to

1665
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:38,960
convert you and turn you into muslims

1666
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,800
and that's why we're doing this that

1667
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,920
that appears that claim does appear at

1668
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,400
times

1669
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,880
but it's if you look at any given bin

1670
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,318
laden text i mean there are 40 claims in

1671
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,599
each text i mean it's kind of it's

1672
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:51,358
dizzying but

1673
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,200
he's a modern politician he knows the

1674
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,440
language of

1675
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,199
of social equality you know that there's

1676
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,800
a class dimension to it there is an

1677
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,558
environmental dimension to it there's a

1678
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,640
gender dimension to it

1679
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,000
and yes there are chronic quotes

1680
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:06,400
sprinkled in

1681
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,119
and when he wants to speak that language

1682
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,880
he knew that you know he's not a scholar

1683
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,680
so he would often get

1684
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,838
a few recognized scholars to sign on so

1685
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,799
some of his declarations of jihad

1686
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,480
had his signature kind of sprinkled in

1687
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,599
with like a dozen other other signatures

1688
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,800
from

1689
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,838
people who were somewhat known or at

1690
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,079
least you know with titles right

1691
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:29,838
so as a kind of intellectual exercise

1692
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,800
it's fascinating to see that

1693
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:32,480
he is

1694
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,440
throwing everything at the wall in one

1695
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,960
level

1696
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,318
um that's one way to see that it's a

1697
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,760
it's a these are kind of testaments

1698
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:41,039
toward recruitment

1699
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,680
of people who

1700
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,519
yes they're angry yes they're unhappy

1701
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,039
and this is what you know i think

1702
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:49,838
for a broader public it's hard to get

1703
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:51,119
you're like well bin laden didn't suffer

1704
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:52,480
he wasn't poor

1705
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,680
like yeah i mean

1706
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,159
lenin

1707
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:57,919
pol pot i mean they're speaking to

1708
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:59,759
they're empathetic to the suffering the

1709
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,838
landscape the full landscape

1710
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,280
it's interesting to think about

1711
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,358
suffering

1712
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,839
you know america

1713
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:09,759
the american public american politicians

1714
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:13,119
and leaders

1715
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:15,040
when they see what is good and evil

1716
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,760
they are often not empathetic to the

1717
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:20,159
suffering of others and

1718
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,119
what you're saying is bin laden

1719
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,598
perhaps accurately could speak to the

1720
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:28,079
ignorance of america maybe the soviet

1721
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,359
union to the suffering of their people

1722
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:34,240
that's right and i mean if you look at

1723
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:37,119
the speeches and the ideas the republic

1724
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,879
of hitler in the 1930s

1725
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,440
he spoke quite

1726
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,559
accurately to the

1727
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,400
injustice and maybe the the suffering of

1728
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,119
the german people

1729
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,880
it i mean charismatic politicians are

1730
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,039
good at telling accurate stories it's

1731
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,519
not all fabricated

1732
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:58,239
but they emphasize certain aspects right

1733
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:00,559
and then the problem part is the actions

1734
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,798
you should take based on that that's

1735
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,559
right right so the the narratives and

1736
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:08,000
the stories may be grounded in

1737
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:10,880
historical accuracy right the actions

1738
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,358
then cross the line yeah the ethical

1739
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,400
line yeah i find that too i mean it's a

1740
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:15,920
again if you pick up just one of these

1741
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,358
texts i mean it's it's a claudio scope

1742
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,559
so the

1743
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:19,440
hitler analogy is interesting because

1744
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,960
it's

1745
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,880
you know hitler spoke to

1746
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,720
he could speak things like inflation

1747
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,200
right which really existed

1748
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,759
um but he also appealed to

1749
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,039
the irrational emotions of germans right

1750
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,720
he

1751
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:36,880
sought out scapegoats you know jews roma

1752
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:37,679
um disabled people homosexuals and so on

1753
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,960
right

1754
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,879
and that's also

1755
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,000
there in bin laden too i mean daddy of

1756
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,240
um

1757
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,639
you know a an anti-semitism

1758
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:48,399
uh the constant flagging of zionists and

1759
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:49,598
crusaders it's a kind of shotgun

1760
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,440
approach to

1761
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,960
a search for followers but i also hasten

1762
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,400
to add that it's

1763
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,519
for all of the

1764
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,160
things that we could take off saying

1765
00:55:55,519 --> 00:56:00,159
well yes kashmiris have suffered

1766
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:01,039
chechens have suffered and so on

1767
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:02,399
um

1768
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:04,480
bin ladenism

1769
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,760
never became a mass movement i mean it

1770
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,838
never really

1771
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,440
i think the

1772
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:10,639
i mean this is the encouraging thing

1773
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,960
right about

1774
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,719
ideology i mean i think the

1775
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,559
the blood on his hands

1776
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,239
always limited his appeal

1777
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,280
among muslims and others

1778
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:20,879
um

1779
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,640
but milan did have i mean he had a

1780
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,599
there's a great book by um a great

1781
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:27,679
scholar at uc san diego um

1782
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,240
jeremy prestol who wrote a great book

1783
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:31,679
about global icons in which

1784
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:34,078
he has bin laden

1785
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,519
he has um

1786
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,880
bob marley

1787
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:40,318
he has

1788
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,240
tupac you know he asked why

1789
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,558
when he's doing research in east africa

1790
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,078
why did he see young kids wearing bin

1791
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,079
laden shirts

1792
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,039
they're also wearing like tupac shirts

1793
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,559
they're wearing

1794
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,679
bob marley shirts and

1795
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:55,519
bass it's a way of looking at um

1796
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:56,558
a kind of partial

1797
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:58,960
embrace

1798
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,880
of some aspects of

1799
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,318
the rebelliousness of

1800
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,039
some of these figures some of the time

1801
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:06,719
by some people under certain conditions

1802
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:08,719
well the terrifying thing to me so yeah

1803
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,480
there is a longing in the human heart to

1804
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:14,000
belong to a group

1805
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:16,000
and a charismatic leader somehow

1806
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,639
especially when you're young

1807
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,280
just a catalyst for all of that and

1808
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:23,118
i tend to think

1809
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,559
that perhaps it's actually hard to be

1810
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,119
hitler

1811
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:29,359
so a leader so charismatic that he can

1812
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:32,480
rile a nation to war

1813
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:35,358
and bin laden perhaps were lucky

1814
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,519
was not sufficiently charismatic

1815
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:40,480
i i feel like if his writing was better

1816
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:42,239
if his speeches were better if his ideas

1817
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,920
were stronger

1818
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:48,719
uh better it's like uh more viral

1819
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:51,760
and then there will be more people

1820
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:54,399
kind of um yeah young people uniting

1821
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,160
around him so in some sense

1822
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,079
it's almost like accidents of history of

1823
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:59,838
just how much charisma

1824
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,760
how much charisma a particular evil

1825
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:03,039
person has

1826
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,319
bin laden

1827
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:06,079
i think it's fair

1828
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,480
evil works i think do you think bin

1829
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,880
laden is evil oh yeah yeah i mean he was

1830
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,240
a mass murderer um

1831
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,519
i'm just saying that you know his ideas

1832
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:15,598
were

1833
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,599
they're more complex than than we've

1834
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,440
tended to acknowledge

1835
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,920
they had

1836
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,838
they have a wider potential resonance

1837
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,240
than we would acknowledge i mean and

1838
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:27,920
also i guess what i'm the just

1839
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:29,439
one fundamental point is that

1840
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,119
um

1841
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,838
thinking about the complexity of bin

1842
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,440
laden is also a way of removing him from

1843
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:37,920
islam

1844
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,798
he is not an islamic thinker he is a

1845
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,119
cosmopolitan thinker who

1846
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:44,798
plays in all kinds of modern ideologies

1847
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,680
which have proven to mobilize people in

1848
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:49,440
the past right so

1849
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,399
anti-semitism

1850
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,559
populism

1851
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,720
environmentalism and the kind of in the

1852
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,400
the urging to like

1853
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,159
you know do something about humanity do

1854
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,680
something about suffering that's why i

1855
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,719
think the actual you ask about like what

1856
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:02,480
motivates people to do this kind of

1857
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:04,558
stuff i think that's why if one goes

1858
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,358
below the level of leadership and this

1859
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:10,240
is being reported if you look at the

1860
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:11,759
trial ongoing now in paris of

1861
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:13,919
uh the bataclan

1862
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,760
murders i think um

1863
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,159
the court allowed some discussion of the

1864
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,040
backgrounds of the accused and they come

1865
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,279
from

1866
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:23,358
different backgrounds but if there's any

1867
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,000
common bond it's kind of that they

1868
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:29,199
had some background in petty crime

1869
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,920
famously in the 7-7 bombings in london

1870
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,838
the

1871
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,400
metropolitan police you know uk

1872
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:35,599
authorities looked at all those guys

1873
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,358
and

1874
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,440
what people want is this idea that like

1875
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:40,798
they must be very pious they must be you

1876
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,838
know super islamic to do this kind of

1877
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:43,440
stuff

1878
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:44,159
they must be fanatical true believers

1879
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,720
but

1880
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:48,399
what they found with those guys was that

1881
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:49,838
some were

1882
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,079
nominally muslim

1883
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:53,199
some went to mosques some didn't

1884
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,519
um

1885
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:57,519
some were single young guys with like

1886
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,400
criminal backgrounds

1887
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:00,880
some

1888
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,559
you know we're like sorry they were

1889
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,160
you know kind of misfits who never

1890
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,240
succeeded in anything

1891
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:08,399
uh but others had you know at least one

1892
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:10,318
thing had a wife and family who he you

1893
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,720
know widowed and orphaned

1894
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:15,039
and so there's no i mean for policing i

1895
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:17,679
mean if you're looking at that lens

1896
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,880
there is no kind of typology that will

1897
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:20,318
predict

1898
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,240
who will become violent that's why i

1899
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:23,039
think we have to move beyond thinking

1900
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:24,558
about

1901
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:25,679
religious augmentation narrowly or by

1902
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,119
itself

1903
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:28,480
and think about things like geopolitics

1904
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,640
think about

1905
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,719
how people respond to inequality

1906
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:35,838
you know the the existential threat of

1907
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:38,480
cri of a you know climate crisis

1908
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:40,639
of um a whole host of matters of and and

1909
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,240
think about th this is a mode of

1910
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:43,838
political contestation i mean it's a

1911
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:45,039
violent one it's one i condemn it is

1912
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:46,719
evil right

1913
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:48,000
but these are people that are they're

1914
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,598
trying to be political they're trying to

1915
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,838
change things in some way

1916
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:54,240
it's not nearly about like i want to

1917
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:55,759
impose sharia law on you

1918
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:57,519
you must wear a veil

1919
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,640
you must eat this kind of food it's it's

1920
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:02,318
not that parochial but one another quick

1921
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:04,480
thought about your interesting claim

1922
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:06,719
about charisma in this i think that the

1923
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:10,000
one self-limiting feature

1924
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,519
of this subculture is that

1925
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
definitely you know i mentioned the

1926
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,119
enigma of not wanting to be seen and

1927
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
that the

1928
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,358
kind of

1929
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,639
invisibility

1930
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:21,598
is a productive force of power

1931
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:23,440
you know which

1932
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,200
a colleague of mine who knows ancient

1933
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,559
history far better than i

1934
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:28,399
you know said this is you know when she

1935
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,319
looked at at

1936
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,039
maloma initially or we come up bin laden

1937
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:35,519
i mean this kind of studied

1938
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:37,440
posture of staying in the shadows

1939
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:40,000
yeah is also a source of authority

1940
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,240
potentially because it it um it invites

1941
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,079
the idea and it's partly dictatorships

1942
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:46,399
do as well i mean it advises the idea

1943
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,839
that someone's working and maybe it's

1944
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,440
the basis for a lot of q a or other

1945
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:51,440
conspiracies today that someone's

1946
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,880
working behind the scenes and things are

1947
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,240
going to go the right way

1948
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,480
you can't see it

1949
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,959
that's almost preferable because

1950
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,960
you can kind of feel it and so

1951
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,720
not having someone out front

1952
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,720
can maybe maybe more effective than

1953
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,239
having someone out in front constantly

1954
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:07,598
then they

1955
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:09,679
and then the whole bin laden you know

1956
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,720
omar thing like you can't see me or if

1957
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:12,879
you look at you know bin laden's

1958
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:14,000
photographs and his video stuff

1959
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,838
i mean he's

1960
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,440
he's coy

1961
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:19,358
uh some observers have noted he's kind

1962
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,960
of effeminate he doesn't strike this

1963
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:24,159
kind of masculine

1964
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,559
he's not a mussolini he's not a hitler

1965
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:28,318
macho i'm standing my thumb in my chest

1966
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,200
he's not doing the theatrical chin you

1967
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:30,558
know

1968
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,159
the theater people tell us is so

1969
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,798
aggressive um

1970
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:38,078
you know or chin what bringing your chin

1971
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:40,159
up i saw a great uh bbc theater person

1972
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,839
it was kind of a it was a makeover show

1973
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:44,159
about how to become

1974
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,519
a better creator oh no uh just a

1975
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,838
powerful

1976
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:49,199
uh yeah leader authoritarian figure no

1977
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:51,679
just how to how to like get ahead in

1978
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,038
life and then oh okay cool and just like

1979
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:54,879
about acting like how you can act

1980
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,079
differently right so it was it was a bbc

1981
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,200
thing um

1982
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,559
and this woman claimed that um

1983
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:02,399
you know sticking your chin out like a

1984
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,559
wrestler does right is the most like

1985
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,559
male-to-man i love this kind of mustache

1986
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,519
hilarious analysis that people have

1987
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,599
about

1988
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,920
power but watch the chin watch the chin

1989
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,119
it's the same as analyzing like in

1990
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,159
wrestling

1991
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:17,920
styles that win or fighting or so on

1992
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:20,239
there's so many ways well the chan i

1993
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,720
mean the chan is a could be

1994
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:25,038
an interesting verbal gesture and i uh

1995
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:27,118
i've watched enough mussolini footage

1996
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,720
from my classes to try to pick the right

1997
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,119
moment and the chin is misleading is all

1998
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:33,679
about the chan so and i have watched

1999
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:36,240
human beings and human nature enough to

2000
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:38,480
know that there's more to a man a

2001
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:39,838
powerful man than a chin yeah no no i'm

2002
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,440
saying no i'm saying it's an active

2003
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:45,358
aggression i'm not saying it's it's one

2004
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,358
of the many tools in the toolkit

2005
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:54,880
deliberate enough

2006
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,838
with the way he presents himself so he

2007
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,640
what i'm saying about bin laden that

2008
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,519
makes him different from these other

2009
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:01,358
characters is it because he

2010
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:04,318
played at being the scholar

2011
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:06,719
he played it being a figure of modesty

2012
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:07,920
and humility and that meant that he was

2013
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:09,199
often

2014
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,639
again if you watch his visuals i mean

2015
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:11,679
yes there's one video of him firing a

2016
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:14,078
gun

2017
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:16,078
but if you watch how he moved

2018
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,680
how he wouldn't look at people directly

2019
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,160
how his face was almost

2020
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:22,000
i mean he appears to be incredibly shy

2021
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,759
he saw spoken

2022
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,440
you know his voice was low

2023
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,079
he attempted to be poetic

2024
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,519
right so it wasn't a warrior kind of

2025
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,798
image that he tried to project of like a

2026
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:34,480
tough guy

2027
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:36,159
it was i'm i'm demure i'm humble

2028
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,798
i'm you know i'm i'm offering you this

2029
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:40,639
message and that and that the appeal

2030
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:43,440
that he was going for was

2031
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:45,519
to see um

2032
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,798
to protect himself as a scholar

2033
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:48,559
his knowledge

2034
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:50,480
and humility the whole package carried

2035
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,000
with it an authenticity

2036
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,880
and a valor

2037
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,480
that would animate inspire people to

2038
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,680
commit acts of violence right and so

2039
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,639
it's a different kind of like logic of

2040
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:02,558
like yes go and kill right so he he put

2041
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:05,679
he presented himself

2042
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,798
in contrast to the imperialist

2043
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:08,558
kind of

2044
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:10,798
macho

2045
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:13,519
whatever yeah yeah so that's just yet

2046
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:15,119
another way of uh yeah and you have to

2047
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:16,639
have facial hair or hair of different

2048
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,720
kind that's recognized we had a very

2049
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,000
recognizable look too or at least later

2050
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:22,719
in life

2051
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
yeah no he he tried to look apart

2052
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,239
yeah yeah

2053
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,559
but i'm saying we're fortunate that

2054
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:31,038
whatever right calculation that he was

2055
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:34,798
making he was not more

2056
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:36,640
um effective yet i mean

2057
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:38,559
there's the the world is full of

2058
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,400
terrorist organizations and we're

2059
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:43,039
fortunate

2060
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,519
to the degree any one of them does not

2061
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:48,559
have an incredibly charismatic leader

2062
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:51,199
that attains the kind of power that's

2063
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:53,359
very difficult to to manage at the

2064
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:54,879
geopolitical level yeah we and we credit

2065
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:56,639
we credit the publics

2066
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,920
you know who don't you don't bind to

2067
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:01,118
that right you see through this we

2068
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,400
credit the the critics you know um

2069
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,200
barely on

2070
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,599
pretty much 9 11 itself

2071
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,519
one of the problems was that

2072
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,280
u.s government officials kept kind of

2073
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:13,038
leaning on muslims to

2074
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,440
to condemn this as if

2075
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,680
all muslims shared some collective

2076
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:20,720
responsibility or culpability

2077
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:20,719
and in fact

2078
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:24,880
dozens of scholars and organizations

2079
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,400
hundreds condemn this

2080
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,358
but their condemnations never quite made

2081
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,200
it out but it created a tension where

2082
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:32,558
you know if you wore a veil

2083
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,279
you must been one of them and you must

2084
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,640
be on team bin laden so a lot of the

2085
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,798
you know i think a lot of the popular

2086
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:41,838
violence and discrimination and and

2087
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:43,519
profiling came out of that urge to

2088
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:44,639
see a oneness

2089
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:46,480
which you know been like bin laden

2090
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:48,318
projected right he wanted to say we are

2091
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,480
one community you know if you are a

2092
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:52,558
muslim you must be with me right

2093
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,079
but i think the

2094
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,000
that's where the the diversity of muslim

2095
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,519
communities became important because

2096
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,920
outside of small pockets i mean they

2097
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,358
didn't accept his leadership right

2098
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,400
people wore t-shirts in some countries i

2099
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:03,920
mean non-muslims were teachers because

2100
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,039
he was like he stuck it to the americans

2101
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,200
so

2102
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,799
in latin america people were like yeah

2103
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:09,919
that was sad but

2104
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:11,519
you know finally i mean there was a kind

2105
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,960
of shot in florida in that moment yeah

2106
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:14,960
international it's like cheri guevara or

2107
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,639
somebody like that yeah change the other

2108
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,000
character in prison's book yeah yeah

2109
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:19,838
that's right that's right yeah it's just

2110
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,838
a symbol it's not exactly what he

2111
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:23,838
believed exactly or the cruelty of

2112
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:25,838
actions he took right it's more like he

2113
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:28,798
stood for an idea of

2114
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:30,719
revolution versus authority that's right

2115
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,639
and that's and that's

2116
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:34,480
a great way to understand bin ladenism

2117
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:37,118
and the whole phenomenon but i think

2118
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,880
looking at the big picture it's also

2119
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,880
you wonder

2120
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,400
will that ever end right i mean is that

2121
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,000
i mean that's the the risk of being a

2122
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,559
kind of hyper power

2123
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,760
um like the u.s were you

2124
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:52,480
in insisting on a kind of unipolar world

2125
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,039
in 2001 2002 2003

2126
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,440
i think that created um

2127
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:59,680
um an almost irresistible target

2128
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,519
you know wherever the us wanted to exert

2129
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:04,000
itself militarily before

2130
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:05,838
we go to the history of afghanistan the

2131
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,639
people and i just want to talk to you

2132
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:10,400
about just some fascinating

2133
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:12,960
aspect of the culture

2134
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,838
let's go to the end

2135
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,600
withdrawal of u.s troops from

2136
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:19,278
afghanistan

2137
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,440
uh what are your thoughts on how that

2138
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:24,480
was executed

2139
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,759
how could it have been done better yeah

2140
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,798
an important question

2141
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,880
i mean i would

2142
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:30,798
preface all this by saying

2143
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,199
you know as i noted i think the war was

2144
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:34,960
a mistake um

2145
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:36,479
i

2146
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,520
had hoped the war would end sooner i

2147
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,678
think there were

2148
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,679
different exit routes all along the way

2149
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:43,359
again i think there were

2150
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,199
lots of policy choices

2151
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,798
in september in october when the war

2152
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:50,399
began

2153
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:52,399
there were choices in december 2001

2154
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:55,439
so we could look at almost every

2155
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:57,358
six-month stopping point and say

2156
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:59,119
we could have done differently

2157
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,279
as it turns out though i mean the way it

2158
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:04,798
played out um you know it's been

2159
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:06,040
catastrophic and i think um

2160
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:08,158
the bride administration

2161
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:10,079
[Music]

2162
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:13,358
has remained unaccountable for the scale

2163
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:15,119
of the strategic and humanitarian and

2164
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,838
ethical failure that they're responsible

2165
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:19,198
for

2166
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:22,719
well okay let's lay out the full

2167
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:25,358
there's george w bush there's

2168
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,960
barack obama there's donald trump that's

2169
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,400
right there is uh

2170
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,439
biden yeah

2171
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:33,358
uh so they're all driving this van and

2172
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,198
there's these exits and they keep not

2173
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,520
taking the exits and they're running out

2174
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:38,798
of gas yeah i do this all the time

2175
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,120
thinking where am i going to pull off

2176
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:43,278
i'll go to the perfect till it's empty

2177
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:45,759
how could it have been done

2178
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,880
better and what exactly

2179
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:48,640
um

2180
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,520
how much suffering

2181
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:52,239
have

2182
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:54,320
all the decisions along the way caused

2183
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:56,238
what are the long-term consequences what

2184
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:58,719
are the biggest things that concern you

2185
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:01,039
about the decisions we've made in both

2186
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:03,119
invading afghanistan and staying in

2187
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:04,960
afghanistan as long as we have

2188
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:07,599
i mean if we start at the end as you

2189
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,359
proposed um

2190
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,520
yeah the horrific scenes of the airport

2191
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:12,799
you know that was just one one dimension

2192
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,880
um

2193
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,679
i think in the weeks to come

2194
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,199
[Music]

2195
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,319
i mean we're going to see afghanistan

2196
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:19,359
implode

2197
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:20,880
um

2198
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:23,920
there are lots of signs that

2199
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,840
malnutrition hunger starvation

2200
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,359
are going to claim

2201
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,279
tens of thousands maybe hundreds of

2202
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:31,599
thousands of lives this winter

2203
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:32,880
and i think there is really

2204
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,719
nothing

2205
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,520
there's no

2206
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,800
framework in place to

2207
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,400
force all that

2208
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,719
what is the government

2209
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:44,559
what is currently the system there

2210
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:46,480
what's the role of the taliban

2211
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,880
so there could be tens of thousands

2212
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:49,839
hundreds of thousands that starve

2213
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,199
uh

2214
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,239
either just

2215
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:56,799
almost the famine or starve to death

2216
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:59,839
so this is economic implosion this is

2217
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:02,000
political implosion what um

2218
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,239
what's the system they're like and what

2219
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,560
could be the one you know some inkling

2220
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:09,198
of hope right right

2221
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:12,320
the taliban sit in control that's unique

2222
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:14,238
when they were in power in 1990s from

2223
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:15,519
1996 2001

2224
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:18,639
they controlled

2225
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,640
some 85 to 90 of the country

2226
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,320
now they own it all

2227
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,560
but they have no budget

2228
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:27,359
the afghan

2229
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,560
banking system is

2230
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:31,119
frozen

2231
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,360
so the financial system is a mess and

2232
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:35,039
it's frozen by the u.s because the u.s

2233
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:36,719
is trying to use that lever to exert

2234
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,640
pressure on the taliban

2235
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:40,399
and so the ethical quandaries are of

2236
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,960
course legion right

2237
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:44,960
do you release that money

2238
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,480
to allow the taliban to shore up their

2239
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,800
rule right

2240
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:50,079
the body administration has said no

2241
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,840
but

2242
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:54,479
the banks aren't working

2243
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:57,360
uh if you're in california you want to

2244
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:59,839
send 100 to your cousin so

2245
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,519
she can buy bread you can't do that now

2246
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,119
it's almost impossible there are some

2247
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,239
informal networks they're moving some

2248
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:06,399
stuff

2249
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:09,119
but there are red lines the talbot

2250
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:11,599
government is incapable

2251
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:13,439
fundamentally just of ruling i mean they

2252
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,520
they can discipline people on the street

2253
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:17,119
they can force people into the mosque

2254
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,640
they can shoot people they can beat

2255
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:20,559
protesters

2256
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,400
they can put out a newspaper

2257
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,679
they can have they're great at diplomacy

2258
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:25,519
it turns out

2259
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,760
they can't rule this country so

2260
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,199
essentially the hospitals

2261
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,600
and

2262
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:33,519
the kind of healthcare infrastructure

2263
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,159
is

2264
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,600
being managed by ngos that are

2265
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:38,479
international

2266
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,520
um

2267
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,039
but

2268
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,440
these people had to leave

2269
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:44,560
and and the taliban have impeded some of

2270
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:45,678
that work

2271
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,600
they've told

2272
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,719
adult women essentially to stay home

2273
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,560
right so

2274
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,600
a [ __ ] big part of the workforce isn't

2275
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,080
there

2276
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,079
so i mean the supply chain is

2277
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:57,039
it you know is kind of crawling to a

2278
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:00,158
halt

2279
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:01,760
trade with pakistan and its neighbors i

2280
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:03,439
mean it's kind of a transit trade

2281
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,360
economy

2282
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,279
it exports fruits

2283
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:08,960
pakistan has been closing the border

2284
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:10,079
because they're anxious about refugees

2285
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:11,198
they want to

2286
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,439
exert pressure on the international

2287
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:15,919
community to recognize the taliban

2288
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:18,639
because the pakistan want the taliban to

2289
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,319
succeed in power because i see that in

2290
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,560
pakistan's national interest

2291
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:23,920
especially the lens of rivalry with with

2292
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,800
india

2293
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:29,119
so the pakistan the pakistani security

2294
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,640
institutions are playing a double game

2295
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,279
essentially afghan people are being held

2296
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,960
hostage and so the taliban are also

2297
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:36,079
saying you know if you don't recognize

2298
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,359
us

2299
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,960
you're gonna let tens of millions of

2300
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:42,079
afghans starve

2301
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:45,119
so to which degree is taliban like

2302
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:47,279
who are the taliban what do they stand

2303
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:50,158
for what do they want

2304
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:51,759
obviously year by year this changes so

2305
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:54,158
what is the nature

2306
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:58,320
of this organization can they be a

2307
01:13:54,158 --> 01:14:00,479
legitimate peaceful kind respectful

2308
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:03,359
uh government

2309
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:06,238
sort of holder of power or

2310
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:07,920
or are they fundamentally not capable of

2311
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:09,919
doing so yeah

2312
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,000
i mean the briefest answer would be that

2313
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,119
they are a

2314
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
clerical

2315
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:17,198
slash military organization

2316
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,439
um

2317
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:22,079
they have

2318
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:22,079
this is kind of a

2319
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:27,119
imperfect metaphor but

2320
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:29,919
years ago a german scholar used the term

2321
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:33,279
caravan to describe them and that that

2322
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:35,039
has some attractive elements because

2323
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:37,359
different people joined the taliban for

2324
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:38,800
different purposes at different times

2325
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:40,799
but today

2326
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,920
and people tell us you know scholars who

2327
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,279
know more about the room than i have

2328
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,119
said listen

2329
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:46,399
the taliban is this kind of hodgepodge

2330
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,079
of different actors and people and

2331
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,679
competing interests

2332
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:51,439
and i think

2333
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,920
so we have a lot of scholars say listen

2334
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,479
they're it's polycentric

2335
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,719
it's got people in this city in that

2336
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:00,238
city and so on i think actually

2337
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:01,840
i was always very skeptical how do they

2338
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:03,198
know this i mean this is an organization

2339
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,039
that doesn't

2340
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,639
want you to know um where that money

2341
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:08,399
comes from and so on

2342
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,079
but i would say

2343
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:12,399
now that we have a clear picture of what

2344
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:15,039
has happened i'd say they are a

2345
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:17,599
astoundingly well-organized

2346
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:18,640
clerical military organization

2347
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,679
that has

2348
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,239
a

2349
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,640
very cohesive

2350
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:26,718
and enduring ideology

2351
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,159
which is quite idiosyncratic if we zoom

2352
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:29,600
out and continue the conversation we're

2353
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:31,279
having about islam and how we think

2354
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,120
about radicalism and

2355
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:34,479
you know who's drawn to what

2356
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:36,399
um

2357
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:38,399
people throw different terms

2358
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:40,158
around to describe the taliban

2359
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:41,839
some use a term

2360
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:43,359
that links it to

2361
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,199
a kind of school of thought born in the

2362
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:47,119
19th century in india the deobandi

2363
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:49,039
school

2364
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:50,800
but if you look at their teachings

2365
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:52,800
it's very clear now i think that

2366
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,480
these labels it's like saying you know

2367
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,199
you're an mit guy well what does that

2368
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:59,198
mean i mean mit is home to

2369
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:00,158
dozens of different potentially

2370
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:02,079
kinds of

2371
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:03,679
intellectual orientations right

2372
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:04,840
i mean attaching the name of the school

2373
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,359
doesn't quite

2374
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:09,039
capture i mean

2375
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:10,880
it's complicated i mean actually mit is

2376
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:12,238
interesting because it's i would say mit

2377
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:15,440
is different than stanford for example

2378
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:18,718
yeah i think mit has a more kind of

2379
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:19,599
narrow yeah um bad analogy in my part

2380
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:21,279
maybe

2381
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,280
well no it's interesting because i would

2382
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:27,198
argue that there's some aspect of a

2383
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:28,880
brand like taliban or mit yeah no

2384
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:30,319
relation

2385
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:33,679
that

2386
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:36,719
has a kind of uh interact like

2387
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:38,719
the the brand results in the behavior of

2388
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,800
the like enforces a kind of behavior on

2389
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,560
the people and the people feed the brand

2390
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,000
and like there's a loot i think yeah

2391
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,440
stanford is a good example of something

2392
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,560
that's more distributed there's

2393
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,238
sufficient amount of diversity in like

2394
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,080
all kinds of like centers and all that

2395
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:54,079
kind of stuff that the

2396
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:57,439
the the the brand doesn't become one

2397
01:16:54,079 --> 01:17:00,000
thing yeah mit is so engineering it's

2398
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:01,439
yeah i think that okay so

2399
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,439
scratching my teeth scratching for two

2400
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:05,039
because i think stanford's more like mit

2401
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:06,799
than than

2402
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:08,800
than you might imagine but uh but isn't

2403
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,640
taliban isn't it pretty

2404
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,039
i don't think there's a diversity so

2405
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:15,039
yeah so like sorry so just a rephrase so

2406
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:17,519
so people say oh the deobandi school i'm

2407
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:18,640
like what is that i mean but the taliban

2408
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,400
are

2409
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,320
they're an ethnic movement

2410
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:24,079
they represent

2411
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:26,799
a vision of

2412
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:27,920
pashtun power right questions are people

2413
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,640
who

2414
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,840
are quite internally diverse who

2415
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,960
actually

2416
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:38,719
speak multiple dialects of pashto who

2417
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:40,399
reside across the frontier of pakistan

2418
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:41,679
and afghanistan

2419
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:43,119
there are pashtuns who live all over the

2420
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:46,079
planet right there's a community in

2421
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:48,479
moscow california everywhere right so

2422
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:50,079
it's a global diaspora of sorts

2423
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:52,559
pashtuns have a kind of genealogical

2424
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:54,479
imagination so that lots of passions can

2425
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,600
tell you the names of their grandparents

2426
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,279
great-grandparents and so on and that's

2427
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,640
kind of a there's a sense of pride in

2428
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:01,119
that

2429
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:04,239
posture language is a kind of

2430
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:06,559
core element of that identity but it's

2431
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:08,799
not universal so for example

2432
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,480
you can meet people who say i am pashtun

2433
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,760
but i don't know pashto

2434
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:15,519
so as you as you claw away at this idea

2435
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,480
it's amorphous it also means different

2436
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,080
things different people at different

2437
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:20,799
times so

2438
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:22,479
saying the taliban our costume requires

2439
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,119
lots of qualifiers because

2440
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:26,718
lots of passions will say no no i i have

2441
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:27,840
nothing to the taliban i hate those

2442
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,920
people

2443
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,760
you know so

2444
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,399
the taliban tried to mobilize other posh

2445
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,239
students with limited success but their

2446
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:38,000
core membership is almost exclusively

2447
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:41,039
pashtun and they say

2448
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:44,079
no no we represent afghans we represent

2449
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:45,840
pious muslims and so in recent

2450
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:47,840
two three years

2451
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,679
they've gone further to say no we have

2452
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,880
other ethnic groups we have uzbeks we

2453
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,480
have tajiks

2454
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,079
we have hazaras

2455
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:56,319
and in the north of afghanistan in

2456
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:57,519
recent years they did do a bit better

2457
01:18:56,319 --> 01:18:59,679
at drawing in people who were very

2458
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,280
disappointed because of the government

2459
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,440
and they were able to diversify their

2460
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:05,920
ranks somewhat but if you watch august

2461
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:08,479
15 and who they've appointed

2462
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:11,119
what language they've used how they've

2463
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:14,319
presented themselves it's clear that

2464
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:15,359
you know they are pashtun they are male

2465
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:18,399
and they

2466
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:20,079
are extremely ideologically

2467
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:20,879
cohesive

2468
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:22,479
and

2469
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,079
disciplined i'd say

2470
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:26,000
right so i think that a lot of the

2471
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:28,000
polycentrism blah blah some of that

2472
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,238
stuff was a way to fight a war

2473
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,198
um they are they are fundamentally you

2474
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:32,879
know

2475
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:35,759
a guerrilla movement

2476
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,440
they see themselves as kind of

2477
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,440
robin hoods

2478
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,119
the rhetoric is very much about taking

2479
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:42,879
from the rich taking the privilege

2480
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:45,198
giving to the poor

2481
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,880
being outside of the underdog

2482
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:47,759
fighting against evil

2483
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,520
and so

2484
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,360
i mean they're bad if you like their

2485
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,840
thing they're their central theme their

2486
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:56,079
brand is about public morality and so

2487
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,039
their origin story going back to 1994 is

2488
01:19:56,079 --> 01:19:59,439
that

2489
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:00,800
they interceded they broke up a gang of

2490
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:03,198
criminals

2491
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:06,239
who were trying to rape people

2492
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:09,119
and so there's a branching kind of like

2493
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,559
emphasis on like sexuality and on on

2494
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:12,079
public morality

2495
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,639
and really being the core of like you

2496
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:15,920
know we're going to restore order and

2497
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,840
public morality

2498
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,199
and how that translates into governance

2499
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,880
is something they've never sorted out i

2500
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:21,599
mean how do you run a banking system if

2501
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,199
your

2502
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,199
intellectual priorities are really about

2503
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:27,678
you know the length of a beard

2504
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,678
and then and then their path to power

2505
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:33,600
in a kind of abstract sense i mean a lot

2506
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:34,880
of that was very much driven by um

2507
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,199
if you like

2508
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,480
propagating the problems of martyrdom

2509
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:39,519
and that sounds i don't mean to say that

2510
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:40,959
in a way that

2511
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:43,040
to make it sound ridiculous it may sound

2512
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,880
like it's um

2513
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:46,880
you know a moral judgment it's simply i

2514
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,760
think a fact it's a fact of their appeal

2515
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,279
that

2516
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:53,360
they promised young men who have known

2517
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:56,079
nothing else but

2518
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:57,359
studying in certain schools if at all

2519
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:58,158
but they've known fighting and they've

2520
01:20:57,359 --> 01:20:59,759
known

2521
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:02,319
they'd known victimization

2522
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,440
and this isn't i'm not asking for like

2523
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:05,279
sympathy for them but i think the

2524
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:06,879
reality is that a lot of

2525
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:08,719
we know about the kind of foot soldiers

2526
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:11,520
is that they

2527
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:15,039
they lost families and bombings um

2528
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:17,440
in air strikes in night raids you know

2529
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:18,639
i mean orphans have always been a stream

2530
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:22,158
um

2531
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:24,159
living in in all male society

2532
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:26,238
not knowing girls not knowing women

2533
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:27,920
hearing things from outside about places

2534
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:29,919
like kabul and so there's always been

2535
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,000
this kind of urban rural

2536
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,119
dimension it's not it's not just that

2537
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,399
but

2538
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:36,158
i think there's a

2539
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:38,079
there's a whole imagination

2540
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:39,519
that being taliban

2541
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:40,719
captures

2542
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,120
and the whole marginal thing is really

2543
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:44,960
it's um

2544
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:46,719
yeah i think to any religious person i

2545
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,279
mean it's not a it's not a bizarre idea

2546
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:50,960
i mean it animates i mean

2547
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,479
so many global traditions yeah but i

2548
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,920
think the

2549
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:55,439
but then you try to tell like an army

2550
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,279
colonel right if you were to have a

2551
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:58,719
conversation with you know u.s marine

2552
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,238
about this

2553
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:02,399
i mean some would get it from their own

2554
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:03,119
religious backgrounds but i think the

2555
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:05,198
it

2556
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:06,079
it's an alien idea but i think it it's

2557
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:07,759
essential to kind of stretch our

2558
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:08,960
imaginations understand that's

2559
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,199
that's attractive and now one of the

2560
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:13,600
dilemmas going forward is that

2561
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:15,678
they've got a pivot from

2562
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,600
martyrdom and some have been some have

2563
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:19,199
told foreign journalists i mean

2564
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,600
it's good that we're in charge now we're

2565
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:24,719
going to build a proper state

2566
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,920
but i it's kind of boring um i want to

2567
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,000
keep fighting i want to maybe i'll do it

2568
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,079
in pakistan yeah i mean it's nice that

2569
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,920
they are expressing that thought

2570
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:33,840
some are not even honest sufficiently

2571
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,279
with themselves to express that kind of

2572
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,119
thought if you're

2573
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:40,238
if you're a fighter

2574
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:42,399
yeah it's a you see that with a bunch of

2575
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:44,959
fighters or professional athletes once

2576
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:47,039
they retire yeah they don't know it's

2577
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,840
very it's boring

2578
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:49,920
yeah

2579
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,760
and so like the if the spirit of the

2580
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,760
taliban yeah

2581
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,159
even the the the best version of the

2582
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:59,440
taliban is to fight is to be martyrs is

2583
01:22:56,158 --> 01:23:01,439
to yeah is to and the paint the world is

2584
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:02,960
good and evil and you're fighting evil

2585
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:04,719
and all that kind of stuff that's

2586
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,520
difficult to imagine how they can run an

2587
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,719
education system a banking system

2588
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,280
respect

2589
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:13,520
all kinds of citizens with different

2590
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:15,039
backgrounds and religious beliefs and

2591
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,880
women and

2592
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:18,479
all that kind of stuff so yeah and

2593
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,800
they've they've walked into kabul and

2594
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:22,079
other major cities um

2595
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,400
if someone are young they never didn't

2596
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:26,158
know those places but also

2597
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:28,000
the very important

2598
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:29,839
obstacle for them is that afghan society

2599
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,359
has changed i mean it's

2600
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,440
it's not with even for the older guys

2601
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:35,920
it's not what they knew in the 1990s

2602
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,279
um some always had some ambulance about

2603
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,480
you know the capital

2604
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:39,840
but now it's totally different i mean

2605
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:42,079
they've been shocked to see i think to

2606
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,840
me one of the most striking

2607
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:44,960
features of the last few weeks has been

2608
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,000
that

2609
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,960
you know women have come out on the

2610
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,920
streets

2611
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,279
and have stood in their faces and said

2612
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,679
you know we demand rights we demand

2613
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:56,158
education we demand employment

2614
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:57,920
and um these foot soldiers are

2615
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:59,679
are paralyzed they're not sure they

2616
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,119
don't know what to do with women period

2617
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,039
yeah yeah and they don't know what to do

2618
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:04,158
with being yelled at and having someone

2619
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:05,359
stick their fingers in their faces i

2620
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:08,719
mean this is not

2621
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:10,479
not what they've imagined and so i think

2622
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:12,399
and at this at this juncture there are

2623
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:13,198
still foreign cameras around

2624
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:15,119
so

2625
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:17,119
they have committed active violence

2626
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:18,559
against women against journalists

2627
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:20,399
they've beaten people yeah they've

2628
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,400
disappeared people even with cameras are

2629
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:23,920
on even in this tense period yeah but i

2630
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:25,359
think that when the cameras

2631
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,440
you know retreat and that that's not

2632
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:28,399
gonna happen it's gonna get much worse i

2633
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:30,238
think

2634
01:24:28,399 --> 01:24:31,839
so the challenge now is you know can the

2635
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:32,879
taliban rule

2636
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,560
and

2637
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,920
and then this is where the diplomacy is

2638
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,719
so important because

2639
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,399
the top one can't rule in isolation and

2640
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:41,600
they know that and

2641
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:42,638
part of the success is due to the fact

2642
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,920
that they were

2643
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:45,359
they became very good at talking to

2644
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,719
other people

2645
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:47,759
in the last

2646
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:50,560
i mean it's been building the last

2647
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,159
decade but that's the last five years

2648
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,719
and they always had pakistan's backing

2649
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:56,719
and so the taliban are we we noted their

2650
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,639
military force very effective gorilla

2651
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,600
force they be they beat nato i mean this

2652
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,600
is

2653
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,800
still hasn't sunk in i mean the fact

2654
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,239
that they

2655
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:07,039
with light arms

2656
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:08,479
using suicide attacks

2657
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:11,679
using mines

2658
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:13,198
improvised explosive devices

2659
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,520
machine guns

2660
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:17,039
and some in recent years they got sniper

2661
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,440
rifles

2662
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:21,359
and you know from the summer they got

2663
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:23,119
american equipment on a broad scale

2664
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:24,559
right they have airplanes they have a

2665
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:27,439
lot that they will be able to use

2666
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,800
eventually um so but still basically

2667
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:30,559
it's a story of

2668
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,960
ak-47s

2669
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,880
some american small arms

2670
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,000
and mines so it's very

2671
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,000
ho chi minh

2672
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,520
very old-school guerrilla fighting right

2673
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,960
and they defeated the most powerful

2674
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,159
military alliance in world history

2675
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,359
probably so

2676
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:44,479
that has not yet sunk in on what that

2677
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:46,399
means for

2678
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:49,279
american and global politics

2679
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:50,719
um and now they're trying to rule right

2680
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:52,840
they know they need

2681
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:54,880
international support

2682
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:56,079
and the most consistent backer has been

2683
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,800
pakistan

2684
01:25:56,079 --> 01:26:00,719
who sees them as a extension of

2685
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,840
pakistani power

2686
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,439
you know and this is very important for

2687
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,119
a pakistani elite that of course is

2688
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:06,479
looking toward india

2689
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:08,399
they want to have their

2690
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:09,759
rear covered right

2691
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:11,519
they want to make sure that these

2692
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,960
pashtuns don't cause trouble for

2693
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,639
pakistan

2694
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,960
and they like i mean for some of the

2695
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:19,039
security forces they like this vision of

2696
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,480
the islamic state that the taiwan are

2697
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:22,000
building there because they

2698
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:24,238
those are not citizens from their views

2699
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,039
of what pakistan should be

2700
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:26,559
but

2701
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:28,079
the taliban have been

2702
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,320
smart enough to kind of diversify their

2703
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:31,198
potential international allies

2704
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:32,880
so

2705
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:36,319
everyone in the neighborhood has wanted

2706
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,600
the us to leave right if we got 2001

2707
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:39,039
there were iranian and american special

2708
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,800
forces in the north

2709
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:42,719
working together against taliban to

2710
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,679
displace them using

2711
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,319
you know

2712
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,639
iranian american and then afghan

2713
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:49,840
resistance forces against the taliban

2714
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:52,079
and that was a real moment of request

2715
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:54,560
mall if we go back to the missed

2716
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:55,840
exits um

2717
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,120
the glacier with iran could be different

2718
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,000
at that moment

2719
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:00,639
but

2720
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,719
the us under george w bush

2721
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,639
you know devised this axis of evil

2722
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:06,800
language

2723
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:08,480
put them together with their enemy iraq

2724
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,920
and north korea

2725
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:12,319
all that went south

2726
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,560
that was the missed opportunity

2727
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:16,799
but in recent years the taliban and iran

2728
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,800
have

2729
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,319
kind of papered over the differences

2730
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:22,800
they allowed

2731
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:24,238
the talbot to open some offices in on

2732
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,600
iranian territory

2733
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,319
likely shared some resources some

2734
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,560
intelligence some sophisticated weaponry

2735
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:32,719
um and then the taliban went to moscow

2736
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,199
and for the demonstration

2737
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:36,319
you know they've long been worried that

2738
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:37,519
you know they see the talbot as a kind

2739
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:39,198
of

2740
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,480
you know disease that will potentially

2741
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:42,960
move north

2742
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:44,479
in fact uzbekistan tajikistan kyrgyzstan

2743
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,639
turkmenistan

2744
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:47,919
and maybe creep into russia's sphere of

2745
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:50,800
influence

2746
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,399
maybe that's why they have you know

2747
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:55,039
a bunch of troops sitting in tajikistan

2748
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:56,719
i mean the one you know forward base

2749
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:58,560
that russia as well has in central asia

2750
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,399
is indigestion

2751
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,000
and so the talmud were always

2752
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:03,759
you know a worrying point but also

2753
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,920
useful because

2754
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,239
they could say well you know

2755
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,679
um in case it's how long it out control

2756
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:11,279
we need to be here

2757
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:13,039
and so tajikistan

2758
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:15,359
said okay you know you're helping you're

2759
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:16,880
helping secure us and yes it impinges

2760
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:17,920
upon our sovereignty but it's okay you

2761
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,679
know

2762
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,639
so putin said you know

2763
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:22,319
let's

2764
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:23,440
you know give another black eye to the

2765
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:24,399
americans

2766
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:25,678
and let's

2767
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:27,519
you know treat the taliban as if they're

2768
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:30,079
the kind of government in waiting let's

2769
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,679
have them come to moscow multiple times

2770
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:32,639
this summer you know

2771
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:34,880
for the last year or two they've been

2772
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:37,039
talking to the talking to china right so

2773
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:39,199
the photographs of

2774
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:40,800
senior top on figures

2775
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:42,960
going from their office in qatar which

2776
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:44,239
was a major major blow to the u.s back

2777
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,279
government the fact that they were able

2778
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:46,959
to open up

2779
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:49,840
an office in qatar that at one point

2780
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,198
began to fly a flag of the islamic

2781
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,639
afghanistan

2782
01:28:51,198 --> 01:28:54,238
that basically said we're a state in

2783
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:56,880
them in the waiting

2784
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:58,959
and as the u.s backed afghan government

2785
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,039
failed and failed and failed at at

2786
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,399
ruling two right as they showed how

2787
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:03,600
corrupt they were

2788
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:05,920
and as they really alienated more and

2789
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,280
more afghans by committing backs of

2790
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,199
violence against them

2791
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:11,840
by stealing from them

2792
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:14,638
by you know

2793
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,600
basically creating a kind of kleptocracy

2794
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,880
right

2795
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,960
um

2796
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,480
the taliban said we are pure

2797
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,520
we are not corrupt

2798
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:23,839
and look at us we're winning on the

2799
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,280
battlefield and

2800
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,119
look we're talking to china we're

2801
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:27,920
talking to putin we're talking to china

2802
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:30,319
yeah

2803
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:31,920
we're a legitimate powerful center of

2804
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:33,759
central asia and also kind of you know

2805
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,679
hinting that you know we oh we have a

2806
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,039
website i mean the whole digital angle

2807
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,719
is amazing because they

2808
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,479
they began to and this is important

2809
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:41,920
actually they they had a

2810
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:44,158
a website which

2811
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:46,000
grew more so skated again after having

2812
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:48,479
you know shot televisions and these kind

2813
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,840
of ceremonial killings of these infidel

2814
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:50,879
devices right

2815
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,639
they said

2816
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:55,359
we have a government we have

2817
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:56,400
commissions we have a complaint line

2818
01:29:55,359 --> 01:29:57,839
they

2819
01:29:56,399 --> 01:30:00,158
lifted all this technocratic language

2820
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,520
that you get from any u.n document you

2821
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:03,920
know about good governance and all that

2822
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,520
kind of you know generic language that

2823
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,560
the ngo world has produced for us right

2824
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,480
in english

2825
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:10,320
they reproduced that in five languages

2826
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:11,519
on their telephone website

2827
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:13,599
and of course i'm not saying even

2828
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,159
believe this but it was like

2829
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,679
you know just put me in coach you know i

2830
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:19,039
know the playbook i know how to run a

2831
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:20,639
government and look we have a we have an

2832
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:24,079
agricultural commission

2833
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:26,159
we have um you know a taxation system

2834
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:28,238
and again this id and then on the ground

2835
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:30,238
they had their own law courts

2836
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:31,839
and they would creep into a district

2837
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:34,718
assassinate some people the local

2838
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:36,880
authority figures men of influence

2839
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:38,480
talk to local clerics either get them on

2840
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,039
board or kill them

2841
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:42,399
and say you know this state is corrupt

2842
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:43,840
but we're bringing you justice this is

2843
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:45,599
our calling card we're bringing public

2844
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,480
reality and justice

2845
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,880
and then

2846
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:50,319
to a broader world they said you know

2847
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,560
yeah things didn't go perfectly the

2848
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:54,079
whole al qaeda thing you know

2849
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,120
you know wish we could have a do-over on

2850
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:57,439
that

2851
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:59,198
um we're not going to let anyone hurt

2852
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:00,638
you from our territory we just want to

2853
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:03,039
rule and

2854
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:05,039
people like us and and look

2855
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:07,198
and so if you look at the neighborhood

2856
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:08,158
iran even central asian states after a

2857
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:09,359
while

2858
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:10,879
recognizing they can make some money i

2859
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:12,880
mean one of the one thing that spikes

2860
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,840
down likes about the current arrangement

2861
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,760
or they're not

2862
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,679
they're not hostile to is that

2863
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:20,480
they have all these contracts they can

2864
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:22,399
potentially make some money from

2865
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:25,039
you know the pipeline dream remains

2866
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:26,479
alive running natural gas oil

2867
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:27,920
to you know

2868
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:31,279
the indian ocean

2869
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:32,319
to markets you know beyond central asia

2870
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:34,000
it's sitting on a couple trillion

2871
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:36,238
dollars probably in mineral resources

2872
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,238
that china would love to have of course

2873
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:39,919
and so people looking at afghanistan now

2874
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:41,279
after 20 years saying

2875
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,679
you know under american rule it was a

2876
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:45,198
basket case

2877
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:47,119
there was immense human suffering

2878
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:49,039
incredibly violent the world did not

2879
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:51,359
start counting civilian casualties in

2880
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:53,279
afghanistan until 2009. everything about

2881
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:54,639
that the war went on for eight years

2882
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:56,399
the talbot were never really defeated

2883
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:59,679
they just went to pakistan they went to

2884
01:31:56,399 --> 01:32:01,439
the mountains into the woods um and so

2885
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:02,719
all these different american operations

2886
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:05,839
as you noted

2887
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:07,439
under bush obama trump and so on

2888
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,239
um

2889
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:09,839
killed

2890
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:11,599
countless civilians the u.s never

2891
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,119
counted for that we never we never even

2892
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,360
counted um

2893
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:17,119
trump escalated the civilian casualties

2894
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:19,198
by escalating the air war

2895
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:21,119
but a lot of this was like very ugly on

2896
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:23,439
the ground you know night raid stuff

2897
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:25,679
where you drop into a hamlet

2898
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:27,198
and and massacre people

2899
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:28,800
and then you're not honest about what

2900
01:32:27,198 --> 01:32:30,799
happened right so

2901
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,560
that dynamic continued to fuel the

2902
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,000
growth of taliban from below

2903
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,520
so the foot soldiers they never they

2904
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,479
never ran out of foot soldiers i mean

2905
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,679
the us and its allies killed

2906
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:41,279
tens of thousands maybe hundreds of

2907
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,639
thousands of taiwan fighters over the

2908
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:45,039
last 20 years

2909
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:46,400
but they just sprouted up again and part

2910
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:48,158
of that was kind of solidarity culture

2911
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:50,319
the male bonding of

2912
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:52,960
of of martyrology of you know of

2913
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:56,000
martyrdom and enough

2914
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,760
you know revenge and a sense of um

2915
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,960
you know the foreign invader and i've

2916
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,159
heard i mean i've you know i haven't

2917
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:02,319
taught a ton of

2918
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:04,399
u.s military people but through the

2919
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:05,840
hoover you know they put officers in our

2920
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:08,079
classes sometimes and

2921
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,600
met a few wonderful you know army and

2922
01:33:08,079 --> 01:33:11,359
marine officers who

2923
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,880
i really enjoyed you know we came from

2924
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:15,198
the south like me

2925
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,480
always had great rapport with them and

2926
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:17,519
and they expressed a range of opinions

2927
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:19,039
about this i think that you know i

2928
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,280
learned a lot from some of them who said

2929
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:22,800
yeah i mean i get that i get why they

2930
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:24,479
hate us i get why

2931
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,840
they're still fighting because

2932
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:27,119
you know last week

2933
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:29,279
we just

2934
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:31,279
killed 14 of their

2935
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:32,399
you know fellow villagers

2936
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:34,479
so

2937
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:36,719
the officers the guys on the ground you

2938
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:38,559
know fighting this war we're not stupid

2939
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:40,399
about that i mean they they got the

2940
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,679
human dimension of that and yet no one

2941
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:43,119
got off the exit as you said people

2942
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:46,319
people kept driving

2943
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:48,800
um but going forward now internationally

2944
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:50,399
it's critical that they have

2945
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,920
i mean they've had meetings

2946
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:54,079
i mean what the top one have done since

2947
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,760
august 15th is a lot of diplomacy

2948
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:57,519
they've had meetings they've had people

2949
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:00,320
they've had tashkent come they've had

2950
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:02,639
beijing come they've had mosque.com

2951
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:06,079
i mean they've had

2952
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:07,920
major visits from islamabad

2953
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:09,198
from security people from diplomatic

2954
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,719
circles

2955
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:12,000
and they're counting on

2956
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:13,600
things being different this time i mean

2957
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,760
the first time around the only people

2958
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,520
who backed the taliban by recognition

2959
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,239
giving them automatic recognition

2960
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:22,480
with the saudis pakistanis and the uae

2961
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:24,399
and because of al qaeda

2962
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:26,238
because of opium

2963
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:28,000
because of some of the human rights

2964
01:34:26,238 --> 01:34:29,279
stuff you know the us pushed everyone to

2965
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,359
like you know let's not recognize the

2966
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:33,039
state even though the u.s did i mean

2967
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:35,599
colin powell famously

2968
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:38,880
in the summer of 2001 you know we did

2969
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:40,960
give a few grants and aid um

2970
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:44,400
to the taliban

2971
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:46,239
as a kind of like massaging negotiations

2972
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:48,319
they kept talking about bin laden but

2973
01:34:46,238 --> 01:34:50,000
they also wanted them to stop um

2974
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:50,960
opium production i mean afghanistan

2975
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,118
throughout all this period we've talked

2976
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:55,118
about is the global center of

2977
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:57,359
opium production i mean over the years

2978
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:59,679
more and more of the afghan economy

2979
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:00,960
continue to today is devoted to the

2980
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,639
opium trade

2981
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:06,000
which is

2982
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:09,039
uh the thing that leads to heroin yep

2983
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,880
uh some of the painkillers

2984
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:11,679
and even if afghan poppies don't make it

2985
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,920
to

2986
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:15,840
you know hoboken you know that they are

2987
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,399
not the

2988
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:20,719
the source of american deaths you know

2989
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:24,319
they are part of a

2990
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:25,679
a universal market a global market which

2991
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:28,000
you know i think any economist will tell

2992
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:29,760
you is part of the story of our opium

2993
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,840
you know problem

2994
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,280
something i

2995
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,360
read

2996
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:37,198
maybe a decade ago now and i just kind

2997
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:40,319
of looked it up again to bring it up to

2998
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:42,960
see your opinion on this is um there's a

2999
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:45,519
2010 report by the international council

3000
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:47,118
on security development that showed that

3001
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:51,280
92 percent

3002
01:35:47,118 --> 01:35:52,399
of afghans in helmand and kandahar

3003
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:55,279
province

3004
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:56,799
know nothing of the 9 11 attacks on u.s

3005
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:57,920
in 2001.

3006
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,400
is this

3007
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:02,960
at all representative of what you know

3008
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:05,039
is this possible so basically put

3009
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:08,079
another way yeah it

3010
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:11,439
is it possible that a lot of afghans

3011
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:14,719
don't even know the reason

3012
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:16,158
why there may be troops or the sort of

3013
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:18,480
american

3014
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:19,519
provided narrative for why there's

3015
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:22,238
troops

3016
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,600
so american soldiers and american drones

3017
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:26,319
overhead

3018
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:29,119
in afghanistan right

3019
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:32,000
i mean my gut response not knowing the

3020
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:33,519
details of this actual poll is

3021
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,600
that that's a um

3022
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:38,719
a very

3023
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:41,520
unhelpful way to think about how afghans

3024
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:42,560
relate to the world and i think um

3025
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,719
you know it could be you know if you go

3026
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,080
to my hometown

3027
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:48,079
in north carolina

3028
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:49,679
if you knock out some doors

3029
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:51,198
you may meet people who don't know all

3030
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,239
kinds of things i could probably walk

3031
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:53,919
around this neighborhood here in

3032
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:55,198
california and there'd be all kinds of

3033
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,600
people who

3034
01:36:55,198 --> 01:36:59,678
don't know all kinds of things um

3035
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,520
you know kyrie irving

3036
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:02,800
apparently thinks the earth is flat i

3037
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,639
mean you know

3038
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,719
so we could we could

3039
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:08,719
make a lot of

3040
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:10,239
certain kinds of ignorance i think but

3041
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:11,760
i think what i would say and then and

3042
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:12,879
there's also i mean a companion point

3043
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,480
may be that

3044
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,880
in thinking about the withdrawal the

3045
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:17,919
collapse the return of the taliban

3046
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,159
there's been

3047
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:22,399
a big conversation about um you know

3048
01:37:20,158 --> 01:37:24,399
what advocates think of us really and

3049
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:25,519
this famous piece in the new yorker was

3050
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:27,198
about

3051
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,239
how you know many people liked the

3052
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:30,399
taliban

3053
01:37:28,238 --> 01:37:32,399
you know that many women

3054
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:35,039
interviewed

3055
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:36,158
supposedly in this piece um

3056
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:38,158
you know were sympathetic because they

3057
01:37:36,158 --> 01:37:40,879
lost family members and all the violence

3058
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:42,000
and the idea kind of was that

3059
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,079
you know we haven't thought about that

3060
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,840
at all when in fact you know of course

3061
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:46,880
we have and lots of people have but i

3062
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:49,039
think if you're just dropping into the

3063
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,319
conversation if you look at the media

3064
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:52,079
arc of coverage of afghanistan the

3065
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:53,118
united states i mean

3066
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:55,439
the

3067
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:57,599
arc went from lots of coverage during of

3068
01:37:55,439 --> 01:38:00,638
course 9 11 it's aftermath

3069
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:03,199
lots of coverage during obama's surge

3070
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:05,118
and then quickly drop down the last

3071
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:06,799
decade has been almost nothing

3072
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:08,479
so if you ask the same question about

3073
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,440
americans or other americans i'm not

3074
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:11,198
sure what they would say to you what

3075
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:14,079
percentage would actually know

3076
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:15,519
why the u.s is in x y or z either right

3077
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:17,359
but again the afghan side just to return

3078
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,639
to that for a moment i think that

3079
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:21,279
you know we can fetishize these

3080
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:23,039
provinces they are kind of you know a

3081
01:38:21,279 --> 01:38:24,000
place where talbot support has been

3082
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:25,118
greatest

3083
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,639
also where there's been the most

3084
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:28,479
violence where the americans have been

3085
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:30,639
most committed to trying to

3086
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:32,238
root out the top on movement where

3087
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:33,840
hellman and kind of exactly in the south

3088
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:36,319
what are the other parts in the south of

3089
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,159
the gas yeah it's mostly poshtune not

3090
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:39,359
exclusively but mostly poshtun you know

3091
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:40,238
mostly rural

3092
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,079
whatever

3093
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:43,678
that's the other group you know that

3094
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:44,559
that the taliban claimed to represent

3095
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:46,079
right

3096
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:48,159
so they're this group what other groups

3097
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:49,840
are there okay sorry yeah sorry so in

3098
01:38:48,158 --> 01:38:51,759
cities you'll find

3099
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:55,199
everything right that is in afghanistan

3100
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:57,520
you'll find uzbeks tajiks hazaras

3101
01:38:55,198 --> 01:39:00,960
um these are people who

3102
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:02,159
you know is a turkey language right uh

3103
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,239
most uzbeks live in what is now

3104
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:06,638
uzbekistan but they form majorities in

3105
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:08,559
some northern parts of the city i'm

3106
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:11,359
sorry of the country of afghanistan

3107
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,719
but whatever size is that um

3108
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:14,158
and you can you can find online an

3109
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,039
ethographic map afghanistan and you'll

3110
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:17,039
see

3111
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:18,399
green where pashtuns live red where

3112
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:20,639
hazaras live

3113
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:22,238
orange islands live you know purple

3114
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,279
where tajiks live

3115
01:39:22,238 --> 01:39:25,599
then there are a bunch of other smaller

3116
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:26,559
groups of different kinds you know there

3117
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,850
are

3118
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,400
um

3119
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:30,480
[Music]

3120
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:31,519
there are baluch

3121
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:32,638
there are

3122
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,880
different religious communities there

3123
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:36,319
are sunni shia different kinds of shia

3124
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,560
what are the key differences between

3125
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:40,399
them is it a religious basis

3126
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,760
from the origins of where they

3127
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:43,439
immigrated from

3128
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,480
and how different are they yeah so

3129
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:46,158
they're all

3130
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:47,759
i mean they're all indigenous i think i

3131
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:49,439
mean there's a kind of mythology that

3132
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,880
some groups have been there longer right

3133
01:39:49,439 --> 01:39:51,919
so they have a greater claim to power

3134
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:53,679
but

3135
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:55,440
historically

3136
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:56,719
i mean it's like you know ethnic groups

3137
01:39:55,439 --> 01:39:58,879
anywhere people have different

3138
01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:01,920
narratives about themselves but many

3139
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:03,199
many pashtuns would tell you not all but

3140
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,719
many would say

3141
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:07,919
we are the kind of state builders of

3142
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:09,520
afghanistan the dynasty that ruled much

3143
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:12,079
of the space

3144
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:15,280
that was born in the mid 18th century

3145
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:16,479
that ruled until 1973 more or less

3146
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:18,399
generalizing

3147
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:20,879
you know it was a pakian dynasty the

3148
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:22,559
taliban have definitely said

3149
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:25,440
to some audiences we are the rightful

3150
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:26,480
rulers because we are pashtun

3151
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:27,919
um

3152
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,678
the trick though is let me i don't mean

3153
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:32,239
to be evasive but just to convince some

3154
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:34,480
of the complexity um one quick answer as

3155
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:36,079
well the majority of minorities i mean

3156
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:37,279
one finds out a lot along with those

3157
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:39,118
maps

3158
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:41,679
but i would say

3159
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:43,679
suspend any firm belief in that because

3160
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:45,199
that could be entirely wrong in fact

3161
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:46,960
there's never been a modern sense of

3162
01:40:45,198 --> 01:40:48,479
census of afghanistan

3163
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,480
so when journalists say

3164
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:51,198
pashion's a majority whether the biggest

3165
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:52,959
group

3166
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:54,960
i would say not so fast

3167
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:56,880
i'd say not so fast because of

3168
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,399
migration is one major issue

3169
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,840
no major

3170
01:40:58,399 --> 01:41:01,118
modern census

3171
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,199
actually the soviets got pretty close

3172
01:41:01,118 --> 01:41:04,960
but didn't quite you know find something

3173
01:41:03,198 --> 01:41:06,559
comprehensive and didn't publicize it

3174
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,480
knowing that it was

3175
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,880
um you know modern times ethnicity can

3176
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:13,039
be the source of political mobilization

3177
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:15,039
it's not it's not innately so but it's

3178
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:16,719
been part of the story but then you have

3179
01:41:15,039 --> 01:41:18,639
mixed families right so a lot of people

3180
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:20,239
you'll meet you'll encounter in the dash

3181
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:22,960

i mean everything's possible right

3192
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:44,479
um

3193
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,399
one of my friends

3194
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:47,519
if you if he were here he'd say i'm

3195
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:49,839
kabuli

3196
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,119
you know i'm i'm from kabul so

3197
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,119
if you think about the russian terms you

3198
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:55,920
know it means a lot if you're a mosquito

3199
01:41:53,118 --> 01:41:58,559
you know if you're from bishop or yeah

3200
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:00,880
i mean you know yeah well even here

3201
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,760
there's bostonians yep that's right

3202
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,319
texans

3203
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:06,159
californians

3204
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:07,118
yeah east coast west coast all that

3205
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:09,279
stuff

3206
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:10,960
those are all part of the mix here so

3207
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:12,238
you ask about kandahar and helmond then

3208
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:16,239
i would say

3209
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:17,519
yeah if you go to you know a pomegranate

3210
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:19,519
you know field

3211
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:21,360
you'll meet a guy who

3212
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:22,400
may reckon time differently from you and

3213
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:23,599
me

3214
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:25,839
who

3215
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:27,679
may not be literate he may not have ever

3216
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:30,159
had a geography lesson

3217
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:31,679
but if you go one door over you may meet

3218
01:42:30,158 --> 01:42:32,099
a guy

3219
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,000
who

3220
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:36,000
[Music]

3221
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,319
you know his life path has taken him to

3222
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,158
live in you know six countries

3223
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:41,279
he may speak five languages

3224
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:42,238
and this is all things i'm not saying

3225
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:44,000
they're all these are just because

3226
01:42:42,238 --> 01:42:45,839
people have money can go fly around i

3227
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,719
mean they're people who are displaced by

3228
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,960
war

3229
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:51,760
from late 1970s right even already in

3230
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,439
the early 70s people were traveling by

3231
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,360
the tens of thousands to iran

3232
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:56,799
you know as labor migrants and once you

3233
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:59,279
get to iran once you get to pakistan

3234
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:01,119
once you get to uzbekistan

3235
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:03,039
you then connect to all kinds of

3236
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:04,799
cosmopolitan cultures in fact i think

3237
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:05,840
one of the themes of of the book you

3238
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,520
know that you may or may not have read

3239
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:09,279
and they put you to sleep um

3240
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,719
you know afghan modern was about you

3241
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:12,639
know conceptualizing afghanistan as a

3242
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:14,639
cosmopolitan place where

3243
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:16,000
for centuries people put on the move

3244
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:18,400
and trade in this area you think of you

3245
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,840
know i think this mischaracterization of

3246
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:21,679
places like hellmann

3247
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,239
and kandahar you fly in

3248
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:25,679
or you're part of the marine battalion

3249
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:28,559
and you see people there and they look

3250
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:30,000
different and i think in our imagination

3251
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,440
if i can generalize

3252
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,000
you know they look like they've been

3253
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:35,839
there for millennia right the dress the

3254
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,800
whatever right you think of technology

3255
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,760
think of the

3256
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,639
the mud compounds and so on you think of

3257
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,000
you know

3258
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:43,679
animal drawn

3259
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,520
transportation that kind of stuff right

3260
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:46,399
or the motorbike right at most is what

3261
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,040
they have

3262
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:51,198
but in fact if you buy those families um

3263
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:53,359
their trade is taking them to northern

3264
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:54,719
india for centuries right the trade has

3265
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:56,639
connected them to

3266
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,639
cosplaton centers you say they have a

3267
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,480
scholar in the family that scholar may

3268
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:01,920
have studied all of the middle east

3269
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:03,039
south asia right

3270
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:04,560
you know the ancestors may have been

3271
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:06,719
horse traders who went all the way to

3272
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,239
moscow right i mean we we have historic

3273
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:10,158
records of all these people traveling

3274
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:12,399
across eurasia

3275
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:15,198
pursuing all kinds of livelihoods

3276
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:16,559
and so afghanistan is this paradox of

3277
01:44:15,198 --> 01:44:18,559
visually looking

3278
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:21,360
remote and looking like it's kind of

3279
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,880
stuck in time but the family

3280
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:24,479
trajectories and the current

3281
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,319
contradictories are astoundingly

3282
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:29,118
cosmopolitan and mobile

3283
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:31,920
and so um and a conception of being a

3284
01:44:29,118 --> 01:44:32,880
world center is also quite strong so

3285
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,079
you know another way to frame that

3286
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,000
question about like do they know about

3287
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:37,840
911 would be like

3288
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,279
why should we know about 911 because we

3289
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,360
are at the center of something important

3290
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:42,719
right we are the center of asia we are

3291
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:44,719
the heart of asia

3292
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:45,920
we have a kind of historic greatness we

3293
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:47,118
are

3294
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,800
you know

3295
01:44:47,118 --> 01:44:49,839
a proud culture of our own achievements

3296
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,679
right so

3297
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,679
we're not worried about that right

3298
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:55,199
that said i mean sure there are

3299
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:57,760
different narratives about why americans

3300
01:44:55,198 --> 01:44:58,719
are there why people are being killed

3301
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,480
you know

3302
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:02,480
of course you'd find you know they want

3303
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:05,039
to convert us you know they want our

3304
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:06,399
gold they want our opium they want x y

3305
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:09,359
and z right

3306
01:45:06,399 --> 01:45:10,559
there was a recent story about a taliban

3307
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:11,759
official

3308
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,199
sitting in office in kabul and a

3309
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:15,039
journalist asked him can you find in

3310
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:16,319
this rotating globe

3311
01:45:15,039 --> 01:45:17,760
find your country find where we're

3312
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:20,639
sitting right now

3313
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:22,560
and he was filmed not being able to do

3314
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,079
it and so a lot of you know race was

3315
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,639
good afghans with asperger were saying

3316
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:28,479
you know ha ha look at this and if that

3317
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:29,760
exists i mean i think

3318
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:30,799
i could go to my stanford classroom and

3319
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:33,360
there'd be a lot of kids who wouldn't

3320
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,960
know where afghanistan is too right but

3321
01:45:33,359 --> 01:45:37,679
but i i wouldn't i wouldn't use those

3322
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:39,279
metrics to suggest that this is a

3323
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:41,440
a place that doesn't have a sense of its

3324
01:45:39,279 --> 01:45:43,279
place in the world and of

3325
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:44,719
geopolitics i think if anything being a

3326
01:45:43,279 --> 01:45:46,399
relatively small country in a very

3327
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,560
complicated neighborhood

3328
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:50,399
i mean everybody every cab driver i mean

3329
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:52,080
people have a i mean

3330
01:45:50,399 --> 01:45:53,118
you know this is where america is

3331
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:54,719
different because i don't think

3332
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:55,839
americans have this sense you know we

3333
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:57,118
we're talking about moscow and stuff i

3334
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,679
think you know

3335
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:01,118
moscow cab drivers

3336
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:03,039
i think a lot of them are going to tell

3337
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:05,519
you like what's happening in the world

3338
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:07,198
and why right it's just part of it's

3339
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,800
part of their thing right you can find

3340
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:10,238
that in ghana you find that mexico city

3341
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,279
right you find that lots of places so i

3342
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:12,718
think

3343
01:46:11,279 --> 01:46:14,960
afghans are part of

3344
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:16,800
a very sophisticated kind of

3345
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,679
mapping of the world and where they fit

3346
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,279
in

3347
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:21,039
and a lot of them remarkably had done it

3348
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:22,479
firsthand which is what struck me so

3349
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:24,079
much and you know relating my

3350
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:26,158
experiences from the 1990s and tashkent

3351
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:28,238
places that these guys had already lived

3352
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:30,079
in more countries than i've ever been

3353
01:46:28,238 --> 01:46:30,959
they already knew half those languages i

3354
01:46:30,079 --> 01:46:33,359
mean

3355
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,800
this one friend's russian was impeccable

3356
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:36,238
um and of course it helped they had

3357
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,760
russian girlfriends

3358
01:46:36,238 --> 01:46:40,479
they had you know they they mixed with

3359
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:41,920
the police they had run-ins i mean they

3360
01:46:40,479 --> 01:46:44,718
this wasn't something you got from a

3361
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:47,039
book right this was like hard knock life

3362
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:48,158
i mean one one friend what's my wealthy

3363
01:46:47,039 --> 01:46:50,079
family

3364
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:51,599
uh in this trading diaspora

3365
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:54,880
and he was imprisoned i mean they sent

3366
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:57,039
him to prison uh in pakistan and he

3367
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:58,719
talks about how he started like running

3368
01:46:57,039 --> 01:47:00,079
running in the jail you know

3369
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:01,118
taking cigarettes to people doing little

3370
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:02,639
things and

3371
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:04,158
kind of you know it's

3372
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:05,520
these are not stories of like oh i went

3373
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:06,799
to i went to harvard and so i'm so

3374
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,800
learning because

3375
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,320
i mean it's a whole range of experiences

3376
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,400
the interesting thing is a survey is a

3377
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:14,000
survey and

3378
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:17,359
it doesn't

3379
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,800
reflect ignorance as you're saying

3380
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:21,279
perhaps

3381
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:24,000
but it may reflect a different

3382
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:25,359
geopolitical view of the world than the

3383
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,279
west has

3384
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:30,639
yeah so if

3385
01:47:27,279 --> 01:47:33,279
you know for a lot of the world 9 11

3386
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:35,520
was one of the most important moments of

3387
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:38,399
recent human history

3388
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,840
and for afghanistan not to know that

3389
01:47:38,399 --> 01:47:41,279
especially when they're part of that

3390
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,199
story yeah

3391
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:44,158
it means they have a very different like

3392
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:46,079
uh

3393
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:48,479
there could be a lot of things said

3394
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:50,719
one is the spread of information

3395
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:52,479
is different the channels of the way

3396
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:54,800
information is spread

3397
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:57,359
and uh to the things they care about

3398
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:00,880
maybe they see themselves

3399
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:03,039
in uh as part of a longer arc of history

3400
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,800
with the bickering of these

3401
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:06,079
superpowers that seem to want to go to

3402
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,639
the moon

3403
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:10,319
uh are not as important as the big sort

3404
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:12,239
of arc that's been the story of

3405
01:48:10,319 --> 01:48:14,158
afghanistan

3406
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:17,118
it is you know that that's an

3407
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:19,759
interesting idea but um it's still a bit

3408
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:21,599
if at all representative of the truth

3409
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,199
right it's heartbreaking

3410
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:26,560
that they're not

3411
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:28,638
do not see themselves as a

3412
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,480
active player

3413
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:33,600
in this

3414
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:36,079
game between the united states and the

3415
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,560
the in central asia because they're such

3416
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:40,158
a critical player and they feel and

3417
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:42,400
obviously

3418
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:46,638
um in many ways get the short end of the

3419
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:49,279
stick in this whole interaction with uh

3420
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:52,639
uh you know invasion of afghanistan for

3421
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:55,279
many years and then uh this uh rushed

3422
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:58,960
with withdrawal of troops and and now

3423
01:48:55,279 --> 01:49:01,840
the economic uh collapse and that yeah

3424
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:01,840
it's um

3425
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:05,439
it's it's sad in some ways no it's very

3426
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:07,279
it's true i mean you know another way to

3427
01:49:05,439 --> 01:49:08,960
put it is this um

3428
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:10,158
i mean there's a range of knowledge and

3429
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,520
and you're right the information flows

3430
01:49:10,158 --> 01:49:12,238
are

3431
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:14,159
are

3432
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:16,000
peculiar to particular geographies and

3433
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:17,439
histories and stuff i think that

3434
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,079
you know plucking out one sample from

3435
01:49:17,439 --> 01:49:21,678
some fairly remote area

3436
01:49:20,079 --> 01:49:23,439
from one like follow the follow the

3437
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:26,000
agricultural products i mean

3438
01:49:23,439 --> 01:49:28,319
and this is where you know i think

3439
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,359
urban rural divides sure used to mean a

3440
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:31,439
lot more

3441
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:33,198
in the 19th century right so a lot of

3442
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:34,960
like nuts and bolts of history is about

3443
01:49:33,198 --> 01:49:36,879
conceiving of these kinds of

3444
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:38,319
distinctions you know but i think that

3445
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:40,000
if one has the privilege of traveling a

3446
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:43,279
bit you see that like

3447
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,920
urban areas are fed by rural interlands

3448
01:49:43,279 --> 01:49:47,759
and if you look think of who actually

3449
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:49,679
you know brings the bread the milk you

3450
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:51,599
know the pomegranates and so on it

3451
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:53,039
creates these networks and then

3452
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:55,520
you know mobility

3453
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:57,039
channels information and so on

3454
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:58,159
but yeah that but your broader point

3455
01:49:57,039 --> 01:50:00,399
about like the tragedy of this man i

3456
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:03,279
guess if i can quote a brain student of

3457
01:50:00,399 --> 01:50:05,039
mine an afghan american woman who just

3458
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:06,158
received her phd who's now you know

3459
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:07,760
doctor

3460
01:50:06,158 --> 01:50:09,598
um he's a great scholar

3461
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,119
you know we've done

3462
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:13,039
several events now trying to just think

3463
01:50:11,118 --> 01:50:14,000
through what's happened and

3464
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:15,920
of course she's very emotionally

3465
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,760
affected by it and she continues to ask

3466
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,359
a really great question if i can get her

3467
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,560
phrasing right

3468
01:50:19,359 --> 01:50:23,359
you know if you think of the cycle of

3469
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:24,880
like the top one being in power in 2001

3470
01:50:23,359 --> 01:50:27,039
in the way in which that affected women

3471
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:28,800
in particular you know half african half

3472
01:50:27,039 --> 01:50:30,479
half of the society right

3473
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:32,079
then you think of this 20-year period of

3474
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:34,959
violence and

3475
01:50:32,079 --> 01:50:36,719
and you know missed exits right and

3476
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:38,480
repeat a tragedy

3477
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,079
but also it created a space i mean it

3478
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:41,359
created a space for a whole i'd say

3479
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:42,880
generationally it created a sense a

3480
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:44,399
space for

3481
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:46,239
people to realize something new and i

3482
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:48,638
think so we have to attend to the the

3483
01:50:46,238 --> 01:50:51,118
dynamism of the society right so

3484
01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:53,039
yeah this happened mostly in kabul other

3485
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:55,279
big cities mazar sharif herat and

3486
01:50:53,039 --> 01:50:56,479
kandahar

3487
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:59,039
but you can't limit your analysis to

3488
01:50:56,479 --> 01:51:00,399
that because things like radio

3489
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:02,479
television

3490
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:05,198
everyone got a tv channel there's a

3491
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:06,959
wonderful documentary called afghan star

3492
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:09,039
that i recommend to your listeners and

3493
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,480
viewers that it's about a singing show a

3494
01:51:09,039 --> 01:51:12,079
scene contest show

3495
01:51:10,479 --> 01:51:14,000
but you see just just personal things

3496
01:51:12,079 --> 01:51:16,559
about like connections i mean

3497
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,238
it's a it's a show by an independent

3498
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:21,039
you know television network that did

3499
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:22,559
drama it did it did kind of infomercials

3500
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:24,479
for the government and

3501
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,480
huge american investment in it so it

3502
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:27,598
wasn't politically neutral but it did

3503
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:29,678
talk shows did all this kind of stuff i

3504
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:31,840
did the singing show that became you

3505
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:33,279
know incredibly popular

3506
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,800
modeled upon the british american you

3507
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:36,880
know american idol kind of stuff you

3508
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,800
know and you could vote so had a kind of

3509
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,920
democratic practice element

3510
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,199
but it's fascinating to see that you

3511
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:43,039
know

3512
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:45,039
people hooked up generators to

3513
01:51:43,039 --> 01:51:46,158
televisions and watch this you know you

3514
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:47,439
think of like

3515
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:49,598
literacy rates literacy rates are

3516
01:51:47,439 --> 01:51:50,399
imperfect and you know people who study

3517
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:52,719
you know

3518
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:54,638
medieval modern europe talk about how

3519
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:56,319
yeah no one could read

3520
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:58,719
and there weren't many books but if

3521
01:51:56,319 --> 01:52:00,238
someone had a book it'd be read aloud to

3522
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:01,520
a whole village potentially or gathering

3523
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:02,799
so there wasn't much you know some of

3524
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:03,679
these metrics don't get what people

3525
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,119
actually

3526
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:06,319
perceive as information or exposure

3527
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:08,158
because

3528
01:52:06,319 --> 01:52:09,840
there's a magnifying power of

3529
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:11,598
open spaces and

3530
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:13,760
hearing radio in group settings seeing

3531
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:15,279
television group settings

3532
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:17,280
having telephone

3533
01:52:15,279 --> 01:52:19,439
you know cheap telephones which then

3534
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:21,198
become an access point to the world and

3535
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:22,559
social media right so

3536
01:52:21,198 --> 01:52:25,519
all the stuff swept across afghan

3537
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:28,159
society as it did elsewhere you know um

3538
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:30,320
in the last decade or more

3539
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:32,000
so african society became you know in

3540
01:52:30,319 --> 01:52:33,679
important ways really connected to

3541
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,800
everything going on and so you see that

3542
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:37,199
reflected politically and what people

3543
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:38,960
wanted so you had some people obviously

3544
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:41,039
back to return to the taliban

3545
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:42,239
some people wanted sasquatch

3546
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:43,359
but increasingly many more people wanted

3547
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:45,678
something else

3548
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:47,920
um and one of the great failures was to

3549
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:49,840
expose people to democracy

3550
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,760
but only give them the rigged version

3551
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:53,920
and so the us and state department in

3552
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:55,920
particular continue to double down on

3553
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:57,840
faked elections for the parliament and

3554
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,000
for the presidency in afghanistan what

3555
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:02,800
kind of elections faked

3556
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,319
fraudulent elections for parliament and

3557
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:05,279
and for

3558
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:06,799
president

3559
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:08,158
and afghanistan again and again from the

3560
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:10,560
very beginning

3561
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:12,719
and those these elections

3562
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:13,920
were partly theater for the us right for

3563
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:15,198
remaining on the road that you're

3564
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,399
describing right for not deviating for

3565
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:18,479
not exiting because we were building

3566
01:53:16,399 --> 01:53:19,920
democracy there

3567
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:22,000
in reality the us government knew it was

3568
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:23,920
never really building democracy there it

3569
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,840
was establishing control

3570
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:27,920
and elections were one means to gather

3571
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:30,319
control right but then you had on the

3572
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:32,000
ground especially when young people

3573
01:53:30,319 --> 01:53:34,479
going to university

3574
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,079
yeah having experiences that were denied

3575
01:53:34,479 --> 01:53:37,039
to them before

3576
01:53:36,079 --> 01:53:38,559
you know they took these promises

3577
01:53:37,039 --> 01:53:41,760
seriously so part of the disenlargement

3578
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:43,840
that we see today is that you know

3579
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:45,119
they believe what the us told them that

3580
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:46,639
they're constructing democracy and of

3581
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:48,399
course you know cynics like us maybe

3582
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,560
thinking well you know you're not really

3583
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:52,238
doing that you're backing fraud they

3584
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:54,239
believed it when they were younger and

3585
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:56,718
now they're actually smart enough to

3586
01:53:54,238 --> 01:53:59,198
understand that it's a farce yeah but

3587
01:53:56,719 --> 01:54:00,960
and so indirectly had the consequence of

3588
01:53:59,198 --> 01:54:03,598
actually working

3589
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:06,000
yeah and that it taught the young

3590
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:06,880
over a period of 20 years young folks to

3591
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,719
believe

3592
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:11,199
that democracy is possible and then to

3593
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:12,480
realize what democracy is not exactly

3594
01:54:11,198 --> 01:54:13,678
the currency that's due for beautifully

3595
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:15,118
said and so

3596
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:16,480
but now but i look at us now it's you

3597
01:54:15,118 --> 01:54:17,839
know it's

3598
01:54:16,479 --> 01:54:19,118
now november

3599
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,039
and so

3600
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:23,198
this whole

3601
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:25,519
period and i wouldn't say like you know

3602
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:26,719
i wouldn't cast the last 20 years if

3603
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:27,679
you're looking at all the achievements

3604
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:28,719
you know

3605
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:30,560
i wouldn't

3606
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:31,840
put them in an american tally sheet like

3607
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:33,520
oh this something we should pat

3608
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:35,039
ourselves on the back for i think that

3609
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:36,400
much just happened actually against what

3610
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:37,439
the americans wanted i mean that the

3611
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:39,198
kind of

3612
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:41,279
free thinking

3613
01:54:39,198 --> 01:54:42,719
democracy wanting

3614
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:44,800
i mean even like yeah we could point out

3615
01:54:42,719 --> 01:54:45,520
on the religious religious sphere i mean

3616
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,719
the

3617
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:48,840
the

3618
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:51,439
african religious landscape became very

3619
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:54,719
pluralistic lots of young people wanted

3620
01:54:51,439 --> 01:54:57,039
a different kind of secular politics

3621
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:59,039
but the old the old guard who wanted the

3622
01:54:57,039 --> 01:55:00,880
status quo and wanted something that

3623
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:03,279
they'd fought for in 1980s

3624
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:04,719
tended to still get american backing as

3625
01:55:03,279 --> 01:55:06,399
the political leads who still tend to

3626
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:08,079
monopolize political power

3627
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:09,279
um so all stuff was happening in

3628
01:55:08,079 --> 01:55:11,359
different ways

3629
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:12,800
i mean the americans established this

3630
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:13,839
american university of afghanistan which

3631
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,159
is i think one of the best things the

3632
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:18,639
u.s did there and i regret that the us

3633
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:20,158
didn't fund 20 more you know sprinkling

3634
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:22,239
them across the country making them

3635
01:55:20,158 --> 01:55:23,679
accessible people because it was

3636
01:55:22,238 --> 01:55:26,238
it was you know again it wasn't an

3637
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:27,760
engine of americanization

3638
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:29,118
it was just opportunity and so that the

3639
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:30,480
thirst for higher education was really

3640
01:55:29,118 --> 01:55:32,399
extraordinary there was never never

3641
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:33,198
really met the u.s tended to put money

3642
01:55:32,399 --> 01:55:35,439
in

3643
01:55:33,198 --> 01:55:36,879
primary education which much of that too

3644
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:37,919
was was fraudulent

3645
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:39,599
but so you have all this interesting

3646
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:40,800
dynamism you have you know the arts you

3647
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,039
have

3648
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,719
a critical space i mean i call it a

3649
01:55:43,039 --> 01:55:46,238
public sphere in the classic

3650
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:47,599
european sense you know the afghans made

3651
01:55:46,238 --> 01:55:49,279
of their own and

3652
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:50,159
again it wasn't americanization it

3653
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:51,359
wasn't

3654
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:53,118
imposed

3655
01:55:51,359 --> 01:55:56,000
it was something that afghans built

3656
01:55:53,118 --> 01:55:58,158
across generations but really with a

3657
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,560
firm foundation among youth

3658
01:55:58,158 --> 01:56:02,879
who wanted importantly a multi-ethnic

3659
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:05,360
afghan society you asked about pashtuns

3660
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:07,520
and that kind of stuff and a lot of that

3661
01:56:05,359 --> 01:56:09,359
language in recent years was um

3662
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:11,679
they were aware that the us-backed

3663
01:56:09,359 --> 01:56:13,519
government was playing ethnic politics

3664
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:15,679
and trying to kind of put people in the

3665
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:17,679
blocks and mobilize people based on

3666
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:18,800
their ethnic identity

3667
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:21,359
and there was a younger cohort of people

3668
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,960
who said you know we are afghan

3669
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:23,920
and there's interesting social media

3670
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:25,679
stuff where

3671
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:29,520
people would say i am hazara but i'm

3672
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:31,520
also tajik i'm also uzbek i mean

3673
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:33,440
it was a way of creating a multi-ethnic

3674
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,199
afghan national identity

3675
01:56:33,439 --> 01:56:37,678
that embraced everything i mean very

3676
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:39,118
utopian you know super utopian right

3677
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:40,560
but symbolically it's very important

3678
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:42,799
that they rejected

3679
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:44,719
being mobilized politically

3680
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:45,920
you know voting as a hazara or voting is

3681
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:48,319
whatever and of course there were there

3682
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:50,639
were communities who wanted to you know

3683
01:56:48,319 --> 01:56:52,319
vote as that ethnic community but there

3684
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:54,960
are also people who said you know let's

3685
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:57,599
put a kind of civic nationalism first

3686
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:59,039
one that accommodates i think pluralism

3687
01:56:57,599 --> 01:57:00,880
in a way that rejected a kind of

3688
01:56:59,039 --> 01:57:03,118
majoritarian politics of

3689
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,480
one ethnic group dominating the thing

3690
01:57:03,118 --> 01:57:06,960
so all this stuff was quite interesting

3691
01:57:04,479 --> 01:57:09,439
i mean women were sorting themselves

3692
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:10,639
in across you know multiple spheres

3693
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:11,598
of course it remained patriarchal of

3694
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:12,480
course there's struggles of course

3695
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:14,400
there's violence of course you know

3696
01:57:12,479 --> 01:57:16,959
there's no utopia

3697
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:18,799
um but the door and all that shut

3698
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:20,639
in on august 15.

3699
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:21,599
so to go back to the quote that i wanted

3700
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:22,880
to

3701
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:25,440
offer from

3702
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:27,599
the student now professor

3703
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:28,319
was it you know trying to make sense of

3704
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:30,000
this

3705
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:31,519
and you mentioned the tragic

3706
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,760
arc here um

3707
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:36,320
you take the 20 years like

3708
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:38,079
she asked you why did you go to war in

3709
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:40,000
our country basically why did you do

3710
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:41,920
this to us for 20 years when

3711
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,679
this was never about us you never asked

3712
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:44,800
us if you wanted to come

3713
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:46,239
you never asked us what you wanted to

3714
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,360
build here

3715
01:57:46,238 --> 01:57:48,638
you asked us when you were coming and

3716
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:50,238
you didn't ask us when when you're

3717
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:51,359
leaving you just did this all on your

3718
01:57:50,238 --> 01:57:53,678
own

3719
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:55,118
and we tried to make the most of it

3720
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:57,920
and then you pulled the rug out from

3721
01:57:55,118 --> 01:58:00,319
under us you know at the 11th hour

3722
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:01,920
in return returned to power

3723
01:58:00,319 --> 01:58:03,920
partly by diplomacy

3724
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:05,679
it wasn't at the end just a military

3725
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:07,039
loss i mean it was a

3726
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:08,480
series of diplomatic decisions i mean

3727
01:58:07,039 --> 01:58:09,840
the idea you asked about alternatives i

3728
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:11,439
mean

3729
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,560
giving up bagram i mean holding the

3730
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:13,839
timeline

3731
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:15,039
i mean the biden people did not need to

3732
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:17,440
hold to

3733
01:58:15,039 --> 01:58:19,920
the doha agreement that trump had signed

3734
01:58:17,439 --> 01:58:22,960
i mean every american president writes

3735
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:24,560
his or her own foreign policy right so

3736
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,399
the body administration acted as if they

3737
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:27,840
tried to convince us that their hands

3738
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:30,638
were tied

3739
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:32,400
um and that it was either this or 21

3740
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:33,279
years of war or some absurd kind of you

3741
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:34,479
know

3742
01:58:33,279 --> 01:58:35,759
false

3743
01:58:34,479 --> 01:58:38,000
alternative

3744
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:39,920
and so but i think that's important for

3745
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,039
american audiences to hear that you know

3746
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:42,000
they're like you came to here to

3747
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:43,519
experiment

3748
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:46,960
you came here to

3749
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:46,960
punish you came here to kind of

3750
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:49,678
you reassert

3751
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:52,239
your dominance the world stage

3752
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:53,920
you know to work out the the fear and

3753
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:56,238
and hurt of 911 that we talked about

3754
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:57,840
which was so real you know and palpable

3755
01:58:56,238 --> 01:58:59,519
um and it's important for american

3756
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:01,760
politics since then like you did you

3757
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:03,920
worked out your problems you know on us

3758
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,639
on our territory

3759
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,399
and

3760
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:08,000
now what do we have for it you know and

3761
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:10,158
then the people who

3762
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,000
who had a stake in in that system

3763
01:59:10,158 --> 01:59:13,598
imperfect as it was

3764
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,198
have been desperate to leave

3765
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:16,639
and so this i don't know how much people

3766
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:18,158
wear this but

3767
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:20,159
you know i'm a scholar i work in

3768
01:59:18,158 --> 01:59:21,679
california you know

3769
01:59:20,158 --> 01:59:24,238
i have friends i

3770
01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:25,520
edit a journal on afghanistan and

3771
01:59:24,238 --> 01:59:26,638
you know but i'm not a politician i'm

3772
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:28,400
not a soldier

3773
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:30,000
but people assume that

3774
01:59:28,399 --> 01:59:32,079
you know afghans have been desperately

3775
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,560
trying to reach me and anyone who is

3776
01:59:32,079 --> 01:59:36,800
kind of on the radar as an american

3777
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:38,800
to help get them out you know that's the

3778
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:41,199
kind of like

3779
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:43,199
you know the symbol of voting with your

3780
01:59:41,198 --> 01:59:44,638
feet you know is quite powerful i mean

3781
01:59:43,198 --> 01:59:46,000
they

3782
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:48,560
there's a huge swath of society that

3783
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,479
doesn't want the system and is

3784
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:51,679
literally living in terror about it

3785
01:59:50,479 --> 01:59:53,678
naturally women you know i mean

3786
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:54,800
especially women of certain age i mean

3787
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:57,359
they feel like their lives are over i

3788
01:59:54,800 --> 02:00:01,520
mean there is an epidemic of suicide

3789
01:59:57,359 --> 02:00:02,479
um they feel betrayed and

3790
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,679
and some people have done some good

3791
02:00:02,479 --> 02:00:05,359
things and getting people out you know i

3792
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:07,679
mean some

3793
02:00:05,359 --> 02:00:09,839
you know the u.s military vets have been

3794
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:11,520
you know at the forefront of

3795
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:12,639
working to get out people you know that

3796
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,480
that they

3797
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:16,639
they know they owe

3798
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:18,718
but um the us government doesn't want

3799
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:21,440
these people i mean they have created

3800
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:23,520
all these obstacles to

3801
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:24,879
to allowing a safety valve for people to

3802
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:27,119
leave

3803
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:29,760
looking forward from a perspective of

3804
02:00:27,118 --> 02:00:31,039
leadership how do we avoid these kinds

3805
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:31,840
of mistakes

3806
02:00:31,039 --> 02:00:34,479
so

3807
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:37,279
obviously some interests some aspects of

3808
02:00:34,479 --> 02:00:40,799
human nature led to this war yeah how do

3809
02:00:37,279 --> 02:00:42,800
we resist that in the future

3810
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:44,719
i think that's beyond my

3811
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:46,000
moral and intellectual capacity i'll say

3812
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:47,439
this i mean looking at again looking at

3813
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,880
it from you know my home ground is the

3814
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:50,559
university and

3815
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,880
i think of the

3816
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:54,320
the intellectual um

3817
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:55,760
you yeah ways of ways of thinking that

3818
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:58,000
that i think students

3819
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:59,520
should develop themselves

3820
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,760
as citizens right maybe that's where to

3821
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:03,280
start is like historical thinking

3822
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,960
i mean these are all

3823
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:06,559
and i try to tell people you know

3824
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,719
if you want to do robotics computer

3825
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:10,639
science you'd be a doctor whatever you

3826
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:11,920
should study history yeah i mean you

3827
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:13,359
don't being destroying like me and it's

3828
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,920
you know my job isn't perfect my

3829
02:01:13,359 --> 02:01:17,439
profession is deeply flawed right but

3830
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:19,199
as i get older i'm like

3831
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:20,399
there are fewer historians actually like

3832
02:01:19,198 --> 02:01:22,158
yeah i want to hang out with and stuff

3833
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:23,839
so it's like i'm not offering my myself

3834
02:01:22,158 --> 02:01:25,359
as like a model for anything but

3835
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:26,800
you know whether you're a

3836
02:01:25,359 --> 02:01:28,799
you know you carry the male or you're a

3837
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:30,400
brain surgeon whatever i mean i think

3838
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,599
it's not it's a way of civic engagement

3839
02:01:30,399 --> 02:01:32,719
in the way of like

3840
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:35,199
you know ethical being in the world that

3841
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:36,319
we need to familiarize also because

3842
02:01:35,198 --> 02:01:37,839
if you're an american or if you're from

3843
02:01:36,319 --> 02:01:38,960
a rich country

3844
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:41,920
you know you need to be aware of your

3845
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:43,198
effect um on a on an energy effect world

3846
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:44,480
um you can't

3847
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:46,000
you can't say anymore that you don't

3848
02:01:44,479 --> 02:01:48,638
know or care what's happening in

3849
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,560
afghanistan or really circle the globe

3850
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:52,000
and point of place i mean

3851
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:54,159
we're all connected and we're all we

3852
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,118
have ethical obligations um

3853
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:56,879
that's one place to start i would just

3854
02:01:55,118 --> 02:02:00,000
say this and this is a i'll offer a

3855
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:01,599
self-critique and that is um

3856
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,960
so much my teaching and like the themes

3857
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:05,360
my research have been about empire you

3858
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:06,880
know how big states work

3859
02:02:05,359 --> 02:02:08,079
not only on big territories like the

3860
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:11,199
russian empire and soviet union stuff

3861
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:12,880
but the way in which power often

3862
02:02:11,198 --> 02:02:15,439
is projected beyond those boundaries in

3863
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:17,199
ways that we don't see so this is where

3864
02:02:15,439 --> 02:02:18,719
things like neoliberalism or just you

3865
02:02:17,198 --> 02:02:20,158
know if you want to take capitalism or

3866
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:22,239
just things that

3867
02:02:20,158 --> 02:02:25,039
you know the idea of humanity or

3868
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:26,879
liberalism or of humanitarianism ideas

3869
02:02:25,039 --> 02:02:29,198
that move beyond state boundaries are

3870
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:31,599
all things that we think about

3871
02:02:29,198 --> 02:02:33,839
as affecting power in some ways that

3872
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:36,159
that often harm people right so i think

3873
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:37,199
part of as i've seen my job so far is i

3874
02:02:36,158 --> 02:02:38,879
think about

3875
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:40,879
you know building upon the work of my

3876
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:42,960
people in grad school and you know

3877
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:44,000
scholars have affected me i mean

3878
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:45,760
you know we're all concerned with how

3879
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,079
power works and its effects and trying

3880
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:48,650
to be attuned to

3881
02:02:48,079 --> 02:02:49,840
understanding

3882
02:02:48,649 --> 02:02:51,039
[Music]

3883
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:52,319
things that aren't visible right that we

3884
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:54,079
should be thinking about that should be

3885
02:02:52,319 --> 02:02:55,279
known to us and as scholars we can

3886
02:02:54,079 --> 02:02:56,158
hopefully play some useful role in

3887
02:02:55,279 --> 02:02:57,359
showing

3888
02:02:56,158 --> 02:02:58,960
effects that

3889
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:00,799
aren't you know

3890
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:02,719
obvious initially

3891
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:04,320
um so empire is a framework to think

3892
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:06,158
about this and so you think about

3893
02:03:04,319 --> 02:03:07,840
invading foreign countries obviously if

3894
02:03:06,158 --> 02:03:09,439
you're a scholar of empire

3895
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,560
you've seen what what that looks like

3896
02:03:09,439 --> 02:03:12,158
and

3897
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:14,960
that's horrific right you look at things

3898
02:03:12,158 --> 02:03:16,960
like racism as one of the ideological

3899
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:19,198
pillars of empire you know that's

3900
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:21,920
horrific it must be critiqued it must be

3901
02:03:19,198 --> 02:03:23,439
you know we must be educated against um

3902
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:24,960
some of the you know gender exploitation

3903
02:03:23,439 --> 02:03:27,118
of empire is also something to highlight

3904
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:28,719
you know to rectify and so on

3905
02:03:27,118 --> 02:03:30,238
um you have to be moral beings when you

3906
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:32,880
think about

3907
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:34,319
past inequality and in the legacies of

3908
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:35,760
legacies of violence and destruction

3909
02:03:34,319 --> 02:03:37,439
that live on i mean living in the

3910
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:38,560
americas i mean look at you know we're

3911
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:41,359
all on

3912
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:43,119
stone land we're all in the sense

3913
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:44,479
living with the fruits of genocide and

3914
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:46,880
slavery and all those things that are

3915
02:03:44,479 --> 02:03:49,519
hard to come to terms with right

3916
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:51,760
but the last few months in afghanistan

3917
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:53,199
and thinking about empire i think

3918
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:54,560
made me more humble

3919
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:56,879
when i read

3920
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:59,039
people who say

3921
02:03:56,880 --> 02:04:01,359
to put it simply have taken some joy in

3922
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:02,319
this moment saying like well

3923
02:04:01,359 --> 02:04:03,759
the americans got kicked out of

3924
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:05,599
afghanistan

3925
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:07,440
you know if you're against empire

3926
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:10,639
this is a good thing this is the kind of

3927
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:12,319
victory of of anti-colonial

3928
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:13,920
you could see from the perspective of

3929
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:16,719
afghanistan

3930
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:19,118
that america is not some kind of place

3931
02:04:16,719 --> 02:04:20,800
that has an ideal of freedom and all the

3932
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:23,279
kind of things that we american tell

3933
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:25,840
ourselves yeah but it's more

3934
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:28,399
america has the idea of empire that

3935
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:31,599
there's one place that has the truth and

3936
02:04:28,399 --> 02:04:34,238
everybody else must follow this truth

3937
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:36,400
and so from a perspective afghanistan it

3938
02:04:34,238 --> 02:04:39,519
could be a victory against this idea of

3939
02:04:36,399 --> 02:04:41,519
centralized truth of empire

3940
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:43,360
that's another way to tell this story

3941
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:46,480
and then in that sense it's a victory

3942
02:04:43,359 --> 02:04:50,319
and yeah in in that sense also i mean

3943
02:04:46,479 --> 02:04:51,279
you push back against this somewhat

3944
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:54,000
this

3945
02:04:51,279 --> 02:04:55,920
idea of afghanistan as the graveyard of

3946
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,960
empires right right

3947
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:58,319
and i'll say this i'd say you know i

3948
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:01,439
mean it's i mean

3949
02:04:58,319 --> 02:05:02,960
i'm a critic of empire i mean you know

3950
02:05:01,439 --> 02:05:04,719
colonialism is a

3951
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:06,800
a political phenomenon that stays with

3952
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:08,319
us and i think you know we need scholars

3953
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:10,560
to point to the way in which it still

3954
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:11,599
works and still does harm

3955
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,880
um

3956
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:15,199
but it's part of being an empire that

3957
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:16,880
you can just get up and leave a place

3958
02:05:15,198 --> 02:05:19,678
right that you can

3959
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:20,960
remake its politics on one day

3960
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:22,719
and then because it

3961
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:23,599
fails to advance your agenda at one

3962
02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:25,039
moment

3963
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:27,199
you simply

3964
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:29,039
walk away i mean you know we can point

3965
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:30,238
to other moments i mean 1947 on the

3966
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:32,000
subcontinent

3967
02:05:30,238 --> 02:05:33,359
you know the way that the british

3968
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,399
withdrew

3969
02:05:33,359 --> 02:05:36,880
um

3970
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:38,799
played a significant role in

3971
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,000
mass violence you know that the company

3972
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:41,520
partition

3973
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,039
it wasn't all the actions of the british

3974
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,800
that you know

3975
02:05:43,039 --> 02:05:45,920
dictated that right there were lots of

3976
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:48,719
actors who

3977
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:49,840
chose to pick up you know the knife to

3978
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:52,000
kill their neighbor and so on i mean

3979
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:53,279
there's lots of agency in that moment as

3980
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,479
there's now in what's happening in

3981
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:55,920
afghanistan

3982
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:57,678
but i think the

3983
02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:00,800
the capriciousness i mean the the

3984
02:05:57,679 --> 02:06:02,800
ability to act as if your

3985
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:05,840
your political decisions

3986
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:07,840
about people's lives

3987
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:09,119
you know are something that can be made

3988
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:11,679
you know in secret

3989
02:06:09,118 --> 02:06:13,279
um that can be made willingly

3990
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:15,279
they really are beyond the

3991
02:06:13,279 --> 02:06:16,880
accountability you know of

3992
02:06:15,279 --> 02:06:19,118
of those who are actually going to live

3993
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:20,800
with the consequences of

3994
02:06:19,118 --> 02:06:23,359
shifting the cards on a deck in a way

3995
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:25,279
that decides who rules and who doesn't i

3996
02:06:23,359 --> 02:06:26,960
would love to hear your conversation

3997
02:06:25,279 --> 02:06:29,920
with somebody i just talked to which is

3998
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:32,639
neil ferguson who argues on the topic of

3999
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:34,560
empire yeah that you can also

4000
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:37,039
zoom out even farther

4001
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:38,159
and say weigh the good and the bad of

4002
02:06:37,039 --> 02:06:40,479
empire

4003
02:06:38,158 --> 02:06:42,799
and he argues i think he gets a lot of

4004
02:06:40,479 --> 02:06:45,759
flack for this from other historians

4005
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:48,320
that like the british empire

4006
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:51,039
did more good than bad

4007
02:06:48,319 --> 02:06:52,719
in uh certain moments of history and

4008
02:06:51,039 --> 02:06:55,519
that's an uncomfortable truth yeah

4009
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:58,239
there's like levels it's a cake with

4010
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:59,840
layers of uncomfortable truths and it's

4011
02:06:58,238 --> 02:07:01,919
not a cake at all because none of it

4012
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,679
tastes good right i mean i would

4013
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:05,440
continue to disagree with without

4014
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:07,520
persons i'm still i'm still working out

4015
02:07:05,439 --> 02:07:10,158
you know where i am and and what this

4016
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:11,920
moment does to kind of i think qualify

4017
02:07:10,158 --> 02:07:13,920
qualify my understanding of the past and

4018
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:15,199
to i think in a moment of humility

4019
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:16,480
you know i i do

4020
02:07:15,198 --> 02:07:17,598
and i'm probably i'm probably reacting

4021
02:07:16,479 --> 02:07:19,759
to the kind of

4022
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:21,039
you know as you put it i mean

4023
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:23,119
the idea this is like a good thing that

4024
02:07:21,039 --> 02:07:24,800
american power has been defeated here i

4025
02:07:23,118 --> 02:07:27,839
mean i do think american power should

4026
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:29,440
contract and i i don't think

4027
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:31,440
and again if i if i had to create a

4028
02:07:29,439 --> 02:07:33,118
tally sheet of what the americans did in

4029
02:07:31,439 --> 02:07:35,359
the us i mean i mentioned the

4030
02:07:33,118 --> 02:07:37,118
american university afghanistan right it

4031
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:38,238
could have done that without invading

4032
02:07:37,118 --> 02:07:40,158
the country and killing people could

4033
02:07:38,238 --> 02:07:41,839
have you know i'm not i've not now

4034
02:07:40,158 --> 02:07:43,039
become an apologist for empire i'm not

4035
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:45,599
i'm not now

4036
02:07:43,039 --> 02:07:48,319
a mini now person but

4037
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:49,440
you know ending empire is

4038
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:51,359
i mean that's

4039
02:07:49,439 --> 02:07:53,439
how you

4040
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:55,198
those decisions you make are

4041
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:57,118
in some ways a continuation of imperial

4042
02:07:55,198 --> 02:07:58,960
hubris right

4043
02:07:57,118 --> 02:08:00,799
um so you're not really out of empire

4044
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:02,880
yet you're not really contracting empire

4045
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:05,039
for those who are living it you know

4046
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:06,639
um but i think it's also i mean maybe

4047
02:08:05,039 --> 02:08:08,158
put this way it's

4048
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:10,159
be careful what you asked for you know i

4049
02:08:08,158 --> 02:08:11,279
mean i i wanted i wanted the us out of

4050
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:12,238
afghanistan

4051
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:13,920
um

4052
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:14,879
but i wanted there to be a political

4053
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:16,000
settlement

4054
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:17,199
i wanted

4055
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,960
you know i wanted my cake and i wanted

4056
02:08:17,198 --> 02:08:20,799
to eat it too right i wanted all kinds

4057
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:22,399
of things to be different right but why

4058
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:24,960
is going afghanistan even needed for

4059
02:08:22,399 --> 02:08:27,759
that you can play all those games

4060
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:30,000
of geopolitics without ever invading and

4061
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:32,400
taking ownership of the place

4062
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,560
it feels like the war yeah

4063
02:08:32,399 --> 02:08:35,519
if it feels like i mean i'm not exactly

4064
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:38,320
sure

4065
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:41,760
what military force is necessary for

4066
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:43,519
except for targeted intense attacks it

4067
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:46,400
feels like to me

4068
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:47,920
the right thing to do after 9 11

4069
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:50,238
was to show

4070
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:52,239
what was a display of force unlike

4071
02:08:50,238 --> 02:08:54,078
anything the world has ever seen for a

4072
02:08:52,238 --> 02:08:57,759
very short amount of time

4073
02:08:54,078 --> 02:09:00,719
targeted at sure a terrorist at certain

4074
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:04,079
strongholds and so on and then in and

4075
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:06,800
out and then focused on education on uh

4076
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:08,799
empowering women to uh

4077
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:10,400
into the education system

4078
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:12,880
all those kinds of things that have to

4079
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:15,359
do with supporting the culture the

4080
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:18,880
education the flourishing

4081
02:09:15,359 --> 02:09:20,158
of the place that's nothing to do with

4082
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:22,078
military

4083
02:09:20,158 --> 02:09:24,638
policing essentially right now i think

4084
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:26,880
yeah if you look at it through that

4085
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:29,118
lens i mean if any afghanistan and then

4086
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:30,400
invading iraq didn't end

4087
02:09:29,118 --> 02:09:34,880
al-qaeda

4088
02:09:30,399 --> 02:09:35,679
it didn't end terrorism right it didn't

4089
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:38,159
really

4090
02:09:35,679 --> 02:09:40,000
deflate these ideologies entirely um

4091
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:41,519
there were if you like you could say

4092
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:44,000
there were

4093
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:44,000
you know some

4094
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:48,000
limited discrediting of certain kinds of

4095
02:09:46,078 --> 02:09:50,319
ideas um but in fact i mean look at the

4096
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,639
phenomena of suicide bonding bombing um

4097
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:54,479
i mean it spread i mean it was never an

4098
02:09:52,639 --> 02:09:55,760
islamic thing it was never you know a

4099
02:09:54,479 --> 02:09:57,359
muslim thing

4100
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:59,280
um some muslims adopted it in some

4101
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:00,319
places but

4102
02:09:59,279 --> 02:10:01,359
you know the circus of knowledge about

4103
02:10:00,319 --> 02:10:03,840
how to do these kind of things only

4104
02:10:01,359 --> 02:10:05,679
expanded um with the insurgencies that

4105
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:07,440
emerged in afghanistan and iraq and then

4106
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:08,399
they kind of became connected and then

4107
02:10:07,439 --> 02:10:10,000
they came to the president i mean

4108
02:10:08,399 --> 02:10:10,960
islamic state is

4109
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,078
it's the best thing that happened to the

4110
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:13,760
taliban

4111
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:15,439
ever because

4112
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:17,760
it's on the basis of its

4113
02:10:15,439 --> 02:10:19,919
supposed

4114
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:21,679
new stance as a counterterrorism outfit

4115
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:23,118
that it will get recognition from all

4116
02:10:21,679 --> 02:10:24,239
its neighbors it will get recognition

4117
02:10:23,118 --> 02:10:26,158
russia

4118
02:10:24,238 --> 02:10:27,359
i mean already with the evacuation

4119
02:10:26,158 --> 02:10:29,198
airport the united states was

4120
02:10:27,359 --> 02:10:32,639
collaborating with taliban

4121
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:34,319
against against islamic state and openly

4122
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:35,679
talking about the taliban as if they

4123
02:10:34,319 --> 02:10:36,880
were partners in the security operation

4124
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:38,560
so

4125
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:39,920
and then al qaeda remains present in

4126
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:43,840
afghanistan so

4127
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:46,158
trillions of dollars spent yeah

4128
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:47,840
the drones up above

4129
02:10:46,158 --> 02:10:50,158
bombing

4130
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:52,078
places that result in civilian death the

4131
02:10:50,158 --> 02:10:54,879
death of children the death of fathers

4132
02:10:52,078 --> 02:10:57,439
and mothers and those stories even at

4133
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:59,920
the individual level propagate virally

4134
02:10:57,439 --> 02:11:01,598
across the land creating potentially

4135
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:02,639
more terrorists

4136
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:04,319
and

4137
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:05,960
a cynical view of the trillions of

4138
02:11:04,319 --> 02:11:08,319
dollars is the

4139
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:10,639
military-industrial complex

4140
02:11:08,319 --> 02:11:13,279
where there's just a momentum

4141
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:16,239
where after 9 11

4142
02:11:13,279 --> 02:11:19,679
the feeling like we should do something

4143
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:21,439
led to us doing something and then a lot

4144
02:11:19,679 --> 02:11:23,599
of people realizing they can make money

4145
02:11:21,439 --> 02:11:26,078
from doing more of that something and

4146
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:27,760
then it's just the momentum where no one

4147
02:11:26,078 --> 02:11:30,000
person is

4148
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,800
sitting there petting a cat in an evil

4149
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,800
way

4150
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:34,639
saying we're going to spend all of this

4151
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:36,320
money and create more suffering and

4152
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:38,000
create more terrorism right but it's

4153
02:11:36,319 --> 02:11:40,960
just something about the momentum that

4154
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:43,118
leads to that and it to me honestly i

4155
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:45,279
just i'm still a sucker i believe in

4156
02:11:43,118 --> 02:11:47,359
leadership i i believe in

4157
02:11:45,279 --> 02:11:50,000
great charismatic leaders

4158
02:11:47,359 --> 02:11:54,238
and the power of that one to do evil and

4159
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:54,238
to do good yeah and it felt like

4160
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:58,639
i honestly put the blame on

4161
02:11:57,279 --> 02:12:02,078
george bush

4162
02:11:58,639 --> 02:12:04,880
obama trump and biden sure for the lack

4163
02:12:02,078 --> 02:12:06,479
of leadership yeah definitely definitely

4164
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:08,000
i agree and yeah there is the

4165
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:09,118
multi-industrial complex component which

4166
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,560
is huge

4167
02:12:09,118 --> 02:12:12,639
and there's also i mean speaking of

4168
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:14,400
government leadership it's also

4169
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:15,920
i'd say the imbalance of power within

4170
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:17,598
washington i mean

4171
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:19,520
the pentagon

4172
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:22,560
used this moment

4173
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:24,480
um well beginning in 2001 i think to

4174
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:26,400
assert this authority

4175
02:12:24,479 --> 02:12:28,559
at the expense of other institutions of

4176
02:12:26,399 --> 02:12:30,879
national government yeah i mean the

4177
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:31,760
state department diplomacy

4178
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:34,000
you know

4179
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:35,679
has become a shadow of what it was once

4180
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,198
capable of doing

4181
02:12:35,679 --> 02:12:38,480
and of course i mean other historians us

4182
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:40,319
historians you know which i'm not

4183
02:12:38,479 --> 02:12:41,439
foreign in the united states but

4184
02:12:40,319 --> 02:12:44,000
you know we can go back to talk about

4185
02:12:41,439 --> 02:12:47,198
vietnam we talk about lots of um cold

4186
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:48,960
war and post-cold war engagements um

4187
02:12:47,198 --> 02:12:50,719
and i think you know we need a reckoning

4188
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:52,078
about how the united states uses

4189
02:12:50,719 --> 02:12:54,158
military power

4190
02:12:52,078 --> 02:12:56,000
you know why we devote so much to our

4191
02:12:54,158 --> 02:12:58,238
military budget and what could be

4192
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:00,560
available to us if we

4193
02:12:58,238 --> 02:13:02,879
had a more sensible view of the value of

4194
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:04,800
military power of its effectiveness

4195
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:06,239
and i think we're willing to hammer home

4196
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:07,360
that this is a defeat i mean i think

4197
02:13:06,238 --> 02:13:09,598
there should be accountability and if

4198
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:11,118
you and this could be a kind of opening

4199
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:12,560
for a kind of bipartisan conversation

4200
02:13:11,118 --> 02:13:14,880
because if you are

4201
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:17,039
a kind of um

4202
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:19,440
american militarist i mean you have to

4203
02:13:17,039 --> 02:13:21,760
look at the leadership that got you to a

4204
02:13:19,439 --> 02:13:23,919
place where you're defeated by

4205
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:26,480
men wearing sandals

4206
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:29,359
firing ak-47s right yeah there should be

4207
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:31,279
a humility with that yeah

4208
02:13:29,359 --> 02:13:33,439
i mean yeah we should actually say that

4209
02:13:31,279 --> 02:13:36,158
we like literally

4210
02:13:33,439 --> 02:13:37,598
the oh we lost you lost it wasn't just

4211
02:13:36,158 --> 02:13:40,078
you know um

4212
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:43,199
the american military

4213
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:45,198
lost yeah and i i feel i have very mixed

4214
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:46,638
feelings and you know it's

4215
02:13:45,198 --> 02:13:48,000
i don't know a ton of veterans but you

4216
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:50,319
know i've mentioned i've taught my share

4217
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,599
and um have a student now and

4218
02:13:50,319 --> 02:13:52,880
you know they are

4219
02:13:51,599 --> 02:13:54,560
they're suffering because they look at

4220
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:56,078
the sacrifices that they made that i

4221
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:57,760
didn't make i mean american society

4222
02:13:56,078 --> 02:13:59,920
didn't make the sacrifices i mean

4223
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:02,159
men and women lost limbs they lost eyes

4224
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:04,239
they lost lives you know

4225
02:14:02,158 --> 02:14:06,078
uh there's been this of course quiet

4226
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:07,039
epidemic of suicide

4227
02:14:06,078 --> 02:14:08,719
among

4228
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:10,158
among veterans and i

4229
02:14:08,719 --> 02:14:11,760
i've heard

4230
02:14:10,158 --> 02:14:14,158
some stories affected the state

4231
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:15,679
department is seeing a similar surge of

4232
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:17,118
suicides because

4233
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:19,118
they see their

4234
02:14:17,118 --> 02:14:20,078
adult life's work

4235
02:14:19,118 --> 02:14:21,598
collapse they've seen their

4236
02:14:20,078 --> 02:14:22,639
relationships i mean they've seen

4237
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:24,639
they've received phone calls in the

4238
02:14:22,639 --> 02:14:27,440
middle of night from people who they

4239
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:28,560
entrusted with their lives who they know

4240
02:14:27,439 --> 02:14:30,638
are going to be targeted i mean some

4241
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:32,800
have already been killed um

4242
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:34,078
they've seen the i mean i think just i'd

4243
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:35,440
imagine just ideologically and

4244
02:14:34,078 --> 02:14:37,759
professionally

4245
02:14:35,439 --> 02:14:40,319
what they believed in and what they

4246
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:41,599
what they sacrificed for you know has

4247
02:14:40,319 --> 02:14:43,920
vanished

4248
02:14:41,599 --> 02:14:45,520
and i think that's a that's

4249
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:46,719
that's bad i mean historically thinking

4250
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:49,040
of some of the presence you were

4251
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:50,480
thinking of i mean if you think of

4252
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:52,078
you know first of all you know at a

4253
02:14:50,479 --> 02:14:53,759
human level i feel horrible for those

4254
02:14:52,078 --> 02:14:54,559
people who you know may not have agreed

4255
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,159
with

4256
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:58,719
everything they'd done and their choices

4257
02:14:56,158 --> 02:15:01,118
in life but i respect the fact that many

4258
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:02,800
good people went out of

4259
02:15:01,118 --> 02:15:04,158
you know the best intentions as young

4260
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,520
people to

4261
02:15:04,158 --> 02:15:07,039
to do the right thing and make things

4262
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:09,360
right and i respect that

4263
02:15:07,039 --> 02:15:10,719
and i've met enough to know that

4264
02:15:09,359 --> 02:15:12,319
there were people who

4265
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:13,198
saw the gray and complexity and that

4266
02:15:12,319 --> 02:15:16,238
that's

4267
02:15:13,198 --> 02:15:17,839
you know all you can hope for um

4268
02:15:16,238 --> 02:15:20,319
but we don't want a generation of

4269
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:22,400
disillusioned veterans um

4270
02:15:20,319 --> 02:15:23,759
you know if we look at the other

4271
02:15:22,399 --> 02:15:25,598
post-war moments and this is kind of a

4272
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:26,880
possible moment where

4273
02:15:25,599 --> 02:15:28,560
you know i think we need a conversation

4274
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:30,560
with american veterans about about what

4275
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:32,000
they've gone through and what they're

4276
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:33,520
feeling and they have they solve skin in

4277
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,639
the game you know because their personal

4278
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:35,920
connections and their in the end of

4279
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:38,000
their histories and they're also going

4280
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:40,639
to be future leaders i mean

4281
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:43,840
uh yeah veterans already yeah people who

4282
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:47,279
are served are often great men and women

4283
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:47,279
that's that's true and

4284
02:15:48,399 --> 02:15:53,198
you know throughout history whether you

4285
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:54,400
sacrifice you served in fighting world

4286
02:15:53,198 --> 02:15:56,960
war ii

4287
02:15:54,399 --> 02:15:58,638
in fighting vietnam that's going to mold

4288
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:01,039
you in different ways

4289
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:03,039
that's going to mold

4290
02:16:01,039 --> 02:16:05,679
how you are as the leader that leads

4291
02:16:03,039 --> 02:16:08,880
this country forward and uh so you have

4292
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:10,960
to have an honest conversation about um

4293
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:12,480
what was um

4294
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,078
the role of

4295
02:16:12,479 --> 02:16:16,718
the war in afghanistan the war in the

4296
02:16:14,078 --> 02:16:18,319
middle east the war on terror

4297
02:16:16,719 --> 02:16:20,639
in the history of america if we just

4298
02:16:18,319 --> 02:16:23,039
look at the full context at the end of

4299
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:24,319
this 21st century how we're going to

4300
02:16:23,039 --> 02:16:26,238
remember this

4301
02:16:24,319 --> 02:16:29,279
and how that's going to result

4302
02:16:26,238 --> 02:16:31,598
in our future interactions with small

4303
02:16:29,279 --> 02:16:34,079
and large countries with china or some

4304
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:35,840
proxy war with china with russia or some

4305
02:16:34,079 --> 02:16:37,439
proxy war with uh

4306
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:39,280
russia what's the role of oil and

4307
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:41,840
natural resources and opium and all

4308
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:44,399
those kinds of things what's the role of

4309
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:47,120
military power

4310
02:16:44,398 --> 02:16:50,079
in the world and now with kovid

4311
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:51,599
you know it it's like um

4312
02:16:50,079 --> 02:16:54,000
it's almost like

4313
02:16:51,599 --> 02:16:57,359
the because of the

4314
02:16:54,000 --> 02:17:00,398
many failures of the us government

4315
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:03,840
and many leaders

4316
02:17:00,398 --> 02:17:05,920
in in science and politics to respond

4317
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:09,679
effectively and quickly

4318
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:12,318
to uh to covid we kind of forget that we

4319
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:14,079
fumbled this other thing too yeah and

4320
02:17:12,318 --> 02:17:15,840
it's hard to know which is going to be

4321
02:17:14,079 --> 02:17:18,718
more expensive yeah

4322
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:20,880
uh yeah they they seem to be symptoms of

4323
02:17:18,718 --> 02:17:24,959
something

4324
02:17:20,879 --> 02:17:26,879
of us of a same kind of source

4325
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:30,318
problem um

4326
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:32,718
of leadership of bureaucracy of of uh

4327
02:17:30,318 --> 02:17:34,478
the way information and intelligence

4328
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:36,318
flows throughout the u.s government all

4329
02:17:34,478 --> 02:17:38,318
those kinds of things and that hopefully

4330
02:17:36,318 --> 02:17:39,199
motivates young leaders to fix things

4331
02:17:38,318 --> 02:17:40,718
right

4332
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:42,319
definitely i mean i think if there's one

4333
02:17:40,718 --> 02:17:44,000
theme that jumps out to me and think

4334
02:17:42,318 --> 02:17:45,439
about this moment i mean

4335
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,760
if we recognize that we live in a kind

4336
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:48,880
of crisis of democracy um

4337
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:50,800
in the united states and in other

4338
02:17:48,879 --> 02:17:52,638
countries that have long been part of

4339
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:53,759
their democratic traditions if we see

4340
02:17:52,638 --> 02:17:55,119
them being under assault from certain

4341
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:57,519
quarters i think

4342
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:58,479
military defeat is yet another addition

4343
02:17:57,519 --> 02:17:59,920
to all the

4344
02:17:58,478 --> 02:18:03,119
the aspects of this that you mentioned i

4345
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:04,398
mean the fact of military defeat is

4346
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:06,800
a giant match that you're throwing on

4347
02:18:04,398 --> 02:18:08,398
this fire potentially if we think of

4348
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:10,398
its legacies and other post-war

4349
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:12,318
environments when

4350
02:18:10,398 --> 02:18:13,840
you know the veteran angle you know is

4351
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:15,760
one when you have

4352
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:16,639
people who feel betrayed i mean they

4353
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:18,000
have been

4354
02:18:16,638 --> 02:18:19,598
fodder for the far right in other

4355
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,718
settings i mean interwar europe is very

4356
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:22,960
much about

4357
02:18:20,718 --> 02:18:25,759
mobilizing disillusioned veterans the

4358
02:18:22,959 --> 02:18:28,799
name of right-wing fascist politics

4359
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:31,920
um if one thinks two of this moment

4360
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:33,759
of really increasing xenophobia you know

4361
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:35,519
our immigration debate is now talking

4362
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:37,040
about whether or not afghans should be

4363
02:18:35,519 --> 02:18:38,880
permitted at all in the united states

4364
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:41,040
you know after 20 years

4365
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:42,879
and i think immediately the response in

4366
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:44,880
europe which i followed to some extent

4367
02:18:42,879 --> 02:18:46,959
you know focusing on germany

4368
02:18:44,879 --> 02:18:48,239
uh because it it was

4369
02:18:46,959 --> 02:18:50,638
really ramping up deportations of

4370
02:18:48,239 --> 02:18:52,718
afghans leading up this collapse

4371
02:18:50,638 --> 02:18:54,558
and now they have been

4372
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:56,398
you know a lot of

4373
02:18:54,558 --> 02:18:59,039
right-wing center-right politicians in

4374
02:18:56,398 --> 02:19:01,279
in germany have been watching all this

4375
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:03,280
with an eye to

4376
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:05,040
using it to their advantage for a

4377
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:06,960
domestic german audience

4378
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:08,719
to say you know in the context of like

4379
02:19:06,959 --> 02:19:09,919
recent elections that you know we are

4380
02:19:08,718 --> 02:19:11,039
the party who will defend you against

4381
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:12,239
these afghans are going to be coming

4382
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:13,599
from this so

4383
02:19:12,239 --> 02:19:14,718
you know what i've tried to emphasize in

4384
02:19:13,599 --> 02:19:16,719
talking to different groups about this

4385
02:19:14,718 --> 02:19:18,558
moment is that it won't be confined to

4386
02:19:16,718 --> 02:19:20,959
afghanistan or even the region i mean

4387
02:19:18,558 --> 02:19:23,119
obviously malnutrition hunger will send

4388
02:19:20,959 --> 02:19:24,478
afghans to neighboring states

4389
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:27,120
but

4390
02:19:24,478 --> 02:19:29,039
where the european right is resurgent

4391
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:30,559
this has been a gift right to say that

4392
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:32,240
the africans are coming

4393
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:33,599
they're brown skinned they're muslim

4394
02:19:32,239 --> 02:19:34,879
they're uneducated they're going to want

4395
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:36,799
your women

4396
02:19:34,879 --> 02:19:39,199
um and they'll take you know the odd

4397
02:19:36,799 --> 02:19:40,718
sexual assault case or the odd whatever

4398
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:42,639
um dramatic

4399
02:19:40,718 --> 02:19:44,000
act of violence that

4400
02:19:42,638 --> 02:19:45,279
you know happens numerically in any

4401
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,000
population

4402
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:48,960
and they'll magnify that to say that you

4403
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,879
know

4404
02:19:48,959 --> 02:19:51,759
our far right group is going to save the

4405
02:19:50,879 --> 02:19:53,199
nation

4406
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:53,920
and sorry that the main point i wanted

4407
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,600
to

4408
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:57,359
to be a leadership was that

4409
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:58,479
i think the serial well there are many

4410
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:01,040
many

4411
02:19:58,478 --> 02:20:02,559
um carnal sins if you like but if you go

4412
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:03,520
back to our analogy of all the exits i

4413
02:20:02,559 --> 02:20:06,318
mean

4414
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:08,800
what blocked some of those exits was um

4415
02:20:06,318 --> 02:20:10,879
an absence of truth and transparency

4416
02:20:08,799 --> 02:20:12,079
and the lying and so i mean that the

4417
02:20:10,879 --> 02:20:13,519
this is no secret anyone who's followed

4418
02:20:12,079 --> 02:20:14,959
this but the

4419
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:16,720
we've allowed

4420
02:20:14,959 --> 02:20:19,279
and you think of the general mistrust of

4421
02:20:16,719 --> 02:20:21,760
government mistrust of of authoritative

4422
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:23,920
of authority across the board

4423
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:26,398
of professors of economists of

4424
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:28,000
scientists scientists uh doctor doctors

4425
02:20:26,398 --> 02:20:29,840
right well i actually think that's the

4426
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,040
hopeful thing to me about the internet

4427
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:32,920
yeah because

4428
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:35,359
the internet hates

4429
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:37,439
inauthenticity they can smell [ __ ]

4430
02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:39,439
much better and i think that motivates

4431
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:40,479
young leaders to be transparent and

4432
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:42,318
authentic

4433
02:20:40,478 --> 02:20:45,039
so like that's

4434
02:20:42,318 --> 02:20:47,680
the very problems we've been seeing

4435
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:51,200
with this kind of attitude of like uh of

4436
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:53,600
authority where oh the populists they're

4437
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:55,120
too busy with their own lies they're not

4438
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:56,880
smart enough to understand the full

4439
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:58,560
complexities of the things we're dealing

4440
02:20:56,879 --> 02:21:00,000
with so we're not going to even

4441
02:20:58,559 --> 02:21:02,159
communicate to them the full

4442
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,920
complexities yeah we're just going to

4443
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:06,318
decide and then

4444
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:08,000
tell them what we decided and conceive

4445
02:21:06,318 --> 02:21:09,359
some kind of narrative

4446
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,439
that that

4447
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:13,359
makes it easy for them to consume this

4448
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:15,680
decision right

4449
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:17,600
as opposed to that i have

4450
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:20,239
i really believe i see there's a hunger

4451
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:22,720
for authenticity of of uh when you're

4452
02:21:20,239 --> 02:21:24,079
making decisions when you're looking at

4453
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:25,119
the rest of the world and trying to

4454
02:21:24,079 --> 02:21:28,079
decide

4455
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:30,240
uh untangle this complexity yeah the

4456
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:32,398
internet the public

4457
02:21:30,239 --> 02:21:35,280
the world wants to see you as a leader

4458
02:21:32,398 --> 02:21:37,519
struggle with the tension of these ideas

4459
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:39,840
to uh change your mind

4460
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:41,760
to see you know to recognize your own

4461
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:44,239
flaws in your own thinking from a month

4462
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:46,800
ago all that the full complexity of it

4463
02:21:44,239 --> 02:21:49,439
also acknowledged the uncertainty as

4464
02:21:46,799 --> 02:21:51,438
with kovid also with the wars

4465
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:52,880
you know uh i think there's a hunger for

4466
02:21:51,439 --> 02:21:54,960
that and i think that's just going to

4467
02:21:52,879 --> 02:21:57,438
change the nature of leadership in the

4468
02:21:54,959 --> 02:21:59,519
21st century i hope so i think you know

4469
02:21:57,439 --> 02:22:00,720
all the things you highlighted i mean

4470
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:02,960
accountability is part of that right i

4471
02:22:00,719 --> 02:22:05,358
mean we need you know

4472
02:22:02,959 --> 02:22:07,039
honesty openness uh and then you know

4473
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:08,800
acknowledgement of mistakes and humility

4474
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:10,640
is the key to all learning right but

4475
02:22:08,799 --> 02:22:12,799
also i mean you think just the headline

4476
02:22:10,639 --> 02:22:14,719
from yesterday the

4477
02:22:12,799 --> 02:22:16,398
the horrible drone strike which was

4478
02:22:14,719 --> 02:22:18,000
really the last kind of american

4479
02:22:16,398 --> 02:22:20,239
military action

4480
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,398
on the day that the us was i think

4481
02:22:20,239 --> 02:22:24,239
mostly departing from kabul

4482
02:22:22,398 --> 02:22:25,199
wiped out an entire family mostly

4483
02:22:24,239 --> 02:22:26,799
children

4484
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:29,359
you know the u.s acknowledged that yes

4485
02:22:26,799 --> 02:22:31,039
this was not the isis bombing outfit

4486
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:32,880
that they thought it was

4487
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:34,640
but yesterday the they did a quick

4488
02:22:32,879 --> 02:22:36,318
review um

4489
02:22:34,639 --> 02:22:38,159
i'm not an expert on undrone strikes in

4490
02:22:36,318 --> 02:22:40,879
their aftermath but those who looking

4491
02:22:38,159 --> 02:22:43,200
more closely said it was basically um

4492
02:22:40,879 --> 02:22:44,719
whole cloth taken from what the u.s

4493
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:46,560
government has been saying

4494
02:22:44,719 --> 02:22:48,000
after all these strikes

4495
02:22:46,559 --> 02:22:48,719
you know reproducing the same language

4496
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,439
and

4497
02:22:48,719 --> 02:22:53,760
basically pointing to technical errors

4498
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:54,639
but denying that there were

4499
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:55,840
any

4500
02:22:54,639 --> 02:22:57,199
procedural

4501
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:59,680
mistakes

4502
02:22:57,200 --> 02:23:01,359
or flaws or is this kind of

4503
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:03,439
they found little ways of acknowledging

4504
02:23:01,359 --> 02:23:06,239
things not go as planned but

4505
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:09,439
you know we follow policies essentially

4506
02:23:06,239 --> 02:23:11,439
and that's it it's not a crime

4507
02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:13,439
it's a way of not even saying

4508
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:16,639
you know we screwed up

4509
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:18,479
and it's kind of the legalese that that

4510
02:23:16,639 --> 02:23:20,799
suddenly makes a war crime not a war

4511
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:23,119
crime you know and that

4512
02:23:20,799 --> 02:23:24,559
that is reflects i think or feasible to

4513
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:26,240
take accountability

4514
02:23:24,559 --> 02:23:29,439
i think people are really sick of that

4515
02:23:26,239 --> 02:23:30,559
yeah in a way where the opposite is true

4516
02:23:29,439 --> 02:23:33,520
which is

4517
02:23:30,559 --> 02:23:35,439
they get excited for people who are not

4518
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:37,280
for leaders who are not that right and

4519
02:23:35,439 --> 02:23:38,800
so there's they're not going to punish

4520
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:42,479
you for saying

4521
02:23:38,799 --> 02:23:44,159
i made a mistake yeah that i i

4522
02:23:42,478 --> 02:23:47,119
i just had a conversation with francis

4523
02:23:44,159 --> 02:23:49,439
collins the director of nih and part of

4524
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:51,840
my criticism towards anthony fauci has

4525
02:23:49,439 --> 02:23:54,159
been that um

4526
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:56,159
it's like such subtle

4527
02:23:54,159 --> 02:23:58,879
but such crucial

4528
02:23:56,159 --> 02:24:01,119
communication of mistakes made

4529
02:23:58,879 --> 02:24:02,318
if you make a small mistake it is so

4530
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:04,000
powerful

4531
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:06,398
to communicate

4532
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:09,359
i think we messed up we thought this was

4533
02:24:06,398 --> 02:24:11,358
true yeah and it wasn't so the the

4534
02:24:09,359 --> 02:24:13,120
obvious thing there was with masks early

4535
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:15,040
in the pandemic

4536
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:17,920
there's so much uncertainty it's so

4537
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:20,240
understandable to make mistakes or to

4538
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:22,559
to also be concerned about what kind of

4539
02:24:20,239 --> 02:24:24,639
hysteria different statements you make

4540
02:24:22,559 --> 02:24:26,799
lead to just being transparent about

4541
02:24:24,639 --> 02:24:28,318
that and saying we were not correct in

4542
02:24:26,799 --> 02:24:31,199
saying the thing you said before that's

4543
02:24:28,318 --> 02:24:32,719
so powerful to communicate

4544
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:35,840
to uh gain

4545
02:24:32,719 --> 02:24:38,478
trust and the opposite is true when you

4546
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:42,079
do this legalese type of talk yeah yeah

4547
02:24:38,478 --> 02:24:43,279
it's it uh destroys trust and i again i

4548
02:24:42,079 --> 02:24:47,120
really

4549
02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:49,120
think the lessons of recent history yeah

4550
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:52,079
teach us what it

4551
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:54,800
what how to be a leader and teach young

4552
02:24:52,079 --> 02:24:57,120
leaders how to be leaders and i so i

4553
02:24:54,799 --> 02:24:59,039
have a lot of hope yeah good partially

4554
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:59,920
thanks for the internet yeah yeah that's

4555
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:01,439
great yeah

4556
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:05,280
no humility i mean we you know we need

4557
02:25:01,439 --> 02:25:06,800
humility accountability honesty um

4558
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:08,159
and yeah studying the past is an

4559
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:10,318
important way to do that i mean to to

4560
02:25:08,159 --> 02:25:11,359
learn from past mistakes and obviously

4561
02:25:10,318 --> 02:25:13,199
there's a source of inspiration and

4562
02:25:11,359 --> 02:25:14,559
courage and you know we can take

4563
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:15,840
some kind of assessments from that too

4564
02:25:14,559 --> 02:25:17,680
but um

4565
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:20,880
but also learning from learning how not

4566
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:22,318
to do things right and then

4567
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:24,318
you know analogies are never like one to

4568
02:25:22,318 --> 02:25:25,119
one i mean we talk about vietnam i mean

4569
02:25:24,318 --> 02:25:26,879
i think

4570
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:28,399
many vietnam veterans would say

4571
02:25:26,879 --> 02:25:30,079
yeah this is like deja vu you know i

4572
02:25:28,398 --> 02:25:32,879
mean there's the story the the the

4573
02:25:30,079 --> 02:25:35,359
visuals of the kabul airport and of

4574
02:25:32,879 --> 02:25:36,478
of the saigon embassy were not the same

4575
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:38,800
but close enough that people would

4576
02:25:36,478 --> 02:25:40,879
juxtapose them all let's run up but i

4577
02:25:38,799 --> 02:25:42,879
would just ask people that you know

4578
02:25:40,879 --> 02:25:43,599
overanalogizing is also you know a kind

4579
02:25:42,879 --> 02:25:46,159
of

4580
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:47,760
path down like making errors of judgment

4581
02:25:46,159 --> 02:25:48,639
and in comparison

4582
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:50,398
and then

4583
02:25:48,639 --> 02:25:51,840
sameness um

4584
02:25:50,398 --> 02:25:54,478
but it's stretch you mean like 9 11

4585
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:56,799
itself i think the idea that um

4586
02:25:54,478 --> 02:25:58,639
people lack the imagination within our

4587
02:25:56,799 --> 02:26:00,318
security apparatus to think this is even

4588
02:25:58,639 --> 02:26:01,760
possible right

4589
02:26:00,318 --> 02:26:05,039
and you think of the simplicity of

4590
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:07,200
having a 10 lock on a cockpit door you

4591
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:08,640
know could have wanted all this and

4592
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:10,479
you know again i'm not saying

4593
02:26:08,639 --> 02:26:12,799
either the time or in hindsight that i

4594
02:26:10,478 --> 02:26:14,398
am on mission about all this but

4595
02:26:12,799 --> 02:26:15,759
you know i just been living in germany

4596
02:26:14,398 --> 02:26:17,760
the year before and

4597
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:19,840
there was a plot there this guy was

4598
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:22,318
hatching from germany to blow up the

4599
02:26:19,840 --> 02:26:23,359
mausoleum of ottawa and ankara with an

4600
02:26:22,318 --> 02:26:25,760
airplane

4601
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:27,600
and so if you kind of dig

4602
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:29,520
you know it wasn't unimaginable that you

4603
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:31,439
would use an airplane as a weapon

4604
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:33,040
and the bush was association kept saying

4605
02:26:31,439 --> 02:26:34,559
no one had ever heard of this who would

4606
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:35,760
do this like well

4607
02:26:34,559 --> 02:26:37,600
not a lot of people do this and then you

4608
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:40,000
know at that very moment my wife was

4609
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:41,120
teaching the joseph conrad novel secret

4610
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,959
agent

4611
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:46,240
which was about a conspiratorial

4612
02:26:42,959 --> 02:26:48,239
organization that wanted to bomb

4613
02:26:46,239 --> 02:26:49,359
actually in respect it was kind of

4614
02:26:48,239 --> 02:26:50,719
suicide bombing because i think they

4615
02:26:49,359 --> 02:26:51,680
tricked this guy into doing it but they

4616
02:26:50,719 --> 02:26:53,599
want to

4617
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:55,840
bomb the greenwich observatory for some

4618
02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:57,040
obscure political purpose

4619
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:57,840
um

4620
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:59,680
so

4621
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:01,359
that's an instance in which you know the

4622
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:03,280
novel right to go back to our kind of

4623
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:05,040
humanities [ __ ] right that it's my

4624
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:06,720
point was that um

4625
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:08,720
you know as you mentioned we need

4626
02:27:06,719 --> 02:27:11,920
humanity transparency but also

4627
02:27:08,719 --> 02:27:14,000
imagination right i think part of

4628
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:16,000
expanding imagination is by you know i

4629
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:17,760
mean obviously delving into your fields

4630
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,680
you know of engineering and the sciences

4631
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:22,000
and robotics and artificial intelligence

4632
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:24,159
and all that rich landscape and then

4633
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,280
but also we find this in film poetry

4634
02:27:24,159 --> 02:27:26,719
literature i mean just the kind of

4635
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:28,399
stretching that

4636
02:27:26,719 --> 02:27:29,599
that we need to do

4637
02:27:28,398 --> 02:27:31,119
to

4638
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:32,399
really educate ourselves more fully

4639
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:34,479
right across the

4640
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:35,920
across the spectrum of everything humans

4641
02:27:34,478 --> 02:27:37,840
need to imagine

4642
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:39,600
do we imagine security you know so much

4643
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:41,520
what we talked about today i mean

4644
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:43,280
it's much of you know

4645
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:45,920
our security is affected by others

4646
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:47,920
perception of their insecurity right

4647
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:50,559
um which unleashes a whole

4648
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:53,439
web of emotions can you

4649
02:27:50,559 --> 02:27:56,879
tell me about the afghan people

4650
02:27:53,439 --> 02:27:58,960
uh what they love what they fear

4651
02:27:56,879 --> 02:28:01,119
what they dream of for themselves and

4652
02:27:58,959 --> 02:28:03,759
for their nation is there something to

4653
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:04,800
say to speak to to the spirit of the

4654
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:06,719
people

4655
02:28:04,799 --> 02:28:09,599
that may humanize

4656
02:28:06,719 --> 02:28:10,840
them and maybe speak to the concerns and

4657
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:13,439
the hopes they

4658
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:15,840
have yeah i think i you know as an

4659
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:18,000
outsider i hesitate to to make any grand

4660
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:18,960
statement but i would say listen i mean

4661
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:21,120
um

4662
02:28:18,959 --> 02:28:22,478
there are a number of documentary films

4663
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:24,800
that that

4664
02:28:22,478 --> 02:28:26,239
are incredibly rich that will offer your

4665
02:28:24,799 --> 02:28:27,279
listeners and viewers at snapshots so

4666
02:28:26,239 --> 02:28:29,119
there is

4667
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:30,079
um afghan star

4668
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:31,600
you know which really brings you to the

4669
02:28:30,079 --> 02:28:33,359
homes of

4670
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:34,318
a set of people who you know they won't

4671
02:28:33,359 --> 02:28:35,359
start them

4672
02:28:34,318 --> 02:28:36,559
they're artists they want to express

4673
02:28:35,359 --> 02:28:38,318
themselves

4674
02:28:36,559 --> 02:28:40,318
some want to push political boundaries

4675
02:28:38,318 --> 02:28:42,398
cultural boundaries there's a woman who

4676
02:28:40,318 --> 02:28:44,000
gets into hot water for dancing

4677
02:28:42,398 --> 02:28:45,680
but you realize it

4678
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:47,520
i mean

4679
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,120
people i mean they love art they love

4680
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:50,479
music they love poetry they love

4681
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:51,920
expression

4682
02:28:50,478 --> 02:28:54,079
you know people want to care for their

4683
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:55,760
children they want safety to families

4684
02:28:54,079 --> 02:28:57,600
they want to enjoy

4685
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:58,719
what everyone enjoys you know i think

4686
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:00,318
it's a very

4687
02:28:58,719 --> 02:29:01,599
humanizing portrait

4688
02:29:00,318 --> 02:29:04,159
there's another great documentary film

4689
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:04,159
called um

4690
02:29:04,398 --> 02:29:09,199
love crimes of kabul

4691
02:29:06,559 --> 02:29:10,959
which is a great snapshot of of the post

4692
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:12,560
2000 world that the americans shaped a

4693
02:29:10,959 --> 02:29:13,519
lot of ways and it's about a women's

4694
02:29:12,559 --> 02:29:14,398
prison

4695
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:15,680
and

4696
02:29:14,398 --> 02:29:16,959
it's incredibly revealing because it's

4697
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:19,840
about

4698
02:29:16,959 --> 02:29:22,159
young girls and what they want um well

4699
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:24,159
not not just young but young teenage and

4700
02:29:22,159 --> 02:29:26,398
then some middle-aged people who

4701
02:29:24,159 --> 02:29:29,840
who are accused of moral crimes ranging

4702
02:29:26,398 --> 02:29:30,639
from homicide which one woman admits to

4703
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:32,318
to

4704
02:29:30,639 --> 02:29:33,680
having such relations outside of

4705
02:29:32,318 --> 02:29:34,478
marriage

4706
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:37,200
and

4707
02:29:34,478 --> 02:29:39,438
so it shows in a way continuity with

4708
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:41,120
the previous telephone regime and that

4709
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:42,318
women are imprisoned for things that you

4710
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:44,880
wouldn't be in prison for elsewhere and

4711
02:29:42,318 --> 02:29:45,840
that islamic law operates as the the

4712
02:29:44,879 --> 02:29:48,559
kind of

4713
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:50,960
judicial logic for these um

4714
02:29:48,559 --> 02:29:52,478
these punishments but lettings women

4715
02:29:50,959 --> 02:29:54,239
kind of speak themselves

4716
02:29:52,478 --> 02:29:55,920
i mean it's fascinating i mean they i

4717
02:29:54,239 --> 02:29:58,719
don't want to give too much away but

4718
02:29:55,920 --> 02:30:01,280
women make ranching choices in this film

4719
02:29:58,719 --> 02:30:02,719
that land them in this predicament so

4720
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:05,120
they don't all profess

4721
02:30:02,719 --> 02:30:06,799
innocence some are like i'm guilty but

4722
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:08,800
they're guilty for reasons

4723
02:30:06,799 --> 02:30:10,159
in one case one woman is guilty she's in

4724
02:30:08,799 --> 02:30:11,519
prison because

4725
02:30:10,159 --> 02:30:13,600
it's a way to exert pressure on her

4726
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:15,520
fiance to finally marry her

4727
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:17,520
you know yeah so you get ethnicity you

4728
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:19,040
get like you know kind of romeo and

4729
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:20,720
juliet things or their families don't

4730
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:22,560
like each other necessarily but they

4731
02:30:20,719 --> 02:30:24,719
find each other you have questions of

4732
02:30:22,559 --> 02:30:26,799
like love money

4733
02:30:24,719 --> 02:30:28,719
clothing furniture

4734
02:30:26,799 --> 02:30:30,478
um it's beautiful and like i mean the

4735
02:30:28,719 --> 02:30:32,079
parts with it i remember showing it in

4736
02:30:30,478 --> 02:30:33,519
class there was a wonderful afghan

4737
02:30:32,079 --> 02:30:35,359
student who was a

4738
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:36,960
i think a fulbright at the ed school at

4739
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:38,800
stanford and she's a genius she's

4740
02:30:36,959 --> 02:30:40,478
amazing um

4741
02:30:38,799 --> 02:30:41,920
it was awkward for her because

4742
02:30:40,478 --> 02:30:44,398
talking about young women having sex and

4743
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:45,920
stuff and it was just it wasn't

4744
02:30:44,398 --> 02:30:47,279
you know the snapshot of afghanistan

4745
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:49,280
that she wanted and obviously there's so

4746
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:51,280
much more they're great writers and

4747
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:52,720
you know musicians and i mean you know

4748
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:54,239
music is a huge thing i mean poetry all

4749
02:30:52,719 --> 02:30:55,199
these things are great

4750
02:30:54,239 --> 02:30:56,879
um

4751
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:58,720
so she found it you know

4752
02:30:56,879 --> 02:31:01,358
i hear you i mean it's a kind of taboo

4753
02:30:58,719 --> 02:31:03,519
subject but i thought the american

4754
02:31:01,359 --> 02:31:04,559
students sing it really identified with

4755
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:06,800
these women

4756
02:31:04,559 --> 02:31:08,000
because they're just so real and so

4757
02:31:06,799 --> 02:31:10,079
you know young people trying to find

4758
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:11,359
like i mean relationships that are

4759
02:31:10,079 --> 02:31:13,200
universal

4760
02:31:11,359 --> 02:31:16,640
um and circumstances that are

4761
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:18,399
very difficult um love love is universal

4762
02:31:16,639 --> 02:31:19,680
yeah so it's i mean we do have resources

4763
02:31:18,398 --> 02:31:21,119
to humanize i mean you know you know

4764
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:23,600
some of your people will know khao

4765
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:25,520
husseini you know he's african-american

4766
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:27,600
he's done his stuff but there are

4767
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:29,920
there are a number of

4768
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:31,600
novelists and short story writers who do

4769
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:33,359
cool things i think that

4770
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:34,960
another tragic aspect of this moment is

4771
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:37,359
that those people have now pretty much

4772
02:31:34,959 --> 02:31:38,719
had to leave the country so

4773
02:31:37,359 --> 02:31:43,280
um there's a visual artist i would

4774
02:31:38,719 --> 02:31:46,000
highlight for you named khadam ali

4775
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:49,040
is a hazara based in australia

4776
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:51,520
he does extraordinary work in blending

4777
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:55,359
a tradition of persian miniatures

4778
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:56,479
with contemporary political commentary

4779
02:31:55,359 --> 02:31:58,239
his work is between australia and

4780
02:31:56,478 --> 02:32:00,079
afghanistan but he also he had to flee i

4781
02:31:58,239 --> 02:32:01,199
mean he's doing some work in kabul

4782
02:32:00,079 --> 02:32:03,439
but it's a

4783
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:05,600
extraordinary um

4784
02:32:03,439 --> 02:32:07,120
kind of visual language that he's

4785
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:08,399
adopted that has been shown all over the

4786
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:11,200
planet now he's got some of his work is

4787
02:32:08,398 --> 02:32:12,478
in new york galleries is in europe

4788
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:13,920
he's been shown in australia but he

4789
02:32:12,478 --> 02:32:16,239
talks about migration

4790
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:18,719
in a way that puts afghans and hazaras

4791
02:32:16,239 --> 02:32:20,318
at the center but it's totally universal

4792
02:32:18,719 --> 02:32:21,119
about um

4793
02:32:20,318 --> 02:32:23,519
you know

4794
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:24,960
our modern crisis of of

4795
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:26,399
all the mains people who were displaced

4796
02:32:24,959 --> 02:32:29,358
across our planet and he attempts to

4797
02:32:26,398 --> 02:32:30,719
kind of speak for some size of them

4798
02:32:29,359 --> 02:32:32,079
in a way that like i think everyone can

4799
02:32:30,719 --> 02:32:33,519
get um

4800
02:32:32,079 --> 02:32:35,760
i mean the visual imagery experts will

4801
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:38,079
know that it's from you know like the

4802
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:39,920
the chaname like an ancient persian you

4803
02:32:38,079 --> 02:32:41,680
know epic that iranians were attached to

4804
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:44,318
that afghans are attached to that people

4805
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:46,079
can quote you know at length um it has

4806
02:32:44,318 --> 02:32:47,840
mythical figures of good and evil that

4807
02:32:46,079 --> 02:32:48,879
kids grow up embodying

4808
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:51,359
they're named the names of the

4809
02:32:48,879 --> 02:32:52,719
characters that are um it's called the

4810
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:54,000
book of kings

4811
02:32:52,719 --> 02:32:56,239
uh the heroes and villains are the

4812
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:57,840
staple of conversation and

4813
02:32:56,239 --> 02:32:59,199
and poetry and

4814
02:32:57,840 --> 02:33:01,840
you know

4815
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:03,280
like russians i mean the kind of the

4816
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:05,040
the resort to literary references and

4817
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:06,800
speak is something that you know

4818
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:08,160
americans don't do most

4819
02:33:06,799 --> 02:33:09,358
west european countries don't do but the

4820
02:33:08,159 --> 02:33:11,439
fact that everyone's got to know this

4821
02:33:09,359 --> 02:33:14,800
character everyone has this reference

4822
02:33:11,439 --> 02:33:17,040
the word play the linguistic finesse um

4823
02:33:14,799 --> 02:33:19,279
in multiple languages is

4824
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:21,439
you know a major value of

4825
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:23,040
afghan storytelling um

4826
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:25,120
as an outsider i'm

4827
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:26,880
scratching it the surface of the surface

4828
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:29,120
yeah but there's a depth to it just like

4829
02:33:26,879 --> 02:33:31,519
it is fascinating the layers yeah with

4830
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:35,040
the layers of russian language that's

4831
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:36,800
exactly the the culture it's a i've been

4832
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:38,800
struggling and this is kind of the

4833
02:33:36,799 --> 02:33:40,239
journey i'm

4834
02:33:38,799 --> 02:33:43,039
embarking on

4835
02:33:40,239 --> 02:33:46,079
convey to an american audience

4836
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:48,560
uh what is lost in translation yeah

4837
02:33:46,079 --> 02:33:50,318
between russian and english and it's

4838
02:33:48,559 --> 02:33:52,639
it's very challenging and some of the

4839
02:33:50,318 --> 02:33:54,000
great translators of dusty yes gif

4840
02:33:52,639 --> 02:33:56,079
tolstoy

4841
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:58,639
of russian literature struggle with this

4842
02:33:56,079 --> 02:34:00,478
deeply and yeah they work uh

4843
02:33:58,639 --> 02:34:02,559
it's it's a it's an art form just to

4844
02:34:00,478 --> 02:34:05,279
convey that and right it's amazing to

4845
02:34:02,559 --> 02:34:07,359
hear that afghanistan with a full mix

4846
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:10,479
of cultures that are there have the same

4847
02:34:07,359 --> 02:34:11,760
kind of uh wit and humor and depth of

4848
02:34:10,478 --> 02:34:13,438
intelligence i mean the humor thing is

4849
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:14,880
that that's you know i'm so much our

4850
02:34:13,439 --> 02:34:16,880
visual imagery is about like this sad

4851
02:34:14,879 --> 02:34:18,398
place and dao or whatever but the

4852
02:34:16,879 --> 02:34:19,839
i mean socially again

4853
02:34:18,398 --> 02:34:22,719
i mean engage in some stereotypes about

4854
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:24,318
generalization stuff but just the um

4855
02:34:22,719 --> 02:34:26,159
you know the afghan friends that i've

4856
02:34:24,318 --> 02:34:27,359
come to be close with they really love i

4857
02:34:26,159 --> 02:34:29,200
mean the

4858
02:34:27,359 --> 02:34:31,200
the humor there's so much there i have

4859
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:32,720
common common stuff of like

4860
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:35,120
when i go to ireland it's one of my

4861
02:34:32,719 --> 02:34:36,398
favorite places and just like the

4862
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:38,240
i feel a sense of pressure like the

4863
02:34:36,398 --> 02:34:40,159
humor all around me all the time i feel

4864
02:34:38,239 --> 02:34:41,760
like there's something between iron like

4865
02:34:40,159 --> 02:34:43,200
i learned in russia

4866
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:44,639
with the humor stuff

4867
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:46,319
where it's like you've you got to be on

4868
02:34:44,639 --> 02:34:48,719
your game if you want to be you know so

4869
02:34:46,318 --> 02:34:52,079
it's yeah it's not i feel like i mean

4870
02:34:48,719 --> 02:34:53,920
it's the intensity of conversation

4871
02:34:52,079 --> 02:34:56,159
in terms of yeah you have to be on your

4872
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:57,280
game in terms of wit and so on i mean

4873
02:34:56,159 --> 02:34:58,559
you have to

4874
02:34:57,280 --> 02:35:00,000
there's certain people i have like when

4875
02:34:58,559 --> 02:35:02,079
i talked on this podcast they're like

4876
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,920
that uh certain people from the jewish

4877
02:35:02,079 --> 02:35:06,719
tradition have that totally like where

4878
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:08,478
the where is just like okay i have to

4879
02:35:06,719 --> 02:35:10,879
oh yeah i really have to pay attention

4880
02:35:08,478 --> 02:35:12,398
yeah yeah it's a game it's like it's

4881
02:35:10,879 --> 02:35:14,318
like uh you know what it feels like it

4882
02:35:12,398 --> 02:35:16,079
feels like speed chess or something like

4883
02:35:14,318 --> 02:35:18,239
that and you really have to

4884
02:35:16,079 --> 02:35:20,159
uh focus and play and at the same time

4885
02:35:18,239 --> 02:35:22,239
there's body language in the and then

4886
02:35:20,159 --> 02:35:24,159
there's a melancholy nature to it at

4887
02:35:22,239 --> 02:35:25,840
least in the russian side yeah the whole

4888
02:35:24,159 --> 02:35:26,959
thing is just a beautiful moment yeah

4889
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:28,398
there's a there's a funny two type video

4890
02:35:26,959 --> 02:35:30,559
that went around that that i got from

4891
02:35:28,398 --> 02:35:31,439
like some afghan acquaintances that was

4892
02:35:30,559 --> 02:35:33,039
uh

4893
02:35:31,439 --> 02:35:34,079
he's an irish comedian

4894
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:36,560
kind of

4895
02:35:34,079 --> 02:35:38,159
highlighting you know kind of irish and

4896
02:35:36,559 --> 02:35:39,600
german natural stereotypes around

4897
02:35:38,159 --> 02:35:41,600
hospitality

4898
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:43,040
and um this afghan woman said you know i

4899
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:45,040
didn't know that the

4900
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:46,160
irish were just white afghans because

4901
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:48,399
the whole like you know the hospitality

4902
02:35:46,159 --> 02:35:49,920
like politics of like of refusal you

4903
02:35:48,398 --> 02:35:50,719
know you you know you don't you don't

4904
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:51,680
take

4905
02:35:50,719 --> 02:35:53,599
something that's offered to the first

4906
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,600
time you don't i mean it's the

4907
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:57,520
the culture of um

4908
02:35:55,600 --> 02:35:58,479
of receiving a guest you know that's you

4909
02:35:57,520 --> 02:35:59,760
know

4910
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:01,599
americans aren't i mean that's not you

4911
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:02,880
know that's not always i mean they're

4912
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,840
different the regional cultures or

4913
02:36:02,879 --> 02:36:05,039
that's the thing there's whatever but

4914
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:07,280
it's i mean the

4915
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:09,359
the kind of like generosity and the kind

4916
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:10,640
of you know that that's that's real i

4917
02:36:09,359 --> 02:36:11,600
mean that's

4918
02:36:10,639 --> 02:36:13,358
and that's a cool thing and that's

4919
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:14,640
amazing that's um you know the food i

4920
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:16,318
mean going on just the sufficient things

4921
02:36:14,639 --> 02:36:18,239
about it with the

4922
02:36:16,318 --> 02:36:20,879
but all that the the warmth of

4923
02:36:18,239 --> 02:36:23,439
hospitality and um

4924
02:36:20,879 --> 02:36:25,199
of wit and and humanity i mean it's

4925
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:26,800
that that that's what we don't see if

4926
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:28,399
you're in the place just through war and

4927
02:36:26,799 --> 02:36:30,318
geopolitics and the moving pieces of the

4928
02:36:28,398 --> 02:36:31,760
map and stuff and that's

4929
02:36:30,318 --> 02:36:34,318
and that's hard to see when the other

4930
02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:36,960
gaps in in language and in religious

4931
02:36:34,318 --> 02:36:38,398
tradition and all that stuff and then

4932
02:36:36,959 --> 02:36:39,358
you know being open to the fact that

4933
02:36:38,398 --> 02:36:41,358
people do

4934
02:36:39,359 --> 02:36:42,159
do things differently you know and it's

4935
02:36:41,359 --> 02:36:43,120
uh

4936
02:36:42,159 --> 02:36:45,439
and the gender did mention there's

4937
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:46,640
important right they're they're kind of

4938
02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:47,920
you know

4939
02:36:46,639 --> 02:36:49,439
arguably each culture has a kind of

4940
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:50,960
gender dynamic that's different and so i

4941
02:36:49,439 --> 02:36:52,398
think it's helpful to have humility in

4942
02:36:50,959 --> 02:36:53,919
thinking that

4943
02:36:52,398 --> 02:36:55,760
some afghans will do something something

4944
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:58,478
different differently yeah but then

4945
02:36:55,760 --> 02:37:00,079
you'll also have afghans who say

4946
02:36:58,478 --> 02:37:01,279
every woman should be educated everyone

4947
02:37:00,079 --> 02:37:03,359
should work and so on and so on so

4948
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:05,680
there's no there's no single way of yeah

4949
02:37:03,359 --> 02:37:08,159
and there is a dynamic in russia too

4950
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:09,200
they we need to be respectful that like

4951
02:37:08,159 --> 02:37:10,879
that's not that's not always what it

4952
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:12,640
looks like at first yeah exactly there's

4953
02:37:10,879 --> 02:37:14,398
layers where power is i mean that's

4954
02:37:12,639 --> 02:37:16,159
definitely i don't know yeah uh yeah

4955
02:37:14,398 --> 02:37:19,199
that's a whole nother conversation where

4956
02:37:16,159 --> 02:37:21,760
the power is yeah uh rumi the 13th

4957
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:24,159
century persian poet who was born in the

4958
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:26,478
land that is now afghanistan is there

4959
02:37:24,159 --> 02:37:28,639
something in his words that speaks to

4960
02:37:26,478 --> 02:37:31,039
you about the spirit of the afghan

4961
02:37:28,639 --> 02:37:31,039
people

4962
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:33,680
i mean everyone owns rumi i guess i'd

4963
02:37:32,639 --> 02:37:35,920
say and that that's going to get me in

4964
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:36,960
trouble with certain afghan fans of rumi

4965
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:38,719
who

4966
02:37:36,959 --> 02:37:40,318
want to see him as as an afghan i would

4967
02:37:38,719 --> 02:37:42,799
say

4968
02:37:40,318 --> 02:37:45,680
are they proud of yeah did they see him

4969
02:37:42,799 --> 02:37:47,519
as an afghan do they yeah i mean so it

4970
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:49,600
depends i mean some some people

4971
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:50,960
will be militant and say

4972
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:52,318
you know the irony is going to have him

4973
02:37:50,959 --> 02:37:53,199
he's ours

4974
02:37:52,318 --> 02:37:55,680
um

4975
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:56,800
but they're also saying you know he's

4976
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:58,639
i mean you could say

4977
02:37:56,799 --> 02:38:00,719
again he's like blood i mean he's he's a

4978
02:37:58,639 --> 02:38:03,199
sufi he's a muslim

4979
02:38:00,719 --> 02:38:04,799
he's a central asian he's iranian he's

4980
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:06,240
afghan

4981
02:38:04,799 --> 02:38:07,679
he's a turk i'm trying to think of

4982
02:38:06,239 --> 02:38:08,959
analogy but he's

4983
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:10,398
he's something special to everyone so i

4984
02:38:08,959 --> 02:38:12,079
guess i would i would not walk into that

4985
02:38:10,398 --> 02:38:13,199
conversation and claim that he's one or

4986
02:38:12,079 --> 02:38:14,719
another but it's a cool thing i mean

4987
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:16,000
it's the um

4988
02:38:14,719 --> 02:38:16,989
but i'm glad you brought that up because

4989
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,799
that's a good way of seeing

4990
02:38:16,989 --> 02:38:20,559
[Music]

4991
02:38:18,799 --> 02:38:22,079
a seeing something that that afghans i

4992
02:38:20,559 --> 02:38:24,478
mean we love our country to afghanistan

4993
02:38:22,079 --> 02:38:26,239
and say okay roomies everyone you know

4994
02:38:24,478 --> 02:38:27,920
madonna helped make famous united states

4995
02:38:26,239 --> 02:38:29,280
you know for better for worse they used

4996
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:31,200
to sell stuff at starbucks and that's

4997
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:32,560
all complicated um

4998
02:38:31,200 --> 02:38:34,960
and embarrassing and his his

4999
02:38:32,559 --> 02:38:36,398
translations are very much disputed

5000
02:38:34,959 --> 02:38:37,919
where you have people being like there's

5001
02:38:36,398 --> 02:38:38,639
some awful roomy translations and there

5002
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:40,079
are

5003
02:38:38,639 --> 02:38:41,599
there's also a lot of

5004
02:38:40,079 --> 02:38:43,680
speaking of the internet there's lots of

5005
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:45,120
uh fake roomie quotes yes

5006
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:45,920
you know like roomie said always be your

5007
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:46,960
best

5008
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:48,159
like

5009
02:38:46,959 --> 02:38:49,759
we didn't say that you know that was you

5010
02:38:48,159 --> 02:38:52,000
know i mean this kind of stuff but yeah

5011
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:53,040
but the cool thing is like the um

5012
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,040
i mean i think

5013
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:57,920
you can read roomie as a religious

5014
02:38:55,040 --> 02:39:00,240
thinker but you can also you know

5015
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:01,359
read rumi as a um

5016
02:39:00,239 --> 02:39:02,959
you know in an islamic sentence but you

5017
02:39:01,359 --> 02:39:04,640
know also as a kind of spiritualist

5018
02:39:02,959 --> 02:39:06,799
right someone who or an ethicist or

5019
02:39:04,639 --> 02:39:08,239
moralist and so i think that's

5020
02:39:06,799 --> 02:39:10,478
i i like the

5021
02:39:08,239 --> 02:39:12,799
the lens of roomie as a gateway to

5022
02:39:10,478 --> 02:39:14,639
afghan um ecumenicism and

5023
02:39:12,799 --> 02:39:16,239
cosmopolitanism you know the theme i

5024
02:39:14,639 --> 02:39:17,039
keep the sizing of

5025
02:39:16,239 --> 02:39:20,318
of

5026
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:22,160
meeting actual afghans who were actually

5027
02:39:20,318 --> 02:39:23,760
you know fluent in russian fluent german

5028
02:39:22,159 --> 02:39:25,840
fluent turkish

5029
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:27,040
they know diary they know pashto

5030
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:28,398
um

5031
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:29,359
they've gone to university or sometimes

5032
02:39:28,398 --> 02:39:31,439
they haven't

5033
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:33,840
and yet i mean they are um i like the

5034
02:39:31,439 --> 02:39:35,359
category of the uh

5035
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:36,960
popular intellectual you know the

5036
02:39:35,359 --> 02:39:38,800
intellectual who isn't

5037
02:39:36,959 --> 02:39:40,159
isn't formally educated necessarily

5038
02:39:38,799 --> 02:39:41,519
although of course that's represented

5039
02:39:40,159 --> 02:39:42,959
too especially increasingly now at this

5040
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:44,479
generation of going university all over

5041
02:39:42,959 --> 02:39:45,519
the world you know stanford mit

5042
02:39:44,478 --> 02:39:48,159
everywhere

5043
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:49,760
um afghans are war reps into there

5044
02:39:48,159 --> 02:39:50,799
but just being

5045
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:52,559
i don't have any kind of worldly

5046
02:39:50,799 --> 02:39:54,478
knowledge that is

5047
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:56,079
not limited to a province to a village

5048
02:39:54,478 --> 02:39:58,719
to a hamlet but

5049
02:39:56,079 --> 02:40:00,719
sometimes it is but sometimes it's not

5050
02:39:58,719 --> 02:40:02,318
because of

5051
02:40:00,719 --> 02:40:03,760
again not because of some fairy tale

5052
02:40:02,318 --> 02:40:06,799
story of

5053
02:40:03,760 --> 02:40:10,079
curiosity wanting the globe out of

5054
02:40:06,799 --> 02:40:11,759
you know some sense of of privilege but

5055
02:40:10,079 --> 02:40:14,559
out of necessity out of survival of

5056
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:15,760
having to adapt and it's really um

5057
02:40:14,559 --> 02:40:18,719
extraordinary that i mean also when you

5058
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:20,880
think about like professions so like

5059
02:40:18,719 --> 02:40:22,559
you know ask ask an afghan you know what

5060
02:40:20,879 --> 02:40:23,759
does he or she do for a living

5061
02:40:22,559 --> 02:40:25,600
and what have they done in the past i

5062
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:27,040
mean the answer is one gets shoe

5063
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:28,720
salesmen

5064
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:32,000
task drivers

5065
02:40:28,719 --> 02:40:32,719
uh surgeons all in one guy yeah yeah

5066
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,239
i mean

5067
02:40:32,719 --> 02:40:35,760
i mean that's not just afghan but that's

5068
02:40:34,239 --> 02:40:37,840
you know that that's very common but

5069
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:38,800
it's also russia is the same that's

5070
02:40:37,840 --> 02:40:41,359
right i think it's right whenever

5071
02:40:38,799 --> 02:40:43,519
there's complexities to the economic

5072
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:45,600
system and that's right a short term and

5073
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:48,079
the long term history of how the country

5074
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:49,920
develops and it's basically the people

5075
02:40:48,079 --> 02:40:51,039
figuring out their way

5076
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:54,559
around

5077
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:58,240
a mess of a country politically yeah but

5078
02:40:54,559 --> 02:41:00,000
a uh beautiful flourishing culture and

5079
02:40:58,239 --> 02:41:02,799
humanity yeah and that that creates

5080
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,879
super interesting people yeah yeah so we

5081
02:41:02,799 --> 02:41:06,559
can often see okay there's taliban

5082
02:41:04,879 --> 02:41:09,438
there's war there's

5083
02:41:06,559 --> 02:41:11,119
uh economic malfunction

5084
02:41:09,439 --> 02:41:12,720
there's harboring of terrorists there's

5085
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:14,399
opium trade all that kind of stuff but

5086
02:41:12,719 --> 02:41:15,760
there's humans there with deep

5087
02:41:14,398 --> 02:41:17,199
intellectual

5088
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:20,239
lies

5089
02:41:17,200 --> 02:41:23,359
uh and uh like i love the movie love

5090
02:41:20,239 --> 02:41:25,600
crimes and the same kind of uh hopes

5091
02:41:23,359 --> 02:41:27,840
fears and desire to love

5092
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:31,359
the the old romeo and juliet story and i

5093
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:32,719
think roomie to me represents that

5094
02:41:31,359 --> 02:41:35,760
the wit

5095
02:41:32,719 --> 02:41:38,478
the intelligence but also the

5096
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:40,960
just eloquent and just beautiful

5097
02:41:38,478 --> 02:41:41,840
representation of humanity of love some

5098
02:41:40,959 --> 02:41:43,679
of the

5099
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:46,719
some of the best quotes about love are

5100
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:48,880
