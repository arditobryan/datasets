00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,399
richard rangham a biological

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,480
anthropologist at harvard specializing

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,120
in the study of primates and the

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,679
evolution of violence sex

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,399
cooking culture and other aspects of ape

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,160
and human behavior at the individual and

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,239
societal level

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,399
he began his career over four decades

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,640
ago working with jane goodall and

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:26,799
studying the behavior of chimps and

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,760
since then has done a lot of seminal

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,160
work on human evolution and has proposed

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,120
several theories for the roles of fire

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,839
and violence in the evolution of us

16
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,439
hairless apes otherwise known as homo

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680

00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:49,920
in the description and now here's my

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,239
conversation with richard wrangham

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,359
you've said that we are much less

23
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,878
violent than our close living relatives

24
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,198
the chimps

25
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:01,759
can you elaborate on this point

26
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:04,319
of how violent we are and how violent

27
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,158
our evolutionary relatives are

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,399
well i haven't said exactly that we're

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,200
less violent than chimps what i've said

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,200
is that there are two kinds of violence

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,439
one stems from proactive aggression and

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
the other stems from reactive aggression

33
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,879
proactive aggression is planned

34
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,599
aggression reactive aggression is

35
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,039
impulsive defensive it's reactive

36
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,199
because

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,759
it takes place in

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,439
seconds after the threat

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,000
and the thing that is really striking

40
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,758
about humans compared to

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,159
our close relatives

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:41,040
is the great reduction in the degree of

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,118
of reactive aggression so we are far

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,079
less violent than chimps

45
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,560
when

46
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,199
prompted by some relatively minor threat

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,320
within our own society and the way i

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,399
judge that

49
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,359
is um with not super satisfactory data

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,799
but

51
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,359
the

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,640
the study which is particularly striking

53
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,159
is

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,079
one of

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,079
people living as

56
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,118
hunter-gatherers in

57
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,639
a really

58
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:13,039
um upsetting kind of environment namely

59
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,399
um people in australia

60
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:19,039
living in a place where

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,680
they got a lot of alcohol abuse

62
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,199
there's a lot of domestic violence

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,719
it's all

64
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,919
a sort of

65
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,759
a a society that is um

66
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,439
you know as bad from the point of view

67
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,000
of violence as

68
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,639
an ordinary society can get

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,639
there's excellent data on the frequency

70
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,719
with which people actually have physical

71
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,159
violence and hit each other and we can

72
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,439
compare that to

73
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,159
data from

74
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,840
several different sites comparing we're

75
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,439
looking at chimpanzee and bonobo

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,519
violence and the

77
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,280
difference is uh between two and three

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,719
orders of magnitude

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,719
the frequency with which chimps and

80
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,080
bonobos hit each other chase each other

81
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,080
charge each other

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,920
uh physically engage

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,480
is something between 500 and 1000 times

84
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,318
uh higher than in humans so there's

85
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,238
something just amazing about us and you

86
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,518
know this has been recognized for for

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,519
centuries uh aristotle drew attention to

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,360
the fact that we behave in many ways

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,200
like domesticated animals because we're

90
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,040
so unviolent

91
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,280
but you know

92
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:28,000
people say well what about you know the

93
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
hideous engagements of this

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,519
20th century

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,519
the the first and second world war and

96
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,719
and much else besides

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,039
and

98
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,239
that is all proactive violence you know

99
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,798
all of that is

100
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,158
is gangs of people

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,840
uh

102
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:45,039
making deliberate decisions to go off an

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
attack

104
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,000
in circumstances which ideally uh the

105
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,799
attackers are going to be able to make

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,438
their

107
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,719
kills and then get out of there

108
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,639
in other words not

109
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,719
face confrontation that's the ordinary

110
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,479
way that arm is trying to work

111
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,598
and um

112
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,518
and there

113
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,000
it turns out that uh humans and

114
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,640
chimpanzees are in a very similar kind

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,519
of state that's to say if you look at

116
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,399
the

117
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,319
the rate of death from chimpanzees

118
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,599
conducting proactive coalitionary

119
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,399
violence

120
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,238
it's very similar in many ways to what

121
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,319
you see in humans

122
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,638
so when not down regulated with

123
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,560
proactive violence it's just this

124
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,960
reactive violence that is

125
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,759
strikingly reduced in humans

126
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,918
so chimpanzees also practice kind of

127
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,919
tribal warfare

128
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,879
indeed they do yeah

129
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,839
so this was discovered first in 1974 it

130
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,240
was observed first 974.

131
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,119
which was about the time that

132
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
um

133
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,199
the

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,279
first

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,040
major study of chimpanzees in the wild

136
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,279
by jane goodall

137
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,439
had been going for

138
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,799
something like five years

139
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,478
during

140
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,478
of

141
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,879
the chimpanzees being observed wherever

142
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,439
they went

143
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,759
until then they'd been observed

144
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,079
at a feeding station where jane was

145
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
luring them into

146
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,800
to be observed by seeing bananas which

147
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,119
is great

148
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,560
she learned a lot but she didn't learn

149
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,759
what was happening at the edges of their

150
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,399
ranges

151
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,600
so five years later

152
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,599
it became

153
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,520
very obvious that there was hostile

154
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,000
relationships between groups

155
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,359
and those hostile relationships

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,918
sometimes

157
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,199
take the form of the kind of hostile

158
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,799
relationships that you see in many

159
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,879
animals which is a bunch of

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,240
chimps in this case uh

161
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,800
shouting uh at a bunch of other chimps

162
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,360
uh on their borders

163
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,199
but dramatically in addition to that

164
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,800
there is a second kind of interaction

165
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,600
and that is

166
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,918
when

167
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,439
a a party of chimpanzees

168
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,478
makes a

169
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,240
deliberate venture uh to the edge of

170
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,000
their territory

171
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,439
silently

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and then

173
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,160
search for members of neighboring groups

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,600
and what they're searching for is a lone

175
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,639
individual

176
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,400
so i've been with chimps when they've

177
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,680
heard a lone individual under these

178
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,399
circumstances

179
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,560
or what they think is a lone one and

180
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,959
they touch each other and look at each

181
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,439
other and then charge forward

182
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,799
very excited

183
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,719
and then

184
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,639
while they're charging

185
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,440
all of a sudden

186
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,600
the place where they heard a lone call

187
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,719
erupts with a volley of calls it was

188
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,680
just one calling out of a larger party

189
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,600
and our chimps put on the brakes and

190
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,560
scoot back for safety into their own

191
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,039
territory but if in fact they do find a

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,399
lone individual and they they can sneak

193
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,800
up to them

194
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,159
then they make a deliberate attack uh

195
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,240
they're hunting

196
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,800
they're stalking and hunting and and

197
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,879
then they impose terrible damage which

198
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,280
typically ends in a kill straight away

199
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,279
but it might end up with the victim

200
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,439
so damaged that they'll crawl away and

201
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,279
die a few days

202
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,199
or hours later

203
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,799
so that was a very dramatic discovery

204
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,319
because it really

205
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,038
made people

206
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,720
realize for the first time that conrad

207
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:28,240
lorenz had been wrong when in the 1960s

208
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,199
in his famous book on aggression he said

209
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,120
warfare is restricted to humans animals

210
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,319
do not deliberately kill each other well

211
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,840
now we know that actually there's a

212
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,919
bunch of animals that deliberately kill

213
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,758
each other and they always do so under

214
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:40,560
essentially the same circumstances which

215
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,038
is

216
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,240
when they feel safe doing it so humans

217
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,159
feel safe doing it when they got a

218
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,360
weapon

219
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,240
animals

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,720
feel safe when they have a coalition

221
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,360
a coalition that has overwhelming power

222
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,360
compared to the victim and so wolves

223
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,680
will do that and lions will do that and

224
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,199
hyenas will do that and chimpanzees will

225
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,199
do it and and humans do it too

226
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,598
can they pull themselves

227
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,120
into something that looks more like a

228
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,079
symmetric war as opposed to an

229
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,519
asymmetric one so accidentally engaging

230
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,120
on the lone individual and getting

231
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,159
themselves into trouble

232
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,319
are they more aggressive in avoiding

233
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,599
these kinds of battles no they're very

234
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,080
very keen to avoid those kinds of

235
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,800
battles but occasionally

236
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,680
they can make a mistake

237
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,879
but

238
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
so far

239
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,879
there have been no observations of

240
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,000
anything like a battle in which both

241
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:40,158
sides maintain themselves and

242
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,038
i think you can very confidently say

243
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:42,718
that

244
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,319
overwhelmingly what happens is that if

245
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,640
they discover that there's several

246
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,080
individuals on the other side then both

247
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,080
sides retreat

248
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
nobody wants to get hurt

249
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,399
what they want to do is to hurt others

250
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,399
yes so you mentioned jane goodall

251
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,159
you've worked with her

252
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,879
what was it like working with her what

253
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,958
have you learned from her

254
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:06,159
well she's a wonderfully independent

255
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,119
um courageous person you know who

256
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,679
she

257
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,639
famously began her studies

258
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,479
not as a qualified person

259
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,159
in terms of

260
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,959
education

261
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,639
but

262
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,399
qualified only by enthusiasm and

263
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,199
considerable experience even in her

264
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,159
early 20s with nature

265
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,160
uh

266
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,559
so she's courageous in the sense of

267
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,919
being able to you know take on our

268
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,919
challenges

269
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,838
the thing that is very impressive about

270
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,799
her is

271
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,399
her

272
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:43,838
total fidelity to the observations

273
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,720
uh very unwilling to extend

274
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,720
uh beyond the observations uh we know

275
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,839
waiting until they mount up and you've

276
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
really got a confident picture

277
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,278
and

278
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,799
tremendous attention to

279
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,600
individuals

280
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,439
so

281
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,360
you know that was an interesting problem

282
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,839
from her point of view because

283
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,200
when she got to know the chimpanzees

284
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,480
of of gombe this particular community of

285
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,200
casa kayla about 60 individuals

286
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,839
oh so gombe was in tanzania on

287
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,120
lake tanganyika she was there initially

288
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,120
with her mother and then alone for

289
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
two or three years of really intense

290
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,159
observation

291
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:28,000
and then slowly joined by other people

292
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,319
what um

293
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,399
what she discovered was that there were

294
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,720
obvious differences in

295
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,278
individual personality and the

296
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,079
difficulty about that was that

297
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,200
when she reported this to

298
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,439
uh

299
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,640
the largest scientific world initially

300
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,440
her advisors at cambridge

301
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,799
uh

302
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
they said well you know we don't know

303
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,759
how to handle that because uh you've got

304
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,360
to treat all these animals as the same

305
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,600
basically because

306
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,200
um

307
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,839
there is no

308
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,720
research tradition of thinking about

309
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,760
personalities well now

310
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,320
whatever it is 60 years later

311
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,838
the study of personalities is

312
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,480
is a very rich part of the study animal

313
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,880
behavior

314
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
at any rate the important point in terms

315
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,759
of you know what was she like is that

316
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,000
she stuck to her guns and she absolutely

317
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,360
insisted that you know we have to

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,480
show

319
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,240
describe in great detail the differences

320
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,440
in personality among these individuals

321
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,959
and then you can leave it to the

322
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,640
evolutionary biologist to think about

323
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,039
what it means

324
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,039
so what is the process of observation

325
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,679
like this

326
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,519
like observing the personality but also

327
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,479
observing in a way

328
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,440
that's not projecting your beliefs about

329
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,639
human nature or animal nature onto

330
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,360
chimps

331
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,838
which is probably really tempting

332
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,399
to project so your understanding of the

333
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,760
way the human world works projecting

334
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,278
that onto

335
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,879
the chimp world

336
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,320
yes i mean it's particularly difficult

337
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,039
with chimps because chimps are so

338
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,240
similar to humans in their behavior

339
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:07,599
that it's very

340
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,639
easy

341
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,278
to make those projections as you say

342
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,680
the process involves

343
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,919
making very clear definitions of of what

344
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:20,319
a behavior is

345
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:23,039
you know aggression

346
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,639
can be defined in terms of

347
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:29,039
a forceful hit a byte and so on

348
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,240
and uh writing down every time these

349
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,078
things happen

350
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,320
and then slowly totting up the numbers

351
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,719
of times that they happen uh you know

352
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,959
from individual a towards individuals b

353
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,120
c d and e

354
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,359
so that you build up a very concrete

355
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,278
picture rather than interpreting at any

356
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,320
point and stopping and saying well you

357
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,559
know they seem to be rather aggressive

358
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,560
so the

359
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,799
sort of formal system is that you build

360
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,078
up a pattern of the relationships based

361
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,559
on

362
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,638
a description of the different types of

363
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,319
interactions the aggressive and the

364
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,278
friendly interactions

365
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,600
um and all of these are defined in

366
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,320
concrete

367
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,800
and

368
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,240
so that from that you extract a pattern

369
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,599
of relationships

370
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,919
and the relationships uh can be defined

371
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,920
as

372
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,480
relatively friendly relatively uh

373
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,359
aggressive competitive uh based on the

374
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,680
frequency of these types of interactions

375
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,000
and so one can talk in terms of

376
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,319
uh individuals having

377
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,839
a relationship which uh on the scores of

378
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,199
friendliness is

379
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,079
two standard deviations outside the mean

380
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,799
i mean

381
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:45,519
you know it's in which direction sorry

382
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,278
uh in both directions

383
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,198
well i mean you know there will be

384
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,919
obviously the friendly ones would be the

385
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:54,319
ones who have exceptionally high rates

386
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,559
of uh spending time close to each other

387
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,040
of touching each other in a gentle way

388
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,958
of grooming each other

389
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,278
and by the way finding that those things

390
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,078
are correlated with each other

391
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,159
so

392
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,638
it's possible to define

393
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:12,159
a friendship with a capital f in a very

394
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,680
systematic way and and to compare that

395
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,719
uh between

396
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,638
uh individuals but also between

397
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,959
communities of chimpanzees

398
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,480
and between different species

399
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,479
so that you know we can say that in some

400
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,720
species individuals have friends and

401
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,480
others they don't at all

402
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
what about just because there's

403
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,399
different personalities and because

404
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,399
they're so fascinating what about sort

405
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,120
of falling in love or

406
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,639
forming friendships with chimps you know

407
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,320
like really

408
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:45,278
you know um connecting with them

409
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,120
as an observer what what role does that

410
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,600
play because you're tracking these

411
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,159
individuals that are full of life and

412
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,440
intelligence from for

413
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,240
long periods of time plus as a human

414
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,279
especially in those days for jane she's

415
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,000
alone

416
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,639
observing it he gets lonely as a human i

417
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,320
mean probably deeply lonely as a human

418
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,600
being observe these other intelligent

419
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,959
species

420
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,560
it's a very reasonable question and of

421
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:15,119
course jane in those early years i think

422
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,919
she's willing now to talk about the fact

423
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,799
that

424
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,479
uh she regrets to some extent how close

425
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,120
she became

426
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
um and the problem is not just from the

427
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,879
humans the problem is from the

428
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,759
chimpanzees as well because

429
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,559
they do things that are

430
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,680
extremely affectionate if you like

431
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,039
you know

432
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,319
at one point

433
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,599
jane

434
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,079
offered a a ripe fruit

435
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,560
to a chimpanzee called david greybeard

436
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,439
david greybeard um

437
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,278
took it and squeezed her hand

438
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,120
as if to say thank you and then i think

439
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:51,439
he gave it back if i remember rightly

440
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,440
yeah

441
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,959
[Laughter]

442
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,000
no thank you

443
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,119
right

444
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
um

445
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,159
oh it's almost like thank you and uh

446
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,320
returning the affection by giving the

447
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,240
food yeah if if they didn't you know it

448
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,000
was a gentle squeeze yeah i mean

449
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,639
chimpanzees could squeeze you very hard

450
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,159
as that occasionally has happened

451
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,560
um some chimps are aggressive to people

452
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,240
um and others are friendly

453
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,039
and the ones that are friendly tend to

454
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,440
be rather sympathetic characters because

455
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,919
they might be ones who are having

456
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,040
problems in their own society

457
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:31,120
you know so jomio in gombe used to uh

458
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,559
come and sit next to me quite often

459
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,399
um and

460
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,078
he was having a hard time making it in

461
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,919
that society you know which i can

462
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,359
describe to you in terms of the number

463
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,319
of aggressive interactions if you want

464
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,199
you know but

465
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,560
um just to be informed about it

466
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,198
so

467
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,039
all of this is a temptation to be very

468
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:49,919
firmly resisted

469
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,360
and

470
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,439
in the community that i've been working

471
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,399
with in uganda for the last 30 years we

472
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
try

473
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,399
extremely hard to impress on all of the

474
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,278
research students who come with us that

475
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,360
it is absolutely vital that you do not

476
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,318
fall into that temptation now you know

477
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,199
we heard a story of one person who did

478
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:12,159
reach out and touch one of our chimps

479
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,199
it's a very very bad idea

480
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,400
not because the chimp is going to

481
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,600
do anything violent at the time

482
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,038
but because

483
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,480
if they learn

484
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:26,240
that humans are as weak uh physically as

485
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,838
we are compared to them then they can

486
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,880
take advantage of it

487
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,879
us and that's what happened in gambi so

488
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,120
after jane had

489
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,600
done the um you know very obvious thing

490
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,719
when you're first engaged in this

491
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,119
game

492
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,038
of uh allowing the infants to approach

493
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,359
her and then tickling them and playing

494
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,279
with them

495
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,038
some of those infants

496
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,519
had the personality

497
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,200
of wanting to take advantage of that

498
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,440
knowledge later

499
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,038
and so you know you had an individual

500
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,440
frodo who was

501
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,879
um violent on a regular basis towards

502
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,160
humans when he was an adult and he was

503
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,160
quite dangerous i mean he could easily

504
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,480
have killed someone in fact he did kill

505
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,000
on one person he killed a baby

506
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,160
that he he took from a mother a human

507
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,119
baby that he took off her hip when he

508
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,679
met her on the path

509
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,038
so it's a reminder that we're dealing

510
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,400
with

511
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,119
a species

512
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,360
that are rather human-like in the range

513
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,399
of emotions they have in the capacities

514
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,558
they have and even uh in the strength

515
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,440
they have they are uh

516
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,200
you know

517
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,038
in many ways stronger than humans so

518
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,038
it's uh

519
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,279
you you've got to be careful

520
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,679
in the full range of friendliness and

521
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,000
violence the capacity for these

522
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,480
very human things

523
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,160
yes i mean it's it's very obvious with

524
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,279
with violence as we talked about you

525
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,120
know that

526
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,319
they will kill they will kill not just

527
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,199
strangers

528
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,240
um

529
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,120
they can

530
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,519
kill

531
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,519
other adults within their own group uh

532
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,119
they can kill babies that are strangers

533
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,879
they can kill babies in their own group

534
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,319
so you know they're

535
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,240
this is a long-lived individual

536
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,599
obviously these killings can't have very

537
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,480
often because otherwise they'd all be

538
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,279
dead

539
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,679
um

540
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,480
and uh we're now finding that they can

541
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,080
live to 50 or 60 years in the wild at

542
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,679
relatively low population density

543
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,839
because they're big animals eating a

544
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,120
rather specialized kind of food the ripe

545
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,240
fruits

546
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,079
um

547
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,000
so it doesn't happen all the time with

548
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,399
friendliness

549
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,400
they are very strong to support each

550
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,559
other they very much depend on their um

551
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,280
their close friendships

552
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,798
which they express through

553
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,558
physical contact

554
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,519
and particularly through through

555
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:42,798
grooming

556
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,720
so grooming

557
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,440
occurs when one individual approaches

558
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,679
another i might present

559
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,720
for grooming a very common way of

560
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,038
starting

561
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,400
turning their back or presenting an arm

562
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,319
or something like that and the other

563
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,759
just riffles their fingers through the

564
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,399
hair

565
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:04,240
and that's partly just soothing

566
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,720
and it's partly uh looking for parasites

567
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,200
but mostly it's just soothing yes and

568
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,720
and the point about this is it can go on

569
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,600
for uh

570
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,279
half an hour it can go on for sometimes

571
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,439
even an hour

572
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:21,200
so this is amazing you know a major

573
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,279
expression of interest in somebody else

574
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,720
when did your interest

575
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,798
in this one particular aspects of jim

576
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,640
come to be which is violence

577
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,679
when did the study of violence and

578
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,520
chimps

579
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,679
uh become something you're deeply

580
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,038
interested in

581
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,360
well

582
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:43,919
um for my phd in the early 1970s

583
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,079
i was in gombe with jane goodall and was

584
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,120
studying feeding behavior

585
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:52,000
but during that time we were seeing and

586
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,479
i say uh we because there were uh half a

587
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,440
dozen research students uh all

588
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,400
uh in her camp

589
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,080
um

590
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,120
we were discovering

591
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:06,480
that uh chimps had this capacity for

592
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,639
for violence um the first kill happened

593
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,720
during that time which was of an infant

594
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
and a neighboring group

595
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,679
um

596
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,839
and we were starting to see these uh

597
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,360
hunting

598
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:19,279
expeditions and this was

599
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,158
the start of my interest because it was

600
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,720
such

601
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,039
chilling evidence of

602
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,079
an extraordinary similarity between

603
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,240
chimps

604
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,399
and humans

605
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,240
now at that time

606
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,559
we didn't know very much

607
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,079
about how chimpanzees and humans were

608
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,839
related

609
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,519
chimps gorillas

610
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,918
bonobos are all

611
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,558
three big black hairy things that live

612
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,400
in the african forests and

613
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,879
eat fruits and

614
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,480
leaves when they can't find fruits

615
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,840
and walk on their knuckles and they all

616
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,519
look rather similar to each other so

617
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,519
they seem as though

618
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,000
those three species chimps and gorillas

619
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,839
and bonobos should all be each other's

620
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,159
closest relatives and humans are

621
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,720
something rather separate and so any of

622
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,640
them will be of interest to us

623
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,960
subsequently we learn

624
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,640
that actually that's not true and that

625
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,200
there's a special relationship between

626
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,559
humans and chimpanzees

627
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,720
but at the time

628
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,038
even without knowing that it was obvious

629
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,200
that there was something very odd about

630
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,079
chimpanzees because

631
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,279
jane had discovered they were making

632
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,879
tools

633
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:31,279
she had seen that they were hunting meat

634
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,080
she had seen that they were sharing the

635
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:36,319
meat among each other she had seen that

636
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,879
the societies were dominated politically

637
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,798
by males coalitions of males all of

638
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,960
these things of course resonate so

639
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,960
closely with humans

640
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,159
and then it turns out

641
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,480
that

642
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,840
in contrast to conventional wisdom at

643
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,038
the time

644
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,558
the chimpanzees were capable of hunting

645
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,558
and killing members of neighbouring

646
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,440
groups

647
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,879
well

648
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,200
at that point

649
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,400
the similarities between chimps and

650
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,360
humans

651
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,600
become less a matter of

652
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,038
sort of you know sheer intellectual

653
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,798
fascination

654
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,558
than something that has a really deep

655
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,440
meaning about

656
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,038
our understanding of ourselves

657
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,000
i mean until then

658
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,960
you can

659
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,200
cheerfully think of humans as a species

660
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,679
apart from the rest of nature because we

661
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,038
are so peculiar but when it turns out

662
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,200
that

663
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,599
as it turns out one of our two closest

664
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,720
relatives

665
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:36,719
has got these features that we share

666
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,798
and that one of the features is

667
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,558
something that is the most horrendous

668
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,278
as well as fascinating

669
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:47,200
aspect of human behavior then you know

670
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:48,839
how can you resist just

671
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,519
you know trying to find out what's going

672
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,519
on so i have to say this

673
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:57,200
i'm not sure if you're familiar with a

674
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,798
man but fans of this podcast are so

675
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,679
we're talking about chimps we're talking

676
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,720
about violence my now friend mr joe

677
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,880
rogan

678
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,880
is a big fan of those things i'm a big

679
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,000
fan of these topics i think a lot of

680
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,559
people

681
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,400
are fascinated by these topics so as

682
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:13,599
you're saying

683
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,798
why

684
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,678
do we

685
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:20,879
find the exploration of violence and the

686
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:25,440
relations between chimps so interesting

687
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,440
what can they teach us about ourselves

688
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,759
until we had this information about

689
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,720
chimpanzees

690
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,158
it was possible to believe

691
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,079
that

692
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,440
the

693
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,879
psychology

694
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,240
behind warfare

695
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,080
was

696
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,640
totally the result of some kind of um

697
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:50,399
cultural recent cultural innovation

698
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,400
right that had nothing to do with our

699
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,840
biology

700
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,679
or if you like that it's got something

701
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,000
to do with uh

702
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,798
sin and and garden

703
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,240
the devil and that sort of thing

704
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,240
but what the chimps tell us

705
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,079
after we

706
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
think carefully about it

707
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,399
is that

708
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,440
it seems undoubtedly the case that

709
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,200
our evolutionary psychology

710
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,400
has

711
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,600
given us

712
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,679
the same

713
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:26,399
kind of attitude towards violence as

714
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,278
has occurred in chimpanzees

715
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,440
and in both species uh it has evolved

716
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,960
because of its uh evolutionary

717
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,240
significance in other words because it's

718
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,840
been helpful to the individuals who have

719
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,120
practiced it

720
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,038
and

721
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,119
now we know that

722
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,000
as i mentioned other species do this as

723
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,319
well

724
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,599
in fact you know wolves

725
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,240
um

726
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,439
which this is a really kind of

727
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
ironical

728
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,038
observation

729
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,038
uh conrad lorenz who i mentioned had

730
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,240
been the person who thought that

731
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:59,519
human

732
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,120
aggression

733
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,158
in the form of killing members of our

734
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,000
own species was unique to our species he

735
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,200
was a great fan of wolves he studied

736
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,519
wolves and in captivity he noted that

737
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,840
wolves are very unlikely to harm each

738
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,038
other in um

739
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,278
spats

740
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,558
among members of the same group

741
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,240
what happens is that one of them will

742
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:23,278
roll over and present their neck much as

743
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,359
you see in a dog park nowadays and and

744
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,599
the other uh might put their jaws on the

745
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,278
neck but will not bite

746
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,839
okay so now it turns out that if you

747
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:35,200
studied wolves in the wild

748
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,639
then neighboring packs often go hunting

749
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,278
for each other

750
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,200
they are in fierce competition

751
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:45,200
and uh as much as 50 of the mortality of

752
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,240
wolves is due to being killed by other

753
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,038
wolves

754
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,120
adult mortality wow so it's a really

755
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:54,558
serious business

756
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:57,119
the chimpanzees and humans uh fit into a

757
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,519
larger pattern of understanding animals

758
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,519
in which

759
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:05,038
you don't have an instinct for violence

760
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,679
what you have is an instinct if you like

761
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:10,558
to use violence adaptively

762
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,080
and if the right circumstances come up

763
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:14,639
it'll be adaptive if the right

764
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,599
circumstances don't come up it won't be

765
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,759
so some chimpanzee communities are much

766
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,038
more violent than others because of

767
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,398
things like

768
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:27,200
the frequency with which a large party

769
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:29,278
of males is likely to meet us a lone

770
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,759
victim and that's going to depend on the

771
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:34,558
local ecology

772
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:36,000
but you know so the overall

773
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,359
answer to the question of what did

774
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,159
chimps teach us is that we have to take

775
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:46,558
very seriously the notion that in humans

776
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,679
the tendency to

777
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,558
make war

778
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,679
is a consequence of a long-term

779
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:56,319
evolutionary adaptation and not just a

780
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,399
military ideology or some you know sort

781
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:02,558
of local patriarchal phenomenon um and

782
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:05,759
of course you know his a reading of

783
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:07,918
history a judicious reading of history

784
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,640
fits that very easily because

785
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,080
war is so commonplace

786
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,480
it's not an accident so it's not a

787
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:17,439
construction of human civilization

788
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,558
it's uh it's deeply within us violence

789
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,240
so what

790
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,519
what's the difference between violence

791
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,839
on the individual level versus group

792
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,240
is um it seems like with chimps and with

793
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,439
wolves there's something about

794
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,240
the dynamic of multiple

795
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,919
uh

796
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,319
chimps together

797
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,720
that increase the chance of violence or

798
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,879
is is violence still

799
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,600
fundamentally part of the individual

800
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,720
like what would an individual be

801
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,839
as violent as they might be as part of a

802
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,480
group

803
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:53,678
if we're talking about uh killing

804
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:57,440
okay then um violence in the sense of

805
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,798
killing is very much associated with

806
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,480
a group

807
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,720
and the reason is

808
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,599
that individuals

809
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,558
don't benefit by getting into a fight in

810
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:11,599
which they risk being hurt themselves

811
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,558
so it's only when you have overwhelming

812
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,798
power

813
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,720
that the temptation to try and kill

814
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,000
another victim

815
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,079
rises

816
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,519
sufficiently for them to be motivated to

817
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,278
do it

818
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,639
the

819
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,679
the average

820
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,480
number of chimpanzee males

821
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,278
that attack a single male

822
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,278
in

823
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,919
something like 50 observations that have

824
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,319
accumulated in the last 50 years

825
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,080
from various different study sites

826
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,759
is eight

827
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:45,119
eight to one

828
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,640
now sometimes it can go as low as uh

829
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:49,278
three to one

830
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,960
but that's a that's getting risky

831
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:53,519
but if you have eight you can see what

832
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,079
can happen i mean basically uh

833
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,679
you have one male on one foot another

834
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,599
male another foot another male and an

835
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,399
arm another male another arm

836
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,879
now you have an immobilized victim

837
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,959
with uh four individuals capable of just

838
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,880
doing the damage and so they can then

839
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,278
move in and tear out his thorax and tear

840
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,480
off his testicles and and twist an arm

841
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:18,319
until it breaks and uh and do this you

842
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,319
know appalling damage with no weapons

843
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,759
what is uh

844
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,519
the way in which they prefer

845
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,440
to commit the violence

846
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,798
is there something to be said about like

847
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,200
the actual

848
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:31,038
process of it is there an artistry to it

849
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,319
so if you look at human

850
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,079
warfare

851
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:36,319
there's different parts in history

852
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,678
preferred different kind of approaches

853
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:39,839
to violence

854
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,159
it had more to do with tools i think on

855
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,959
the human side but

856
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,600
just the nature of violence itself sorry

857
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,240
the practice the strategy of violence is

858
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,158
it basically the same you improvise you

859
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,278
immobilize the uh

860
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,880
the victim

861
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:56,640
and they just rip off different parts of

862
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,200
their body kind of thing

863
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,120
yeah you have to understand that

864
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,480
these things are happening at high speed

865
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,278
in thick vegetation yes mostly so that

866
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,599
they

867
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:12,240
they have not been filmed uh carefully

868
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:14,798
you know we we have a few

869
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,640
little glimpses of them from uh

870
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,558
one or two people like david watts so

871
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,559
he's got some great video but

872
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,319
uh we don't know enough to be able to to

873
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,119
say that it's hard for me to imagine

874
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:28,319
that there are styles that vary between

875
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:32,158
um communities you know cultural styles

876
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,759
but it is possible on one thing that is

877
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,559
striking is that

878
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,558
the

879
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,678
number of times that an individual

880
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:42,319
victim has been killed immediately

881
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,120
uh has been higher in

882
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,839
uh kibali forest in uganda

883
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,678
than in in gombe national park in

884
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,759
tanzania it's conceivable that's just

885
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,720
chance we don't have real numbers now

886
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,960
but

887
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,038
was this um i can't remember exact

888
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,000
numbers but you know 10 versus

889
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:02,319
15 or something um

890
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,200
so maybe

891
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,960
they

892
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,600
damage to the point of

893
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,600
uh expecting a death in one place and

894
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,038
they just finish it off in the other but

895
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,439
most likely

896
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,599
that sort of difference will be due to

897
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,038
differences in the numbers of

898
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,959
attackers

899
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:21,599
you know human beings are able to

900
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,399
conceive of the philosophical notion of

901
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:28,719
death of mortality is there any of that

902
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,558
for chimps

903
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,360
when they're thinking about violence is

904
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:35,359
violence like what what is the nature

905
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,319
of their conception of violence do you

906
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,319
think

907
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,639
do they do they realize they're taking

908
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:44,319
another conscious being's

909
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,720
life or is it some kind of

910
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:50,240
like optimization over the use of

911
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,240
resources or something like that

912
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,720
i i don't think it's i can't think of

913
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,000
any way to get an answer to the question

914
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,200
of what they know about that um

915
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,278
i think that

916
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,278
uh the way to think about

917
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,159
the motivation

918
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:06,558
is

919
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,679
uh rather like

920
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,398
the motivation in sex

921
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,320
so

922
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,479
when males are

923
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,720
interested in having sex with a female

924
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,558
whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans

925
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,839
they don't think about the fact that

926
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,119
what this is going to do is to lead to a

927
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:26,480
baby mostly

928
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,079
you're right mostly what they're

929
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,839
thinking about is i want to get my

930
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:31,359
underway

931
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,519
and um

932
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,918
i think that that's a similar kind of

933
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,120
process uh with the gems you know what

934
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,519
they are thinking about is i i want to

935
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:45,038
kill this yes individual

936
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,720
and it's hard to imagine that

937
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,640
taking the other individual's

938
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,720
perspective and thinking about what it

939
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,399
means for them to die is going to be an

940
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,759
important part of that in fact

941
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:54,959
you know there's reasons to think it

942
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,640
should not be an important part of it

943
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,919
because it might inhibit them and they

944
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,559
don't want to be inhibited you know the

945
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,399
more efficient they are in doing this

946
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,678
the better but you know i think it's

947
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,839
interesting to think about this whole

948
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,840
motivational question because it does

949
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,480
produce a rather haunting thought that

950
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:16,960
there has been selection in favor of

951
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:20,719
enthusiasm about killing

952
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,679
and in our

953
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,480
relatively gentle and uh deliberately

954
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,480
moral society that we have today

955
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,240
it's very difficult for us to face the

956
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,199
thought that

957
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,319
in

958
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,559
all of us

959
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,599
there might have been a

960
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,398
a

961
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,280
re

962
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:42,239
residue and a more than that sort of an

963
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,280
actively uh an active potential

964
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,519
for that thought of really enjoying

965
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,800
killing someone else

966
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,280
but

967
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,440
i i think you know one can sustain that

968
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,000
thought fairly obviously by

969
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,838
thinking of circumstances in which

970
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,559
it would be true

971
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:04,078
that the ordinary

972
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:06,639
human male would be delighted to be part

973
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,039
of a group that was killing someone what

974
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:11,519
you've got to do is to

975
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:14,239
be in a position where you're regarding

976
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,119
the victim as dangerous

977
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,598
and

978
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,880
thoroughly hostile

979
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,119
but the pure enjoyment of violence

980
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,320
there's uh i don't know if you know this

981
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,960
historian dan carlin he has a podcast he

982
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,039
has an episode

983
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,280
three four hour

984
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,880
episode that i recommend to others it's

985
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,040
quite haunting

986
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,720
but he takes us through an entire

987
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:43,599
history uh it's called painful tainment

988
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,358
the uh the history of

989
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,160
humans

990
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:51,119
enjoying the murder of others in a large

991
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:53,519
group so like public executions were

992
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,480
part of long part of human history

993
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,480
and there's something that

994
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:03,199
for some reason humans seem to have been

995
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,358
drawn to just watching others die

996
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,598
and he ventures to say that that may

997
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:11,279
still be part of us for example he said

998
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,440
if it was possible to televise

999
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,000
to stream online for example the

1000
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,000
execution and the murder of somebody or

1001
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,960
even the torture of somebody

1002
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,599
that

1003
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,519
a very large fraction of

1004
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,680
the population on earth would not be

1005
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,719
able to look away they'd be drawn to

1006
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,679
that somehow as a very dark

1007
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,519
thought

1008
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,358
that we were drawn to that

1009
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,639
so you think that's part of us in there

1010
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,440
somewhere that

1011
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:40,480
selection that we evolved for the

1012
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,960
enjoyment of killing and the enjoyment

1013
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,240
of observing

1014
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,400
uh

1015
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,239
those in our tribe

1016
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,720
doing the killing

1017
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,838
yes i mean and that word you produced at

1018
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,879
the end is critical i think you know

1019
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,799
because uh

1020
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,240
it would be a little bit weird i think

1021
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,680
uh to

1022
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,679
imagine

1023
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,598
a lot of enjoyment about

1024
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,199
people in your own tribe being killed

1025
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,280
right yeah i i don't think we're

1026
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,838
interested in violence for violence's

1027
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,920
sake that much

1028
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,358
it's um

1029
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,280
it's when you get these social

1030
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,400
boundaries set up

1031
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,160
and

1032
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,760
in today's world

1033
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:20,838
you know happily

1034
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,400
uh

1035
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:25,599
we kind of are already one world

1036
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,320
you know we

1037
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,440
you have to dehumanize someone to get to

1038
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,240
the point where they are really outside

1039
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,599
you know our recognition of a tribe at

1040
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:37,279
some level which is you know the whole

1041
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,640
human species

1042
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,480
but in

1043
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,759
uh ancient times that would not have

1044
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,519
been true because in ancient times

1045
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,200
there are lots of accounts of hunters

1046
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,239
and gatherers uh

1047
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:51,838
in which

1048
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:53,439
the appearance of a stranger

1049
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,440
would lead to

1050
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,358
an immediate response of

1051
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,559
shooting on site

1052
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:03,119
because what was human was the people

1053
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:05,199
that were in your society

1054
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,280
and the other things that actually

1055
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,559
looked like us and you know were human

1056
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,440
in that sense were not regarded as human

1057
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,119
so there was a kind of automatic

1058
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,200
dehumanization of everybody that didn't

1059
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,599
speak our language or hadn't already

1060
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:22,399
somehow become

1061
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,920
recognized as uh

1062
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,000
sufficiently like us to escape the

1063
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,079
the dehumanization context and so

1064
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,440
hopefully the story of human history is

1065
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,640
that we

1066
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,119
are

1067
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,159
that tribalism fades away

1068
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,240
that our

1069
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:41,759
dehumanization the natural desire to

1070
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:44,078
dehumanize or a tendency to dehumanize

1071
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,960
groups that are not within this tribe

1072
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,119
decreases over time and so then

1073
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,960
the desire for violence decreases over

1074
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,838
time yeah i mean that that's the

1075
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,320
optimistic perspective and uh and the

1076
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,279
the great sort of concern of course is

1077
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,440
that

1078
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,519
um small conflicts can build up into

1079
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,639
bigger conflicts and then dehumanization

1080
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:06,639
happens and then violence is released

1081
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:09,598
as hannah aaron says you know there

1082
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:12,799
currently is no uh known alternative to

1083
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,838
war as a means of settling really

1084
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,839
important conflicts

1085
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,358
so if we look at the big picture what

1086
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,519
role has violence or do you think

1087
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,319
violence has played in the evolution of

1088
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:29,519
homo sapiens so we are

1089
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,519
quite an intelligent got a beautiful

1090
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,320
particular little branch on the

1091
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:36,000
evolutionary tree

1092
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,519
what part of that

1093
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,039
was played by

1094
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,039
our tendency to be violent

1095
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,200
well i think that violence was

1096
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,838
responsible for creating your homo

1097
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:47,838
sapiens

1098
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,440
um

1099
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,439
and

1100
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,039
that raises the question of what homo

1101
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,119
sapiens is

1102
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,719
yes

1103
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,079
yeah exactly

1104
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,199
so

1105
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,240
you know nowadays people um

1106
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,759
begin

1107
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:09,358
the

1108
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,440
the concept of what homo sapiens is by

1109
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:12,880
thinking about features that are very

1110
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,679
obviously different from all of the

1111
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,480
other species of homo

1112
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:18,799
and

1113
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,240
our large brain are

1114
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,039
a very rounded

1115
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:25,439
cranium a relatively small face

1116
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,920
these are characteristics which are

1117
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,240
developed in a relatively modern way by

1118
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,920
about 170

1119
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,559
000 years ago say you know it's one of

1120
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,519
the earliest skulls in africa that

1121
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:40,078
really captures that

1122
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:42,000
but uh it has been argued that

1123
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,280
that is a

1124
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,079
um

1125
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,839
an episode in a process

1126
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,240
that has been

1127
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,599
uh started substantially earlier and

1128
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,838
there's no doubt that that's true you

1129
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,160
know homo sapiens is a species that has

1130
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:57,279
been changing pretty continuously

1131
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:58,318
throughout

1132
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,160
the

1133
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:03,318
length of time it's there

1134
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:06,960
and it goes back to 300 000 years ago

1135
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:09,440
315 literally is the the time

1136
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,039
the the best estimate of a date for

1137
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,119
uh a series of bones from morocco

1138
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,358
that have been dated uh three or four

1139
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,119
years ago at that time and have been

1140
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:21,279
characterized as

1141
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,358
earliest homo sapiens

1142
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,640
now at that point

1143
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:29,358
they are only beginning the trend of

1144
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,759
sapionization and that trend consists

1145
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:32,960
basically of grassonization

1146
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,400
of making

1147
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,880
our ancestors

1148
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,440
less robust

1149
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,119
shorter faces smaller teeth a smaller

1150
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,400
brow ridge a narrower face

1151
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,519
a thinner

1152
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,599
cranium all these things that are

1153
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,759
associated with

1154
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,079
reduced violence

1155
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,640
okay so that's that's saying what

1156
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,480
that's homo sapiens beginning so it

1157
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,239
began sometimes three three to four

1158
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,440
hundred thousand years ago because by

1159
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:02,239
three hundred fifteen 000 years ago

1160
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,159
you've already got something

1161
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,679
recognizable so you're you're more on

1162
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,639
that side of things that there was this

1163
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,919
gradual process it's not 150 170 000

1164
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,519
years ago it's

1165
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,200
it started like 400 000 years ago and

1166
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:17,119
it's just it started three to four

1167
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,598
hundred thousand years ago and and if

1168
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,760
you look at 170 it's got even more like

1169
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,440
us and if you if you look at at a

1170
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,880
hundred it's got more like us again and

1171
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,800
if you look at 50 it's more like us

1172
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,960
again it's all the way it's just getting

1173
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,880
more and more like the moderns

1174
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,000
so the question is what happened between

1175
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,559
three and four hundred thousand years

1176
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,559
ago to produce homo sapiens

1177
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,838
and i i think we have a pretty good

1178
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,000
answer now

1179
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,639
and the answer comes from violence

1180
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,480
and the story begins by focusing on this

1181
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,358
question why is it that in

1182
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,960
the

1183
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,000
human species

1184
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,119
we are unique among all primates in not

1185
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,800
having

1186
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,480
an alpha male in any group

1187
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,720
in the sense that

1188
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,719
what we don't have is an alpha male who

1189
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,118
personally beats up

1190
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,639
every other male

1191
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,280
and the answer

1192
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,879
uh that

1193
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,240
has been

1194
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,760
portrayed most most uh richly by

1195
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,399
christopher boehm

1196
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,480
and whose work i've elaborated on

1197
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,480
uh is that

1198
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,480
only in humans

1199
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,599
do you have a system by which any male

1200
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,159
who tries to bully others

1201
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,240
and become the alpha equivalent to an

1202
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,159
alpha gorilla or an alpha chimpanzee or

1203
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,358
an alpha bonobo or an alpha baboon or

1204
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,480
anything like that

1205
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:43,279
any male who tries to do that in humans

1206
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,079
gets taken down by a coalition

1207
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,119
of beta males

1208
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,960
um that coalition yes

1209
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,519
it's a really good uh picture of human

1210
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,960
society yes i like it okay

1211
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,199
so and that's the way all our societies

1212
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,039
work now yes um because

1213
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:00,799
individuals try and be alpha and then

1214
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,559
they get taken out yeah i mean we don't

1215
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,480
usually think of ourselves as beta males

1216
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,400
but yes i i suppose i suppose that's

1217
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,960
what democracy is

1218
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,880
exactly yes exactly

1219
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,199
um okay so

1220
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,400
well so at some point alpha males get

1221
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,039
taken out

1222
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,480
well what alpha males are are males who

1223
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,880
respond with high reactive violence

1224
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,920
to any challenge to their status you see

1225
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,920
it all the time in in primates some

1226
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,039
peter male thinks he's getting strong

1227
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,680
and and uh you know maturing in wisdom

1228
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:36,000
and so on and uh he refuses to

1229
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:38,318
uh kowtow to the alpha male and the

1230
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,800
alpha male comes straight in and and

1231
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,960
charges at him or maybe he'll just wait

1232
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,000
for a few minutes or and then take an

1233
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,000
opportunity to attack him

1234
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:48,399
the

1235
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,720
um

1236
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,039
all of these primates have got a high

1237
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:55,279
tendency for reactive aggression

1238
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,838
and that make enables the possibility of

1239
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,240
alpha males we don't we have this great

1240
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,920
reduction as i talked about earlier

1241
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,279
and the question is when did that

1242
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,639
reduction happen well

1243
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,599
cut to

1244
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:12,159
the famous experiments by the russian

1245
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,920
biologist dimitri believe

1246
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:17,598
who tried

1247
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,920
domesticating wild animals

1248
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,599
when you domesticate wild animals what

1249
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,559
you're doing is

1250
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,880
reducing reactive aggression

1251
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,078
you are selecting those individuals to

1252
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,200
breed

1253
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,119
who are most willing to be approached by

1254
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,759
a human or by another member of their

1255
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,920
own species and are least likely to

1256
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,920
erupt in a reactive uh aggression

1257
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,318
and you only have to do that for a few

1258
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,960
generations to discover that there are

1259
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:49,199
changes in the skull

1260
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,519
and those changes

1261
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,118
consist of

1262
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:54,480
a

1263
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,240
shorter face

1264
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,960
smaller teeth

1265
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:58,959
a

1266
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,880
reduced maleness

1267
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,039
are the males become increasingly

1268
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,240
female-like

1269
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:08,239
and reduced brain size

1270
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,318
well the changes that are characteristic

1271
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,639
of domesticated animals in general

1272
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,960
compared to wild animals are all found

1273
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,480
in homo sapiens compared to our early

1274
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,199
ancestors

1275
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,280
so it's a very strong signal that when

1276
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:24,318
we first see homo sapiens what we're

1277
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,079
seeing is evidence of a reduction in

1278
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:27,838
reactive aggression

1279
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,039
and that suggests that what's happening

1280
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:33,440
with homo sapiens is that uh that is the

1281
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,358
point at which there is selection

1282
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,358
against the alpha males

1283
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,199
and therefore

1284
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,279
the way in which the selection happened

1285
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:44,078
would have been the way it happens today

1286
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,680
the beta males take them out

1287
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,880
so i think that

1288
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,759
homo sapiens is a species characterized

1289
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,119
by

1290
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,520
the suppression of reactive aggression

1291
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,400
as a kind of incidental consequence of

1292
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:01,119
the suppression of the alpha male

1293
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:05,680
and and the story of our species is the

1294
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:09,280
story of how the beta males took charge

1295
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:13,279
and have been responsible for

1296
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:16,319
the generation of a new kind of human

1297
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,760
and incidentally

1298
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:19,119
for

1299
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,040
imposing

1300
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,119
on the society

1301
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:27,119
a new set of values because when those

1302
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,760
beta males discovered that they could

1303
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,519
take out the previous alpha male

1304
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,960
and continue to do so because in every

1305
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,920
generation there'll always be some male

1306
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,440
who says

1307
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,440
maybe i'll become the alpha male and

1308
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,440
they you know so they just keep chopping

1309
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,760
them down

1310
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,358
in discovering that they also obviously

1311
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,280
discovered that they could kill anybody

1312
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:46,480
in the group

1313
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,319
females

1314
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,000
young males

1315
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,800
anybody who

1316
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
didn't follow their values

1317
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,440
and so this story is one of um

1318
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,880
one in which the males of our species

1319
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:06,000
and these would be the breeding males

1320
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,440
have been able to impose their values on

1321
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,280
everybody else and there's two kind of

1322
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,039
values there's one kind of value is

1323
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,760
things that are good for the group like

1324
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,920
thou shalt not murder

1325
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,200
and the other kind of value is things

1326
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,358
that are good for

1327
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:21,759
the males

1328
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:25,119
such as hey guess what when good food

1329
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,960
comes in males get it first yes

1330
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,559
so i mean it's fascinating that that

1331
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,800
kind of set of ideals could out-compete

1332
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,119
the the others

1333
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,280
do you have a sense of why

1334
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,920
or maybe you can comment on neanderthals

1335
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,079
and all the other early humans why did

1336
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,720
homo sapiens

1337
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,440
come to succeed and flourish and all the

1338
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:50,399
other ones all the other branches

1339
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,679
of evolution died out

1340
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,079
or get murdered

1341
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:55,919
nowadays when when homo sapiens

1342
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,920
meets homo sapiens

1343
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,119
and we don't know each other uh

1344
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,400
initially

1345
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,559
then conflict breaks out and the

1346
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,519
more militarily able

1347
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,559
group

1348
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,480
wins

1349
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,920
you know we've seen that

1350
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,679
everywhere throughout the age of

1351
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,240
exploration and

1352
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:17,199
throughout history

1353
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,679
so i'm i'm rather surprised you know the

1354
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:23,039
conventional wisdom uh that you see

1355
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:25,759
nowadays in contemporary anthropology

1356
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,920
is very reluctant to point to

1357
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,800
uh success in warfare

1358
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,000
uh as the reason why sapiens uh wiped

1359
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,760
out neanderthals within about 3000 years

1360
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,599
of the sapiens coming into europe 43 000

1361
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,480
years ago

1362
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,240
and

1363
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,679
people are much more inclined to say

1364
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,479
well the neanderthals were at low

1365
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:49,118
population density so they just couldn't

1366
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,000
survive the demographic

1367
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,519
sort of

1368
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,079
sweep

1369
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,440
or the disease came in and you know

1370
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,280
maybe those things

1371
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,119
might have been important but

1372
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,920
you know far and away the most obvious

1373
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:05,039
possibility is that

1374
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,039
sapiens were just

1375
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,599
were powerful

1376
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,160
they had

1377
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,280
everyone agrees they had larger groups

1378
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,679
they had better weapons uh they they had

1379
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:19,119
uh projectile weapons bows and arrows

1380
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,799
to judge from the um little microlith uh

1381
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,920
bits of flake

1382
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,720
um

1383
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,559
which the neanderthals didn't

1384
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,039
you know nowadays there's

1385
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,119
evidence of of interbreeding uh quite

1386
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:33,759
extensive interbreeding between sapiens

1387
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,400
and neanderthals uh as well as with some

1388
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,559
other groups and sometimes people say

1389
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,559
well you know so they loved each other

1390
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,720
they made love not war

1391
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,400
i think they made love and war

1392
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:45,679
and

1393
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,079
you know it wouldn't necessarily mean

1394
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,919
too loving i mean

1395
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,960
if you just follow through from

1396
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,960
typical ethnographies nowadays of when

1397
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,800
um dominant groups meet subordinate

1398
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,440
groups they didn't know each other

1399
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,039
then uh you can imagine that

1400
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,240
neanderthal females would essentially be

1401
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,159
captured

1402
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,959
and taken into

1403
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:09,279
champions groups

1404
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,318
maybe you can comment on this

1405
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:15,440
uh cautiously

1406
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:18,400
and eloquently what's the role of sexual

1407
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,079
violence in human evolution because you

1408
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,838
mentioned taking

1409
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,920
neanderthal females you've also

1410
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,519
mentioned that some of these rules are

1411
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,720
defined by the

1412
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:30,719
uh by the male side of the society

1413
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,959
what's the role of sexual violence in

1414
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:34,000
this story

1415
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,519
i think you've got to distinguish

1416
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,519
between groups and within groups

1417
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:42,000
and

1418
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:44,400
you know i think where the world has

1419
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,838
been slowly waking up over the last

1420
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,559
several decades

1421
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:50,400
to the fact that sexual violence is uh

1422
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,640
routine in

1423
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,800
war

1424
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:55,598
and that to me says

1425
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,200
that

1426
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,960
um

1427
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:03,039
it's just another example of power

1428
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,400
corrupts because uh you know when

1429
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:06,400
frustrated

1430
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,680
uh scared

1431
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,880
elated

1432
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,639
soldiers

1433
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,720
uh come upon

1434
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:15,838
females in a group

1435
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:17,279
that has been essential dehumanization

1436
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:19,599
of

1437
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,760
then they get carried away by

1438
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,039
opportunity

1439
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,440
it is

1440
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,960
not always possible to argue that this

1441
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,480
is adaptive

1442
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,400
uh nowadays

1443
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,800
because you know you get lots and lots

1444
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,880
of stories of um

1445
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,280
women being

1446
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,000
abused to the point of of being killed

1447
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,119
uh you know she'll be gang raped and and

1448
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,480
then killed there's lots of

1449
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,640
terrible

1450
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,280
cases of that reported from all sorts of

1451
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:49,279
different wars

1452
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:53,440
but you can see that that could build on

1453
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,559
a

1454
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:59,039
um a pattern that would have been a

1455
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,359
adaptive if happening in under

1456
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,159
sort of much less extreme circumstances

1457
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:04,400
uh

1458
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:06,799
you know the the war is is very extreme

1459
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,680
nowadays in the sense that you get

1460
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,480
battles in which people are sent by a

1461
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,558
military hierarchy into a war situation

1462
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,318
in which they do not feel what hunters

1463
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,559
and gatherers would typically have felt

1464
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:20,558
which would have been that if we attack

1465
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,839
we have an excellent chance of getting

1466
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,960
away with it

1467
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:24,799
nowadays

1468
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,880
uh you know you're sent in across the

1469
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,559
somme or whatever it is and and there's

1470
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,280
a very high chance you will be killed

1471
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,640
and that's totally unnatural and a novel

1472
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,400
evolutionary experience i think

1473
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:37,440
then there's sexual coercion within

1474
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,599
groups

1475
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,960
and um

1476
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,960
so that takes various kinds of forms

1477
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,000
you know but nowadays of course i think

1478
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,519
people recognize increasingly that

1479
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,440
the principal form of

1480
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,719
sexual intimidation

1481
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,318
and rape

1482
00:53:54,719 --> 00:54:00,879
occurs within relationships

1483
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:03,599
it's not stranger rape that is really

1484
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,039
you know statistically important there's

1485
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,440
much more

1486
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,199
um what happens

1487
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,119
behind the walls

1488
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:13,279
of

1489
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,880
a bedroom where people have been living

1490
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,000
for some time

1491
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,440
and

1492
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,119
um

1493
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:24,079
just two sort of you know thoughts and

1494
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:25,760
observations about this uh one is that

1495
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,559
it may seem odd

1496
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,680
that

1497
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,160
um

1498
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:32,000
that males should be

1499
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:33,118
i

1500
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
should think it

1501
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:38,160
you know a good idea as it were to

1502
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,358
impose themselves sexually on someone

1503
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:44,078
with whom they have a relationship

1504
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,920
but what they're doing is

1505
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,880
intimidating someone

1506
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:51,440
in a relationship in which the relative

1507
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,240
power in the relationship has continuing

1508
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:57,280
significance uh for a long time

1509
00:54:54,239 --> 00:55:00,000
and that power probably goes well beyond

1510
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,079
uh just the sexual you know it's it's to

1511
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,119
do with domestic relationships it's to

1512
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,519
do with

1513
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:08,720
the man getting his his own way all the

1514
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:11,440
way it's power dynamics and uh the

1515
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:14,000
sexual aggression is one of the tools to

1516
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,679
regain power gain power gain more power

1517
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,119
and that kind of thing yeah

1518
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:22,239
exactly and and in that respect

1519
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:24,559
um it's worth noting that

1520
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:27,358
although this wasn't appreciated uh for

1521
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,960
some time it's it's emerging that in a

1522
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:30,719
bunch of primates you have somewhat

1523
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,599
similar

1524
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,879
somewhat parallel kinds of sexual

1525
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,200
intimidation

1526
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,880
where males will target particular

1527
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:41,199
females even in a

1528
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,358
group in which the norm is for females

1529
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:45,358
to mate with multiple males

1530
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,960
but each male will target a particular

1531
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:49,440
female and

1532
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,280
the more he is aggressive towards her

1533
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,240
then the more she

1534
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,200
conforms to his wishes when he wants to

1535
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:56,879
mate

1536
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,719
so a long-term pattern of sexual

1537
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,880
intimidation

1538
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:04,000
so there's that aspect the other aspect

1539
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:06,480
i would just just note is that

1540
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,480
males

1541
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:14,400
get away with a lot compared to females

1542
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:15,679
in the any kind of intersexual conflict

1543
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,160
um

1544
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:19,919
you know so the punishment uh

1545
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:23,118
here's one example of this the

1546
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,039
punishment for a husband killing a wife

1547
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,838
uh has always been much less than the

1548
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:31,679
punishment for a wife killing a husband

1549
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:34,000
um and and you see similar sorts of

1550
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:36,318
things in terms of the punishments for

1551
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,639
adultery and um

1552
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:41,119
and so on and

1553
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:42,960
i bring this up in the context of

1554
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,798
of males

1555
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:50,559
sexually intimidating uh their partners

1556
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:53,440
may be wives or or whoever

1557
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:55,680
because it's a reminder that

1558
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,599
it's basically a patriarchal world that

1559
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:00,078
we have come from

1560
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,920
a patriarchal world in which

1561
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:04,000
male alliances

1562
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,400
tend to support males

1563
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,480
and take advantage of the fact that they

1564
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,599
have political power at the expense of

1565
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,838
females

1566
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,280
and i would say that that all goes back

1567
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:14,639
to what happened three to four hundred

1568
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,880
thousand years ago

1569
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,519
when the beta males took charge and they

1570
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,358
started imposing their own norms on

1571
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,440
society as a whole and they've continued

1572
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:25,440
to do so and you we now look at

1573
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,720
ourselves and you know jordan peterson

1574
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:31,039
says we are not a patriarchal society

1575
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:33,679
well you know it's true that the laws

1576
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,838
try and make it even-handed nowadays

1577
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,719
between males and females but obviously

1578
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:42,239
we are patriarchal de facto

1579
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:43,439
because society still in many ways uh

1580
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:44,479
supports

1581
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,480
um

1582
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,358
men better than it supports women in

1583
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,420
these sorts of conflicts so beta male

1584
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:51,759
patriarchal

1585
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,599
[Laughter]

1586
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,079
if we're looking

1587
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:58,400
at the evolutionary history okay is

1588
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,960
there uh maybe sticking on jordan for a

1589
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,920
second is is there

1590
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,559
um

1591
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,559
so he's a psychologist right and

1592
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,798
what part of the picture do you think

1593
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,798
he's missing in analyzing

1594
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:18,400
the human relations

1595
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,079
like what needs what does he need to

1596
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,639
understand

1597
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:25,039
about our origins and violence and the

1598
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,879
way the society has been constructed oh

1599
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,960
i i don't want to

1600
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,798
go deep into into his

1601
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,760
missing perspectives you know but i just

1602
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,039
think that

1603
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,280
um

1604
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:36,719
that what he's doing in that particular

1605
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,960
example is

1606
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:42,239
uh focusing on the legalistic position

1607
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,679
and that's great

1608
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:48,639
that um you know you do not find

1609
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:51,358
uh formal patriarchy in the law anything

1610
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,960
like to the extent that you could find

1611
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:54,318
it 100 years ago

1612
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,798
and so on you know women have got the

1613
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:58,558
vote now hooray but it took a long time

1614
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:02,159
for women to get the vote

1615
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:03,119
and um you know it remains the case

1616
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,719
that

1617
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,838
um

1618
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:08,399
the women

1619
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:10,078
suffer in in various uh kinds of ways

1620
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,960
you know you know

1621
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,960
a woman who is

1622
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,559
uh has lots of sexual partners uh is uh

1623
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,720
treated much more rudely than a male who

1624
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:23,040
has lots of sexual partners

1625
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:25,679
uh there are all sorts of informal ways

1626
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,119
in which uh it's a rougher being a woman

1627
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:28,798
than it is a man

1628
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,720
and uh if we look at

1629
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,480
the surface layer

1630
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:34,959
of uh the law

1631
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,039
we may miss the deeper

1632
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,000
human nature

1633
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:40,079
uh

1634
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,760
like the origins of our human nature

1635
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,079
that still operates no matter what the

1636
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,520
law says yeah

1637
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,760
which is

1638
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:49,519
you know human nature is awkward because

1639
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,160
uh it includes

1640
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:54,239
some unpleasant features that uh when we

1641
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:55,358
sit back and reflect about them uh we

1642
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,759
would like to

1643
00:59:55,358 --> 01:00:00,400
uh them to go away yeah

1644
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,440
but it remains the fact that

1645
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,519
men

1646
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,400
are

1647
01:00:03,519 --> 01:00:08,239
hugely concerned to try and

1648
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,559
have sex with

1649
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:12,879
um

1650
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,798
at least one woman and you know often

1651
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,720
lots of women yeah and so women are con

1652
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:18,159
men are constantly putting pressure on

1653
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,078
women in

1654
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:21,598
ways that women find unpleasant and if

1655
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,960
men sit back and reflect about it they

1656
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,880
think yeah we shouldn't do this but

1657
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,159
actually just it just goes on because of

1658
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,440
human nature

1659
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:32,719
so maybe looking at particular humans in

1660
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,440
history uh let's talk about genghis khan

1661
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,879
so

1662
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:40,318
is uh this particular human who was

1663
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:43,358
one of the most famous examples of

1664
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:46,159
a large-scale violence is he a deep

1665
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:47,838
representative of human nature or is he

1666
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:48,798
a rare exception

1667
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:51,440
well

1668
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:51,440
i think that

1669
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:58,640
it's easy to imagine that

1670
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,358
most men could have become genghis khan

1671
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:01,759
uh

1672
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:04,239
it's possible that he had a particular

1673
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,240
streak of psychopathy

1674
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:08,838
um

1675
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:11,469
you know it's it's striking that

1676
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:13,039
i by the time you become

1677
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:15,519
[Music]

1678
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,759
immensely powerful

1679
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:18,960
then uh your

1680
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,200
willingness

1681
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,358
to do terrible things

1682
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:25,838
uh for the interest of yourself and your

1683
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:25,838
group

1684
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,000
becomes

1685
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,280
very high

1686
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,400
you know

1687
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,200
stalin

1688
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,200
marty tung

1689
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,040
these sorts of people

1690
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,960
have histories

1691
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,199
in which they do not show

1692
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,639
obvious psychopathy but by the time they

1693
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,358
are big leaders they are really

1694
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:50,838
psychopathic in the sense that

1695
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:53,759
they do not follow the ordinary morality

1696
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:55,838
of considering

1697
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,160
the harm that they are doing to their

1698
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:00,400
victims

1699
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:00,399
i

1700
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:04,078
you know what kind of experiment would

1701
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,639
we need to discover whether or not

1702
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,519
anybody could fall into this position i

1703
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,798
don't know

1704
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:11,679
but

1705
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:12,960
you know lord acton's uh famous dictum

1706
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:14,879
was

1707
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,559
power corrupts an absolute power

1708
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,480
corrupts absolutely

1709
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,400
and then the point that people often

1710
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,440
forget is the next sentence that he said

1711
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,639
which is great men are almost always bad

1712
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,480
men

1713
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:28,960
and that is right

1714
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,679
it is very difficult to find a great man

1715
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,838
in history who was not responsible for

1716
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,759
terrible

1717
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:38,719
things i think there's some aspect of it

1718
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,640
that it's not just power

1719
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:42,558
i think

1720
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:45,279
men who's been who have been the most

1721
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:48,839
destructive in human history

1722
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,839
are not psychopathic

1723
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,920
completely

1724
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:55,119
they have convinced themselves of an

1725
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:57,280
idea it's like the idea of psychopathic

1726
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,798
uh stalin for example i don't hitler is

1727
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,599
a complicated one i think he was

1728
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:04,000
legitimately insane but i think stalin

1729
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,838
has convinced himself that

1730
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
he's doing good

1731
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:10,400
so the idea of communism is the thing

1732
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,440
that's psychopathic in his mind like a

1733
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:16,318
bread you construct a worldview in which

1734
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,880
the violence is justified the cruelty is

1735
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:20,239
justified so they're

1736
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,000
in in that

1737
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:24,399
sense first of all you can construct

1738
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
experiments unethical experiments that

1739
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,960
could test this but

1740
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,639
uh

1741
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,720
in that sense anybody else could have

1742
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,598
been in stalin's position

1743
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:35,759
it's the idea that could overtake the

1744
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,400
mind of a human being

1745
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,799
and in so doing justify cruel acts and

1746
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,000
that seems to be at least in part unique

1747
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,480
to humans

1748
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,440
is the ability to hold ideas in our

1749
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,358
minds

1750
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,159
and share those ideas

1751
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:50,880
and

1752
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:51,679
use those ideas to convince ourselves

1753
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,960
that

1754
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:57,279
uh proactive violence on a large scale

1755
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,798
is a good idea

1756
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,200
so that i i don't know if you haven't

1757
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:03,119
supposed though i mean but but uh

1758
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:06,078
it seems to me what really motivated my

1759
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,880
uh stalin was not so much

1760
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,599
uh

1761
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:12,640
communism uh as

1762
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:15,359
the retention of power

1763
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:16,480
so once he became

1764
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:18,960
leader

1765
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,599
and in the process of becoming leader

1766
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,480
he was absolutely desperate to get rid

1767
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:27,039
of anybody who was a challenger he was

1768
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:30,318
deeply suspicious suspicious of of

1769
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:32,480
anybody uh even on his side

1770
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,558
uh who might possibly be showing a

1771
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,920
glimmerings of uh willingness to

1772
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,319
challenge him

1773
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:42,318
so you know when he uh

1774
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:44,960
apparently had uh uh kirov uh murdered

1775
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:47,119
uh kirov was a great communist

1776
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,079
uh trotsky was a great communist

1777
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:53,039
uh you know all all his rivals uh and i

1778
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:55,039
mean when he went into the towns and and

1779
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,559
murdered people by the tens of thousands

1780
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,680
they were all communists a lot of them

1781
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,160
were coming

1782
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:01,679
explicit communists that's right but but

1783
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:04,879
what he was worried about was that there

1784
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:06,960
were rivals to him

1785
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,318
i suppose the thought is

1786
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,760
i am the best person to bring about

1787
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:13,279
a uh

1788
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,400
a global

1789
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,440
sort of embrace of communism and others

1790
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,960
are not

1791
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,798
and so we have to get rid of those

1792
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,639
others well i suspect you're being very

1793
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:24,719
charitable here but i mean

1794
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:26,318
maybe you're

1795
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:27,118
you know enough about starting to

1796
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:29,759
realize

1797
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:30,880
well so the point i'm making i i do

1798
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,839
quite a bit

1799
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,200
is

1800
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:34,719
from my

1801
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:37,598
understanding and sense of course we

1802
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:41,519
can't know for sure is he believed in

1803
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:44,880
communism this wasn't purely a game

1804
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:46,239
of power now he got drunk with power

1805
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,039
pretty quickly

1806
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,199
but

1807
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,440
he really believed for

1808
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:54,000
i believe his whole life that

1809
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:58,079
uh communism is good for the world

1810
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,480
and that i don't know what role

1811
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,599
that belief plays with the not more

1812
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,679
natural

1813
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:06,160
human desire for power

1814
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:07,440
i don't know but it just seems like as

1815
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:09,358
we agreed he's killing a lot of

1816
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,358
communists on his

1817
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:12,480
on his journey

1818
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:14,480
hmm

1819
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,400
but it's not that doesn't that calculus

1820
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,719
doesn't work that way there's

1821
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,680
humans who are communists and then

1822
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:25,598
there's the idea of communism so

1823
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:27,679
for him in his delusional worldview

1824
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,400
killing a few people

1825
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:30,798
is

1826
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,559
worth the final result of bringing

1827
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:34,000
communism to the whole world

1828
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,720
but it was more than that again because

1829
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,358
i mean he really wanted power for uh the

1830
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:42,159
soviet union and and uh so surely the

1831
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:45,759
reason that he um

1832
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:47,519
he uh orchestrated the

1833
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:51,119
export of

1834
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:54,000
wheat from ukraine and in so doing was

1835
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,519
willing to lead to mass starvation was

1836
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,440
because he wanted to sell it on the

1837
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:59,280
market in order to be able to build up

1838
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,720
the power of

1839
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,720
the soviet union

1840
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:04,798
you know alternative view of communism

1841
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:07,038
might have been well you know

1842
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:08,960
let's just make sure everybody survives

1843
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,920
and make sure everybody has enough to

1844
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,079
eat and we'll all be mutually supportive

1845
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,318
in a communal network but no but he

1846
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:18,480
wanted the power for the country well i

1847
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,318
guess exactly so that it's not even

1848
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,000
communism the set of ideas or like

1849
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:24,960
marxism or something like that it's the

1850
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,079
country i guess what i'm saying is uh

1851
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,679
it's not

1852
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:32,079
purely power for the individual

1853
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:33,279
it's power for a vision for this great

1854
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,760
nation

1855
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,280
the soviet union yeah and similar with

1856
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,200
hitler

1857
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,400
the guy believed

1858
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:45,598
that this is a great nation germany and

1859
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,079
like they it it's a nation that's been

1860
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:49,838
wronged throughout history and needs to

1861
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,599
be righted

1862
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:54,480
and there's some

1863
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:57,920
dance between the individual human and

1864
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:00,079
the tribe yes no absolutely yes and so

1865
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,000
so just like chimpanzees uh you know we

1866
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,000
are fiercely tribal

1867
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,880
and the tribalism uh resides

1868
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,079
particularly in male psychology

1869
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,838
and uh it's it's very scary because once

1870
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,280
you assemble

1871
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:15,279
a

1872
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,920
set of males who

1873
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:22,159
share tribal identity then they have

1874
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:23,199
power that they can exert

1875
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:25,039
with

1876
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,719
very little

1877
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:29,039
concern about what they're doing to

1878
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,560
damage other people

1879
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:31,838
do you think this

1880
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,759
so nietzsche

1881
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:35,679
will to power

1882
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:36,719
we talked about the corrupting nature of

1883
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,640
power do you think that's a

1884
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,158
manifestation

1885
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,798
of those

1886
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:44,798
uh early origins of violence

1887
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:46,000
what's the connection of this desire for

1888
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:49,920
power

1889
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,560
and our proclivity for violence

1890
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:56,399
you know what we're talking about is um

1891
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:59,120
tribal power right power on behalf of a

1892
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:01,838
group yes and uh yeah that seems to me

1893
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:04,399
to go right back to

1894
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:06,640
a deep evolutionary origin

1895
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:10,318
because you see essentially the same

1896
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,798
thing in uh in a whole bunch of animals

1897
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:15,039
you know they that most

1898
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:17,278
uh of the sort of

1899
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:19,439
cognitively complex animals live in

1900
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,839
social groups in which they have tribal

1901
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:21,838
boundaries

1902
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:26,239
and

1903
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:28,880
so what you see in chimpanzees is echoed

1904
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:30,798
in almost all of the primates the

1905
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,560
difference between

1906
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:34,479
us and

1907
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,520
chimpanzees and humans on the one hand

1908
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:39,358
and other primates on the other

1909
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,600
is that we kill and they don't and the

1910
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,838
reason they don't is because

1911
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:46,798
they never meet in the context where

1912
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,679
there are massive imbalances of power

1913
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:49,198
so

1914
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,239
two groups of baboons you know there's

1915
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:52,479
30 on

1916
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:54,319
this side and 50 on this side fine

1917
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,839
nobody's going to try and kill anybody

1918
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:59,279
else because

1919
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,279
the serious risks involved

1920
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:05,279
but nevertheless they are tribal so

1921
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,279
you know they will have

1922
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:08,158
fairly intense intergroup interactions

1923
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:10,559
uh

1924
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:14,000
in which everybody knows whose side is

1925
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:17,120
on who is on whose side and um

1926
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:21,039
the long-term consequences of

1927
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:24,960
winning those battles non-lethal battles

1928
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:27,198
is that the dominance i get access to

1929
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:32,239
larger areas of land

1930
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:32,238
more safety and so on with chances are

1931
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:34,719
better

1932
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:40,159
record of

1933
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:42,079
reproductive success subsequently

1934
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:46,399
do you think this from an evolutionary

1935
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:47,760
perspective is a feature or a bug our

1936
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:50,639
natural

1937
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,800
sort of tendency to form tribes

1938
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,960
so what's a bug

1939
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,679
oh sorry this is a computer uh

1940
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:00,319
programming analogy

1941
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:00,319
meaning like

1942
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:06,158
it would be more beneficial

1943
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:08,559
is it beneficial or detrimental

1944
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:10,879
to form tribes from an evolutionary

1945
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,239
perspective yeah yeah but but but

1946
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,119
what is that what does it mean what does

1947
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:16,799
a bug mean yes right i mean

1948
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:19,119
well yeah it's like where's evolution

1949
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,719
going it's beneficial from you know it's

1950
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:22,399
beneficial in the sense that it evolved

1951
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:24,399
by natural selection

1952
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:27,519
to be to benefit the individuals who did

1953
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:29,599
it yes but if you if by bug you mean

1954
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,880
something that from the point of view of

1955
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,640
the species it would be great if you

1956
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,800
could just wipe this out right because

1957
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,920
the species would somehow do better yes

1958
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,760
as a result

1959
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,800
then yes but but then you know males are

1960
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:43,679
a bug

1961
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,840
oh come on now it's uh

1962
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:48,480
there's some nice things to males

1963
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,079
uh speaking as a male i the fact that

1964
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,919
there are some nice things to males

1965
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:53,920
doesn't mean that they're not bugs you

1966
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,840
know maybe they're quite nice bugs but

1967
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,640
it'll be much better for the species as

1968
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,119
a whole not to have to have males who

1969
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,880
impose this violence on the species as a

1970
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:04,559
whole yeah

1971
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,119
as somebody who practiced controlled

1972
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,840
violence and doing a lot of martial arts

1973
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:12,399
yeah it uh i'm not sure

1974
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:15,199
it does seem kind of fun to have this

1975
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:17,920
kind of controlled violence also sports

1976
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:19,519
also i mean the question of conflict in

1977
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,399
general i guess that's the deeper

1978
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,400
question

1979
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,238
don't you think there's some value to

1980
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:26,719
conflict

1981
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:29,359
for the improvement of society for

1982
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,960
progress that that this tension between

1983
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:32,079
tribes

1984
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,119
isn't this

1985
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:35,119
like

1986
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:37,119
uh experiment

1987
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:38,800
a continued experiment will conduct with

1988
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,119
each other to figure out what is a

1989
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,320
better world to build like you need that

1990
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:44,880
conflict

1991
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:47,759
of good ideas and bad ideas

1992
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:50,640
to go to war with each other it's like

1993
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:53,440
the united states with the 50 states and

1994
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,000
the it's the laboratory of ideas

1995
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:57,599
don't you think that is again feature

1996
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,439
versus bug

1997
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,360
um it

1998
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:02,879
this kind of conflict when it doesn't

1999
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:04,880
get out of hand

2000
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,920
is actually ultimately progressive

2001
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,920
productive for a better world

2002
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,920
well what do you mean by conflict

2003
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,239
i mean you can have conflict in the

2004
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:17,119
sense of people have different ideas

2005
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:19,279
about the solution to a problem and so

2006
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:21,519
their ideas are in conflict they can sit

2007
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:23,840
down with it and uh

2008
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,400
on a log and chat about it and then

2009
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:27,520
decide okay you're right or i'm wrong or

2010
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:28,879
whatever

2011
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:32,320
um

2012
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:34,480
but but if by conflict uh you mean a

2013
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:36,399
great idea to build a nuclear bomb and

2014
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:37,198
set that off

2015
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:39,198
then

2016
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:42,559
no you know i don't see why it's a good

2017
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:42,559
idea to have all this violence

2018
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:46,678
yeah there's

2019
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,480
i i wonder

2020
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:52,559
i mean it's not a good idea but i wonder

2021
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:54,879
if human history would evolve the way it

2022
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,039
did without the violence

2023
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:59,119
oh i'm sure you're you're right probably

2024
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:00,560
uh humans would not have evolved in in

2025
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:02,319
the sense that we have

2026
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,800
but i would hope that

2027
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:05,840
uh the course of

2028
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,199
uh

2029
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,679
violence

2030
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:10,879
in evolution will continue in the way it

2031
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,239
has

2032
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,440
so

2033
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:15,519
you know there's all sorts of

2034
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:17,439
indications um

2035
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,520
that the

2036
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:21,759
importance of violence has been reduced

2037
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,600
over time

2038
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,760
and you know this is

2039
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,960
made famous in stephen pinker's book but

2040
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:32,320
others have written about it too

2041
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,439
that the the frequency of uh death from

2042
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,158
violence

2043
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:38,319
in every country you look at

2044
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:39,839
has been declining

2045
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:41,599
that's just great and so you know the

2046
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,000
amazing thing about this is that even

2047
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:46,480
when you take the death due to the first

2048
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,039
world war and the second world war the

2049
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:52,079
20th century appears to have been

2050
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:54,079
statistically meaning rates of death per

2051
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,960
individual

2052
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,479
the

2053
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,119
least violent

2054
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:59,119
in history

2055
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,000
so we haven't got very far down the

2056
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:05,600
course to non-violence but i don't see

2057
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,319
why we shouldn't just carry on doing it

2058
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:11,679
i think it's ridiculous frankly you know

2059
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:13,599
excuse my frankness uh to to say that uh

2060
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:16,158
violence is a good thing

2061
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:18,800
um i think that it would be a wonderful

2062
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:21,920
concept if we could evolve somehow to a

2063
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:25,760
world you know 3 000 years from now

2064
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:27,520
where violence is really regarded as uh

2065
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,640
simply appalling and that you know they

2066
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,400
look back on our time and can't believe

2067
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,280
what we were doing

2068
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:34,799
yeah

2069
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,399
but of course violence takes a lot of

2070
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,279
different shapes as we start to think

2071
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:41,119
deeper and deeper about living

2072
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:42,479
beings on earth for example the violence

2073
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:44,800
would commit and the torture would

2074
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,879
commit to animals and then perhaps down

2075
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,480
the line as we talked offline about is

2076
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,000
with robots

2077
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,238
and that kind of thing so there there's

2078
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,920
just so many ways to commit violence to

2079
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:55,919
others and some people now talk about

2080
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,319
violence in the space of ideas

2081
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,800
which of course to me at least is a bit

2082
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:03,920
of a silly notion relative to use that

2083
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:06,800
same v word for the space of ideas

2084
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:09,199
versus actual physical violence but it

2085
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,920
may be that a long time from now we see

2086
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:15,279
that even violence in the space of ideas

2087
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:17,840
is is quite a manifestation of that same

2088
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:20,559
kind of violence and so it is

2089
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:22,880
interesting where this is headed and i

2090
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,640
think you're absolutely right

2091
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,640
a world

2092
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,119
a non-violent world does seem like a

2093
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,560
better world i wonder if the constraints

2094
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:32,399
on resources

2095
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,880
somehow make that world

2096
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:36,559
more and more difficult especially as we

2097
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,760
run out of resources well it's got to be

2098
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,120
very very different from what we're

2099
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,960
doing nowadays

2100
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:42,319
and it's unimaginably different if we

2101
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,840
could imagine it then maybe we could

2102
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:45,599
work towards it at the moment nobody

2103
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,520
knows how to work towards it well that's

2104
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,640
kind of the stories of humans as we we

2105
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,360
don't really know the future we're

2106
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,760
trying to try to add hog kind of

2107
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:56,880
develop it as we go and sometimes get

2108
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,800
into trouble yeah that's the violence

2109
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,359
but it you know george orwell's vision

2110
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,760
in 1984 was of

2111
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:06,079
of you know two or three world powers

2112
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:08,400
each so powerful that nobody could

2113
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:11,600
could diminish the

2114
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:11,599
could destroy the other

2115
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:16,000
but the notion of

2116
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:17,599
an evolutionarily stable relationship

2117
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,079
among

2118
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,960
heavily armed world powers

2119
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:22,960
just does not seem

2120
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,199
as though

2121
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,960
it's reasonable at all

2122
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:31,519
that's to say

2123
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:35,359
uh you know we've we've now got

2124
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:38,880
170 or 190 nations in the world

2125
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:42,079
uh dominated by a few big ones

2126
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:44,719
uh all with arms pointing at each other

2127
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:47,279
and the notion that we could just carry

2128
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:50,560
on having peace talks and making sure

2129
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:52,238
that uh these arms uh don't get uh

2130
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,000
involved in some kind of massive

2131
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:56,879
confrontation

2132
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,760
seems incredibly optimistic

2133
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:01,440
some kind of major change has to happen

2134
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,800
uh whereby

2135
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:04,639
you know and some people would like to

2136
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,239
see all the weapons go that'd be great

2137
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,480
you know i i'm a

2138
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:10,479
member of that that sort of group that

2139
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:11,519
tries to to see that happen

2140
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,399
it's going to be very difficult to see

2141
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,800
it happen

2142
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:17,039
um another kind of concept is

2143
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,480
the nations themselves will dissolve and

2144
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:20,000
will become

2145
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:21,759
one

2146
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,600
one government

2147
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:27,039
that itself is a terrifying vision

2148
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,880
because the capacity for abuse by a

2149
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:31,679
single world power would be

2150
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,440
so problematic and in addition how do

2151
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,039
you get there without a war in the first

2152
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:37,198
place

2153
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:40,479
so you know at the moment we we have

2154
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:42,079
no reasonable kind of future in mind but

2155
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:43,919
i'm sure it's there somewhere it's just

2156
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:45,439
that we haven't yet to find it and a lot

2157
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,760
of people like in the cryptocurrency

2158
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:50,719
space argue that you can create

2159
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:53,039
decentralized societies if you take away

2160
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:55,359
the power from states to define the

2161
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:58,158
monetary system so they argue like if

2162
01:18:55,359 --> 01:19:00,079
you give if if you make the monetary

2163
01:18:58,158 --> 01:19:02,479
system such that it's disjoint from

2164
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:04,559
anyone the control of any one individual

2165
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:07,119
any one government then that might be a

2166
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:09,760
way to form sort of ad-hoc decentralized

2167
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:11,599
societies just they just pop up all over

2168
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,880
the place that's a really interesting

2169
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:17,280
technological uh solution to how to

2170
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,840
remove the overreach of power from

2171
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:22,399
governments yeah that's right absolutely

2172
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,199
and and it may well be that uh

2173
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:25,198
that

2174
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:26,719
the future will emerge out of some sort

2175
01:19:25,198 --> 01:19:29,359
of quite surprising

2176
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:31,439
direction uh like that is it

2177
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:33,119
nevertheless surprising to you that we

2178
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:35,279
have not destroyed ourselves with

2179
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:37,359
nuclear weapons so the mutually assured

2180
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:39,519
destruction that we've had for many

2181
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,839
decades from somebody who studies

2182
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,440
violence

2183
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,360
how does that make sense to you well i

2184
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:48,639
mean i'm surprised only in the sense

2185
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:51,839
that um accidental the the the fact that

2186
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:54,159
we have not had an accident yet

2187
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,560
uh has been quite remarkable

2188
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:58,238
yeah because all the accounts are that

2189
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,920
we've come very close to having very

2190
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:02,238
serious accidents where

2191
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,800
people either side of misread

2192
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:06,479
intentions or apparent launches and so

2193
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,719
on

2194
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:10,718
uh so yes i think it is remarkable there

2195
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:11,760
is a a nasty

2196
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,719
um

2197
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:18,719
generalization that can be made that uh

2198
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:21,198
the longer that um powerful states go

2199
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:25,039
uh without having wars then the worst

2200
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:25,039
the war is afterwards

2201
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:29,279
and you know you can sort of see that

2202
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,198
that kind of makes sense because

2203
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:33,119
basically what's happening uh with these

2204
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:34,799
tribal groups that the nations are at

2205
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:36,079
the moment

2206
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,840
is that

2207
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:38,960
after a big war like the second world

2208
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:40,639
war

2209
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,079
they established new kinds of dominance

2210
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:43,520
relationships

2211
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:46,238
and then

2212
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,000
during the periods of peace what happens

2213
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:49,039
is that

2214
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,158
the

2215
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:54,639
de facto dominance relationships change

2216
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:56,638
because some nations become poorer some

2217
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:59,119
become richer some become more

2218
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:02,159
militarily powerful and so on generally

2219
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:04,800
economy and military goes hand in hand

2220
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,719
so you know right now china uh emerged

2221
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:09,760
from the war is a relatively low status

2222
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:11,119
state and is now high status so if this

2223
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,560
were chimpanzees you know what would

2224
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:15,198
happen is that you would predict a

2225
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,280
conflict because you need to have a

2226
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:20,000
readjustment of the formal dominance

2227
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:22,238
relationships to recognize the the new

2228
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,079
in practice dominance relationships

2229
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:25,839
recognized by the economy in the

2230
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:28,719
military

2231
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:31,039
so the longer that you have of a period

2232
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:34,319
of peace following a war then the more

2233
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:37,039
these tensions of unresolved changed

2234
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:40,000
dominance relationships build up

2235
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:44,319
and the longer they take to occur then

2236
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:47,039
uh the more uh challenging uh are going

2237
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:49,039
to be the conflicts that's a terrifying

2238
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:50,880
view because we've been we've been out

2239
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:52,319
of conflict for quite a bit that's right

2240
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,159
maybe it's building up

2241
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:56,559
so it's a scary view but on the other

2242
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:57,839
hand you know things have changed hugely

2243
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,239
with the

2244
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,840
advent of nuclear weapons because at

2245
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:03,919
least that

2246
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:06,000
conforms to

2247
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,920
this psychology that is very clear in

2248
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,079
other animals which is you don't want to

2249
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,880
get into a fight if you are going to get

2250
01:22:10,079 --> 01:22:13,519
hurt

2251
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,520
so that's the whole principle of mad

2252
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:17,679
mutually assured destruction

2253
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,080
and it's doubtless being why

2254
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:21,840
powerful nations like america and

2255
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,840
and russia

2256
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,400
have not used their nuclear weapons

2257
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:28,400
since 1945

2258
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,238
the you know so

2259
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:33,039
if we can overcome the problem of

2260
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:36,238
accidental launches

2261
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:38,158
then maybe the fact of mad does fit into

2262
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:41,439
human psychology in a way that means

2263
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:44,399
that we really will resolve our tensions

2264
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:46,158
without using them but

2265
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:48,559
we haven't yet really faced that

2266
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:50,879
challenge you know i mean the soviet

2267
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,520
union collapsed because of uh the poor

2268
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:56,000
economy but with

2269
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,400
china you know desperate to

2270
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,359
take back taiwan

2271
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:02,238
and

2272
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:04,000
america shifting its focus on the

2273
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:05,678
pacific

2274
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,840
the potential for something going wrong

2275
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:09,440
is clearly very high

2276
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,679
so what's the

2277
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:14,079
hopeful case that you can make for a

2278
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,760
long-term surviving and thriving human

2279
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:19,600
civilization

2280
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:22,159
given all the dangers that we face

2281
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,960
well i i can't really exactly make one i

2282
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:24,960
would just say that

2283
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,840
we're talking about the dangers

2284
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:31,359
obviously the dangers are there yeah um

2285
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,520
but but what i would

2286
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:35,759
sort of think about is um

2287
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,520
the notion that

2288
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,880
that surprises

2289
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,239
come from all sorts of different

2290
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,639
directions

2291
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:45,519
you know and um i mean

2292
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:48,000
you you're you work in robotics and you

2293
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:50,320
know i can well imagine that

2294
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,960
there will be advances in robotics and

2295
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:54,719
in some way i can't even conceive will

2296
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,600
somehow undermine

2297
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,000
the

2298
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,280
motivation for conflict

2299
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,119
something about

2300
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:03,920
you know by the time chips have been

2301
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,760
planted in human brains and we're all

2302
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:08,399
instantly sharing information in a way

2303
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,639
that we never did before

2304
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:13,119
will this change the nature of

2305
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:14,400
uh human existence in such a way that

2306
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:16,399
these conflicts

2307
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:18,238
get resolved so remove the conflicts but

2308
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:20,158
keep some of the magic the beauty of

2309
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:22,319
what it means to be human so like still

2310
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:24,719
be able to enjoy life the richness of

2311
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:26,799
life the full complexity of life because

2312
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,158
you can remove conflict by giving

2313
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,480
everybody a pill

2314
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:32,559
and then they go to sleep right you

2315
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:35,919
still want life to be amazing

2316
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:38,320
uh exciting you know uh

2317
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,760
interesting and so that's where you have

2318
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:41,039
to find the balance

2319
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,480
well it's

2320
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:45,679
yes i mean it's all science fiction

2321
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:48,238
stuff and and uh so how it's going to

2322
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:50,560
work out totally unclear

2323
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:50,559
um

2324
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:55,760
i don't see any worry about the magic of

2325
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,119
life disappearing i mean

2326
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,199
first of all you somehow get rid of

2327
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:00,800
males i think i think you really need to

2328
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:02,399
get rid of males because males are the

2329
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,600
source of

2330
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:06,960
uh

2331
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,639
of of a major problem which is the lust

2332
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,279
for power

2333
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,199
and the resulting conflict but you don't

2334
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:14,238
think the males are also a source of

2335
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:16,719
beauty

2336
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:18,879
and creation no no i mean i i i don't

2337
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,960
have anything against males as you know

2338
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,880
as individuals that sort of thing and

2339
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,520
and males have clearly done a lot i mean

2340
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,960
they've been incredibly exploratory and

2341
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,600
creative

2342
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,198
and what they've done in in art and

2343
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,000
music has been wonderful and that sort

2344
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:34,238
of thing

2345
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,198
on the other hand

2346
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:36,799
i'm not sure there's anything

2347
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:39,039
particularly special and i think that

2348
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:42,239
probably females could do the same thing

2349
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:45,359
just as well when given the chance

2350
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:47,119
yes including the dark stuff i i mean a

2351
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:47,839
partial part of me is not understanding

2352
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:49,039
the

2353
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,360
so there is

2354
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:52,639
a evolutionary distinction between men

2355
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:53,359
and women

2356
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:55,840
but

2357
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:57,839
i tend to believe both men and women if

2358
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,920
you look out into the future can be

2359
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:02,480
destructive can be evil can be greedy

2360
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,920
can be corrupted by power so if you move

2361
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:06,319
males from the picture which are

2362
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:08,560
historically connected to this evolution

2363
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:10,880
of that we've been talking about

2364
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:13,280
that women are going to fill that role

2365
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:15,760
quite nicely and then it'll be just

2366
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:17,759
the same kind of process we not the same

2367
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,880
but it'll be new

2368
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,480
and

2369
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,560
interesting

2370
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:24,000
there's a there's a sense that the the

2371
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,480
will to power

2372
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,158
craving power committing violence is

2373
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:29,599
somehow coupled

2374
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:31,279
with the

2375
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,400
with all the things that are beautiful

2376
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:34,960
about life

2377
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:38,638
that if you remove conflict completely

2378
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:40,000
if you remove all the evil in the world

2379
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,639
it it

2380
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,198
it seems like

2381
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:47,440
you're going to um

2382
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:49,599
you're not going to have a stable place

2383
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:52,399
for the beauty for the goodness like

2384
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,159
there's always has to be

2385
01:26:52,399 --> 01:26:56,000
a dragon to fight

2386
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:57,519
for the way if you look at human history

2387
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,279
now you can say

2388
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:02,239
the the reason i'm nervous about a sort

2389
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:04,000
of utopia where everything is great

2390
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:06,799
is every time you look through human

2391
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:09,840
history when utopia has been chased you

2392
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:12,800
run into a lot of trouble or again

2393
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:15,039
sneaks into this evil this craving for

2394
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:16,639
power now you could say that's a male

2395
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:18,719
problem

2396
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:20,560
but i just think it's a human problem

2397
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:22,960
and it's not even a human problem it's a

2398
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,719
chimp problem too it's life on earth

2399
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:29,119
problem intelligent life on earth

2400
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:31,920
problem so like it's better to um

2401
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:34,639
not necessarily get rid of the sources

2402
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,960
of the darker sides of human nature but

2403
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:39,679
more create mechanisms that

2404
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,679
the kindness the the goodness as

2405
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,880
the goodness paradox your book

2406
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,079
that that

2407
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,600
is

2408
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:49,279
incentivized

2409
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,280
and encouraged empowered

2410
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,560
well

2411
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,319
look

2412
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,320
i don't think it would be utopia if you

2413
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:58,079
got rid of the males

2414
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:59,759
right

2415
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:01,359
and certainly females capable of

2416
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,119
conflict

2417
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:04,880
i just think it's a gamble worth taking

2418
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:06,238
if you could actually do it

2419
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:09,119
you can certainly find females in

2420
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:10,879
history who've done unpleasant things

2421
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:12,319
but nevertheless

2422
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,560
you know we have a very strong

2423
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:16,880
evolutionary theory which explains why

2424
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,400
males benefit more

2425
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,319
by

2426
01:28:18,399 --> 01:28:22,399
having conflict and winning conflicts

2427
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:23,359
than females do

2428
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:24,559
and

2429
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:27,359
so

2430
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,920
if we want to talk about reducing

2431
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:31,839
conflict yes then

2432
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:34,000
it would reduce it to get rid of males

2433
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:36,079
now i understand this is a fantasy yeah

2434
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,760
and it i think it's a fantasy that

2435
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:39,920
people would be able to talk about

2436
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:43,119
fairly soon because reproductive

2437
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:45,600
technology is getting to the point where

2438
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:48,158
it's quite likely that

2439
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,400
human females could breed without the

2440
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:51,439
use of males

2441
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:53,599
and so

2442
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:55,519
there would be a sort of

2443
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,880
a potential dynamic

2444
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:00,159
if

2445
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,679
everybody just agreed not to have any

2446
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:03,039
male babies

2447
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:05,600
it's a it's a really interesting thought

2448
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:08,238
experiment i will agree with you that

2449
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,440
if given two buttons one is get rid of

2450
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:12,479
all women

2451
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:13,919
and the other buttons get rid of all men

2452
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:15,759
um

2453
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,719
realizing that uh

2454
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:20,639
i have a stake in this uh choice uh

2455
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:24,480
you're probably getting rid of all men

2456
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:25,600
if i wanted to preserve

2457
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:28,399
earth

2458
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:30,239
and the richness of life on earth i

2459
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:31,599
would probably get rid of all men i

2460
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:33,359
don't know i don't think you ever stake

2461
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,800
in it you know i mean

2462
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:38,399
but you're saying that because you're a

2463
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:40,320
man yeah but i don't see why being a man

2464
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:42,638
should make you any more interested in

2465
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,319
having a male future for the world than

2466
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:46,800
a female future you know you've got just

2467
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:48,238
as many ancestors who were male as as

2468
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:51,360
were female

2469
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:53,599
well my problem is i'll have to die

2470
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:56,158
well that's going to happen anyway

2471
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,639
i know but like i prefer to die tomorrow

2472
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:00,960
not today you know i you know i prefer

2473
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:03,199
to snooze hit the snooze button on the

2474
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,480
whole mortality thing but it's

2475
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:05,919
interesting but this is not suggesting

2476
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:07,759
that males have to die in order to make

2477
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,840
room for females it's just

2478
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,280
you know you you all you have to do is

2479
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,840
just say

2480
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:15,039
don't let's have any more males born

2481
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,960
interesting of course you know the

2482
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:19,679
difficulty is that that because we're

2483
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,719
tribal you know some country somewhere

2484
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:22,800
would say well we're not going to do

2485
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,800
that yeah and then guess what they'd

2486
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,560
take over yeah because they're male so

2487
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,320
that's why it's impossible to imagine

2488
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,400
actually happening

2489
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:32,479
uh you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna

2490
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:34,879
take that and actually think about it i

2491
01:30:32,479 --> 01:30:36,479
don't know i'm uncomfortable

2492
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,199
there's a

2493
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:41,198
there's a certain kind of woke culture

2494
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:42,559
that i've been kind of uncomfortable

2495
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:44,879
with because

2496
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,760
it's not women necessarily it's more

2497
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:48,079
just

2498
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:50,159
there's a lot of bullying i see

2499
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:52,479
there's a lack of empathy and a lack of

2500
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:54,158
kindness towards others that's created

2501
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:55,759
by that culture so but you're speaking

2502
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:57,599
about something else you're speaking

2503
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:00,159
about

2504
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:03,360
reducing conflict in this world

2505
01:31:00,158 --> 01:31:06,319
and looking at the basics of our

2506
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:07,759
human nature and its origins

2507
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:10,559
in the uh

2508
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:12,960
evolution of homo sapiens and thinking

2509
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:15,199
about which kind of

2510
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:18,000
aspects of human nature if we get rid of

2511
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:20,079
them we'll make for a better world

2512
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,600
it's an interesting thought experiment

2513
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:22,880
but it is only a thought experiment i

2514
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,520
mean you know it's got no practical

2515
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,800
meaning uh right now yeah and and i take

2516
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,920
your point that

2517
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,880
um

2518
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:33,840
you know males get a hard rap nowadays

2519
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:38,639
uh in some ways because

2520
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:40,000
uh the balance of uh social power

2521
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:41,520
is moving

2522
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,840
uh

2523
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,920
against

2524
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:48,000
um i mean you know quite rightly in a

2525
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:51,440
strong sense of course against

2526
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,960
all the nasty things that males do

2527
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,678
but

2528
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:58,079
what people sometimes fail to remember

2529
01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:01,679
is that um

2530
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:03,519
life is very hard for males who

2531
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:04,560
don't have the power

2532
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,159
who

2533
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,600
don't have money

2534
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:10,638
who don't have

2535
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,639
access to women

2536
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:14,800
you know i'm sympathetic to uh in cells

2537
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,480
i

2538
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,880
i'm not sympathetic

2539
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:20,079
to them using violence to solve their

2540
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,719
problems

2541
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:24,079
but i am very sympathetic to the fact

2542
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:27,679
that

2543
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:29,840
it's not easy simply to be told by

2544
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:31,039
um

2545
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,800
well-off

2546
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:34,079
um

2547
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,159
feminist

2548
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:37,920
uh middle-class people

2549
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:39,439
uh that you shouldn't behave like this

2550
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,279
or you shouldn't feel like this because

2551
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:43,519
you do yes

2552
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:47,198
that's who you are i mean the the in

2553
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:50,080
general just empathy and kindness

2554
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:52,158
male or female i

2555
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:53,760
have uh i believe

2556
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:55,279
will be the thing that builds a better

2557
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,520
world and that

2558
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:59,840
that's practiced in different ways from

2559
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:02,239
different backgrounds but ultimately you

2560
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,480
should listen to others and empathize

2561
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:06,559
with the experience of others and put

2562
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:08,399
more love out there in the world now

2563
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,679
that's hopefully is the way to reduce

2564
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:12,319
conflict

2565
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:14,319
uh reduce violence

2566
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:17,439
and uh

2567
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:19,198
reduce that that whole psychological

2568
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:20,879
experience of being powerless in this

2569
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:22,399
world problems to become the best

2570
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,840
version of yourself

2571
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:26,638
and that you know but no one's going to

2572
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,800
disagree with all those fine sentiments

2573
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:31,279
right but that

2574
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:34,320
yes but that's that's an actionable

2575
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:38,559
thing is actually practice empathy

2576
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:41,119
right like saying that um

2577
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,600
somebody should be silenced or just like

2578
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:45,279
this group is bad and this group is good

2579
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:47,120
i just feel like that's not empathy

2580
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:49,679
empathy is

2581
01:33:47,119 --> 01:33:51,359
understanding

2582
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:52,800
the experience of others and like

2583
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:55,279
respecting it

2584
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:57,039
like i mean that that's that's what it

2585
01:33:55,279 --> 01:33:58,479
that's what a better world looks like

2586
01:33:57,039 --> 01:33:59,600
that's what the reduction of conflict

2587
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:01,759
looks like

2588
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:04,400
it's like as opposed to uh

2589
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,679
saying my tribe is right your tribe is

2590
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:07,920
wrong

2591
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:10,319
uh forget the violence and non-violence

2592
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:12,158
part that just that act of saying my

2593
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:13,679
tribe is right that tribe is wrong

2594
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:15,839
removing that from the picture that's

2595
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:17,359
the way to make a better world

2596
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,760
that's the way to reduce the violence i

2597
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:21,920
think

2598
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,639
not necessarily removing the people who

2599
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,560
are

2600
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:26,159
causing the violence you have to get to

2601
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:27,920
the source of the problem i don't mean

2602
01:34:26,158 --> 01:34:29,359
the evolutionary source but

2603
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,800
the just the

2604
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:33,279
the mindset

2605
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:35,119
that creates the violence is usually

2606
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:37,599
just a lack of empathy

2607
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:37,599
for others

2608
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:41,600
yeah but you know i mean you can't just

2609
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,360
teach that because there's our

2610
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,679
evolutionary psychology

2611
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:47,519
puts us in particular directions so you

2612
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:50,399
don't think

2613
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,920
do you think it's possible to learn

2614
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:54,799
through practice

2615
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:58,399
to resist the basics of our evolutionary

2616
01:34:54,800 --> 01:35:01,520
psychology the basic forces

2617
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:03,839
yeah i mean lots and lots of training

2618
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,920
you know lots and lots of education

2619
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:09,119
uh can do it the

2620
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:11,840
the famously most peaceful society uh

2621
01:35:09,118 --> 01:35:14,960
that anthropologists have recorded uh

2622
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:16,719
involves a tremendous amount of

2623
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:18,719
of teaching

2624
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:21,840
including some punishment

2625
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:24,800
you know it's a society in thailand

2626
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:26,639
you you have to beat it out of children

2627
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,600
to make them nice so it's carrot and

2628
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:29,600
steak

2629
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:32,480
you know the point is that

2630
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:35,960
you do not find societies in which

2631
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:35,959
people are spontaneously

2632
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,960
showing the kinds of

2633
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:45,039
behaviors that we would all love them to

2634
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:47,039
show it requires work it requires work

2635
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:49,279
what is your book titled goodness

2636
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:50,158
paradox what are the main ideas in this

2637
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:53,439
book

2638
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:54,638
well the paradox is the fact that humans

2639
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:56,638
show

2640
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:58,719
extremes

2641
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:00,319
in relationship to both violence and

2642
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:01,439
non-violence

2643
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:03,279
and

2644
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:06,638
the violence is that we are one of these

2645
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:08,880
few animals in which we

2646
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:10,800
use coalitionary proactive violence to

2647
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,118
kill members of our own species and we

2648
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,639
do it in large numbers just like a few

2649
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:16,319
other species

2650
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:18,159
and the

2651
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:19,679
non-violence is were particularly

2652
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:20,559
extreme in

2653
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:22,800
how

2654
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:25,600
repressed we are in terms of reactive

2655
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:27,360
violence and i i told you the story of

2656
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,440
of how we get there you know so what's

2657
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:32,479
so extraordinary about us is that

2658
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:35,359
uh most animals uh are either high on

2659
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:37,759
both or relatively low on both

2660
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:40,639
so chimpanzees are high on proactive

2661
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:41,760
violence and reactive violence bonobos

2662
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:42,560
are less

2663
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,960
than

2664
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:47,520
chimpanzees on both of those but still

2665
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:50,800
hundreds of times more

2666
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:52,960
reactively aggressive than humans are

2667
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:56,159
what we've done is retain

2668
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:59,118
uh proactive violence being high and got

2669
01:36:56,158 --> 01:37:01,118
a reactive violence really being low

2670
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:03,118
and so we have these wonderful societies

2671
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:05,759
in which we're all so incredibly nice to

2672
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:08,319
each other and tolerant and calm and and

2673
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:11,280
can meet strangers and have no problem

2674
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:11,279
about um

2675
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:17,279
leading to any kind of conflict

2676
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:20,400
at the same time as we are one of the

2677
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:22,960
worst killing machine species that's

2678
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:25,519
never existed so what's so extraordinary

2679
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:27,920
about this is that if you look at the

2680
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,679
political philosophers of the last few

2681
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,199
hundred years

2682
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:34,158
you've got this fight

2683
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:35,839
famously between thomas hobbes and

2684
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:36,799
jean-jacques rousseau or literally

2685
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,000
you've got the fight between their

2686
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:40,639
followers

2687
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,639
you know so the followers of hobbes say

2688
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:44,639
well hobbes was right because he says

2689
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:48,480
that we are naturally violent and you

2690
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:50,480
need a leviathan a central government or

2691
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:51,599
a king to be able to suppress the

2692
01:37:50,479 --> 01:37:54,319
violence

2693
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:56,400
so we're naturally hurried and we can

2694
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:58,799
learn to be good whereas jean-jacques

2695
01:37:56,399 --> 01:38:01,359
rousseau is interpreted as saying the

2696
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:03,679
opposite that we are naturally good and

2697
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:06,000
it's only when culture intervenes and

2698
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:09,118
and horizontal ideologies come in that

2699
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:11,279
we become uncivilized and so people have

2700
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:12,639
have had this endless fight between are

2701
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:13,599
we naturally

2702
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:17,199
corrupt

2703
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:19,119
or are we naturally uh kind

2704
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:21,599
and and that has gone on you know for

2705
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:24,238
years and it's only in the last two or

2706
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,239
three decades that anthropologists like

2707
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:28,000
christopher bohm and bruce naft have

2708
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:30,238
said look you know it's obvious what the

2709
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,479
answer is we are both of these things

2710
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:34,879
and what is so exciting now is i think

2711
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:38,079
we can understand why we are both and

2712
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:40,079
the answer is we come from ancestors

2713
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:41,600
that were elevated on proactive

2714
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:43,600
aggression that were

2715
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:47,119
hunters and killers

2716
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:49,280
both of animals and of each other

2717
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:52,799
i think you've got to include that as

2718
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:55,920
almost certain uh from the past

2719
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:59,279
and um and then now we've we've

2720
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:01,600
taken our reactive aggression and we've

2721
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:04,559
down regulated it and that's given us

2722
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:06,800
power it's given us power because

2723
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:09,520
once you get rid of the alpha male once

2724
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:12,400
the beta males take over and

2725
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:15,360
force selection in favor of a more

2726
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:16,960
tolerant less reactively aggressive

2727
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:18,479
individual

2728
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:20,880
the effect is

2729
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:23,519
that our cultures suddenly become

2730
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,800
capable of focusing on things other than

2731
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,080
conflict

2732
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:30,159
and so we have social groups in which

2733
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:32,238
individuals instead of constantly being

2734
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:33,519
on edge in the way that chimpanzees are

2735
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:34,399
with each other

2736
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,800
um

2737
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:39,759
are able to interact

2738
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:42,560
in ways that enable them to share

2739
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,880
looking at a tool together or share

2740
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:47,520
their food together or

2741
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,520
pass ideas from one to another or

2742
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:52,719
support each other when they're ill or

2743
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:54,400
whatever the issue is cooperate in ways

2744
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:56,880
that make the group

2745
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:59,759
far more effective so you asked earlier

2746
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:01,760
you know what did i think about why

2747
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:04,159
sapiens was able to expand at the

2748
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:07,520
expense of neanderthals so dramatically

2749
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:09,039
around 40 000 years ago and the answer

2750
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,320
is uh

2751
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:12,639
that

2752
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:15,679
whatever it was it had something to do

2753
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:17,440
with the sapiens ability to cooperate

2754
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:21,118
yeah that was what gave them bigger

2755
01:40:17,439 --> 01:40:23,678
groups that's what enabled them to

2756
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:25,599
have a far more effective way of living

2757
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:28,239
and i suspect it was to do with the

2758
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:31,039
weapons and and military aspects but

2759
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:33,839
even if it wasn't that the the

2760
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:35,920
greater cooperation that sapiens were

2761
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:39,039
showing uh would have been hugely

2762
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:39,840
important so sapiens then had groups of

2763
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:41,679
uh

2764
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,600
you know who knows exactly how big they

2765
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:44,399
were but um

2766
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,960
uh

2767
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:48,559
scores of of people uh to judge from

2768
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:51,840
their remains uh whereas the

2769
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:54,800
neanderthals were living in um widely

2770
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,960
separated small groups of you know maybe

2771
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,719
maybe as many as 15 or 20 people

2772
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,960
sometimes um

2773
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:03,439
where they saw others so rarely that

2774
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,960
they were inbreeding at high levels you

2775
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:08,238
know fathers

2776
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,679
uh having babies with their daughters

2777
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:11,198
very different world

2778
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,800
very different world and that's probably

2779
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:15,279
what our world was like before we got

2780
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:17,679
sapiens before we got serpents and it's

2781
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:20,238
fascinating that there was that kind of

2782
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:21,600
violence against so

2783
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:24,319
once you get the

2784
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:27,199
get rid of the alpha males

2785
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:29,759
you have now the freedom to uh

2786
01:41:27,198 --> 01:41:32,799
to have kindness amongst the beta

2787
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:35,039
the beta males like not not kindness but

2788
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,719
collaboration that's the better word yes

2789
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:38,800
right much more correlation not just

2790
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:41,118
among the males but among the beta males

2791
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:43,440
but also among the gamma males and

2792
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:45,198
the uh and the females yeah

2793
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:47,359
i don't know what a gamma male is but i

2794
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:48,638
imagine there's a whole alphabet

2795
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:50,880
well i don't know about hill alphabet

2796
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:53,359
but i think the the big letters are the

2797
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:55,359
married men yeah and and the and the

2798
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:57,279
unmarried men ah you know because now

2799
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,799
the married men were had a problem with

2800
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:00,158
the unmarried men

2801
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,239
right i mean you you see it in

2802
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:04,960
ethnographies of hunters and gatherers

2803
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:07,519
recently where uh the unmarried men

2804
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:09,600
would be given rules such as i mean the

2805
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:12,560
very extreme rule in northern australia

2806
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:15,280
was uh you cannot come to the camp uh

2807
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:17,280
for months you have to go away and live

2808
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:18,639
uh somewhere out in the bush yes because

2809
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:19,920
we don't want you anywhere near our

2810
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:22,000
wives

2811
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:25,440
and and then another kind of you know

2812
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,520
rule is um if you are in camp you must

2813
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:28,799
be in the fire light all the time

2814
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,920
otherwise we don't know what you're

2815
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,760
doing out in the dark

2816
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,440
so you're real enough to control them

2817
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:37,280
because you know

2818
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:38,879
the men who had lots of wives did not

2819
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:40,079
want those horrid bachelors sneaking

2820
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,359
around the piece

2821
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:45,840
i love this you also wrote the book

2822
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:47,599
titled catching fire how cooking made us

2823
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,480
human

2824
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:52,400
what's the central idea in this book

2825
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:55,039
the subtitle how cooking made us human

2826
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:58,319
refers not to homo sapiens but to homo

2827
01:42:55,039 --> 01:42:59,840
erectus so human there means the genus

2828
01:42:58,319 --> 01:43:02,799
homo

2829
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:05,199
and homo erectus is the first

2830
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:06,800
full member of the genus homo in the

2831
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:10,158
sense that

2832
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:13,199
it looked like us just with a sort of

2833
01:43:10,158 --> 01:43:14,559
slightly robust more robust build and a

2834
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:17,279
smaller brain

2835
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:22,000
i and the central idea of catching fire

2836
01:43:17,279 --> 01:43:23,118
is that it was the um control of fire

2837
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,439
that

2838
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:27,118
was responsible for the emergence of

2839
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:29,519
homo erectus

2840
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:30,639
and therefore the genus

2841
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,880
homo

2842
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:34,480
which happened two million years ago

2843
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,440
and it was

2844
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:37,599
a

2845
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:38,799
an evolution from

2846
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:42,480
a

2847
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:46,239
um a line of australopithecines

2848
01:43:42,479 --> 01:43:47,678
and australopithecines are the creatures

2849
01:43:46,238 --> 01:43:49,359
from whom

2850
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:50,158
we evolved

2851
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:52,799
they

2852
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:54,638
were present in africa

2853
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,960
from something like

2854
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:59,840
six or seven million years ago

2855
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:01,439
up to um actually up to one million

2856
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,279
years ago

2857
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:05,678
and then a branch

2858
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:07,359
led off to homo around 2 million years

2859
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:08,399
ago

2860
01:44:07,359 --> 01:44:10,079
and the way to think of

2861
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:12,238
australopithecines

2862
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:14,000
is that they were like chimpanzees

2863
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:18,479
standing upright

2864
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:20,399
so they were erect bipedal walkers

2865
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:23,198
they were like chimpanzees

2866
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:25,759
in the sense that uh they had brains

2867
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,359
about the size of a chimpanzee they were

2868
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,320
literally about the body size of a

2869
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:33,359
chimpanzee a little bit smaller actually

2870
01:44:30,319 --> 01:44:35,599
and they had big jaws because they were

2871
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:37,679
still eating

2872
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:39,520
raw food they had

2873
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:42,560
big teeth and big jaws

2874
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:44,400
and then around two million years ago

2875
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:47,039
the line of australopithecines which

2876
01:44:44,399 --> 01:44:48,559
ended with a an intermediate species a

2877
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:49,439
kind of missing link area because it's

2878
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,360
not

2879
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:52,879
missing called

2880
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:54,799
habilis

2881
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,239
sometimes called homo habilis but more

2882
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:59,279
properly i in my view call

2883
01:44:56,238 --> 01:45:00,158
australopithecus habilis

2884
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:02,399
that

2885
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:04,960
gave rise to homo erectus

2886
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:05,920
and homo erectus here's how different it

2887
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,039
was

2888
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,760
it had

2889
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:11,519
a smaller mouth

2890
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:13,119
a smaller jaw

2891
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:16,719
smaller teeth

2892
01:45:13,118 --> 01:45:19,118
and to judge from its ribs and pelvis

2893
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:20,639
smaller gut

2894
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:22,880
in addition

2895
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:25,359
it had lost what australopithecines all

2896
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:27,440
had which was adaptations for climbing

2897
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:29,198
in the trees

2898
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:31,599
and that meant that homo erectus must

2899
01:45:29,198 --> 01:45:34,000
have slept on the ground

2900
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,360
and since it slept on the ground

2901
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,679
it should have been able to defend

2902
01:45:35,359 --> 01:45:39,039
itself somehow against predators and i

2903
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:42,560
can't think of any way they could have

2904
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:42,560
done that unless they had fire

2905
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,440
so

2906
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:48,880
there are two major clues to why

2907
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:50,559
it was

2908
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:53,600
with homo erectus

2909
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:55,119
that our ancestors first acquired the

2910
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:57,360
control of fire

2911
01:45:55,118 --> 01:45:59,439
one is the fact that they were clearly

2912
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:02,000
not sleeping in trees in the way that

2913
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:05,198
chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos and

2914
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:07,679
all the other primates do

2915
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:09,198
and the other is that

2916
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:12,960
there was this

2917
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:14,399
striking reduction throughout the gut

2918
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,840
reduction in

2919
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:17,279
size of the mouth and the chewing

2920
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:19,199
apparatus

2921
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:20,158
and in the gut itself

2922
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:21,118
and

2923
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:23,679
that

2924
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:27,039
conforms to what we see nowadays about

2925
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:29,359
humans which is that our guts are about

2926
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:31,840
two-thirds of the size of what they

2927
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:33,279
would be if we at raw food

2928
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,279
to judge by

2929
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:36,000
the great apes

2930
01:46:35,279 --> 01:46:39,519
so

2931
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,639
at some point in our revolution

2932
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,679
we

2933
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:43,679
acquired

2934
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:45,840
the skill of cooking and skill of

2935
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:47,679
controlling fire

2936
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:49,760
at no time

2937
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:50,639
between two million years ago and the

2938
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,679
present

2939
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:56,560
do we see any changes in our anatomy

2940
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:58,000
that can as it were justify

2941
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:00,639
uh the

2942
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,118
enormous change that happens when

2943
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:04,000
you are an animal that learns to control

2944
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:05,599
fire

2945
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,399
but at two million years ago we have

2946
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:10,639
exactly what you'd expect namely the

2947
01:47:08,399 --> 01:47:12,879
guts becoming smaller because the food

2948
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:14,800
is becoming softer and much more easy to

2949
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:17,118
digest so you don't have to work so hard

2950
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:20,320
in your body to digest it

2951
01:47:17,118 --> 01:47:22,079
and as i say a commitment to sleeping on

2952
01:47:20,319 --> 01:47:23,759
the ground

2953
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:28,399
which i think you'd be absolutely crazy

2954
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:30,239
to do nowadays uh on a moonless night uh

2955
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:32,638
in the middle of serengeti unless you

2956
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:35,519
had fire i've slept out quite a lot in

2957
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:37,840
various parts of africa uh in the bush

2958
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:40,880
and you will not catch me

2959
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:43,039
just lying on the ground um in an area

2960
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:46,000
with lots of predators unless i got a

2961
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:47,600
fire with me you're going to get eaten

2962
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,039
you're going to get terrified and you're

2963
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:51,520
going to get eaten

2964
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:52,960
okay so there's a million questions i

2965
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:55,920
want to ask so one

2966
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:58,399
is is it very naturally coupled the

2967
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,319
discovery of controlled fire and

2968
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:01,359
cooking with fire is that an obvious

2969
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:03,599
leap

2970
01:48:01,359 --> 01:48:05,839
well what here's what we know we know

2971
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:08,639
that um all the animals that we've

2972
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,880
tested like to eat their food cooked

2973
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:13,039
more than they like it raw okay so this

2974
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:14,639
is true for all the great apes you know

2975
01:48:13,039 --> 01:48:17,600
we've tested them

2976
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:20,239
um that's fascinating by the way why is

2977
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:22,639
that that's just like a property of food

2978
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:23,919
i suppose yes i think what it is is that

2979
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:27,199
um

2980
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:30,079
animals are always looking for any kind

2981
01:48:27,198 --> 01:48:31,599
of way to get food that is easier to

2982
01:48:30,079 --> 01:48:33,279
digest

2983
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:35,600
and there are various signals in the

2984
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:37,920
food such as the amount of sugar there

2985
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:42,239
the amount of free amino acids because

2986
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:44,560
the amino acids can be tasted

2987
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:46,638
and the physical qualities of the food

2988
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:49,360
be particularly important how tough the

2989
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:52,079
food is always prefer softer food

2990
01:48:49,359 --> 01:48:53,759
provided it it feels safe you know it

2991
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:57,760
tastes safe

2992
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,560
and these kinds of sensory cues

2993
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,719
are

2994
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:02,960
all there in cooked food

2995
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:05,198
you know it's uh it's soft it doesn't

2996
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:08,399
have so many uh toxins it's not so

2997
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:09,759
noxious to taste um easier to chew

2998
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:12,000
so

2999
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:14,000
everyone loves it spontaneously uh your

3000
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,760
dogs and your cats prefer cooked food or

3001
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,520
raw food well maybe you can say that's

3002
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:19,520
the consequence of domestication but

3003
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,119
even you know as i say all of the great

3004
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:23,679
apes

3005
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:25,839
not you test naive ones and uh they

3006
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:27,920
prefer it cooked if they can so

3007
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:29,520
so then obvious once you have fire

3008
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:30,480
you're going to accidentally discover

3009
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,480
that

3010
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:34,638
food changes when you apply fire to it

3011
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:37,839
and then there's going it's going to be

3012
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:39,520
the crate the big crazy new fad yeah you

3013
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:41,760
took the words out of my mouth i mean if

3014
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:43,840
if they have fire at all and you know

3015
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,440
their food rolls into it

3016
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,880
five minutes later it tastes better than

3017
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:49,118
before

3018
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,880
how big of an invention from an

3019
01:49:49,118 --> 01:49:53,439
engineering perspective do you think is

3020
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:55,679
the discovery of fire

3021
01:49:53,439 --> 01:49:57,598
do you think

3022
01:49:55,679 --> 01:50:00,319
for the

3023
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:04,000
uh for homo erectus homo sapiens do you

3024
01:50:00,319 --> 01:50:04,000
think it's the greatest invention ever

3025
01:50:04,079 --> 01:50:06,719
yeah

3026
01:50:05,118 --> 01:50:07,839
i think i think that

3027
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:10,719
that

3028
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:13,279
the control of fire has

3029
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:15,840
been ultimately responsible for

3030
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:17,519
essentially

3031
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:20,239
how grandiose do i want to be here you

3032
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:23,119
know the entire human story uh going

3033
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:26,158
back to homo it is what changed us from

3034
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:27,519
being a regular kind of animal

3035
01:50:26,158 --> 01:50:29,920
and

3036
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:31,840
perhaps the biggest way in which it is

3037
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:33,840
likely to have changed this is

3038
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:38,079
it reduced

3039
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:39,520
the difficulty of making a large brain

3040
01:50:38,079 --> 01:50:42,319
so

3041
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:44,719
you know the story here is that

3042
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:47,599
the constraints on brain size

3043
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:47,599
are energetic

3044
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:52,520
you and i have brains that are something

3045
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:54,399
like

3046
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:56,639
2.5

3047
01:50:54,399 --> 01:51:00,479
of our body weight

3048
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:03,440
uh it consumes around 25

3049
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:05,359
of all of our calories

3050
01:51:03,439 --> 01:51:07,519
so it's disproportionate

3051
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:11,439
there are other expensive organs in our

3052
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:11,440
body as well such as the heart

3053
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:15,360
and

3054
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:18,079
what's different about their brain is

3055
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:19,679
that in addition to us being able to

3056
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:21,039
fuel it in a way that other animals

3057
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:23,840
can't

3058
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:25,359
we also have reasons for wanting to have

3059
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:28,560
an even bigger brain whereas we don't

3060
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:28,559
want an even bigger heart

3061
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:35,199
so what those reasons are is unclear but

3062
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:36,638
with regard to the costs of maintaining

3063
01:51:35,198 --> 01:51:39,519
a brain

3064
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:40,800
cooking makes it possible because it's

3065
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,560
supplying

3066
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:45,199
more calories

3067
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:48,320
and it is enormously reducing the amount

3068
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:50,960
of time that it takes to chew your food

3069
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:53,118
so if you were a gorilla

3070
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,960
and you wanted to have a bigger brain

3071
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:56,719
you might say okay well let's just eat

3072
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:59,520
some more

3073
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:00,560
but gorillas are eating

3074
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:03,199
for

3075
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:05,679
pretty much the entire day in the sense

3076
01:52:03,198 --> 01:52:08,399
that they are eating for

3077
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:10,079
maybe seven or eight hours a day in in

3078
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:11,679
some seasons

3079
01:52:10,079 --> 01:52:13,599
uh that's just chewing and then they've

3080
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:15,440
got to sit around and digest their food

3081
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:16,480
because they can't just eat all the time

3082
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:19,839
they've got to

3083
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:22,479
take a break while the food is

3084
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:23,760
digested in the stomach and then passed

3085
01:52:22,479 --> 01:52:26,799
into the gut

3086
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:29,199
so the stomach is already full

3087
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:31,039
so basically gorillas are eating about

3088
01:52:29,198 --> 01:52:33,359
the maximum rate already

3089
01:52:31,039 --> 01:52:35,679
so how does a gorilla get a bigger brain

3090
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:37,359
it doesn't it's actually got a smaller

3091
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:39,039
brain relative to his body size than

3092
01:52:37,359 --> 01:52:40,639
chimpanzee does

3093
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:42,960
and um

3094
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:45,760
and that's the basic problem for our

3095
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:48,239
ancestors then you come along and cook

3096
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:50,239
and all of a sudden you can get an

3097
01:52:48,238 --> 01:52:51,839
increased amount of energy from your

3098
01:52:50,238 --> 01:52:54,000
food

3099
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:56,159
you are spending much less energy on

3100
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,439
digesting your food

3101
01:52:56,158 --> 01:52:59,598
you know there are

3102
01:52:57,439 --> 01:53:02,158
25 bodily processes

3103
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:05,360
or more that are involved in digesting

3104
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:07,920
your food making the acid that

3105
01:53:05,359 --> 01:53:11,359
takes the proteins apart

3106
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:13,279
maintaining the brush border where the

3107
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:14,880
molecules are taken across the gut wall

3108
01:53:13,279 --> 01:53:17,359
and so on

3109
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:19,118
that all costs it costs you to digest

3110
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:21,359
your food it costs less if you cook your

3111
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:22,719
food so you get a net gain in the amount

3112
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:25,598
of energy

3113
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:26,560
and you are reducing the amount of time

3114
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:29,520
from

3115
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:31,760
uh in our case of our ancestors probably

3116
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:34,400
around fifty percent of the day

3117
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:36,239
to chewing to nowadays

3118
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:37,759
one hour a day chewing

3119
01:53:36,238 --> 01:53:39,919
so all of a sudden you've got hours a

3120
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:42,719
day in which to do other things and to

3121
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:46,000
use those those brains that you've now

3122
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:47,520
enabled to grow so with homo erectus you

3123
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,679
start the process of getting a bigger

3124
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:51,360
brain and famously you know throughout

3125
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:53,679
the whole period of the evolution of the

3126
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:57,198
genus homo you have a steadily

3127
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:58,239
increasing size of brain

3128
01:53:57,198 --> 01:54:00,399
until

3129
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:02,479
right at the end when it actually gets

3130
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:03,920
smaller but that's a different story

3131
01:54:02,479 --> 01:54:06,158
which end is this

3132
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:08,079
which are we talking about homo sapiens

3133
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:10,799
yeah in with homo sapiens you've got a

3134
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:13,039
smaller brain uh from

3135
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:15,679
um people haven't got it exactly down

3136
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:17,198
but at least 30 000 years ago it starts

3137
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:18,319
declining

3138
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:20,559
and

3139
01:54:18,319 --> 01:54:22,479
so the fascinating thing about that is

3140
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:25,440
that all domesticated animals have

3141
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:26,479
smaller brains than their wild ancestors

3142
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:28,638
and

3143
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:28,638
i

3144
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:34,159
the domestication is intricately

3145
01:54:32,319 --> 01:54:36,238
connected to this brain size you think

3146
01:54:34,158 --> 01:54:38,000
and do yeah exactly so i think what

3147
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:40,799
we're seeing in humans is uh is that

3148
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:43,760
same manifestation um and then the

3149
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:45,279
fascinating question is is why and the

3150
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,320
only point i would want to make about

3151
01:54:45,279 --> 01:54:50,000
this is

3152
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:52,559
that there's no evidence that in the

3153
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,319
small brain domesticates they're losing

3154
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:55,199
say an average about 15 percent of brain

3155
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:56,880
size

3156
01:54:55,198 --> 01:54:58,559
uh in those small brain domestics

3157
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:01,118
compared to their wild ancestors there's

3158
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:03,520
no indication of a loss of

3159
01:55:01,118 --> 01:55:05,759
cognitive ability

3160
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:08,639
so i think what's going on is that

3161
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:11,039
uh it's a it's a younger brain it's a

3162
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:13,760
more pedomorphic brain in looking like

3163
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:17,519
the juveniles of the ancestor

3164
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:19,280
but just as our kids are very smart and

3165
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,960
can learn amazing things compared to

3166
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:22,639
adults you know all they lack is wisdom

3167
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:25,359
and maturity but they you know in terms

3168
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:26,560
of sheer cognitive ability they got it

3169
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:27,920
and i think that's the same with

3170
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:30,159
domesticated animals compared to their

3171
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,960
wild ancestors and probably therefore

3172
01:55:30,158 --> 01:55:34,319
with

3173
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:37,198
um homo sapiens say 30 000 years ago

3174
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:40,639
compared to to their ancestors so we

3175
01:55:37,198 --> 01:55:41,759
have smaller brains than neanderthals

3176
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:45,118
size

3177
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:47,280
richard isn't everything exactly

3178
01:55:45,118 --> 01:55:50,000
what's the connection between fire

3179
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:53,198
cooking and the eating of meat

3180
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,319
do you which came first do you think uh

3181
01:55:53,198 --> 01:55:56,879
humans

3182
01:55:54,319 --> 01:55:58,319
starting to enjoy the eating of meat

3183
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:00,319
or the

3184
01:55:58,319 --> 01:56:02,238
the the invention of fire and the use of

3185
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:05,679
fire for cooking i think that fire

3186
01:56:02,238 --> 01:56:08,879
increased the using of meat but um

3187
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:13,279
but the fact that chimpanzees uh really

3188
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:16,159
like to hunt and kill meat as do bonobos

3189
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:18,158
certainly puts us in so they they

3190
01:56:16,158 --> 01:56:19,920
those two species have a common ancestor

3191
01:56:18,158 --> 01:56:22,079
with us going six seven million years

3192
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:24,079
ago and it was from that common ancestor

3193
01:56:22,079 --> 01:56:26,238
that you get the australopithecine line

3194
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:28,079
it's very likely therefore astrologians

3195
01:56:26,238 --> 01:56:29,279
were eating meat when they could get it

3196
01:56:28,079 --> 01:56:30,639
which wouldn't be very often because

3197
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:32,479
they wouldn't be very

3198
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:33,840
good sprinters but nevertheless they

3199
01:56:32,479 --> 01:56:36,158
would occasionally be able to get some

3200
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:37,920
meat and i bet they loved it all the

3201
01:56:36,158 --> 01:56:39,839
time and basically all primates like

3202
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:41,520
meat if they can get it almost all of

3203
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:43,920
them

3204
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:47,840
but i think fire would have been very

3205
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:51,039
important um for a couple of reasons

3206
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:53,360
uh one is that once you eat fire once

3207
01:56:51,039 --> 01:56:55,359
you eat your food cooked then you're

3208
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:57,359
saving yourself time

3209
01:56:55,359 --> 01:57:00,559
by saving yourself time

3210
01:56:57,359 --> 01:57:03,359
you can free up

3211
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:05,520
the opportunity to go and hunt more

3212
01:57:03,359 --> 01:57:07,598
because hunting is a high risk high gain

3213
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:10,080
activity

3214
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:12,000
there's every risk that you will get

3215
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:13,760
nothing on one particular afternoon that

3216
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,399
you go off

3217
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:18,800
looking for opportunities to kill

3218
01:57:16,399 --> 01:57:20,079
but it's high gain because when you do

3219
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:22,639
get something

3220
01:57:20,079 --> 01:57:26,079
you bring down a kudu then

3221
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:26,079
you've got a serious amount of meat

3222
01:57:26,479 --> 01:57:29,118
what did

3223
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:31,440
males and females do with the time they

3224
01:57:29,118 --> 01:57:33,839
were saving from not having to

3225
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:35,439
chew their food i think that

3226
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:37,199
in the case of males it's very

3227
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:39,359
reasonable to think they spent a greatly

3228
01:57:37,198 --> 01:57:41,118
increased amount of time hunting

3229
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:42,559
so chimpanzees

3230
01:57:41,118 --> 01:57:44,399
they hunt

3231
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:47,440
maybe two or three times a month and the

3232
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:50,000
average hunt length is 20 minutes

3233
01:57:47,439 --> 01:57:53,039
with humans they're

3234
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,198
hunting maybe uh 20 times a month

3235
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:57,679
and the average hunt length is six hours

3236
01:57:55,198 --> 01:57:59,678
yeah so it's a huge difference yeah

3237
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,760
so and that's possible because the time

3238
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:05,039
was available because they were cooking

3239
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:06,800
less chewing more hunting you got it

3240
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:08,719
the other thing is

3241
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:10,639
that the meat

3242
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:13,198
is so much nicer

3243
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:15,520
yeah yeah so when a chimpanzee

3244
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:17,439
kills a monkey and i mean they are so

3245
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:19,040
excited about killing a monkey you know

3246
01:58:17,439 --> 01:58:21,039
they are so excited about going into the

3247
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:23,118
hunt and uh when they

3248
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:26,079
make the kill then there's screams

3249
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:28,000
everywhere and uh some try to

3250
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:30,479
seize it and capture it and take it away

3251
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:33,198
from the others and eventually the

3252
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:34,799
strongest one has it and the others sit

3253
01:58:33,198 --> 01:58:36,559
around begging and trying to get some

3254
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:37,520
and tear it off and so yeah they all

3255
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:39,840
love it

3256
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:41,360
there are others who he often goes to

3257
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,800
the top of a tree

3258
01:58:41,359 --> 01:58:45,118
in order to be able to get away from all

3259
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,719
of these beggars and scavengers and

3260
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:49,039
while he's there

3261
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:51,520
drops of blood or little scraps will

3262
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:53,279
fall down to the bottom and the junior

3263
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:55,599
members of society you know the females

3264
01:58:53,279 --> 01:58:57,920
and young and that sort of thing um they

3265
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:59,360
they are racing through to find a

3266
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,960
particular leaf that's got a drop of

3267
01:58:59,359 --> 01:59:03,839
blood on it so they can lick it i mean

3268
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:03,840
they love it

3269
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:05,840
but

3270
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:08,079
yes

3271
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:10,079
it takes them a lot of time to chew it i

3272
01:59:08,079 --> 01:59:11,439
mean it's the same thing as for cooked

3273
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:15,359
food in general

3274
01:59:11,439 --> 01:59:16,879
so um they are getting meats very slowly

3275
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:18,799
into their bodies

3276
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:20,480
and there sometimes comes a time when

3277
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:23,199
they just say i've had enough of this i

3278
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:25,198
need real food and they'll drop the meat

3279
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:27,279
and go off and and eat

3280
01:59:25,198 --> 01:59:28,719
fruit again because they can get fruit

3281
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:31,198
into their bodies so much faster than

3282
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:32,239
they can get meat

3283
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:34,319
um

3284
01:59:32,238 --> 01:59:36,399
so once they're cooking that problem is

3285
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:37,759
solved and they can eat the meat so this

3286
01:59:36,399 --> 01:59:40,238
is much more readily so i think that

3287
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:42,320
meat eating would become important

3288
01:59:40,238 --> 01:59:46,079
for two reasons with cooking

3289
01:59:42,319 --> 01:59:48,559
so the key uh not to oversimplify but

3290
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:51,198
the key moments in human history

3291
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:53,360
are with the homo erectus

3292
01:59:51,198 --> 01:59:55,198
the discovery of fire and the use of

3293
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:58,880
fire for cooking

3294
01:59:55,198 --> 02:00:00,479
and then with uh homo sapiens the

3295
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:02,400
the beta males

3296
02:00:00,479 --> 02:00:05,039
killing off the alpha males so that the

3297
02:00:02,399 --> 02:00:06,158
cooperation can exist and cooperation

3298
02:00:05,039 --> 02:00:08,479
leads to

3299
02:00:06,158 --> 02:00:10,638
communication and language and ideas the

3300
02:00:08,479 --> 02:00:13,279
sharing of ideas that kind of thing

3301
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:15,920
well yes the only thing i would modify

3302
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:18,479
on that is that you have to ask

3303
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:20,319
how is it that the beta males were able

3304
02:00:18,479 --> 02:00:21,118
to kill the alpha male

3305
02:00:20,319 --> 02:00:23,519
right

3306
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:26,158
and we now know that although

3307
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:29,119
chimpanzees do kill males within their

3308
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:31,679
own group sometimes it's not a process

3309
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:34,319
of killing the alpha male it's taking

3310
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:36,880
advantage of opportunity when some male

3311
02:00:34,319 --> 02:00:38,399
gets into a bad position but it's not a

3312
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:39,279
systematic ability to kill the alpha

3313
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:41,279
male

3314
02:00:39,279 --> 02:00:43,279
and you can see see why you know because

3315
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:46,559
they don't have language and without

3316
02:00:43,279 --> 02:00:48,639
language it's very difficult to know

3317
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:50,639
how confident you can be

3318
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:52,480
of the support of others against a

3319
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:53,760
particular individual within your own

3320
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:54,959
group yes

3321
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:56,960
when you're attacking someone from

3322
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:58,800
another group that problem is solved you

3323
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:59,920
know we all hate the

3324
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:01,520
yes you know

3325
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:03,118
those guys

3326
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:05,199
but

3327
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:06,559
the alpha male has got alliances within

3328
02:01:05,198 --> 02:01:08,960
his group

3329
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:11,360
some of those allies might be willing to

3330
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:13,039
to turn against him

3331
02:01:11,359 --> 02:01:15,198
some of them might be harboring deep

3332
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:17,679
feelings of resentment

3333
02:01:15,198 --> 02:01:19,279
but how does anyone else know that

3334
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:20,239
so in other words i think that you have

3335
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:22,479
to have

3336
02:01:20,238 --> 02:01:23,678
some kind of language that is pretty

3337
02:01:22,479 --> 02:01:26,079
good

3338
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:27,760
to solve the problems of

3339
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:29,760
gaining confidence

3340
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:32,000
that

3341
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:32,960
five of you say you know or some some

3342
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,920
number

3343
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:36,960
um

3344
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:38,399
can trust each other in this final

3345
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:40,719
attack

3346
02:01:38,399 --> 02:01:42,719
and you know even nowadays it's it's

3347
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:44,158
difficult uh you know when you mention

3348
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:45,599
stalin

3349
02:01:44,158 --> 02:01:48,319
it's like

3350
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:51,279
why was everybody terrified

3351
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:53,279
any dictator that takes control why is

3352
02:01:51,279 --> 02:01:55,920
all of us as individuals terrified when

3353
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:58,800
you know there's millions of us

3354
02:01:55,920 --> 02:02:01,520
that's right and so like that we lack

3355
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:04,800
the language because our basic

3356
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:07,119
psychology of fear overtakes us like who

3357
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:09,840
can we talk to who can we talk to and

3358
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:12,158
not get killed ourselves exactly that's

3359
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:14,880
right but you're yeah do you have this

3360
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:16,479
intuition that some kind of language was

3361
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:18,560
developing

3362
02:02:16,479 --> 02:02:21,519
along with this process

3363
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:23,920
of beta males taking over yes yes i mean

3364
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:25,679
once you have sufficient language to be

3365
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:28,000
able to have the beta males conspiring

3366
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:31,520
to kill the alpha male

3367
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:33,198
then you have selection uh in favor of

3368
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:37,280
cooperation and tolerance as we spoke

3369
02:02:33,198 --> 02:02:38,960
about and at that point there will be uh

3370
02:02:37,279 --> 02:02:40,639
increased ability to communicate and the

3371
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:41,599
language will get richer and better and

3372
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:44,239
better

3373
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:48,159
so yes absolutely positive feedback loop

3374
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:51,678
once you get the situation started

3375
02:02:48,158 --> 02:02:53,598
can you maybe comment on um

3376
02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:55,760
the full complexity and richness of the

3377
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:57,930
human mind through this process we've

3378
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:59,280
been casually saying cooking

3379
02:02:57,930 --> 02:03:00,560
[Music]

3380
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:01,920

02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:03,920
and uh

3382
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:06,399
beta males

3383
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:09,118
leading to cooperation

3384
02:03:06,399 --> 02:03:10,879
but how does the the beauty of the human

3385
02:03:09,118 --> 02:03:12,319
mind emerge from all of this is there

3386
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:14,800
other further steps we need to

3387
02:03:12,319 --> 02:03:16,399
understand or is it as simple as this

3388
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:17,679
language emerging

3389
02:03:16,399 --> 02:03:19,759
from

3390
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:21,118
taking over the alpha male and the

3391
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:24,079
cooperation

3392
02:03:21,118 --> 02:03:26,158
or am i also over romanticizing how

3393
02:03:24,079 --> 02:03:29,359
amazing the human mind is is it just

3394
02:03:26,158 --> 02:03:31,920
like one small step in a long journey of

3395
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:31,920
evolution

3396
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:37,360
well if the beauty of the human mind is

3397
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:39,679
the ability

3398
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:42,799
of us all to

3399
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:43,679
be creative

3400
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:46,159
to

3401
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:48,000
explore

3402
02:03:46,158 --> 02:03:50,078
i

3403
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,639
that's one kind of beauty

3404
02:03:50,078 --> 02:03:53,759
another kind of beauty is

3405
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:55,599
the

3406
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:57,440
empathy

3407
02:03:55,599 --> 02:04:00,159
that we can show and we think of that as

3408
02:03:57,439 --> 02:04:00,960
beautiful because it is a kind of rare

3409
02:04:00,158 --> 02:04:02,719
and

3410
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:05,279
uh and special

3411
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:09,198
ability compared to

3412
02:04:05,279 --> 02:04:10,479
uh the sort of ordinary selfishness

3413
02:04:09,198 --> 02:04:13,519
that

3414
02:04:10,479 --> 02:04:15,678
can commonly predominate

3415
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:18,079
um i suppose we have to think of you

3416
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:20,719
know different sources for those those

3417
02:04:18,078 --> 02:04:20,719
two types

3418
02:04:22,158 --> 02:04:25,679
i suppose you know a general answer is

3419
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:28,319
that

3420
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:30,719
there has been selection in favor of

3421
02:04:28,319 --> 02:04:32,319
bigger brains which probably in general

3422
02:04:30,719 --> 02:04:33,760
has been associated with increasing

3423
02:04:32,319 --> 02:04:36,000
cognitive ability

3424
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,960
and as that has happened

3425
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,520
i

3426
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:41,039
the complexity of life

3427
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:42,639
has increased

3428
02:04:41,039 --> 02:04:44,639
because

3429
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:45,760
people have more and more

3430
02:04:44,639 --> 02:04:48,480
complex

3431
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:51,119
highly differentiated strategies in

3432
02:04:48,479 --> 02:04:53,198
response to each other's more complex

3433
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:54,960
highly differentiated strategies

3434
02:04:53,198 --> 02:04:57,839
and we get to a point where there is

3435
02:04:54,960 --> 02:05:00,480
deception and self-deception

3436
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:03,679
there is some

3437
02:05:00,479 --> 02:05:06,000
a manipulation of ideas through

3438
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:07,520
stories that we invent and stories that

3439
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,719
we pass on

3440
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:10,719
um

3441
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:13,520
you know i guess all i'm

3442
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:15,679
wanting to say is that

3443
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:17,199
there is a world of

3444
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:18,960
the mind

3445
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:22,479
that

3446
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:25,520
evolves in response

3447
02:05:22,479 --> 02:05:27,598
to these platforms that are put there

3448
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:29,040
you know the platform of

3449
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:31,840
increasing brain size and therefore

3450
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:34,960
cognitive ability made possible by

3451
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:35,760
uh increased energy supply the platform

3452
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,920
of

3453
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:40,639
uh cooperation and

3454
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:42,800
tolerance in a world in which there

3455
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:45,760
remains a lot of conflict

3456
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:48,079
and therefore a need to respond to the

3457
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:49,920
conflict and manipulate your allies

3458
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:52,399
appropriately

3459
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:53,840
you know i don't see beauty as coming uh

3460
02:05:52,399 --> 02:05:56,158
either kind of beauty is coming so

3461
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:57,520
totally independently of these things

3462
02:05:56,158 --> 02:05:58,799
um you know i don't think there's a

3463
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,599
selection

3464
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:01,520
for

3465
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:02,639
staring into the sunset and creating

3466
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:04,800
poetry

3467
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:05,920
yes you know but um i guess sexual

3468
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:07,360
selection

3469
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:09,920
you know males

3470
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:11,519
wanting to impress females in different

3471
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:13,599
ways will lead to

3472
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:15,040
um them wanting to

3473
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:17,520
very poetry

3474
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:18,880
well yes you know show off yeah

3475
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:21,599
in all the different ways so all of

3476
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:23,840
these are natural consequences of uh

3477
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:25,599
just coming up with strategies of how to

3478
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:27,440
cooperate and

3479
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:30,078
how to achieve certain ends so that's

3480
02:06:27,439 --> 02:06:31,439
just like a natural

3481
02:06:30,078 --> 02:06:33,039
i mean we haven't spoken about sexual

3482
02:06:31,439 --> 02:06:35,598
selection but but that is a really

3483
02:06:33,039 --> 02:06:38,078
important part of it you know they

3484
02:06:35,599 --> 02:06:39,360
trying to out-compete each other in

3485
02:06:38,078 --> 02:06:42,399
um

3486
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:44,960
normally without any physical conflict

3487
02:06:42,399 --> 02:06:47,439
uh just in order to be able to be chosen

3488
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:50,239
by mates of the opposite sex and and

3489
02:06:47,439 --> 02:06:52,960
that that is certainly a major source of

3490
02:06:50,238 --> 02:06:52,959
creativity

3491
02:06:53,279 --> 02:06:57,439
so

3492
02:06:54,238 --> 02:06:59,519
you've studied chimps you also all the

3493
02:06:57,439 --> 02:07:01,439
other relatives gorillas what do you

3494
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:03,920
find beautiful and fascinating about

3495
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:05,598
chimps about gorillas about humans maybe

3496
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:08,000
you can paint the the whole picture of

3497
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:10,800
that evolutionary that little local

3498
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,960
pocket of the evolutionary tree

3499
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:14,880
how are we related what is the common

3500
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:16,800
ancestor what are the interesting

3501
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:18,159
differences i know i'm asking a million

3502
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,960
questions but

3503
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:21,679
um

3504
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:23,679
can you paint a map of

3505
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:25,760
what are chimps gorillas and humans like

3506
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:29,039
how we're related and what you find

3507
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:29,039
fascinating about each

3508
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:33,678
in africa

3509
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:37,279
straddling the equator

3510
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:38,399
there is a strip of rainforest

3511
02:07:37,279 --> 02:07:41,519
that

3512
02:07:38,399 --> 02:07:43,679
relies on the combination of

3513
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:46,639
high temperatures and rainfall that you

3514
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:49,440
get around the equator

3515
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:51,760
that rainforest goes into about

3516
02:07:49,439 --> 02:07:53,759
22 countries

3517
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,679
and throughout those countries uh you

3518
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:57,920
have chimpanzees although they've gone

3519
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:58,880
extinct in two of them

3520
02:07:57,920 --> 02:07:59,840
i

3521
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:01,440
in

3522
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:03,199
uh

3523
02:08:01,439 --> 02:08:06,799
just a fraction of them but i was at

3524
02:08:03,198 --> 02:08:08,399
sorry five countries uh you've got

3525
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:10,239
gorillas

3526
02:08:08,399 --> 02:08:12,799
where there are mountains

3527
02:08:10,238 --> 02:08:14,479
and in one country on the left bank of

3528
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:17,520
the great congo river

3529
02:08:14,479 --> 02:08:19,198
you have bonobos

3530
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:21,119
so in the african forest you've got

3531
02:08:19,198 --> 02:08:23,118
these three african apes the only

3532
02:08:21,118 --> 02:08:24,399
african apes

3533
02:08:23,118 --> 02:08:25,279
all of which

3534
02:08:24,399 --> 02:08:27,279
are

3535
02:08:25,279 --> 02:08:28,639
very similar in

3536
02:08:27,279 --> 02:08:30,238
much of their

3537
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:32,000
way of life

3538
02:08:30,238 --> 02:08:33,678
they walk on their knuckles

3539
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,560
through the forest looking for fruit

3540
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:36,480
trees

3541
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:40,239
and eating

3542
02:08:36,479 --> 02:08:40,238
herbs when they can't find fruits

3543
02:08:41,198 --> 02:08:46,000
gorillas

3544
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:47,599
represent the oldest chain

3545
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,679
so about

3546
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:51,679
10 million years ago maybe as recently

3547
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:54,078
as 8 million years ago

3548
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:56,000
the ancestral gorillas broke off from

3549
02:08:54,078 --> 02:08:58,238
the ancestor leading to chimps and

3550
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,479
bonobos and humans

3551
02:08:58,238 --> 02:09:02,479
so they probably remained very similar

3552
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:04,638
now to what

3553
02:09:02,479 --> 02:09:06,158
very similar to what they were then they

3554
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:07,039
were probably

3555
02:09:06,158 --> 02:09:10,238
um

3556
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:13,439
the largest apes uh living in mountain

3557
02:09:10,238 --> 02:09:16,078
areas and uh spending more time

3558
02:09:13,439 --> 02:09:19,039
uh eating just uh

3559
02:09:16,078 --> 02:09:22,158
herbs stems

3560
02:09:19,039 --> 02:09:23,118
not so vitally dependent on fruit

3561
02:09:22,158 --> 02:09:24,879
and

3562
02:09:23,118 --> 02:09:27,118
living in um

3563
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:30,560
if there was like the present

3564
02:09:27,118 --> 02:09:31,359
uh groups up to about 50 stable groups

3565
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:36,000
with

3566
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:36,000
one alpha male who was in charge

3567
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:41,199
gorillas are

3568
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:43,119
wonderfully

3569
02:09:41,198 --> 02:09:45,519
slow

3570
02:09:43,118 --> 02:09:47,118
and inquisitive compared to chimps and

3571
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:48,400
bonobos yeah

3572
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:49,920
and i had the

3573
02:09:48,399 --> 02:09:51,039
privilege of

3574
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:53,760
um

3575
02:09:51,039 --> 02:09:55,760
spending uh a week or two with

3576
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:58,639
gorillas um

3577
02:09:55,760 --> 02:10:02,960
at diane fossey's camp when before she

3578
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:03,760
was murdered and i i i went out

3579
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:05,359
with

3580
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:07,360
two women

3581
02:10:05,359 --> 02:10:09,279
kelly and bob

3582
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:10,319
to a particular group

3583
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:12,399
and

3584
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:15,920
there was a young female in the group

3585
02:10:12,399 --> 02:10:19,439
called simba and simba approached us

3586
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:20,880
and stared at the two women and then she

3587
02:10:19,439 --> 02:10:22,000
came towards me

3588
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:23,359
and

3589
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,000
she

3590
02:10:23,359 --> 02:10:30,238
very deliberately reached out her

3591
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,238
knuckles and touched me on the forehead

3592
02:10:30,479 --> 02:10:35,039
she was watched in doing this

3593
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:35,920
by a young male who was quite keen on

3594
02:10:35,039 --> 02:10:37,920
her

3595
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:40,239
and he was called digit

3596
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:41,359
and about five minutes later

3597
02:10:40,238 --> 02:10:44,000
digit

3598
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:47,118
stood in front of us on the path

3599
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:50,000
and kelly was in front of me uh and then

3600
02:10:47,118 --> 02:10:51,839
there was bob and then there was me

3601
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:54,000
and he came charging down the path and

3602
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:55,920
he sidestepped around kelly and he

3603
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,960
sidestepped around barb

3604
02:10:55,920 --> 02:11:00,000
and me

3605
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:04,319
he just knocked with his arm and sent me

3606
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:04,319
flying about five yards into the bushes

3607
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:08,880
and i loved the way that

3608
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:10,960
that was a very deliberate response and

3609
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:14,239
i loved the way that simba had been so

3610
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:16,800
interested in me and and held my eye

3611
02:11:14,238 --> 02:11:18,559
chimps and bonobos never hold your eye

3612
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:20,000
but gorillas really look as though

3613
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:22,400
they're trying to figure out what are

3614
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,399
you thinking

3615
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:28,319
about that was

3616
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:30,158
a species that has goes back for

3617
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:31,840
something like 10 million years in that

3618
02:11:30,158 --> 02:11:34,000
situation

3619
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:35,199
was there a game being played

3620
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,679
um

3621
02:11:35,198 --> 02:11:39,519
well i mean i i felt that digit was

3622
02:11:37,679 --> 02:11:42,399
telling me i don't want you messing with

3623
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:43,599
with simba or was simba

3624
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:44,719
using you

3625
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:47,119
oh i see

3626
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:49,118
well that's a fun idea uh i don't see

3627
02:11:47,118 --> 02:11:51,759
why she should be using me but you mean

3628
02:11:49,118 --> 02:11:53,679
testing how strongly the affection

3629
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:54,960
preferred to intervene too yeah exactly

3630
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:56,560
oh that's that's

3631
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:58,319
that's comes straight out of a sort of

3632
02:11:56,560 --> 02:12:00,159
adolescent to high school playbook all

3633
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:02,238
right well that's that's no no there's

3634
02:12:00,158 --> 02:12:03,598
nothing wrong with it brother for that

3635
02:12:02,238 --> 02:12:05,919
um yeah

3636
02:12:03,599 --> 02:12:08,560
i don't know i never thought of that and

3637
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:08,560
you never know

3638
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,599
so

3639
02:12:10,479 --> 02:12:16,158
so yeah so okay so this is an ancient

3640
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:19,119
branch of the evolutionary tree uh this

3641
02:12:16,158 --> 02:12:20,719
gorilla that led to gorillas gorillas um

3642
02:12:19,118 --> 02:12:22,559
so then the next thing that happened on

3643
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:24,480
the evolutionary tree was uh six or

3644
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:25,520
seven million years ago when

3645
02:12:24,479 --> 02:12:27,759
uh

3646
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:30,320
you have uh the line

3647
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:34,000
uh between chimps and bonobos on the one

3648
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:36,158
hand and humans on the other splitting

3649
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,479
and basically what happened is that

3650
02:12:36,158 --> 02:12:39,359
at that point a chimp-like ancestor

3651
02:12:38,479 --> 02:12:41,759
uh

3652
02:12:39,359 --> 02:12:44,078
leaves the forest

3653
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:45,679
gets isolated in an area outside the

3654
02:12:44,078 --> 02:12:47,279
forest and adapts and that becomes the

3655
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:49,520
astrological scenes and meanwhile the

3656
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:51,439
chimpanzees

3657
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:53,440
and bonobo ancestor continues in the

3658
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:54,638
forest

3659
02:12:53,439 --> 02:12:57,198
and

3660
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:59,039
later what happens is that one branch of

3661
02:12:57,198 --> 02:13:01,118
that crosses the congo river and becomes

3662
02:12:59,039 --> 02:13:02,560
the bonobos

3663
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:05,198
that was only about two million years

3664
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:06,880
ago maybe one million years ago

3665
02:13:05,198 --> 02:13:08,719
now the chimps that remained in the

3666
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:10,719
forest throughout this time and occupied

3667
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:13,118
all the countries across uh from east

3668
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:15,439
west to east africa now

3669
02:13:13,118 --> 02:13:18,479
um again we assume that they're pretty

3670
02:13:15,439 --> 02:13:20,799
similar to the ones that live nowadays

3671
02:13:18,479 --> 02:13:21,678
whether some variation from from west to

3672
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:24,320
east

3673
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:28,960
and these are animals that live in

3674
02:13:24,319 --> 02:13:31,439
social communities of between say 20 and

3675
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:33,840
200. they have a lot of them in one

3676
02:13:31,439 --> 02:13:35,359
group but they never come together in a

3677
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:38,719
single unit

3678
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:39,839
these are they share an area a community

3679
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:42,078
territory

3680
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:44,078
and that area is defended by males and

3681
02:13:42,078 --> 02:13:46,078
within it females wander and bring up

3682
02:13:44,078 --> 02:13:47,439
their young independently

3683
02:13:46,078 --> 02:13:52,078
and

3684
02:13:47,439 --> 02:13:54,319
the females are very scared about

3685
02:13:52,078 --> 02:13:56,960
the possibility that males will be mean

3686
02:13:54,319 --> 02:13:58,639
to their infants and in order to

3687
02:13:56,960 --> 02:14:01,920
avoid them doing that

3688
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:04,560
they do their best to mate with every

3689
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:07,440
single male in the group multiple times

3690
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:09,199
as if to give a memory in that mail of

3691
02:14:07,439 --> 02:14:11,439
yeah yeah i remembered you so i'm not

3692
02:14:09,198 --> 02:14:13,439
going to be mean to your baby

3693
02:14:11,439 --> 02:14:15,118
so what's wonderful about gyms well you

3694
02:14:13,439 --> 02:14:17,919
know as we've spoken about them yeah

3695
02:14:15,118 --> 02:14:20,000
they are creative and um uh and so

3696
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:21,760
amazingly human-like

3697
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:24,800
but i love the the sort of you know the

3698
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:27,119
quiet moments and and here's one

3699
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:30,400
um i've got uh

3700
02:14:27,118 --> 02:14:32,319
uh two chimps who are uh grooming each

3701
02:14:30,399 --> 02:14:33,598
other on a day when they are utterly

3702
02:14:32,319 --> 02:14:35,439
exhausted

3703
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:38,840
they've walked um

3704
02:14:35,439 --> 02:14:40,638
11 kilometers the day before up and down

3705
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:42,719
hills and

3706
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:44,319
on this particular day all they do is

3707
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:46,000
they get to one tree

3708
02:14:44,319 --> 02:14:48,399
and they eat from that tree and other

3709
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:50,238
than that they only walk about 100 yards

3710
02:14:48,399 --> 02:14:52,319
and they go back to sleep in the nest in

3711
02:14:50,238 --> 02:14:54,959
which they woke up

3712
02:14:52,319 --> 02:14:56,639
so they're utterly exhausted um

3713
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:58,239
and they're just eating non-stop because

3714
02:14:56,639 --> 02:14:59,760
they're trying to recover uh their

3715
02:14:58,238 --> 02:15:03,198
energy

3716
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:04,480
and this is uh hugh and charlie and we

3717
02:15:03,198 --> 02:15:06,719
think they were probably brothers so we

3718
02:15:04,479 --> 02:15:08,479
never actually got the genetic evidence

3719
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:10,078
to prove it

3720
02:15:08,479 --> 02:15:12,158
well um

3721
02:15:10,078 --> 02:15:14,319
i never remember now who it is but let's

3722
02:15:12,158 --> 02:15:17,039
say that

3723
02:15:14,319 --> 02:15:18,639
they both come down from the tree

3724
02:15:17,039 --> 02:15:19,760
and um

3725
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:22,719
they're both

3726
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:23,920
carrying branches of the food they're

3727
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:24,960
eating actually seeds from these

3728
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:26,960
branches

3729
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:29,198
they're both engaged

3730
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:30,960
even in the midday sun when they want to

3731
02:15:29,198 --> 02:15:32,479
come down and

3732
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,439
unshade themselves for a bit on the

3733
02:15:32,479 --> 02:15:36,000
ground

3734
02:15:33,439 --> 02:15:38,158
um they're still eating but then charlie

3735
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:42,479
finishes his branch

3736
02:15:38,158 --> 02:15:44,479
and he starts grooming hugh

3737
02:15:42,479 --> 02:15:45,439
and

3738
02:15:44,479 --> 02:15:48,879
hugh

3739
02:15:45,439 --> 02:15:51,439
continues eating from his branch

3740
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:53,118
charlie eventually gets bored of this

3741
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:55,359
after a few minutes

3742
02:15:53,118 --> 02:15:56,559
and he reaches out

3743
02:15:55,359 --> 02:15:59,039
and he

3744
02:15:56,560 --> 02:16:01,199
lifts the branch from which hugh is

3745
02:15:59,039 --> 02:16:02,000
still taking seeds

3746
02:16:01,198 --> 02:16:03,919
and

3747
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:07,039
puts it over his head and puts it behind

3748
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:08,560
his back as far as possible away from

3749
02:16:07,039 --> 02:16:10,479
you

3750
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:12,480
hugh doesn't do anything

3751
02:16:10,479 --> 02:16:15,039
he just finishes his mouthful and then

3752
02:16:12,479 --> 02:16:16,959
he turns to charlie and grooms him so

3753
02:16:15,039 --> 02:16:19,679
this very polite way of saying will you

3754
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:21,359
groom me please has worked

3755
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:22,480
then

3756
02:16:21,359 --> 02:16:25,439
hugh

3757
02:16:22,479 --> 02:16:28,319
grooms around charlie's back

3758
02:16:25,439 --> 02:16:30,238
and around our to the right side and

3759
02:16:28,319 --> 02:16:32,879
then down his arm to what point where he

3760
02:16:30,238 --> 02:16:34,879
can reach the branch again

3761
02:16:32,879 --> 02:16:36,079
and then he picks up the branch and

3762
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:38,398
continues

3763
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:39,679
nonchalantly right yeah so in other

3764
02:16:38,398 --> 02:16:41,599
words you know

3765
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:43,760
a very sort of simple little strategy

3766
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:45,439
yeah but it just shows the the courtesy

3767
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:46,960
with which they can

3768
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:49,280
treat each other

3769
02:16:46,959 --> 02:16:50,558
and you know the days i love with gym so

3770
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:51,519
when you see that sort of thing or when

3771
02:16:50,558 --> 02:16:54,159
you see

3772
02:16:51,519 --> 02:16:56,719
mothers just lying in a sunlit patch in

3773
02:16:54,159 --> 02:16:58,959
the forest with babies bouncing on top

3774
02:16:56,718 --> 02:17:01,438
of them um just

3775
02:16:58,959 --> 02:17:02,879
having a a wonderful peaceful time and

3776
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:05,920
that's you know that's what most of

3777
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:08,959
their lives are like

3778
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:11,359
so chimpanzees are the

3779
02:17:08,959 --> 02:17:13,839
species that kind of unites the rest of

3780
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:15,760
the apes because a gorilla is in many

3781
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:18,398
ways a just a big version of a

3782
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:20,398
chimpanzee if you can sort of engineer a

3783
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:22,398
chimpanzee in your mind to be bigger it

3784
02:17:20,398 --> 02:17:24,159
basically turns into a gorilla

3785
02:17:22,398 --> 02:17:26,840
and then bonobos

3786
02:17:24,159 --> 02:17:28,478
on the left bank of the congo river

3787
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:31,040
are a

3788
02:17:28,478 --> 02:17:32,638
like a domesticated form of

3789
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:33,760
of chimpanzee but obviously humans

3790
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:36,000
didn't domesticate them so they're

3791
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:38,478
self-domesticated they are less

3792
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,478
aggressive and they show all the marks

3793
02:17:38,478 --> 02:17:43,039
of domestication that domesticated

3794
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:44,558
animals do in compared to wild animals

3795
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:46,639
in their bones

3796
02:17:44,558 --> 02:17:48,159
so they have reduced differences between

3797
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:49,679
males and females in which the males are

3798
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:51,119
more like females they have smaller

3799
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:54,239
brains they have

3800
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:55,519
shorter faces smaller teeth and smaller

3801
02:17:54,239 --> 02:17:56,959
bodies

3802
02:17:55,519 --> 02:18:00,159
all the things that domesticate animals

3803
02:17:56,959 --> 02:18:03,518
show and and bonobos live in this

3804
02:18:00,159 --> 02:18:06,799
environment in a strikingly peaceful way

3805
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:08,880
compared to the chimpanzees there's no

3806
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:10,799
indication that they will have these

3807
02:18:08,879 --> 02:18:12,799
aggressive kills

3808
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:14,079
and enough data now to show that there's

3809
02:18:12,799 --> 02:18:16,398
a statistical difference in the

3810
02:18:14,079 --> 02:18:19,920
frequency of which it would happen

3811
02:18:16,398 --> 02:18:21,599
and um and bonobos are famously uh

3812
02:18:19,920 --> 02:18:26,159
erotic

3813
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:27,359
the females have enlarged sexual

3814
02:18:26,159 --> 02:18:29,519
parts

3815
02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:31,840
which swell to a particularly

3816
02:18:29,519 --> 02:18:33,679
large size compared to the

3817
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:36,639
female chimpanzees

3818
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:38,638
and the females have a lot of

3819
02:18:36,638 --> 02:18:41,199
interactions with each other in which

3820
02:18:38,638 --> 02:18:44,159
they excitedly rub their clitorises

3821
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:46,880
together and um and appear to have

3822
02:18:44,159 --> 02:18:48,718
orgasms and wow these occur in the

3823
02:18:46,879 --> 02:18:50,318
context of

3824
02:18:48,718 --> 02:18:52,799
um

3825
02:18:50,318 --> 02:18:54,159
some kind of social tension and they

3826
02:18:52,799 --> 02:18:55,920
sometimes happen before this sounds

3827
02:18:54,159 --> 02:18:59,439
happen after the social tension and they

3828
02:18:55,920 --> 02:19:02,239
seem to be devices uh these interactions

3829
02:18:59,439 --> 02:19:04,079
for um ensuring that everyone's friends

3830
02:19:02,239 --> 02:19:05,599
and uh reducing the chances that they're

3831
02:19:04,079 --> 02:19:07,359
actually going to get into a fight this

3832
02:19:05,599 --> 02:19:09,760
is a kind of uh

3833
02:19:07,359 --> 02:19:11,679
conflict resolution through uh

3834
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:13,599
through through sex or some kind of

3835
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:15,439
pleasurable sexual experience well it's

3836
02:19:13,599 --> 02:19:18,239
often characterized as make love not war

3837
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:19,439
that's right make love not war

3838
02:19:18,239 --> 02:19:21,039
okay

3839
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:23,359
uh

3840
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:26,639
you uh mentioned to me offline that you

3841
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:29,679
you have a deep love for nature

3842
02:19:26,638 --> 02:19:32,318
if we look at the world today

3843
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:35,679
how can we ensure that

3844
02:19:32,318 --> 02:19:37,840
the beautiful parts of nature

3845
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:39,519
remain a big part of our lives

3846
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:41,200
as human beings

3847
02:19:39,519 --> 02:19:42,239
and in the way we think about it in the

3848
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:46,079
way

3849
02:19:42,239 --> 02:19:47,760
we also keep it around preserve it

3850
02:19:46,079 --> 02:19:50,799
you know we keep it part of our minds

3851
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:50,800
and part of our world

3852
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:55,040
it's a

3853
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:56,560
very difficult question

3854
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,960
because

3855
02:19:56,559 --> 02:20:03,199
every time there is a conflict between

3856
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:04,959
conservation of a natural habitat and

3857
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:07,280
allowing people to

3858
02:20:04,959 --> 02:20:08,318
get a little bit of extra food for their

3859
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:09,280
babies

3860
02:20:08,318 --> 02:20:10,478
then

3861
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:13,920
naturally

3862
02:20:10,478 --> 02:20:16,478
the tendency is for the humans to win

3863
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:17,600
so we have this steady

3864
02:20:16,478 --> 02:20:19,279
erosion

3865
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:22,079
in the face of

3866
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:25,200
tremendous efforts to conserve nature

3867
02:20:22,079 --> 02:20:28,159
we have a continuing steady erosion of

3868
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:30,000
habitats and all the species and the

3869
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:31,680
numbers are always in the wrong

3870
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:33,439
direction

3871
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:36,398
occasionally you get sort of wonderful

3872
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:37,200
little examples of something being saved

3873
02:20:36,398 --> 02:20:40,159
but

3874
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:41,439
the overall trend is clear

3875
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:44,559
and it's very difficult to see how one

3876
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:45,920
can ever escape that because it's not

3877
02:20:44,559 --> 02:20:48,799
human

3878
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:50,239
i know that we are essentially a single

3879
02:20:48,799 --> 02:20:51,599
tribe

3880
02:20:50,239 --> 02:20:54,879
to

3881
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:57,439
want to save an elephant if it means

3882
02:20:54,879 --> 02:21:00,559
killing 20 humans

3883
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:02,239
so i think the only way in which we can

3884
02:21:00,559 --> 02:21:03,760
really conserve

3885
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:04,959
is if we

3886
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:06,559
uh put

3887
02:21:04,959 --> 02:21:07,599
tremendous effort

3888
02:21:06,559 --> 02:21:09,279
into

3889
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:10,840
conserving

3890
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:15,280
the very best

3891
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:16,719
representative areas of nature

3892
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:18,720
often this will be the national parks

3893
02:21:16,719 --> 02:21:21,358
that already exist

3894
02:21:18,719 --> 02:21:24,318
and what we have to do is to make them

3895
02:21:21,359 --> 02:21:27,120
so valuable that actually it is worth it

3896
02:21:24,318 --> 02:21:30,000
in terms of human survival to be able to

3897
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:30,880
keep those sorts of places

3898
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,040
and

3899
02:21:30,879 --> 02:21:34,799
you know that's the attitude that uh

3900
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:35,920
my colleagues and i have taken in uganda

3901
02:21:34,799 --> 02:21:37,920
where

3902
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:40,559
we want to

3903
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:41,840
keep the kibani national park alive

3904
02:21:40,559 --> 02:21:43,760
which has got the largest population

3905
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:45,280
chimpanzees in uganda and it's got

3906
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:46,478
elephants and wonderful birds and

3907
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:47,840
wonderful butterflies and wonderful

3908
02:21:46,478 --> 02:21:50,559
plants and so on

3909
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:52,880
and um and visitors

3910
02:21:50,559 --> 02:21:54,719
and lots and lots of visitors it may be

3911
02:21:52,879 --> 02:21:57,358
that we're going to have to have

3912
02:21:54,719 --> 02:21:59,920
huge increases in the amount of

3913
02:21:57,359 --> 02:22:01,760
charges that you pay for eco-tourism and

3914
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:03,280
you need to make sure the ecotourism is

3915
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:06,079
done right

3916
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:08,640
in other places you will

3917
02:22:06,079 --> 02:22:09,680
keep nature there because it's useful

3918
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:11,199
for

3919
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:13,359
um

3920
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:16,000
maintaining the climate uh

3921
02:22:13,359 --> 02:22:19,680
you're bringing rain uh

3922
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:24,478
maybe uh you can in some places

3923
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:27,040
uh convince people of the sheer sort of

3924
02:22:24,478 --> 02:22:28,719
aesthetics of keeping nature

3925
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:30,399
that

3926
02:22:28,719 --> 02:22:33,760
even over the long term

3927
02:22:30,398 --> 02:22:36,879
presidents whose job it is

3928
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:39,359
to look for the future of the country

3929
02:22:36,879 --> 02:22:41,279
will be persuaded that you can do it for

3930
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:44,079
purely aesthetic reasons

3931
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:44,079
but overall

3932
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:50,560
what is required

3933
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:53,600
is for people in the rich countries

3934
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:55,279
to do much more investment than

3935
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:57,359
they have so far

3936
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:59,439
in maintaining both

3937
02:22:57,359 --> 02:23:00,479
the natural places in their own

3938
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:03,439
countries

3939
02:23:00,478 --> 02:23:05,279
and in the tropics and if you look at

3940
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:08,639
africa you know i mean

3941
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:10,399
the population trends are that

3942
02:23:08,639 --> 02:23:13,039
nigeria

3943
02:23:10,398 --> 02:23:14,639
may become the most populous country

3944
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:18,120
in the world i think

3945
02:23:14,639 --> 02:23:18,119
within a century

3946
02:23:18,799 --> 02:23:23,119
future of african habitats you know it's

3947
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:25,200
clear what's going to happen in general

3948
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:27,920
there's going to be a huge conversion

3949
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:29,439
towards agricultural land

3950
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:31,840
uh

3951
02:23:29,439 --> 02:23:36,559
i heard ed wilson

3952
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:38,960
speak years ago about the prospect of

3953
02:23:36,559 --> 02:23:42,959
the entire globe being turned into a

3954
02:23:38,959 --> 02:23:42,959
single human feedlot

3955
02:23:43,359 --> 02:23:47,600
it's going to take a lot to avoid that

3956
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:50,478
he is out there

3957
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:52,239
calling for

3958
02:23:50,478 --> 02:23:54,239
half the earth

3959
02:23:52,239 --> 02:23:56,000
to be devoted to nature

3960
02:23:54,239 --> 02:23:57,439
it's incredibly ambitious and incredibly

3961
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,799
optimistic

3962
02:23:57,439 --> 02:24:01,120
but unless you have

3963
02:23:58,799 --> 02:24:03,920
really exciting goals

3964
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:06,720
probably nothing will be achieved

3965
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:08,478
yeah i mean there's something

3966
02:24:06,719 --> 02:24:10,959
to me like when i visit new york and i

3967
02:24:08,478 --> 02:24:13,358
see central park and somehow constructed

3968
02:24:10,959 --> 02:24:14,398
a situation where you preserve this park

3969
02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:16,318
in the middle

3970
02:24:14,398 --> 02:24:17,760
probably some of the most expensive land

3971
02:24:16,318 --> 02:24:19,439
in the world

3972
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:20,960
the fact that that's possible gives me

3973
02:24:19,439 --> 02:24:23,920
hope that you can do this kind of

3974
02:24:20,959 --> 02:24:25,919
preservation at a global scale

3975
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:28,159
perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons

3976
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:30,398
of just valuing

3977
02:24:28,159 --> 02:24:33,359
the beauty and um

3978
02:24:30,398 --> 02:24:35,358
just respecting our origins

3979
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:38,720
of having come from the earth

3980
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:42,079
we are so incredibly lucky to have

3981
02:24:38,719 --> 02:24:44,159
chimpanzees bonobos and gorillas as our

3982
02:24:42,079 --> 02:24:45,439
um close relatives still living on the

3983
02:24:44,159 --> 02:24:47,439
earth you know we're unlucky that we

3984
02:24:45,439 --> 02:24:49,520
don't have astrology and other species

3985
02:24:47,439 --> 02:24:51,200
of homo but we're still lucky to have

3986
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:53,359
those because they are incredibly

3987
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:54,800
closely related to us compared to what

3988
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:56,239
most animals have you know there are

3989
02:24:54,799 --> 02:24:59,358
many animals that don't have any close

3990
02:24:56,239 --> 02:25:01,199
relatives to them on the earth but not

3991
02:24:59,359 --> 02:25:02,960
only are they they're relatively close

3992
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:05,840
but they teach us so much about

3993
02:25:02,959 --> 02:25:07,438
ourselves you know they the similarities

3994
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:09,680
between them and ourselves raise

3995
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:10,398
questions that we can then test

3996
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:12,880
about

3997
02:25:10,398 --> 02:25:15,680
the extent to which our own behavioral

3998
02:25:12,879 --> 02:25:17,920
propensities are derived from the same

3999
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:19,120
evolutionary stock as in those great

4000
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:21,439
apes

4001
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:23,439
well how much is that worth you know i

4002
02:25:21,439 --> 02:25:25,760
mean we could spend billions going to

4003
02:25:23,439 --> 02:25:27,040
the mars to

4004
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:29,040
find

4005
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:30,560
evidence of bacteria there and that's

4006
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:32,720
fascinating too

4007
02:25:30,559 --> 02:25:34,559
but we should be spending billions on

4008
02:25:32,719 --> 02:25:35,840
this earth in order to

4009
02:25:34,559 --> 02:25:38,639
make sure

4010
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:40,159
that we have

4011
02:25:38,639 --> 02:25:43,439
i don't know how to say it you know

4012
02:25:40,159 --> 02:25:45,439
substantial representative populations

4013
02:25:43,439 --> 02:25:47,600
are these close relatives

4014
02:25:45,439 --> 02:25:50,479
yeah that we can meet there's something

4015
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:52,159
um like space tourism when you go out

4016
02:25:50,478 --> 02:25:53,279
into space and you look back down on

4017
02:25:52,159 --> 02:25:55,680
earth

4018
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:58,079
that's to a lot of people including

4019
02:25:55,680 --> 02:26:00,000
myself is worth a lot

4020
02:25:58,079 --> 02:26:01,680
but why is that worth a lot is because

4021
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,200
you uh

4022
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:04,559
it's humbling

4023
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:06,240
and

4024
02:26:04,559 --> 02:26:08,959
beautiful

4025
02:26:06,239 --> 02:26:11,840
in the same way that meeting our close

4026
02:26:08,959 --> 02:26:13,519
evolutionary relatives is humble and and

4027
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:16,159
beautiful

4028
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:18,479
just to know that this

4029
02:26:16,159 --> 02:26:19,200
this is what we come from this is who we

4030
02:26:18,478 --> 02:26:20,879
are

4031
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:22,479
not just for the understanding or the

4032
02:26:20,879 --> 02:26:25,519
science of it but just like something

4033
02:26:22,478 --> 02:26:29,279
about just the beauty of witnessing this

4034
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:30,800
um and it's again it's both humbling and

4035
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:33,120
empowering

4036
02:26:30,799 --> 02:26:36,079
that this place is fragile and we're

4037
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:38,160
damn lucky to be here

4038
02:26:36,079 --> 02:26:39,600
yes unfortunately the problems are

4039
02:26:38,159 --> 02:26:42,079
incredibly difficult

4040
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:45,439
to solve and there is no one solver you

4041
02:26:42,079 --> 02:26:47,680
know it has to happen from a network of

4042
02:26:45,439 --> 02:26:49,120
potentially cooperating people

4043
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:51,359
but but i mean you're so right about it

4044
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:52,960
being daunting to to think about what it

4045
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:56,159
looks like from space and i love the

4046
02:26:52,959 --> 02:26:57,279
view that herman muller expressed

4047
02:26:56,159 --> 02:26:59,119
of uh

4048
02:26:57,280 --> 02:27:01,200
being able to go out from space and he

4049
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:03,680
said the whole of life

4050
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:06,079
uh would look like a kind of rust on the

4051
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:06,079
planet

4052
02:27:06,398 --> 02:27:10,239
yeah so the aliens were to visit i'm not

4053
02:27:08,639 --> 02:27:12,159
sure they would notice the life they

4054
02:27:10,239 --> 02:27:13,920
would probably notice the

4055
02:27:12,159 --> 02:27:15,439
trees or

4056
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:18,079
ocean

4057
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:20,318
it's it's a kind of rust but let me ask

4058
02:27:18,079 --> 02:27:21,280
the big ridiculous philosophical

4059
02:27:20,318 --> 02:27:23,519
question

4060
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:24,880
of what is the meaning of this rust

4061
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:26,079
what do you think is the meaning of life

4062
02:27:24,879 --> 02:27:27,759
on earth

4063
02:27:26,079 --> 02:27:30,959
what is the meaning of our human

4064
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:33,359
intelligent life

4065
02:27:30,959 --> 02:27:36,559
well i think it's very clear that um

4066
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:37,520
we have an evolutionary story uh that

4067
02:27:36,559 --> 02:27:38,879
uh

4068
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:41,280
is only getting

4069
02:27:38,879 --> 02:27:43,119
challenged around the edges you know we

4070
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:44,720
we have a very clear understanding of

4071
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:45,920
the evolution of life

4072
02:27:44,719 --> 02:27:48,719
and

4073
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:51,680
the meaning is you know we are here

4074
02:27:48,719 --> 02:27:54,239
as a consequence of

4075
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:56,479
materialistic processes

4076
02:27:54,239 --> 02:27:56,478
that

4077
02:27:56,559 --> 02:28:00,639
began uh in our sense uh you know with

4078
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:03,200
the

4079
02:28:00,639 --> 02:28:04,799
establishment of the earth the four and

4080
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:06,640
a half billion years ago whatever it was

4081
02:28:04,799 --> 02:28:09,840
and then water and

4082
02:28:06,639 --> 02:28:12,959
oxygen and and so on um

4083
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:14,159
and you know we are the astonishing

4084
02:28:12,959 --> 02:28:16,159
uh

4085
02:28:14,159 --> 02:28:18,398
uh consequence

4086
02:28:16,159 --> 02:28:20,639
of um

4087
02:28:18,398 --> 02:28:22,559
the evolution of of cells and and

4088
02:28:20,639 --> 02:28:24,000
multicellular organisms

4089
02:28:22,559 --> 02:28:27,359
uh

4090
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:29,600
the word random is the wrong word to use

4091
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:31,439
unless you understand what it means

4092
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:32,720
you know

4093
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:35,040
it didn't happen

4094
02:28:32,719 --> 02:28:37,438
by chance but a lot of random events had

4095
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:39,280
to happen to make this possible

4096
02:28:37,439 --> 02:28:41,359
and those random events of course

4097
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:43,120
are the production of uh appropriate

4098
02:28:41,359 --> 02:28:46,000
mutations

4099
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:47,760
but the um you know the meaning of life

4100
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:49,280
is

4101
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:52,000
there is no meaning

4102
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:55,040
it's the you know the really big mystery

4103
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:57,600
of life is why is there a universe

4104
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:59,200
and that same y propagates itself

4105
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:01,680
through the whole of it

4106
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:04,079
through the whole process of it for the

4107
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:06,800
emergence of planets the virgins first

4108
02:29:04,079 --> 02:29:10,079
of all galaxies of

4109
02:29:06,799 --> 02:29:12,318
star systems of planets of

4110
02:29:10,079 --> 02:29:14,318
the proteins required to construct the

4111
02:29:12,318 --> 02:29:17,039
single cell organisms and the single

4112
02:29:14,318 --> 02:29:19,519
cell organism becoming complex organisms

4113
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:22,560
and uh some of the clever fish

4114
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:24,479
crawling out onto the land and and the

4115
02:29:22,559 --> 02:29:25,760
whole of it and then there's fire some

4116
02:29:24,478 --> 02:29:28,318
some clever

4117
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:30,398
uh clever guy or lady invented fire and

4118
02:29:28,318 --> 02:29:33,039
then now here we are

4119
02:29:30,398 --> 02:29:35,199
uh it just does seem

4120
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:37,359
speaking as a human kind of special they

4121
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:39,040
were able to reflect on the whole thing

4122
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:40,720
where the whole wonderful story is so

4123
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:42,800
much more interesting than the stories

4124
02:29:40,719 --> 02:29:44,719
produced by religion

4125
02:29:42,799 --> 02:29:47,358
yeah it is it is beautiful but it just

4126
02:29:44,719 --> 02:29:49,599
seems special that us humans are able to

4127
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:52,479
write religions and

4128
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:54,000
construct stories yeah and and also do

4129
02:29:52,478 --> 02:29:56,639
science

4130
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:59,760
that seems uh

4131
02:29:56,639 --> 02:30:02,478
that seems kind of amazing it seems like

4132
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:03,760
the universe

4133
02:30:02,478 --> 02:30:06,879
is such

4134
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:08,960
that it it um it creates

4135
02:30:06,879 --> 02:30:10,398
beings like us that are able to

4136
02:30:08,959 --> 02:30:12,559
investigate

4137
02:30:10,398 --> 02:30:14,398
it

4138
02:30:12,559 --> 02:30:16,559
and that and that that's why there's

4139
02:30:14,398 --> 02:30:18,799
this longing for why

4140
02:30:16,559 --> 02:30:20,879
it's just uh

4141
02:30:18,799 --> 02:30:23,358
such a beautiful little pocket of

4142
02:30:20,879 --> 02:30:25,599
complexity created by the universe it

4143
02:30:23,359 --> 02:30:27,439
seems like um

4144
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:28,960
it seems like there should be a y but

4145
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:31,120
maybe there's just an infinite number of

4146
02:30:28,959 --> 02:30:32,559
universes and this is the one

4147
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:34,640
that uh

4148
02:30:32,559 --> 02:30:35,840
led to this particular set of humans

4149
02:30:34,639 --> 02:30:37,119
even without an infinite number of

4150
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:39,280
universes i bet there's an infinite

4151
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:41,520
number of intelligent beings throughout

4152
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:43,120
this universe yeah now that we know how

4153
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:45,040
many planets are

4154
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:47,120
have the right sort of conditions

4155
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:49,040
you know which is what i can't remember

4156
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:50,960
a lot you know it's some significant

4157
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:52,640
percentage of all planets

4158
02:30:50,959 --> 02:30:54,478
um then

4159
02:30:52,639 --> 02:30:55,439
then there are apparently billions of

4160
02:30:54,478 --> 02:30:57,039
planets

4161
02:30:55,439 --> 02:30:59,359
and

4162
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,640
there's every i mean things happen so

4163
02:30:59,359 --> 02:31:05,680
quickly on earth you know once you've

4164
02:31:00,639 --> 02:31:07,760
got water then uh you've got life and um

4165
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:09,920
it did not take long for for life to

4166
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:12,159
evolve in in the big scheme of things

4167
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:14,639
and if you think you look out there

4168
02:31:12,159 --> 02:31:16,559
say there's a nearly infinite number of

4169
02:31:14,639 --> 02:31:19,519
intelligent civilizations

4170
02:31:16,559 --> 02:31:21,920
one dimension you could look at is the

4171
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:23,920
proclivity to violence they have it's

4172
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:27,200
interesting to think

4173
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:28,559
what level of violence is useful

4174
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:31,120
for

4175
02:31:28,559 --> 02:31:32,799
extending the life of a civilization so

4176
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:33,920
we have a particular set of violence in

4177
02:31:32,799 --> 02:31:36,239
our history

4178
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:37,840
maybe being too peaceful is a problem in

4179
02:31:36,239 --> 02:31:39,760
the early days

4180
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:42,639
uh maybe being too violent quite

4181
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:45,439
obviously is as a problem so you look at

4182
02:31:42,639 --> 02:31:47,680
viruses what kind of viruses on earth

4183
02:31:45,439 --> 02:31:49,600
propagate and succeed if you're too

4184
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:51,359
deadly that's a big problem

4185
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:52,640
uh if you're not deadly enough that's

4186
02:31:51,359 --> 02:31:53,439
also a problem

4187
02:31:52,639 --> 02:31:56,079
so

4188
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:58,479
so that is a fascinating exploration of

4189
02:31:56,079 --> 02:31:59,600
i don't see any evidence i don't see

4190
02:31:58,478 --> 02:32:02,079
where you're coming from when you say

4191
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:03,280
that being too peaceful is a problem

4192
02:32:02,079 --> 02:32:06,159
well because

4193
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:07,840
so i'll say it this way

4194
02:32:06,159 --> 02:32:09,280
death

4195
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:12,639
is a way

4196
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:14,960
to get rid of suboptimal solutions

4197
02:32:12,639 --> 02:32:16,959
so violence but there's lots of ways to

4198
02:32:14,959 --> 02:32:19,519
die without violence right

4199
02:32:16,959 --> 02:32:21,119
to me death in itself is violence

4200
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:22,720
and

4201
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:25,200
you you can i mean a lot of people that

4202
02:32:22,719 --> 02:32:26,799
talk about for example longevity and and

4203
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:29,520
disease and all that kind of stuff they

4204
02:32:26,799 --> 02:32:31,279
see death is uh

4205
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:32,880
this is the way they they talk about it

4206
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:34,239
and it's interesting to philosophically

4207
02:32:32,879 --> 02:32:35,358
think of it that way

4208
02:32:34,239 --> 02:32:37,600
death is

4209
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:40,000
it's like mass murder that's happening

4210
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:42,880
it's like people that try to from a

4211
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:44,879
biological perspective help extend life

4212
02:32:42,879 --> 02:32:46,799
they see that you're

4213
02:32:44,879 --> 02:32:47,839
you're helping

4214
02:32:46,799 --> 02:32:49,840
the most

4215
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:51,359
the biggest atrocity in the history of

4216
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:52,639
human civilization from their

4217
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:53,760
perspective

4218
02:32:52,639 --> 02:32:55,039
is

4219
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:57,439
not

4220
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:58,880
allocating all our resources to solving

4221
02:32:57,439 --> 02:33:01,439
death

4222
02:32:58,879 --> 02:33:03,119
right because death is a kind of

4223
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:04,639
violence it is the kind of murder that

4224
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:08,240
we're allowing

4225
02:33:04,639 --> 02:33:10,559
to be committed on us by nature and so

4226
02:33:08,239 --> 02:33:12,318
so the flip side of that is death makes

4227
02:33:10,559 --> 02:33:14,000
way for new life

4228
02:33:12,318 --> 02:33:16,159
for new ideas

4229
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:18,799
and so that's but but that's got nothing

4230
02:33:16,159 --> 02:33:20,239
to do with with peace versus war

4231
02:33:18,799 --> 02:33:22,318
you know i mean you you have animals

4232
02:33:20,239 --> 02:33:24,079
that are very very peaceful but but they

4233
02:33:22,318 --> 02:33:25,760
evolved just in the same way as as other

4234
02:33:24,079 --> 02:33:29,039
animals do they they just don't do it

4235
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:31,120
with with death caused by violence and

4236
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:32,560
violent death is premature death surely

4237
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:35,280
i mean you know i don't mind about

4238
02:33:32,559 --> 02:33:38,639
people dying um you know what what i

4239
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:40,640
mind about is people dying uh in the

4240
02:33:38,639 --> 02:33:43,439
in in their youth

4241
02:33:40,639 --> 02:33:45,358
prematurely but some people would say

4242
02:33:43,439 --> 02:33:48,479
all death is premature it certainly

4243
02:33:45,359 --> 02:33:51,120
feels that way it's uh

4244
02:33:48,478 --> 02:33:53,760
died too soon anyone who's ever died

4245
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:55,840
died too soon yeah well i mean if we can

4246
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:56,880
become like sequoias you know and and

4247
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:58,318
live for

4248
02:33:56,879 --> 02:34:00,318
hundreds of years and thousands of years

4249
02:33:58,318 --> 02:34:02,398
that would be great

4250
02:34:00,318 --> 02:34:03,920
do you ponder your own mortality

4251
02:34:02,398 --> 02:34:05,920
are you afraid of death

4252
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:07,840
i don't think i'm afraid of it um you

4253
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:09,040
know i'm reconciled to the fact it's

4254
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:10,159
going to happen

4255
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:13,040
um

4256
02:34:10,159 --> 02:34:15,840
i i just feel frustrated because i enjoy

4257
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:18,720
life you know and i don't want to

4258
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:18,719
to leave the party

4259
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:23,280
yeah

4260
02:34:20,639 --> 02:34:25,439
it's kind of a fun party

4261
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:27,600
i don't want to leave the party either

4262
02:34:25,439 --> 02:34:30,960
so however we got here we made one heck

4263
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:32,640
of an awesome party and you're right uh

4264
02:34:30,959 --> 02:34:35,919
having a party with a little bit less

4265
02:34:32,639 --> 02:34:37,920
violence in it is an even more fun party

4266
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:39,680

4272
02:34:46,879 --> 02:34:51,438
