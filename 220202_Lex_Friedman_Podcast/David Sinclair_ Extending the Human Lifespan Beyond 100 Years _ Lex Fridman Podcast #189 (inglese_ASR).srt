1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,240
david sinclair he is a professor

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,200
in the department of genetics at harvard

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,199
and co-director

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,638
of the paul f glenn center for the

6
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,638
biology of aging

7
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,239
at harvard medical school he's the

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,000
author of the book lifespan

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,240
and co-founder of several biotech

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,800
companies he works on

11
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,079
turning age into an engineering problem

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,000
and solving it

13
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,000
driven by a vision of a world where

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,800
billions of people can live much longer

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
and much healthier lives quick mention

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,359
of our sponsors

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,799
on it clear national instruments

18
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,238
and i simply safe and lino'd

19
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,919
check them out in the description to

20
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,919
support this podcast

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,079
as a side note let me say that longevity

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,320
research challenges us to think

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,679
how science and engineering will change

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,119
society

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,198
imagine if you can live a hundred

26
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,679
thousand years even under controlled

27
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,839
conditions like in a spaceship say

28
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,799
then suddenly a trip to alpha centauri

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,920
that is uh 4.37 light years away

30
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,599
takes a single human lifespan and on the

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,079
psychological maybe even

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,640
philosophical level as the horizons of

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,039
death drifts farther into the distance

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,159
how will our search for meaning change

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,680
does meaning require

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,080
death or does it merely require struggle

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,360
reprogramming our biology will require

38
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,079
us to delve deeper

39
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,680
into understanding the human mind and

40
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,920
the robot mind

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,080
both of these efforts are as exciting of

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,400
a journey as i can imagine

43
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,920
this is the lex friedman podcast and

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,280
here is my conversation

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,680
with david sinclair i usually feel like

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,519
the

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,640
same person when i was 12 like when i

48
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,879
right now as i think about myself i feel

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,000
like exactly the same person

50
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:51,920
that i was when i was 12 and yet

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,680
um i am getting older both body and mind

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
and still feel like time hasn't passed

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,000
at all do you um

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,200
feel this tension in yourself that

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
you're the same person

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,600
and yet you're aging yeah i have this

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,920
tension that that i'm still

58
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,438
a kid but that helps in my career

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,399
scientists need to have a wonder about

60
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,478
the world and

61
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,598
you don't want to grow up 12 year olds

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
and even younger

63
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,439
i would say 6 7 year olds i've still got

64
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,200
that boy in me

65
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,318
and i can look at things it's a gift i

66
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,919
think that i can see things for the

67
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,318
first time if i choose to

68
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,519
and then explain them as i would to a 60

69
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:25,519
or 6 year old because i

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,640
i am that mentally but on the other hand

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,360
i'm getting older right

72
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,479
i run a lab of 20 people at harvard i've

73
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
got a book i've got

74
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,719
uh you know science to do companies to

75
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,639
run and so i have to

76
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,318
and on most days just pretend to be a

77
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,719
grown up and and be mature but i

78
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,479
definitely don't feel that way

79
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,840
there's uh there's something i really

80
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,518
appreciated in

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,878
opening your book you talked about your

82
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,360
grandmother

83
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,318
and on this kind of theme on this kind

84
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
of topic

85
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,679
uh she first of all had a big influence

86
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,080
on you

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
my grandma mother had a big influence on

88
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,319
me

89
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,319
he also mentioned this poem by the

90
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:05,359
author of winnie the pooh

91
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:08,639
allen alexander milne maybe i can

92
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,159
read it real quick because i on the

93
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,799
topic of being children

94
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,359
when i was one i had just begun when i

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
was two

96
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,120
i was nearly new when i was three i was

97
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,920
hardly me

98
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,719
when i was four i was not much more when

99
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,158
i was five

100
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,719
i was just alive but now i am six

101
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,519
i am as clever as clever so i think i'll

102
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,639
be six

103
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,158
now forever and ever

104
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:37,679
um so this idea of

105
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:39,598
being six and staying six forever

106
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,519
being youthful being curious being

107
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:44,798
childlike

108
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,879
this and other things what uh

109
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,560
influence has your grandmother had in

110
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:53,120
your thinking about

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,479
life about death about uh love

112
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,920
yeah i was getting misty-eyed as you

113
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,359
read that because that that poem was

114
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,039
read to me

115
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,239
very often if not every day by my

116
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,560
grandmother who partially raised me

117
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,400
and she was as much a bohemian as an

118
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,239
artist philosopher

119
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,760
and she's one of those people that

120
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,438
wouldn't talk about the little things

121
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,959
she said i hate small talk

122
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,039
don't talk to me about politics or the

123
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,600
weather yeah talk to me about

124
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,399
human beings and culture so i was raised

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,239
on that and

126
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,478
this poem was one that she read to me

127
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:26,000
often because she knew

128
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:30,079
that the mind of a child is precious

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,560
it's honest uh it's pure and she grew up

130
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,758
during the second world war and in

131
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,079
hungary and budapest

132
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,960
witnessed the worst of humanity she was

133
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,240
trying to save

134
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,439
a whole group of jewish friends in her

135
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,120
apartment

136
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,719
saw what happened after the world war

137
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
which was um

138
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,400
there was the the russians were in

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,240
control and

140
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,399
locals weren't necessarily treated well

141
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,400
if they were rebellious which she was

142
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,079
and then there was the revolution in 56

143
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,879
which she was part of and had to escape

144
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,918
the country so she saw what can happen

145
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,360
when humans

146
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,599
do their worst and her words to me

147
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,879
expressed in part through that poem was

148
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,840
david

149
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,439
always stay young and innocent and have

150
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,918
wonder about the world

151
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,360
and then do your best to make humanity

152
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,000
the best it can be

153
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,439
and that's who i am that's what i live

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,720
for that's what i get up in the morning

155
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,600
to do is to leave the world a better

156
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,039
place

157
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,439
and show to whoever's watching us

158
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,839
whether it's aliens or some future human

159
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,038
historian that we can do better than we

160
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,038
did in the 20th century

161
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,879
you know we mentioned offline this idea

162
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,959
of bringing people back to life

163
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,159
through um through artificial

164
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,159
intelligence

165
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,840
sort of i don't know if you've seen

166
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,280
videos of

167
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,519
basically animating people back to life

168
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,719
meaning uh whether it's for me

169
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,439
personally i've been working

170
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,120
on specifically about albert einstein

171
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,639
but also alan turing

172
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,399
isaac newton and richard feynman

173
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,639
and it's it's an opportunity to bring

174
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,079
people that meant a lot

175
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,600
to others in the world and uh

176
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,918
animate them and be able to have a

177
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,840
conversation with them

178
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,839
at first to try to visually

179
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,918
visually explore the the full richness

180
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
of character that they had

181
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,478
as they struggle with the ideas of the

182
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,639
modern age sort of it's less about

183
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,000
bringing back their mind and more

184
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,240
bringing back the

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,038
the visual quirks that made them who

186
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
they are

187
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:34,478
and then maybe in the future it's using

188
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,199
the textual the visual the the

189
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,639
the video the audio data to actually

190
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,199
compress

191
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,879
down the person for who they are and be

192
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,520
able to generate text there's a few

193
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,079
companies

194
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,519
there's replica which is a chat engine

195
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,079
that was born out of the idea of

196
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,318
bringing

197
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:55,839
the the founder uh lost her friend

198
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,199
uh to uh he he got ran over by a car

199
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,159
and the initial reason she founded the

200
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,079
company was

201
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,759
trying to just have a conversation with

202
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,318
her friend she trained

203
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,360
a machine learning uh natural language

204
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,960
system

205
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,639
on the text that they exchanged with

206
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,758
each other and try she had a

207
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,319
conversation with him

208
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,960
sort of after he was gone uh and it's

209
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,879
very

210
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,159
the the conversation was very trivial it

211
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,759
was obvious that it's

212
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,800
uh you know a ai agent but it

213
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,000
gave her solace it made her actually

214
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,439
feel really good

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,439
and that's the way i wonder if it's

216
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,598
possible to bring back

217
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,959
people that are that means something to

218
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:38,079
us personally not just einstein but

219
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:41,279
people that we've lost and in that way

220
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:43,198
achieve a kind of small artificial

221
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,279
immortality i don't know if you think

222
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,478
about this kind of stuff uh well i'd

223
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,519
definitely think about a lot of things

224
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,120
that that one's a really good one

225
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,519
there's a great black mirror episode

226
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,598
about the the wife who brings back the

227
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,719
the boyfriend or husband i think one of

228
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,319
the challenges with bringing back

229
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,240
richard feynman would be to

230
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,680
to capture his sense of humor but that

231
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,879
would be awesome um but yeah bringing

232
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,959
back loved ones would be great

233
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,479
especially if uh if it's

234
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,638
you're they're young and uh they die

235
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,839
early though it may hold you back from

236
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,680
moving on that's another

237
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,959
thing that could happen as a negative

238
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
but i think that's great and i also

239
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,959
think that it's going to be possible

240
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,639
especially when we're recording some of

241
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,279
us every aspect of our lives whether

242
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
it's

243
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,478
our face or uh things we see right

244
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,199
eventually one day everything we see can

245
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,120
be recorded and then you can

246
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,560
you can build somebody's experience and

247
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,759
and thoughts uh

248
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,639
speech and and you will have replicas of

249
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,958
everybody

250
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,559
um at least digitally and physically you

251
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,639
could do that too one day

252
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,759
but that that's a good idea especially

253
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,479
because there are people that i'd like

254
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,838
to meet

255
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
and i think it's easier than building a

256
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,279
time machine one person i'd love to meet

257
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,399
is benjamin franklin

258
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,480
really well i wouldn't go back in time

259
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
um i would but i'd prefer to bring him

260
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,560
into the future and say

261
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,320
can you believe we have this thinking

262
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,239
machine in our pockets now

263
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
and he just see the look on his face as

264
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
to where humanity has come because i

265
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,080
think of him as a modern guy

266
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,839
that just was before his time yeah so

267
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
you're you're thinking benjamin franklin

268
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,240
the scientist

269
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
not benjamin flanken the political thing

270
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,959
because he'd be very upset with congress

271
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,199
right now

272
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,159
right so maybe talk to him about science

273
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
and technology

274
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,399
not uh not politics or maybe just don't

275
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,240
get him on twitter because he'll be very

276
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,440
upset with human civilization

277
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,278
you know i wonder what their

278
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,640
personalities are like

279
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,919
isaac newton it does seem complicated to

280
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,319
figure out what their personality is

281
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,159
like

282
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,720
even friedrich nietzsche who i also

283
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,360
thought about feynman is

284
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,000
we just have enough video where we get

285
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
the full

286
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,759
kind of um i mean it shows you

287
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,879
how important it is to get not the

288
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,679
official

289
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,519
kind of book level presentation of a

290
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,919
human but the authentic

291
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,278
the full spectrum of humanity you

292
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,199
mentioned collecting data

293
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,759
about a person collecting the whole

294
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,519
thing the whole of life the ups and

295
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,559
downs the embarrassing stuff the

296
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,078
beautiful stuff

297
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,239
not just the things that's condensed

298
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,759
into a book and then with finding you

299
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,519
start to see that a little bit

300
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,360
through conversations you start to see

301
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,000
peaks of like that genius

302
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,879
and then through stories about him from

303
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
others

304
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,600
and then certainly you uh the sad thing

305
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,720
about alan turing for example

306
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,800
is there's very little if any

307
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,800
uh recording of him in fact i haven't

308
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,240
been able to find recording allegedly

309
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,519
there's supposed to be a recording of

310
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,919
him

311
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,000
doing some kind of radio broadcast but i

312
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,159
haven't been able to find anything

313
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and so that that's that's that's truly

314
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,480
sad that it feels like it makes you

315
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
realize

316
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,239
how the upside how nice it is to collect

317
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,839
data

318
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,360
about a person uh to capture that person

319
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,079
there's that's the upside of the

320
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,000
modern internet age the digital age that

321
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,120
that information

322
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,039
uh yeah creates a kind of immortality

323
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,639
the and then you can choose to highlight

324
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,519
the best parts of the person maybe throw

325
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,480
away the

326
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,278
ugly parts and celebrate them even after

327
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,240
they're gone

328
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,879
so that's a really interesting

329
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,839
opportunity you um you've also mentioned

330
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,600
to me offline

331
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,360
that you're really excited about all the

332
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
different wearables and all the

333
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,039
different ways we can collect

334
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,200
information about our bodies about uh

335
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,159
well the whole thing is what's most

336
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,480
exciting to you

337
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,078
in terms of collecting the the

338
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,680
biological

339
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:30,399
uh data about a human being

340
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,199
well so i'm a biologist i find animals

341
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,320
and humans

342
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,360
as machines very interesting it's one of

343
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,680
the reasons i didn't become

344
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,560
an engineer or a surgeon i wanted to

345
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,399
understand how we actually are built

346
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:47,039
and so i think a lot about machines

347
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,879
merging with humans and the first of

348
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,480
that are the bio wearables

349
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,200
and so i talked a lot about this i wrote

350
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,360
about it um in life span the book and

351
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,800
pictured a future where you would be

352
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,639
monitored constantly

353
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,159
so that you wouldn't suddenly have a

354
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,720
heart attack you'd know that was coming

355
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,360
or you

356
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,160
you wouldn't go to the doctor and they

357
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,519
don't know if it's

358
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:09,600
you need an antibiotic or not um

359
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,039
long term how old are you how to fix

360
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,159
things what should you eat what should

361
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,120
you take what should you

362
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,000
do these devices i predicted would be

363
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
smarter

364
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,600
better educated than you than your

365
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,800
physician and would augment them

366
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,159
and then there'd be a human that would

367
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,159
just tick off to see if that it's

368
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,360
correct and they approve

369
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:29,278
i also was predicting in the book that

370
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,120
we would have video conferences with our

371
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:31,919
doctors and that medicines would be

372
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,440
delivered

373
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,039
initially by courier but eventually by

374
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,079
drones and get it to you sometimes in an

375
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,000
emergency

376
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,319
and that we could even have pills that

377
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,480
were synthesized or delivered

378
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,839
um in your kitchen and combined

379
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,240
certainly

380
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,040
what's amazing about that is that what

381
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,360
are we now

382
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,078
two years since the book came out even

383
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,519
less

384
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:53,120
and that future is basically here

385
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
already covered

386
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,720
uh 19 accelerates accelerated that

387
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,560
incredibly

388
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,839
so where we're at now in society is if

389
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,199
you if you want to pay for it you can

390
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,440
have a blood test that will detect

391
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,480
cancer 10 20 years earlier than it would

392
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,920
before it forms a tumor you can of

393
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,720
course do your genome very cheaply for

394
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,879
less than a hundred dollars now

395
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,959
there are bio wearables already i wear

396
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,200
this ring from aura

397
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,799
that i have number of years of data i've

398
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,160
been doing blood tests for the last 12

399
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,039
years with a company called inside

400
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,360
tracker which

401
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,799
i consult for and so i have all of that

402
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,959
data as well and there's

403
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,879
34 different parameters on my

404
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:32,239
testosterone my blood glucose my

405
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,919
inflammation and i use all that data to

406
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,240
of course i wear a watch that that

407
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:39,439
measure things as well i use that data

408
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,560
to keep my body in optimal shape so i'm

409
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,959
now 51

410
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,799
and according to those parameters i'm at

411
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,599
least as good as someone in their early

412
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,599
40s

413
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,759
and i if i really work at it i can get

414
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,560
my biochemistry down to

415
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,039
early to mid 30s though i like to you

416
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,159
know now

417
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,639
eat a little dessert once in a while

418
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,799
so that's the future we're in right now

419
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,399
anyone can do what i just said

420
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,240
but in the very near future just in the

421
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,879
next few years

422
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,399
you can be wearing wearables so i'm

423
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:12,000
currently wearing a little

424
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:16,000
what's called a bio sticker uh this one

425
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,958
i just put on last night uh it's about

426
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,078
an inch long a few millimeters yeah

427
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,319
people just listening it's

428
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,159
uh san diego's chest yeah it's just the

429
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,079
how does it attach it's just kind of

430
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,600
it sticks on sticks yeah so on one side

431
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,198
you have an on button that you press

432
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
the lights come on flashes four times

433
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,838
it's good to go it

434
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,639
immediately syncs to your phone and

435
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,680
this one uh the it's called a bio button

436
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,720
a nice name and there's a there's

437
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,278
another one that i have that i haven't

438
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,680
tried yet

439
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:43,278
that does ekg on your heart um this is

440
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,638
mainly for doctors to monitor patients

441
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:45,519
that go home after a heart attack or

442
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,600
surgery

443
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,799
but that's medical grade fda approved

444
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,639
device

445
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,240
so there will be a day in fact it's

446
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,919
already here that

447
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,480
doctors are using these to get patients

448
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,879
to go home and save

449
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,800
a week in hospital two thousand dollars

450
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,519
at least for each patient

451
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,319
that's massive safe um savings for the

452
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,078
hospital

453
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,519
but ultimately what i'm excited about is

454
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,278
a future that isn't that far off where

455
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,639
everybody certainly in developed

456
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,240
countries eventually these will cost a

457
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,600
few cents and rechargeable

458
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,919
the only cost will be the software

459
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,120
subscription that can be monitored

460
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,399
constantly

461
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,839
and to give an idea what this is

462
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,320
measuring me at a thousand times a

463
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,079
second

464
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,639
is my vibrations as i speak

465
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,479
my orientation it can already has told

466
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,600
me this morning how i slept

467
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,480
where i slept what side i slept on

468
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
uh we've got sneezing coughing body

469
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,000
temperature

470
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,719
heart rate heart of other parameters of

471
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,919
the heart

472
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,920
that would indicate heart health

473
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:51,278
these these data are being used to now

474
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,959
to predict sickness so

475
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,879
eventually we'll have just in the next

476
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,479
year or so the ability to predict

477
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,159
whether something or diagnose whether

478
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,600
something is pneumonia

479
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,799
or just a rhinovirus that can be treated

480
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,360
or not

481
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,719
right this is really going to not just

482
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,399
revolutionize medicine but i think

483
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
extend lives dramatically

484
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
because if i have if i'm going to have a

485
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,879
heart attack next week and that's

486
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,880
possible

487
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,958
this device should know that and i'll be

488
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,399
in hospital before i even have it

489
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,000
maybe you can talk a little bit about

490
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,958
inside tracker because i saw that

491
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,440
there's some really cool things in there

492
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,000
like it

493
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,600
actually so maybe you can talk about i

494
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,639
guess that you're collecting blood

495
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,560
and to give it the data so

496
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,079
and it has like basic recommendations on

497
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,159
how to improve your life

498
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,000
so we're not just talking about diseases

499
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,360
right like anticipating

500
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
having a particular disease but it's

501
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
almost like guiding your trajectory to

502
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,720
life how to

503
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,519
whether it's extend your your life or

504
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,360
just

505
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,799
live a more fulfilling like improve the

506
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,240
quality of life i suppose this is the

507
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,479
right way to say it

508
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,680
what how does inside tracker work uh

509
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,039
what the heck is it because i thought

510
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,198
there was also pretty cool

511
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,240
yeah what is it is it something other

512
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,000
people can use

513
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,839
you can definitely use it uh you can

514
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,440
sign up it's consumer

515
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,600
it's like a company consumer facebook

516
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,558
company it is yes

517
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,438
uh and i also want to democratize the

518
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,119
ability to

519
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,480
to just take a mouth swab eventually we

520
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,438
don't need to have a blood test

521
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,279
necessarily

522
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,120
but for now it's a blood test and and

523
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,318
you'd go to a lab core request in the

524
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,239
u.s

525
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,599
it's also available overseas you can

526
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,679
upload your own data

527
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,279
for a minimal cost and get the

528
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,880
algorithms the ai

529
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,720
in the background to take that data plot

530
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,880
where you are against others in your age

531
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,720
group as in terms of health and

532
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,400
longevity by your age they call it no

533
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,400
inner age but also

534
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,240
it provides recommendations and this

535
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,280
isn't just a bunch of bs it sounds like

536
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,880
it might be

537
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,558
to say i'll go eat this or go to that

538
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,320
restaurant and order that but it's

539
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,879
actually based on

540
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,759
they basically this company has entered

541
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,360
hundreds

542
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,119
now it would be thousands of scientific

543
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,879
papers into their database

544
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,479
and hundreds of thousands of human data

545
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,039
points and they have

546
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,240
tens of thousands of individuals that

547
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,879
have been tracked over time

548
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,160
and anonymously that data is used to say

549
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,000
what works and what doesn't

550
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,519
if you eat that what works if you take

551
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,279
that supplement what works

552
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,519
and i was a co-author on a paper that

553
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,038
showed that the recommendations for

554
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:16,798
food and supplements um

555
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,879
was better than the leading drug for

556
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,639
type 2 diabetes

557
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,799
that's so cool the idea that you can

558
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,200
connect like skipping

559
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,359
the human having to do this work you can

560
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,000
connect the scientific papers

561
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,479
almost like meta-analysis of the science

562
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,798
connected to the individual data

563
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,000
and then based on that sort of connect

564
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,400
your data to

565
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,319
whatever the proper group is within the

566
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,200
whatever the scientific paper is

567
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,879
to make the suggestion of how how like

568
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,600
how that work

569
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,600
applies to your life and then that

570
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,199
ultimately maps to like a recommendation

571
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,480
what you should do with your life

572
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,919
like it all like this giant system

573
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,400
that ultimately recommends you should

574
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,840
drink more coffee or less

575
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,679
right and and we'll have the genome in

576
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,159
there as well you can upload that yeah

577
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,200
uh and so so these programs will know us

578
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,519
way better than

579
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,880
we do and and our doctors as well the

580
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,440
idea of going to a doctor once a year

581
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,440
for an

582
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,640
annual checkup and having you know males

583
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,600
get a finger up their butt and

584
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,280
uh you know you cough that that to me is

585
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,839
a joke that's medieval

586
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,440
medicine and that's very soon going to

587
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:24,480
be seen as medieval

588
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,919
yeah it's um to me as a computer science

589
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
person

590
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,120
it's always upsetting to go to the

591
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,359
doctor and just

592
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,038
look at him and like realize you know

593
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,599
nothing about me

594
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,119
like you you're you're you're making

595
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,319
your like opinions

596
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:43,119
based on like it is very valuable

597
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,879
years of intuition building about basic

598
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,759
symptoms but you're just like it is

599
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,559
medieval

600
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,079
they're very good at it in fact doctors

601
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,599
in medieval times are probably

602
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:57,119
damn good at working with very little

603
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,439
but the thing is i'd rather pref

604
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,959
for a doctor that doesn't really know

605
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,880
what they're doing but has a huge amount

606
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,640
of data to work with

607
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,400
well you're right and many of my good

608
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,280
friends are doctors i work at hard

609
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,480
so i'm not against the profession at all

610
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,079
yeah but i think that

611
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,519
they need just as much help as anyone

612
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,720
else does

613
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,319
we wouldn't drive a car without a

614
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,640
dashboard we wouldn't think of it so why

615
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,279
would doctors do the same

616
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,880
if we could we step back to the big

617
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,798
profound philosophical

618
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,320
both tragic and beautiful question about

619
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:30,079
age

620
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,918
how and why do we age is it uh

621
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,519
from an engineering perspective he said

622
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,759
you like the biological machine

623
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,759
is that a feature or a bug of the

624
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,640
biological machine

625
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,200
it is both a bug and a feature uh

626
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,640
evolutionary speaking we

627
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,279
only live as long as we need to to

628
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,640
replace ourselves efficiently

629
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,399
if you're a mouse you're only going to

630
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
live two and a half years three years

631
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
you're probably going to die of

632
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,240
starvation predation freezing

633
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,558
in the winter so they they divert most

634
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,480
of their resources to reproducing

635
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,639
rapidly but they don't put a lot of

636
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,240
energy into preserving their soma which

637
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
is their body

638
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
conversely a baleen type of whale a

639
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,200
bowhead whale in particular will live

640
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,320
hundreds of years

641
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,080
because they're at the top of the food

642
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,480
chain and they can live as long as they

643
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,319
want

644
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,558
so they breed slowly and build a body

645
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,158
that lasts we're somewhere in between

646
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,759
because we've you know we've really only

647
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,200
just come out of the savannas where we

648
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,519
could be picked off by

649
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,038
a cat we were pretty wimpy going back

650
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,319
six million years ago

651
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:30,400
uh so we we actually need to evolve

652
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,839
quicker than evolution will and that's

653
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,798
why we can use our

654
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,000
oversized brains and intuition to give

655
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:37,599
us what evolution

656
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,440
not only didn't give us but took away

657
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,558
from us you know we're pathetic look at

658
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,320
our bodies

659
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,440
these arms if any of us even the

660
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,879
strongest person in the world went in a

661
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,159
cage with a chimpanzee

662
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,320
the chimp could knock that person's head

663
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,760
off no question so we're pathetic so we

664
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,439
need to engineer ourselves to be

665
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:55,200
healthier and longer lived

666
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,519
so getting to aging we we can do better

667
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,440
right whales do way better we're trying

668
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,000
to learn how whales do that

669
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,720
and if you ask really anybody in the

670
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,440
field now

671
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,319
professor they'll say there are eight or

672
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,240
nine

673
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,519
hallmarks of aging which are really it's

674
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,079
a it's a

675
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,558
word for causes of aging so that you

676
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,519
probably

677
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,480
have heard of some of these your

678
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,000
listeners will have a loss of telomeres

679
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,200
the ends of the chromosomes like their

680
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,679
little

681
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,440
ends of um shoelaces that kind of thing

682
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,798
they get too short cells stop dividing

683
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,840
becomes senescent

684
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:29,440
they they become they put out what are

685
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,199
called mitogens that cause cancer and

686
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,720
inflamma inflammatory molecules that's

687
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,960
another aspect of aging

688
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,720
cellular senescence another one is loss

689
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,759
of the energetic so mitochondria the

690
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,640
battery packs

691
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,759
wind down there's a whole bunch stem

692
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,000
cells

693
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,279
proteostasis well these are our achilles

694
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,519
heels that i'm talking about

695
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,319
that are common amongst all life forms

696
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:49,918
really

697
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,519
but if you wanted me to jump to the

698
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,480
chase as to where

699
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,918
what is the upstream defining factor if

700
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,319
we boil it down

701
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,600
what do we get so most biologists would

702
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,759
say you can't boil it down

703
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,519
it's too complex i would say you can

704
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,759
boil it down to an equation

705
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,200
which is the preservation of information

706
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,319
and lost due to entropy

707
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,240
i.e noise and that is the basis of my

708
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,918
research

709
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,279
it originally came out of discoveries in

710
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,679
yeast cells where

711
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,639
i went to mit in the 1990s you studied

712
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,000
bread

713
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,159
i kind of did i studied the uh the

714
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,919
makers of bread a little yeast called

715
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,799
saccharomyces cerevisiae which at the

716
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,120
time was

717
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,798
one of the hottest excuse the pun uh

718
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,678
organisms to work on yes

719
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,200
but they we we figured out in the lab

720
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,960
why yeast cells get old

721
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,880
and found genes that control that

722
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,880
process and made them live longer

723
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,240
which was an amazing four years of my

724
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,278
life

725
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,759
one of those genes had a name with an

726
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,599
acronym

727
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:52,400
sir2 now the two is irrelevant

728
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,678
the s-i-r is important and the most

729
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,320
important letter out of all of those

730
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,519
three is

731
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:59,519
i which stands for information silent

732
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,038
information regulator number two

733
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,639
when you put more copies of that gene in

734
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,798
just put in one more copy

735
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,400
the yeast cells lived 30 longer and

736
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,079
suppressed the cause of aging which was

737
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
the dysregulation of information in the

738
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,678
cell

739
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,720
and then so fast forward to now i've

740
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,278
been looking

741
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,000
in humans and mice because they live

742
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,558
shorter and

743
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,278
cheaper to study where the loss of

744
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,480
information

745
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:25,599
in our bodies is a root cause of aging

746
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,240
and i think it is your boldness

747
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,439
in viewing biology in this way is

748
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,839
fascinating

749
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,840
because that also leads to a kind of

750
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,519
uh it's almost like allows for a theory

751
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,038
of aging like like you could boil it

752
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,000
down to a single equation

753
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:47,599
and it leads to a perhaps a metric that

754
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,839
allows you to optimize

755
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,439
aging sort of in the fight against

756
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,519
entropy

757
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,038
to figure out which mechanisms like you

758
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,200
said the the silent information

759
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,960
regulator which mechanisms allow you to

760
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,519
preserve information

761
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,400
now without like without injecting noise

762
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,000
without

763
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,960
without creating entropy without

764
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,038
creating degradation of that information

765
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,440
for some reason converting biology

766
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,599
which i thought was mostly impossible

767
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,400
into an engineering problem

768
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,359
feels like it makes it amenable to

769
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,919
optimization

770
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,439
to solving problems to creating

771
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,640
technology that can

772
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,919
whether that's genetic engineering or ai

773
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,400
it makes it uh possible to uh

774
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,360
create the technology that would improve

775
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,480
the

776
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,079
the degradation of information and aging

777
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,759
is there more concrete ways you think

778
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,359
about the kind of information we want to

779
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:45,359
preserve

780
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:47,439
and also is there good ideas about

781
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,918
regulators of that information about

782
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,919
ways to

783
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,919
prevent the distortion and degradation

784
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,759
of that information

785
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,200
right so that we have some information

786
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,480
regulated genes in our bodies we have

787
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,000
seven of them

788
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,240
uh certain one through seven they're

789
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,519
called and we found in in mice

790
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
one way to slow down the loss of

791
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:06,158
information is to just give more of

792
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,278
these

793
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,200
um to up regulate these genes so we we

794
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:11,919
made a mouse that has more of this so t1

795
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,759
gene

796
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,038
turned it on and that slowed down the

797
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,119
aging of the brain

798
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,480
and preserved their information now what

799
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,359
information am i talking about you might

800
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,919
ask

801
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,959
well again you can simplify biology

802
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,120
there are two types of

803
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,079
information in the cell primarily the

804
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,000
one we all

805
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,519
read about and know about is the dna the

806
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,640
genome and that's

807
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:34,639
base four information atcg the four

808
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,400
chemicals that make up the various

809
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,759
sequences of the genome billions of

810
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,000
letters

811
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,599
and that also degrades over time but

812
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,679
what's been fascinating

813
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,038
is that we find that that information is

814
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,840
pretty much intact

815
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,200
in old animals and people you can clone

816
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,879
a dog one of my friends in l.a just

817
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,558
cloned his dog three times

818
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,080
so this is doable right it means that

819
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,079
the genome can be intact but

820
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,439
what's the other type of information

821
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,918
it's the epigenome

822
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,120
the regulators of the genetic

823
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,720
information

824
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,319
and physically that's really just how

825
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,960
the dna is wrapped up

826
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,918
or looped out for the cell to access it

827
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,079
and read it

828
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,038
so it's similar to an excuse this

829
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,759
analogy

830
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,200
but it's a good one um a compact disc or

831
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,919
a dvd

832
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,440
those pits in the foil are the digital

833
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,038
information that's the genome

834
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,960
and the epigenome is the reader of that

835
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,879
information and in

836
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,480
in a different cell you'd read different

837
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,720
music different songs

838
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,480
different symphonies and that's what

839
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,120
gets laid down when we're

840
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,960
in the womb and that gives makes a skin

841
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,239
skin cell forever a skin cell and not a

842
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,759
brain cell tomorrow

843
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,759
thank god otherwise our brains wouldn't

844
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,158
work very well but over time what we see

845
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,759
is

846
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,600
that the brain cells start to look more

847
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,679
like skin cells and the kidney cells

848
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,000
start to look more like liver cells

849
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,679
and they what we call x differentiate

850
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,558
this is a term that we use in my lab but

851
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,240
isn't yet widely used but we needed a

852
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,839
term to explain this and that those

853
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,919
that process of x differentiation the

854
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:01,119
loss of the reader

855
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:04,880
of the the cd or the dvd

856
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:07,278
we liken that to scratches

857
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,360
on the dvd so that the reader cannot

858
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,038
fully access the information

859
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,119
now we can slow down the scratches as i

860
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,319
mentioned we can turn on these genes we

861
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,278
can even put in

862
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,519
molecules into the cell or even eat them

863
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,200
and turn on those pathways which

864
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,798
which my father and i have been trying

865
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,120
to do for about a decade

866
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:25,839
to slow things down but the question

867
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,278
that i've had

868
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,720
is is there a repository of information

869
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,319
still in the body

870
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,079
because anyone who knows anything about

871
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,079
the loss of information or even has

872
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,158
tried to copy a cassette tape or

873
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,240
photocopy or xerox anything knows that

874
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,600
over time you you lose that information

875
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,919
irreparably

876
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,918
so i've been looking for a backup copy

877
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,559
inspired largely by claude shannon's

878
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,679
work

879
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:51,599
at mit as well in the 1940s

880
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,278
his theory mathematical theory of

881
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,558
communication is just brilliant and so

882
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:55,359
i've been looking for what he called the

883
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,839
observer

884
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,599
which is the backup copy we today might

885
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,599
call that the tcpi pro

886
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,599
tcp ip protocol of the internet that

887
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,959
stores information in case it doesn't

888
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,439
make it to your computer

889
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,240
it will fill in the gaps and we've been

890
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,759
spending

891
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,440
about the last five years to try and

892
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,079
find if there really is a backup copy in

893
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,399
the body

894
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:16,158
to reset the epigenome and polish those

895
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,398
scratches away

896
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,240
that's incredible so finding the backup

897
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,278
so whenever there are too many scratches

898
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,399
pile up

899
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:26,480
you can just write a new version

900
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:29,038
like right that not every new version

901
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,360
but go to the backup and restore it

902
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,398
right that's really all we're talking

903
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,959
about it's not that hard

904
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,798
once you know the trick and for people

905
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,840
that actually remember

906
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:41,200
uh like dvds and scratches on them how

907
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,519
frustrating it is

908
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,759
that that's a brilliant metaphor for

909
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,798
aging

910
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:51,359
and then the the reader is uh

911
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:53,278
is the thing that skips and then it

912
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,119
could destroy your experience

913
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,038
the richness of the experience that is

914
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,879
uh listening to your favorite song

915
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:00,158
right but in biology it's even worse

916
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,520
because you'll lose your memory your

917
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,600
kidneys will fail you'll

918
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,960
you'll get diabetes your heart will fail

919
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,839
and we call that aging

920
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,120
and age-related diseases so it's it most

921
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,519
people forget that

922
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,639
diseases that we get when we get old are

923
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,558
80 to 90

924
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,320
caused by aging and we've been trying to

925
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,038
fix things with band-aids after they

926
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:19,519
occur

927
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,359
without even generally talking about the

928
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,480
root cause of the problem

929
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:27,678
is there um the scratches

930
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,679
do those come from

931
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,840
are those programmed or are they

932
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,278
failures

933
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:39,278
meaning is it so if it's

934
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:42,000
by design then there's like a encoded

935
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,960
timeline schedule that the body's just

936
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,798
on purpose

937
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,000
degrading the whole thing and then

938
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,000
there's the just

939
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,278
the wear and tear of like the scratches

940
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,440
and a disc that happen

941
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,839
uh through time which which one is it

942
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,519
that's the source of aging

943
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,439
uh it's more akin to wear and tear there

944
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,720
isn't a program um getting back to

945
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,200
evolution

946
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,200
there's no selection for aging we're not

947
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,038
designed to age we just live as long as

948
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,480
we need to and then we're at the whim of

949
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:07,278
entropy basically second law of

950
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,759
thermodynamics

951
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,038
stuff falls apart we live a bit longer

952
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,879
than age 40

953
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,200
only because there are robust resilient

954
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,799
systems but eventually they fail as well

955
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,919
current limit to the human lifespan

956
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:22,158
where they completely fail is 122.

957
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,519
uh but so it's and i but i don't like to

958
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,399
think of it as wear and tear because

959
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,079
there's

960
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,918
there's two aspects to it there's a

961
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,879
system that's built to keep us alive

962
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,159
when we're young but actually ghost

963
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,960
comes back to bite us

964
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,519
as we get older and we call this this

965
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,240
issue

966
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,440
antagonistic pleiotropy what's good for

967
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,798
you when you're young

968
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,159
can cause problems when you're older

969
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,079
so we've been looking what what is the

970
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,760
cause of the main causes of the noise

971
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,199
and we've come we found two of them

972
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,079
definitively

973
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,679
the first one is broken chromosomes when

974
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,759
a chromosome breaks

975
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,278
the cell has to panic because that's

976
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,158
either going to cause a cancer or kill

977
00:31:57,278 --> 00:31:59,519
the cell

978
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,000
there's only two outcomes it's pretty

979
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,440
much a problem uh and so what the cell

980
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,599
does is it

981
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,200
reorganizes the epigenome in a massive

982
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,000
way

983
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,360
what that leads to is think of it as a

984
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,398
tennis match or a ping pong

985
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,759
game the proteins are the bowls and they

986
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,319
now leave where they should be

987
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,919
which is regulating the genes that make

988
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,119
the cell type whatever it is

989
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,880
and they have to they have a dual

990
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,518
function they actually go to the break

991
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,159
the chromosome will break and fix that

992
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,519
and then they come back you might ask

993
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,120
well why is it set up that way well it's

994
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,679
a beautiful system it coordinates gene

995
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,759
expression

996
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,840
the control systems with the repair you

997
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,839
want them coordinated

998
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,359
problem is as we get older this ping

999
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,798
pong game some of the balls get lost

1000
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,240
they don't come back to where they

1001
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,960
originally started

1002
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,519
uh and that's what we think is the main

1003
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,480
noise

1004
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,319
for aging and we've also the other cause

1005
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,519
of aging that we found is is cell stress

1006
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,839
we damage nerves

1007
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,720
and they age rapidly so you that's the

1008
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,398
other issue there's probably others

1009
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,919
smoking chemicals for example we know

1010
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,000
accelerates biological age pretty

1011
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,759
dramatically

1012
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,440
but the question is can you slow that

1013
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,038
down or can you reset them to get those

1014
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,519
ping-pong balls to go back to where they

1015
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,879
originally started in the game

1016
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,519
and we think we've found a way to do

1017
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,440
that what can you give me hints

1018
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,640
uh whose fault is it and the ball's not

1019
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,600
coming back is it the proteins

1020
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,399
themselves

1021
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,599
like are they are they starting again

1022
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,119
i've been obsessed with the protein

1023
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,519
folding problem from the ai perspective

1024
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,119
so

1025
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,278
is it the proteins or is it something

1026
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:30,879
else well we know who hits the balls

1027
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:33,359
um and recruits them so that the brake

1028
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,720
uh is recognized by proteins who send

1029
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,918
out a signal

1030
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,880
uh through phosphorylation is typical

1031
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,759
way cells talk

1032
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,240
to other proteins and that recruits

1033
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:44,398
those

1034
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,480
repair factors those ping-pong balls to

1035
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:46,959
the brake so the cell's actively doing

1036
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,558
this

1037
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,600
to try and help itself but we don't know

1038
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:56,798
who's to blame for them not coming back

1039
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:59,038
um that could just be a flaw in the

1040
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,240
quote-unquote design i don't think that

1041
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,480
there's something saying

1042
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,000
well one percent of you you bowls

1043
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,000
proteins never go back

1044
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,599
i just think it's hard to reset a system

1045
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,079
that's constantly changing

1046
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,639
we have in our bodies close to a

1047
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,320
trillion dna breaks every day

1048
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,079
and imagine that over 80 years what

1049
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,440
damage that does to our epigenomic

1050
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,240
information

1051
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,320
now we know that this is well i should

1052
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,918
we never know anything in biology but we

1053
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,359
have strong evidence that this is true

1054
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,559
because we can

1055
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,039
mess with animals we can create dna

1056
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,838
breaks

1057
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,599
and tickle them with a few breaks maybe

1058
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:34,639
raise it by threefold over background

1059
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,359
levels of normal

1060
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,200
breakage and if we're right those mice

1061
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,519
should get old

1062
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,279
and they do we can actually we've we've

1063
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,199
created these breaks in a way that's

1064
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,359
titratable we can it's like a rheostat

1065
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,118
we can send it to 11.

1066
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,480
you know i drove my tesla here i'm a big

1067
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,639
fan of of

1068
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,559
spinal tap two going to 11. if we go to

1069
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,679
11 we can make a mouse old in a matter

1070
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,480
of months

1071
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,079
we prefer to go to a level of about four

1072
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,079
and it gets old in 10 months

1073
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,599
but it's definitely old it's got all of

1074
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,320
the hallmarks of aging

1075
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,920
it's got diseases it looks old its skin

1076
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,838
is old it's got gray hair

1077
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,280
but importantly we can now measure age

1078
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,559
by looking at the scratches

1079
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,560
we can look at the epigenome we can

1080
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,679
measure it and use machine learning to

1081
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,039
give us a number

1082
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,559
and those mice are 50 older than normal

1083
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:22,320
so you can replicate the aging process

1084
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,400
in a controlled way you can all

1085
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,280
i mean in a way that you i mean you

1086
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,519
could accelerate it

1087
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,640
in a controlled way and measure how much

1088
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,679
exactly

1089
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,440
it's aging and that gives you step one

1090
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,118
of a two-step process to when you can

1091
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,039
then figure out what how can we

1092
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,519
reverse this and now we're reversing

1093
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,279
those mice is there a good

1094
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,358
i love what you said i mean in biology

1095
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,400
you really don't know

1096
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:51,199
it's it's such a beautiful mess uh

1097
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,480
is is there is there ideas how to do

1098
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,679
that is that on the

1099
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,519
genetic engineering level is that uh

1100
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,319
like what can you mess with

1101
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:02,159
is it going to the trying to discover

1102
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,880
the backup copies

1103
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,399
and restoring from them like what's if

1104
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,160
it's it's possible to convert it into

1105
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,838
natural language words

1106
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,519
what are the ideas here what is the

1107
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,679
observer and how do we contact it

1108
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,838
exactly what's the observer and how do

1109
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:19,358
you contact or if there's other ideas

1110
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:20,480
how to reverse the the the boss getting

1111
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,119
lost process

1112
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,519
yeah well you you can slow it down slow

1113
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,320
it

1114
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,880
but we found a reset switch recently we

1115
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:32,960
just published this

1116
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,079
in the december 2020 issue of nature

1117
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,079
and what we found is that there are

1118
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,880
three embryonic

1119
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,680
genes that we could put into the adult

1120
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,160
animal

1121
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,919
to reset the age of the tissues and it

1122
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,559
only takes four to eight weeks to work

1123
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,480
well

1124
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,239
and we can take a blind mouse that's

1125
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,760
lost its vision due to aging

1126
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,679
neurons aren't working well towards the

1127
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,480
brain reset those neurons back to a

1128
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,358
younger age

1129
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,159
and now the mice can see again these

1130
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:58,000
three genes

1131
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,440
are famous actually because they're a

1132
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,920
set of four genes

1133
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,920
discovered by shinya yamanaka who won

1134
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,760
the nobel prize in 2016

1135
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,119
for discovering that those four genes

1136
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,920
when turned on

1137
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,800
at high levels in adult cells can

1138
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,440
generate

1139
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,280
stem cells and this is i think well

1140
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,079
known now that we can create stem cells

1141
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,320
from adult

1142
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,000
tissue but what wasn't known is can you

1143
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,640
partially take age back without becoming

1144
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,400
a tumor

1145
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,920
or generating a stem cell in the eye

1146
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,680
which would be a disaster

1147
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,920
and the answer is yes there is a system

1148
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,279
in the body that can take the age of a

1149
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,000
cell back to a certain point but no

1150
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,040
further

1151
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,679
safely and reset the age

1152
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,519
and uh we're now using that to reset the

1153
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,199
age of the brain of those mice that we

1154
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:40,639
age prematurely

1155
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,399
and they're getting their ability to

1156
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:44,400
learn back

1157
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,160
this is really exciting right like

1158
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,760
what's uh what's the downside

1159
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,239
of this well the downside is if you

1160
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,760
overdo it and you don't get it right

1161
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:55,759
uh you might cause tumors but we do

1162
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,520
we do it very carefully and we also know

1163
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,720
that in the eye it's very safe

1164
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:02,400
yeah we also injected these we deliver

1165
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,199
them by viruses so

1166
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,800
we can control where and when they get

1167
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,480
turned on

1168
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,480
and in this paper we've published that

1169
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,400
if we put high levels in the mouse

1170
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,719
into their veins throughout the body

1171
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,280
they don't get cancer for over a year

1172
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,480
so i'm so optimistic that we're going

1173
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,960
into human studies

1174
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,000
in less than two years from now is there

1175
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,760
a place where ai can help

1176
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,159
sorry to inject one of the things i'm

1177
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,800
very

1178
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:33,679
excited about i'm passionate about so uh

1179
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,119
deep uh google deep mind

1180
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:38,078
recently had a big breakthrough with

1181
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:41,440
alpha fold two but also half a fold

1182
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,359
two years ago with um

1183
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,200
achieving sort of uh state-of-the-art

1184
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:49,199
performance on the protein folding

1185
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:52,239
problem single protein folding

1186
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,759
but it also paints a hopeful picture of

1187
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:54,799
what's possible to do in terms of

1188
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,480
simulating

1189
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,359
the folding of proteins but also

1190
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,719
simulating biological systems

1191
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:05,759
through ai is there something to you

1192
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:07,519
combined with this brilliant work on

1193
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,960
the biology side that you're hopeful

1194
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,039
about where ai can

1195
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,720
be a tool to help where isn't that a

1196
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,159
tool and if you're not using ai right

1197
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,598
now in biology you're getting left

1198
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,799
behind we use it all the time we're

1199
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,440
using it to generate these

1200
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,200
biological clocks to be able to read

1201
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,440
those scratches

1202
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,719
we're using it to predict the folding of

1203
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,400
proteins so we can

1204
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,879
target molecules and modulate their

1205
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,000
activity we're using it to assemble

1206
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,519
genomes of different species what else

1207
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,838
we use it to predict the longevity of a

1208
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:38,639
mouse based on how it reacts to certain

1209
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,279
things

1210
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,759
hearing eyesight generally frailty so we

1211
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,200
have

1212
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,599
we just put out a paper last year on

1213
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,960
that um

1214
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,760
the other thing we can use it for which

1215
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,599
is a little off the track here but

1216
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,280
we use it for predicting which

1217
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,400
microorganisms are in your body

1218
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,040
actually not predicting telling you so

1219
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,880
our daughter natalie was infected with

1220
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:02,960
lyme disease a few years ago

1221
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,039
almost went blind from it and the test

1222
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,880
took four days and i thought

1223
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,159
just give me the dna for my spinal fluid

1224
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,280
i'll go tell you what's in it if it's

1225
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,039
lyme disease or not

1226
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,560
they refused and so at that point i said

1227
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,880
this has to be done better

1228
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,078
so i've started a company that now can

1229
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,000
take a sample of any

1230
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,680
part of your body it's typically done

1231
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,079
now with transplant

1232
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:22,719
liver transplant patients to detect

1233
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,200
viruses

1234
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,439
that come out of their organs but that's

1235
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:29,039
that's another area that ai is extremely

1236
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,440
important for

1237
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,039
um i i think if you're not in five years

1238
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,960
if you're not using

1239
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,239
you know deep learning you've got a

1240
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,318
problem because the amount of data that

1241
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,159
we generate now as biologists

1242
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:41,599
is just terabytes can be terabytes per

1243
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:42,159
week it'll eventually be terabytes per

1244
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,160
day

1245
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,358
and then we just go from there and i

1246
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,920
actually have trouble recruiting enough

1247
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:52,318
bioinformaticians a lot of our work is

1248
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,039
now just number crunching

1249
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,079
a part of that is collecting the data

1250
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:57,199
which is kind of

1251
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,079
something we've talked a little bit

1252
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:02,639
about but is there something you can say

1253
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,480
about how we can like can collect more

1254
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:07,519
and more data

1255
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,519
not just on the one person level

1256
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:14,559
like for you to understand your like

1257
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,679
various markers but to create

1258
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,199
huge data sets to understand how we can

1259
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:21,279
detect

1260
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,960
certain pathogens detect certain

1261
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,440
properties characteristics of

1262
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,440
whether it's aging or all the other ways

1263
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,679
the human body can fail

1264
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,559
it seems like with the with biology

1265
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,000
there's a kind of

1266
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,358
privacy concerns that well actually not

1267
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,639
privacy concerns it's almost like

1268
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,199
regulation

1269
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,879
that kind of prevents like hospitals and

1270
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,159
sharing data

1271
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,039
um you know i'm not sure exactly how to

1272
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,759
say it but it

1273
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,358
seems like when you look at autonomous

1274
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,079
vehicles people are much more willing to

1275
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,480
share data

1276
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,000
when you look at human biology system

1277
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,960
people are much less willing to share

1278
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,519
data is there

1279
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,440
a hopeful path forward where we can

1280
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:00,079
share more and more data at a large

1281
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,559
scale

1282
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,160
that ultimately ends up helping us

1283
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,960
understand the human body and then

1284
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,159
treat problems with the human body so we

1285
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,838
are right in the middle

1286
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,279
we're living through what's going to be

1287
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:12,559
seen as one of the biggest revolutions

1288
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,040
in human health

1289
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,318
through the gathering of data about our

1290
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,559
bodies

1291
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,000
and 20 years ago people didn't want to

1292
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:20,559
go on social media they're worried about

1293
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,239
it now

1294
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,599
you have to if you're a kid that's for

1295
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,919
sure

1296
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,440
same with medical records these are

1297
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,200
becoming all digitized and

1298
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,440
and expanded ultimately we're going to

1299
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,639
even if we don't want to have to be

1300
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,039
monitored

1301
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,559
there's going to be a court case that i

1302
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:39,679
bet two three years from now someone's

1303
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,519
going to say

1304
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,239
how come my father died from a heart

1305
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,679
attack you had these biosensors 20 bucks

1306
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,598
and you didn't use it

1307
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,719
lawsuit right there and suddenly all

1308
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,920
hospitals have to

1309
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,719
give you one of these there will be a

1310
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,400
reversal like to where

1311
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:55,919
it's your fault if you don't collect the

1312
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,160
data that's brilliant

1313
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,200
that's and that's absolutely right i

1314
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,679
mean that's

1315
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,838
absolutely right that's the frustration

1316
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:08,639
i feel when going to the doctor

1317
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:11,279
is like you're it's almost negligent

1318
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,199
to not collect the data because you're

1319
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,920
making if there's something really wrong

1320
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,919
with me

1321
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,760
and you're making decisions based on

1322
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,440
very few tests

1323
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,200
that's almost negligent when you have

1324
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,838
the opportunity to collect a huge amount

1325
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,439
more data

1326
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:25,039
well like let me tell you something yeah

1327
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,200
like the

1328
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:28,960
i've got this inside tracker data for

1329
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,118
for myself over a decade

1330
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,880
and you'd think my doctor would roll his

1331
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,720
eyes at this oh he's gone to a consumer

1332
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,880
company blah blah blah

1333
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:39,039
i had my first checkup in a year with

1334
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,160
him through video conference

1335
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:44,719
and he was running

1336
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:45,920
blind he really didn't know what was

1337
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:46,318
going on with me he asked the usual

1338
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,720
things

1339
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:49,920
how am i sleeping how am i eating these

1340
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,239
kind of usual things

1341
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,000
and i said well i've got new tests back

1342
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,639
from inside tracker and he said

1343
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,318
great i'd love to see them so i share

1344
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,118
screen and we look at the graphs look at

1345
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:01,679
the data

1346
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,960
and he's loving it because he cannot

1347
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,960
order these tests

1348
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,280
willy-nilly so i said well let's order a

1349
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,800
hba1c blood glucose levels because i'm

1350
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,240
very interested in that that tracks with

1351
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,000
longevity and he says well

1352
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,439
i have no reason to order that do you

1353
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,239
have a family history

1354
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,480
no uh are you have any symptoms of

1355
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,838
diabetes no well i can't order the test

1356
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,679
i almost wanted to reach through the

1357
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,599
computer and strangle him um

1358
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,118
but instead you know i i pay a little

1359
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,240
bit to get these tests done and then he

1360
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,240
looks at them

1361
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,759
so that's now the way consumer health is

1362
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,358
going is that you can get better data

1363
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,400
than your doctor can and but they like

1364
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,480
you to do that

1365
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,240
quick human question maybe you can

1366
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,480
educate me

1367
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:42,318
i've i think doctors sometimes have a

1368
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,159
little bit of an ego

1369
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:45,679
i understand that the doctor is super

1370
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,000
experienced a lot of things but

1371
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:49,118
this is a fundamental question of human

1372
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,960
variability

1373
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,240
like i know a lot of specific details

1374
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,079
about like

1375
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,598
um i mean depending of course what we're

1376
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,640
talking about but there's a i bring a

1377
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,519
lot of knowledge

1378
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,159
and if i have data with me then i have

1379
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,838
like

1380
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,480
several orders of magnitude more

1381
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:06,799
knowledge and i think there's an aspect

1382
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,719
to where the doctor has to

1383
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,119
put their expert hat like

1384
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,279
take it off and actually be a curious

1385
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,960
open-minded person and study

1386
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,319
and look at that data do you think it's

1387
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,880
possible to sort of

1388
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,800
change the culture of the medical system

1389
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,519
to where the doctors are almost

1390
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,200
as you said are excited to see the data

1391
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,400
or that's already happening it's really

1392
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,078
happening now

1393
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,240
we've probably lost the last generation

1394
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,640
um that they're no hopers but

1395
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:35,838
so i teach at harvard medical school and

1396
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:37,440
they're excited about this

1397
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,440
they're excited about aging which is a

1398
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,760
new aspect to medicine

1399
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,039
oh wow we can do something about that

1400
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
and then yeah all this data what do we

1401
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,199
do with it

1402
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,480
there's still the traditional pathology

1403
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:47,039
and all that stuff which they need to

1404
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,639
know

1405
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:53,838
but time will change their

1406
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,400
their uh mindset i'm not worried about

1407
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:56,480
that

1408
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,240
and like we were discussing this isn't a

1409
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,880
question of if it's just a matter of

1410
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:00,479
when

1411
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,240
and it's you know i have a front row

1412
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,358
seat on all of this

1413
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,598
i had breakfast with with the ceo who

1414
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:09,519
uh is making this happen uh just

1415
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,838
yesterday

1416
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,759
i can tell you for sure that most people

1417
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,639
have no idea that this revolution

1418
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,119
is occurring and is happening so quickly

1419
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,639
uh

1420
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,480
if you're running a hospital and you can

1421
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:22,318
save two thousand dollars per

1422
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,159
cardiac patient what are you gonna do

1423
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:25,599
you have to use it otherwise

1424
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,078
you know the hospital down the road's

1425
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,079
gonna be beating you

1426
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,920
um and there are large hospital

1427
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,880
aggregations so there's ascension and

1428
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,400
others

1429
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,640
that just have to go this way

1430
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,519
for budgetary reasons and right now the

1431
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:44,239
u.s spends what is 17 of their gdp

1432
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,920
on healthcare for let's say one of these

1433
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,118
buttons on my chest cost 20 bucks it's

1434
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,639
rechargeable

1435
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,480
and it can predict people's health and

1436
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,519
save on antibiotics

1437
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,800
prevent heart attacks how many billions

1438
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:58,318
if not trillions of dollars

1439
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,160
will that save over the next decade

1440
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,358
yeah so when the public wakes up to this

1441
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,039
they'll almost demand it

1442
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:04,880
like this this should be this should be

1443
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,079
accepted everywhere this is obvious

1444
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,680
it's gonna save a lot of money it's

1445
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,599
gonna improve the quality of life well

1446
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:12,318
and the cfos of hospital

1447
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,000
yeah groups will have to and insurance

1448
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:16,318
companies are going to

1449
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,519
want to get in on this so now that gets

1450
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:19,039
to privacy right if

1451
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,039
should an insurance company have access

1452
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,279
to your data i would say

1453
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,440
no but you could voluntarily show them

1454
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,040
some of it if they give you a discount

1455
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,880
and that's also being worked on right

1456
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,880
now

1457
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,119
i hope we do create kind of systems

1458
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,400
where i can volunteer to share my data

1459
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,720
and i can also

1460
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,960
take the data back meaning like delete

1461
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,519
the data request the deletion of data

1462
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,079
and then maybe policy creates rules to

1463
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:43,838
where

1464
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,119
you can share data you could delete the

1465
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:48,159
data

1466
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,200
and i think if i have the option to

1467
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,358
delete

1468
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,480
all my data that that a particular

1469
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,199
company has

1470
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,760
then i'll share my data with everyone

1471
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,118
like

1472
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,160
i feel like uh if the if uh

1473
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,039
because that gives me the tools to be a

1474
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,000
consumer an

1475
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,838
intelligent consumer of giving of

1476
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,599
awarding my data to a company that

1477
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:11,119
deserves it and taking it back when the

1478
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,160
company is misbehaving

1479
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,680
and in that way encourage as a consumer

1480
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,838
in the capitalist system

1481
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,159
encourage the companies that are doing

1482
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:22,639
great work with that data

1483
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,598
well yeah health care data security is

1484
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,639
is number one

1485
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,318
on on my mind uh inside tracker

1486
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:29,679
made sure that that was true but you

1487
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:31,519
know these

1488
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:33,679
buttons on your chest there's very

1489
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,759
private stuff they can probably tell

1490
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,960
if you're having sex one night right so

1491
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,599
this is not the kind of stuff you want

1492
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,880
leaked

1493
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,480
yeah so i don't know whether it's

1494
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,960
blockchain or just for yourself i don't

1495
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,960
want this public

1496
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,400
life i guess it depends on how you how

1497
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,240
how you go but yeah

1498
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,760
uh you know there there's a lot of stuff

1499
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,519
you don't want out there and

1500
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,440
this definitely has to be number one

1501
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,400
because it you know it's one thing to

1502
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,838
have your credit card

1503
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,680
information stolen it's another thing

1504
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:59,759
health records are permanently out there

1505
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:02,239
yeah so there's on the biology side

1506
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,319
super exciting ways to um

1507
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,439
to slow aging but there's also on the

1508
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,000
lifestyle side

1509
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,440
i've recently did a 72 hour fast it's

1510
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,838
just an opportunity to take a pause and

1511
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,960
be

1512
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:14,318
you know appreciate life think about

1513
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,240
like there's something about fasting

1514
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:19,759
that um

1515
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:22,959
encourages you to reflect deeper than

1516
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,920
you otherwise might the time kind of

1517
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,920
slows

1518
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,519
and you also realize that you're human

1519
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,039
because your body needs food and you

1520
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,519
start to see your

1521
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,239
is almost as a machine that that takes

1522
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,679
food

1523
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:37,919
and produces thoughts and then

1524
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:39,679
and then ends briefly i mean there you

1525
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,760
start to depending who you are

1526
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:42,719
if you're like engineering minded you

1527
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,480
start to think

1528
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:46,159
of this whole thing as a kind of yeah as

1529
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:50,559
a machine

1530
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:52,639
and then also feelings fill this machine

1531
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,920
uh feelings of gratitude of love but

1532
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:57,358
also

1533
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,599
the uglier things of jealousy and greed

1534
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:03,199
and hate and all those kinds of things

1535
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:05,359
you start to think okay how

1536
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,879
how do i manage this body to create a

1537
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:07,759
rich experience all that comes from

1538
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,318
fasting for me

1539
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,760
anyway but there's also health benefits

1540
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,159
to fasting

1541
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,359
i intermittent fast a lot i eat just one

1542
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,759
meal a day

1543
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,598
most of the time is there something you

1544
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,400
can say about the benefits of fasting in

1545
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,359
your own life

1546
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,000
and in general the anti-aging process

1547
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:26,078
well

1548
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,920
you're a philosopher too sorry i

1549
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,480
apologize no i'm impressed

1550
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,680
uh through renaissance man uh it's it's

1551
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,760
a joy to be here

1552
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,759
uh so when it comes to fasting this is

1553
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,400
you know being abstinence is one of the

1554
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,559
the oldest ways to improve health right

1555
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,440
probably they knew this 5000 plus years

1556
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,839
ago

1557
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,519
so that's not new but what we're

1558
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,599
figuring out is what is optimal

1559
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:49,440
and how does it work and one of the

1560
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,760
things we helped contribute to

1561
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,318
which i can speak to with some authority

1562
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,480
is that these longevity genes we work on

1563
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:58,558
we showed back in the early 2000s are

1564
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,719
turned on by fasting

1565
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,480
and at least in yeast we were the first

1566
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,318
to show that how calorie restriction

1567
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,400
fasting works to extend lifespan

1568
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,079
that was the first for any species

1569
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,480
something similar happens in our bodies

1570
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,800
when we're hungry or put our bodies

1571
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,000
under any other perceived adversity such

1572
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,240
as running

1573
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,199
our bodies think wow we're getting run

1574
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,919
chased by a cyber

1575
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,679
save tooth cat or something if we're

1576
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,318
really hot or cold these probably also

1577
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,759
work

1578
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:26,079
to put our bodies in this defensive

1579
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,119
state to activate these genes in the way

1580
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,839
that whales do

1581
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,280
and mice don't and so hunger is the best

1582
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:32,880
way to do that

1583
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,119
in fact i don't think you have to feel

1584
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,400
hungry you can get used to it

1585
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,240
but if there was one thing i would

1586
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,720
recommend to anybody

1587
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:41,519
to slow down aging would be to skip a

1588
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:43,919
meal or two

1589
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,358
a day now it doesn't mean you don't have

1590
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,400
to live well you can go out i go to

1591
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:48,838
restaurants i eat

1592
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,280
regular food i try to be as healthy as

1593
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:53,358
possible but i've gone from skipping

1594
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,559
breakfast most of my life

1595
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:58,480
now to skipping lunch as well and i have

1596
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,160
my physique back that i had when i was

1597
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,639
20. i feel

1598
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,480
20 mentally i'm much sharper i don't

1599
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:06,318
feel tired anymore i sleep well

1600
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,960
so i'm a huge fan of the one meal a day

1601
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,838
thing uh where i'm not good at is going

1602
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,720
beyond

1603
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,440
one day but have you ever fasted longer

1604
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,239
than uh

1605
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,039
than them 24 hours i tried doing two

1606
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:18,639
days

1607
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,079
i might have made it to the third and

1608
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,879
given up i'm

1609
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,318
i just find that i'm i'm not ver i don't

1610
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,838
have a lot of willpower i also hate

1611
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:27,759
exercise so

1612
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,199
i'm not sure how long i'm going to live

1613
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,240
but i've managed to do one meal a day so

1614
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,439
if i can do that

1615
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:35,919
seriously anybody can do that um to your

1616
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,400
listeners and viewers i would say

1617
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,519
don't try to do it all at once you can't

1618
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,200
go from snacking

1619
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:42,719
and eating three meals a day to what i

1620
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,318
do easily

1621
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:46,159
work your way up to it but also

1622
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:48,159
compensate with drinking if you like tea

1623
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:50,318
if you like coffee put some milk in it

1624
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,000
um that's fine you can fill your stomach

1625
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:53,759
up with with liquids

1626
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,358
uh diet sodas i get criticized for

1627
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,400
drinking but i'm going to continue to

1628
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,000
have those

1629
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,680
but then you know i power through the

1630
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,358
day i definitely don't feel tired i

1631
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,279
don't have a lag anymore but give also

1632
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:05,358
give it at least two weeks because you

1633
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,480
there's a habit as well having something

1634
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:09,119
in your mouth chewing

1635
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,159
feeling that fullness you can break that

1636
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,000
habit and within two

1637
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:13,598
three weeks you'll have done it

1638
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,679
absolutely so i'm not actually even that

1639
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,000
strict about it you said that soda

1640
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:20,078
uh yeah people are very kind of weirdly

1641
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,280
strict about fasting the rules and

1642
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,920
the fasting like for example i i drank

1643
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,200
uh element electrolytes when i was

1644
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,318
fasting and that has like

1645
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,799
five calories and so technically it's uh

1646
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:34,880
not fasting or people will say like if

1647
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,400
you drink coffee there's caffeine and

1648
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,680
they'll say that's technically not

1649
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,280
fasting because there's some kind of

1650
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,199
biological effects of caffeine

1651
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,119
whatever of course there's like

1652
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,199
biological benefits that you can argue

1653
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,920
about but there's also just experiential

1654
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:48,960
benefits

1655
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,200
just calorie restriction broadly has a

1656
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,519
certain experience to it that

1657
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:55,039
like for me personally just as you said

1658
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:58,639
has made me feel really good

1659
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:01,838
that said like especially uh i've gained

1660
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:03,440
quite a bit of weight uh like maybe even

1661
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,599
like 15 pounds something like that since

1662
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,440
i moved to austin texas

1663
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:12,800
and i i still keep the same diet but

1664
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,559
i eat a lot of meat in that one

1665
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,160
just because it's delicious because it's

1666
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,280
also the

1667
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:21,759
the the amazing people i met in texas

1668
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,519
it's just there's like a camaraderie a

1669
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,599
friendship of love to the people that

1670
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:28,318
like makes you really enjoy

1671
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,318
the uh the atmosphere of eating the

1672
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,880
brisket and the meat is this joe rogan

1673
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:33,440
insisting joe is i mean he's very

1674
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,960
different

1675
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:40,318
uh joe loves bread

1676
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,880
and pasta like he knows that his body

1677
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,159
feels

1678
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,559
best doing keto or carnivore

1679
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,279
so that's what he usually tries to stick

1680
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,400
to

1681
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,000
but he also does not hold back and he'll

1682
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,400
just eat pasta when he does

1683
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,039
pasta and he sort of enjoys life in that

1684
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,200
way

1685
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,079
i can't i don't know how to enjoy life

1686
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:00,798
in that way i

1687
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,359
also love pasta but i'm just not going

1688
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,920
to enjoy it because i know

1689
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:07,358
i i know my body ultimately does not

1690
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,760
feel good with pasta so

1691
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:10,798
it's a funny kind of dichotomies i i

1692
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,160
would

1693
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:17,599
like to uh cheat i guess by

1694
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:20,719
eating more meat than i you know like

1695
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,720
overeating uh on the things that

1696
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,798
i know my body feels good on as opposed

1697
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,318
to eating stuff i shouldn't like cake

1698
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:30,559
and all those kinds of things

1699
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:34,000
i tend to um i tend to find happiness in

1700
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,880
overeating the good stuff versus

1701
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,760
eating the bad stuff and the that's the

1702
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,960
kind of balance

1703
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,640
him he's like [ __ ] it

1704
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,440
every once in a while you got to enjoy

1705
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:46,480
it and and then also coupled with that

1706
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,920
for him

1707
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,838
uh is just exercise like then faces

1708
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,440
demons the next day and just

1709
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,599
like burn a huge amount of calories

1710
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,440
which is i mean

1711
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,720
whatever whatever is up with that guy's

1712
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,079
mind

1713
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:05,039
there's an there's a ability to fully

1714
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,000
experience life which is represented by

1715
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:08,558
the pasta

1716
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,400
and the ability to just like fight the

1717
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,839
demons which is represented by all the

1718
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,440
crazy kettlebells and

1719
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:15,599
and running the hills and all this kind

1720
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,960
of stuff that he does that takes a lot

1721
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,760
out of you doing that kind of insane

1722
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,720
exercise and

1723
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,400
i think i'm more like you at least

1724
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:25,759
towards your direction is like

1725
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,720
i really hate exercise so i do it but i

1726
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,040
really hate it

1727
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,558
and so it's a balance that you have to

1728
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:31,358
strike is there something you could say

1729
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,798
about

1730
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:37,838
the diet side of that for you personally

1731
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:39,679
but in general in order to achieve

1732
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:43,199
calorie restriction

1733
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,239
like for me eating i know it may not

1734
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,759
sound healthy but

1735
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:50,000
eating carnivore eating mostly meat

1736
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,960
has been has made me feel really good

1737
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,440
both

1738
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,960
mentally and physically is there

1739
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,079
something you could say about the kinds

1740
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,720
of diets

1741
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:01,039
that may improve longevity but also

1742
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:03,759
enable calorie restriction

1743
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:05,279
well sure i mean the first thing that's

1744
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,079
important to know is that

1745
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,519
while many people are interested slash

1746
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,240
obsessed with

1747
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:13,599
what they eat the data that's come out

1748
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:16,159
of animal studies at least

1749
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,200
is it's far more important when you eat

1750
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:19,598
than what you eat

1751
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:20,639
and this was a fantastic study a few

1752
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,640
years ago by

1753
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,558
my friend rafael de cabo at the national

1754
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,159
institutes of health in bethesda

1755
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,640
and he had 10 000 mice on different

1756
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:29,118
diets hoping to find the perfect mix of

1757
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,078
carbs

1758
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:33,358
protein and fat and it turns out that

1759
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,318
the only ones that lived longer were the

1760
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:37,358
ones that only ate

1761
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:39,119
once a day and so that if we're we're

1762
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:40,318
not mice but i think that we're close

1763
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,680
enough to mice

1764
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,199
that this tells us a lot but okay but i

1765
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:48,558
still think the best bang for the

1766
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:51,679
longevity buck is to do both well eat

1767
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,119
less often and eat the right things now

1768
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:55,199
i'll preface this to say

1769
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,559
i'm not a nut about this i will eat

1770
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,318
occasional

1771
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,000
very occasionally a dessert usually i

1772
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:00,798
steal from others which doesn't count

1773
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,400
right

1774
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:04,000
exactly but you've got to live life

1775
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,280
right what's what's a long life if it's

1776
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,440
not enjoyable anyway

1777
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,760
but what i've i also found and this is

1778
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,000
i'll get to your question a second but

1779
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,400
my microbiome right now and stomach is

1780
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,639
at a point where if i try to overeat

1781
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,960
on a steak which i did a couple of days

1782
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:22,159
ago i actually had a chicken

1783
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,159
uh a fried chicken specifically

1784
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:25,920
for two days i felt terrible i couldn't

1785
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:27,519
sleep it wouldn't go down

1786
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,079
so i'm now at a point where even if i

1787
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:32,639
want to binge on meat and fried foods i

1788
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,480
just can't it just feels bad

1789
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:35,679
but what what do i recommend well what

1790
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,480
the data says

1791
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,598
which i try to follow is that

1792
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,358
plant-based foods will

1793
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,480
will be better than meat-based foods and

1794
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:43,759
i know that there are a lot of people

1795
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,838
disagree

1796
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,280
but one of the facts is there's a few

1797
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:48,719
facts one is that people who live a long

1798
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,000
time tend to eat those type of diets

1799
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:52,798
mediterranean okinawa

1800
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,838
diet they're eating mostly plants with a

1801
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,400
little bit of meat

1802
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,279
and not a lot of red meat and the other

1803
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,599
fact is that in

1804
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,798
animals we know that there's a there's a

1805
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,440
mechanism that's called

1806
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:04,318
mtor little m capital tr that responds

1807
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,079
to

1808
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:07,440
certain amino acids that are found in

1809
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,880
more abundance in meat

1810
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,880
and when it responds it actually

1811
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,318
shortens lifespan and the converse if

1812
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,680
you starve it of those

1813
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:17,759
three amino acids uh in mostly in meat

1814
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:19,358
then it extends lifespan and there

1815
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,280
there's a drug called rapamycin

1816
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:22,639
which some people are experimenting with

1817
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,240
that does that

1818
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:25,920
so you might be able to you know i'm

1819
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:27,439
just saying this here from

1820
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,880
my colleagues we don't know the results

1821
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,559
here but you could potentially take a

1822
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,880
rapamycin-like drug

1823
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,160
and counteract the effects of meat on in

1824
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,680
the long run

1825
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,279
don't know we should try that actually

1826
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:39,279
we could do that in the lab

1827
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,119
but uh getting to the bottom of this

1828
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,480
what i think is going on is that

1829
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,200
just like testosterone and growth

1830
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,599
hormone you will get temporary

1831
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:48,480
maybe not temporary um immediate health

1832
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,480
benefits

1833
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,000
you'll feel great you'll get more muscle

1834
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,760
energy

1835
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,358
but the problem is i think it's at the

1836
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,200
expense of long-term health and

1837
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,838
longevity

1838
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,318
well this is actually something i worry

1839
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:04,159
about

1840
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:06,000
in terms of long-term effects or

1841
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,199
the the cost in terms of longevity it's

1842
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,838
very difficult to know

1843
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,558
how your choices affect your longevity

1844
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:14,480
because

1845
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:16,000
the impact is down the line like

1846
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,599
just because something makes me feel

1847
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,599
good now

1848
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,838
like eating only meat makes me feel good

1849
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,240
now i wonder what are the costs down the

1850
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:23,759
line

1851
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:26,159
well think about what i i was saying

1852
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,599
about the trade-offs between

1853
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,759
growth and reproduction which is what a

1854
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,838
mouse does and a whale that

1855
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,960
grows slowly reproduces slowly lives a

1856
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:35,440
long time

1857
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,559
it's called the disposable soma theory

1858
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,119
um kirk would just

1859
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,720
uh propose that in the 70s what meat

1860
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,358
probably does is put you in

1861
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:44,639
the mouse category super fertile grow

1862
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:47,039
fast heal fast

1863
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:47,920
and then if you want to be a whale you

1864
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:51,199
should restrict

1865
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,240
meat uh and do things that promote the

1866
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,759
preservation of

1867
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:56,879
your body is it uh difficult to eat a

1868
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,000
plant-based

1869
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,400
diet that uh you perform well under

1870
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
so uh mentally and physically just

1871
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,200
almost i'm asking uh

1872
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,440
almost like a anecdotal question unless

1873
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,279
you know the science

1874
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,559
uh well the science is still being

1875
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,240
worked out but

1876
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,480
from the synthesis of everything i've

1877
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:19,118
read i try to

1878
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,719
eat a diet that's definitely full of

1879
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,640
leafy greens

1880
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:24,558
uh particularly spinach is great because

1881
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:27,920
it's got the iron that we need

1882
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:31,040
plenty of vitamins i also

1883
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,920
try to avoid too much fruit

1884
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:35,838
and berries particularly fruit juice

1885
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,480
definitely avoid that sugar high

1886
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:39,759
spiking your sugar is not healthy in the

1887
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,119
long run

1888
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,359
the other thing that's interesting is we

1889
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:46,079
discovered what are called what we call

1890
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:46,400
xeno hormetic molecules let me unpack

1891
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,920
that

1892
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,318
because it's terrible name and i take

1893
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,960
full responsibility with my friend

1894
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:53,838
conrad howitz the xeno means cross

1895
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,639
species

1896
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:59,119
and hormesis is the term that what

1897
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:01,519
doesn't kill you makes you live longer

1898
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,400
and and and be healthier and so we're

1899
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:05,358
getting cross

1900
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,798
species health improvements by molecules

1901
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:08,400
that plants make

1902
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:10,079
and plants make these molecules when

1903
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,119
they're also under adversity

1904
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,119
or perceived adversity for instance uh

1905
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,640
i understand if you want really healthy

1906
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:18,880
or good oranges

1907
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,318
you can drive nails into the the bark of

1908
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,559
the tree before you harvest

1909
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:24,239
same with wine you typically want them

1910
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,720
to be dry before you harvest

1911
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:28,798
or covered in fungus and that's because

1912
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:31,679
these plants make these colorful

1913
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:33,679
and xenohemetic molecules that make

1914
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,000
themselves stress resistant turn on

1915
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:37,598
their

1916
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,760
sirtuin defenses the sir genes remember

1917
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,280
and when we eat them we get those same

1918
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,640
benefits that's the idea and we've

1919
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,599
evolved to do so this isn't a

1920
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:46,639
coincidence

1921
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,240
it's my theory our theory that we want

1922
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:49,838
to know when our food supplies

1923
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:51,838
is under adversity because we need to

1924
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:53,920
get ready for a famine

1925
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:55,759
and so we hunker down and preserve our

1926
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,400
body and by eating these colored foods

1927
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,319
so

1928
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,079
practically speaking if it's full of

1929
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:01,920
color or if there's been some chewing by

1930
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,880
a caterpillar caterpillar

1931
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,838
organic grown locally in local farms

1932
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,920
i'll eat that

1933
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:12,078
versus a watery insipid uh light-colored

1934
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,838
um lettuce that's been grown in

1935
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,599
california so you want vegetables that

1936
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:16,639
have suffered you want the david goggins

1937
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,359
as the vegetables

1938
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:20,639
that's the xenochromatic molecules i

1939
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:22,159
love that tone

1940
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:24,879
i'm gonna take that one with me thank

1941
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:26,879
you yeah

1942
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,559
oh i follow him on instagram is always

1943
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,760
screaming so you want the

1944
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:35,280
that he's basically uh the the

1945
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,839
the xeno-harmonic version of a human

1946
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,200
um i like it so these are the molecules

1947
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:42,400
that are representative of

1948
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:44,798
the stress that's been um

1949
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:46,720
that a plant has been under yeah the

1950
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:48,159
best example of that is resveratrol

1951
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:51,038
which many people including myself

1952
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:52,879
take as a supplement grapes or grape

1953
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,280
vines produce that in abundance when

1954
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,920
they're

1955
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,960
dried out or they have too much light or

1956
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,318
fungus

1957
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,240
and that we've shown activates the so2

1958
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:04,079
enzyme in our bodies which remember is

1959
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:06,078
what extends lifespan in yeast and

1960
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,559
slows down aging in the brain that's

1961
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,798
beautiful yeah i tend to avoid fruit

1962
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,640
as well so green veggies anything that's

1963
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:14,400
not very sweet

1964
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:18,400
so i would just say you're relatively

1965
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:20,639
low like you try to avoid sugary things

1966
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,240
as well yeah i'm fairly militant about

1967
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:24,400
that um i rarely would

1968
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,239
add sugar to anything occasionally i

1969
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:28,160
would um

1970
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:31,118
eat a slice of cheesecake but that would

1971
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:33,118
be you know maybe once or twice a year

1972
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:35,200
you have to give in occasionally but

1973
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,440
yeah anything that's sweet i would

1974
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:40,798
rather substitute something like stevia

1975
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:45,280
if i need a sugar hit

1976
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:47,038
what about exercise your favorite topic

1977
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,519
is there uh is there anybody talking

1978
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,920
about it yeah okay great is there

1979
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:54,480
benefits to longevity

1980
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,519
from exercise well no doubt that's

1981
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,440
that's proven

1982
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:58,719
um just like fasting it's pretty clear

1983
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,639
that that works

1984
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:01,759
uh for example there are studies of

1985
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:04,159
cyclists

1986
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:06,079
it was something like people that cycle

1987
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:08,239
over 80 miles a week

1988
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,240
have a 40 reduction in a variety of

1989
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:11,679
diseases certainly heart disease

1990
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,118
so that that's not even a question but

1991
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,838
what's interesting is that we're

1992
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,200
learning that

1993
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:17,519
you don't need much to have a big

1994
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:19,279
benefit it's an asymptotic curve

1995
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:20,559
and in fact if you overdo it you

1996
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,760
probably have reduced benefits

1997
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:23,359
particularly if you start to wear out

1998
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,119
joints that kind of thing

1999
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:26,558
but just 10 minutes on a treadmill a few

2000
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,559
times a week getting your lose your

2001
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:31,200
breath get hypoxia because it's cold

2002
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:32,559
seems to be very beneficial for

2003
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:34,639
long-term health

2004
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,319
um and that's the kind of exercise that

2005
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:39,199
i like to do aerobic

2006
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:40,960
though i do enjoy uh lifting weights so

2007
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,960
that is what i call my exercise which

2008
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,440
has other benefits including

2009
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,079
maintaining hormone levels male hormone

2010
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,519
levels

2011
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:50,640
but also really why i do it is i want to

2012
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:52,159
be able to

2013
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:53,679
counteract the effects of sitting for

2014
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:55,679
most of the day yeah and

2015
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:57,519
as you get older you lose muscle mass

2016
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:59,038
it's a percent or so a year

2017
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:00,798
and i don't want to be frail when i'm

2018
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,880
older and fall over and break my hip

2019
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:04,000
which is which happens every 20 seconds

2020
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,760
in this country

2021
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
so maintaining that strength but also

2022
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,079
doing the cardio for the longevity for

2023
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,039
the avoiding the heart disease

2024
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,720
yeah i definitely just like with fasting

2025
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:17,599
have the philosophical benefit of

2026
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:19,358
running long and running slow i enjoy

2027
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,400
because it kind of clears the mind and

2028
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:22,239
allows you to think

2029
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,798
and actually listen to brown noise as i

2030
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:26,558
run it really helps

2031
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:28,559
remove myself from the world and just

2032
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,720
like zoom in on particular thoughts

2033
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,720
what is brown noise it's like white

2034
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:35,279
noise but deeper so like

2035
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:38,318
the white noise is like shh and then

2036
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,319
brown noise is more like

2037
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:42,239
like ocean that sounds great i might try

2038
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,880
that yeah

2039
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:46,318
yeah it's a small sweet thing probably

2040
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,920
i'm not sure there could be signs to

2041
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:48,798
this i need to look this up i've been

2042
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,000
meaning to

2043
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:53,838
but i've when i started uh

2044
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,119
this is maybe like five years ago i

2045
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:56,078
started listening brown noise when i

2046
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:58,318
work

2047
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,160
and uh the first time i listened to it

2048
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:03,679
something happened to my mind

2049
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:06,480
where it just went like zoomed in

2050
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,759
to like in a way that it felt like

2051
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,199
really weird

2052
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,680
like how how precisely was able to sort

2053
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:14,798
of

2054
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:17,919
remove the distractions of the world and

2055
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:19,519
really help my mind obviously like the

2056
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,838
mind is trying to focus

2057
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:22,880
and then it just enabled that process of

2058
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:24,880
trying to focus

2059
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,480
on a particular problem i don't know if

2060
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,519
this is generalizable to others people

2061
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,000
should definitely try it if you're

2062
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:31,199
listening to

2063
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,960
this maybe it's just my own mind but

2064
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:36,798
it's funny like it made me brown noise

2065
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,720
made me realize that there's probably

2066
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:40,798
hacks out there

2067
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:42,399
that work for me that i should be

2068
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:43,440
constantly looking for it's almost like

2069
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,559
um

2070
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:49,440
an encouraging and motivating

2071
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,960
of event that maybe there's other stuff

2072
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,119
out there maybe there's other

2073
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,199
brown noise like things out there that

2074
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,000
truly like almost immediately make me

2075
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:57,439
feel better

2076
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,760
i don't know if it's generalizable to

2077
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,559
others but it does seem that

2078
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,680
it's the case that there's probably for

2079
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:05,920
many others things

2080
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:06,960
like that that could be discovered and

2081
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,039
so

2082
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,318
it's always disappointing when i find

2083
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,119
things in life

2084
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:14,079
that i wish i had found earlier like i

2085
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:17,279
got lasik

2086
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:18,880
eye surgery a few years ago

2087
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,279
and the first thought i had like the

2088
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:24,079
next day when i woke up is like

2089
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:26,159
damn it why didn't i do this way earlier

2090
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:29,039
there's other stuff

2091
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:31,599
of that nature that um they're yet to be

2092
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:32,880
discovered so it pays to explore

2093
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,798
yeah though you have a different mind

2094
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,640
you have quite a beautiful mind so i

2095
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:38,158
suspect brown noise helps you

2096
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,159
focus and because you're probably all

2097
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:42,000
over the place if you don't control it

2098
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:44,318
yeah exactly i mean it's something about

2099
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,520
it it's a programmer thing i don't

2100
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:50,560
the programming is a really difficult

2101
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,880
um mental journey because you have to

2102
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,120
keep a lot of things in mind

2103
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,400
you have to uh so you're constantly

2104
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:58,640
designing things

2105
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:01,039
and you have to be extremely precise by

2106
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:04,838
making those things concrete in code

2107
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:06,158
you also have to look stuff up on the

2108
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:08,880
internet

2109
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:10,399
to sort of feed like information and

2110
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,079
looking up stuff on the internet

2111
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:13,759
internet is full of like distracting

2112
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:14,880
things so you have to be really focused

2113
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,439
in the way you look stuff

2114
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,279
up in pulling that information in so it

2115
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,079
requires a certain discipline and a

2116
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:23,359
certain focus

2117
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:24,318
that uh i've been very much exploring

2118
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,319
how to do like

2119
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,920
i do it really well in the morning

2120
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,080
coffee is involved all those kinds of

2121
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,798
things you're trying to optimize

2122
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:34,559
uh keeping very positive inspired no

2123
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:36,479
social media all those kinds of things

2124
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,839
and trying to optimize for and everybody

2125
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,000
has their own kind of

2126
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:41,278
little journey that they try to

2127
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,920
understand you get this from like

2128
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,239
writers

2129
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,759
when you read about the habits of

2130
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:47,759
writers

2131
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,279
like the habits they do in the morning

2132
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,880
they usually write like two three four

2133
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,520
hours a day and that's it

2134
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,440
it's like they optimize that ritual and

2135
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:59,120
then there's always hunters thompson

2136
01:09:55,439 --> 01:10:01,439
so uh

2137
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:02,238
sometimes it pays off to be wild what

2138
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:05,519
about

2139
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:06,718
the sleep how important is sleep for

2140
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,800
longevity

2141
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:12,158
i would guess based on the evidence that

2142
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,119
it's really important

2143
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:16,879
and because we don't know for sure but

2144
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,559
what we know from animal studies

2145
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,400
is the following if you restrict sleep

2146
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,120
from a rat for just two weeks it'll

2147
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:24,319
develop

2148
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:26,238
type 2 diabetes it's that important

2149
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:28,479
so that's the main thing what we also

2150
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:31,759
know is at the molecular level

2151
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:33,839
that if you disrupt your

2152
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,119
sleep wake cycle so we actually have

2153
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,640
proteins that go up and down that

2154
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:39,198
control our sleep wake

2155
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:41,119
all of us most of our cells do that if

2156
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:43,439
you disrupt that you'll get premature

2157
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:45,279
aging and guess what the opposite is

2158
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:48,479
true that as you get older

2159
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:49,359
that cycle the the amplitude becomes

2160
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:50,959
diminished

2161
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:52,559
and this is why it's harder to get to

2162
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,800
sleep as you get older and then

2163
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,159
you've got all sorts of problems and i

2164
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,600
think what's going on is this positive

2165
01:10:56,158 --> 01:10:59,599
feedback loop which

2166
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,280
is is a disaster in your old age which

2167
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,280
is um

2168
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:04,399
right you're aging you can't at this

2169
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:06,000
moment

2170
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:07,439
totally prevent that and then it's

2171
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,479
disrupting your sleep then you get not

2172
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:10,399
enough sleep and then that's going to

2173
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,718
accelerate your aging process

2174
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:13,839
um and so it's known that that people

2175
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,800
who are shift workers are more

2176
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,920
susceptible

2177
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,520
to certain age-related diseases so your

2178
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,800
bottom line you definitely want to work

2179
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,320
on that it's one of the reasons i have

2180
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,320
this ring on my finger which helps me

2181
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:26,960
optimize my sleep and learn

2182
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:28,479
what i do the day before if it was a bad

2183
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,439
idea and i'll stop doing that like

2184
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:31,439
eating a fried chicken

2185
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,800
i see you're still carrying the burdens

2186
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:37,359
of that decision

2187
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:40,159
but is yeah you know sleep is one of

2188
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:41,920
those things that's making me

2189
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:43,679
wonder about the variability between

2190
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:47,440
humans a little bit and how

2191
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:50,640
science is often focused on

2192
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:53,519
like it's not often focused on high

2193
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,440
performers in a particular way

2194
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,760
and it's looking at the aggregate versus

2195
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:59,599
the individual cases

2196
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,679
for example like for me i don't know

2197
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,920
what the exact hours are but

2198
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:05,920
like power naps are incredible

2199
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:10,639
i tend to look at the metric of stress

2200
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:13,279
and happiness

2201
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:16,000
and joy and try to optimize those so

2202
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:18,880
decreasing stress increasing happiness

2203
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,079
and using sleep as just one of the tools

2204
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,199
to do that

2205
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:25,679
because like hitting the five six seven

2206
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:27,119
eight nine hour mark or whatever the

2207
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:30,000
correct mark is

2208
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:30,960
i find that to be stress inducing for me

2209
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,279
versus

2210
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,079
stress relieving like thinking about

2211
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,719
that i

2212
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,399
i feel best if i sleep sometimes for

2213
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,520
eight hours sometimes for four hours and

2214
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:42,479
then power nap

2215
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,480
and as long as i have a stupid private

2216
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:47,119
usually smile on my face

2217
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:47,839
that's when i'm doing good as opposed to

2218
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:50,238
getting

2219
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,279
a perfect amount of sleep according to

2220
01:12:50,238 --> 01:12:54,079
whatever the

2221
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:56,479
latest blog post is and i also pull

2222
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:57,920
all-nighters still

2223
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:01,119
i also think there's something about the

2224
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:04,319
body like as long as you do it

2225
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,359
regularly it's not as stress-inducing

2226
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:07,519
like you know what

2227
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:08,880
you know what it is the reason i pull

2228
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,840
all-nighters isn't for like

2229
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,279
i'm playing diablo 3 or something is

2230
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,319
because i'm doing something i'm truly

2231
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:16,399
passionate about well

2232
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:17,759
i can also love video games but i'm

2233
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:18,399
doing something i'm truly passionate

2234
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,560
about

2235
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:22,479
and it's almost like there's the jocko

2236
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,640
willing feeling of when i'm

2237
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:25,519
up at seven a.m and i haven't slept all

2238
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,440
night

2239
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,960
and still i'm working on it there's a

2240
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:30,960
kind of a celebration of the human

2241
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:34,319
spirit that i really enjoy it

2242
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,359
like uh and that's happiness and to sort

2243
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:37,119
of

2244
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:38,559
then and i usually don't tell that kind

2245
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:40,880
of stuff to people because

2246
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,560
their first statement will be like you

2247
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:46,239
should get more sleep

2248
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,920
it's like no i'm doing stuff i love

2249
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:50,399
you should get more love in your life

2250
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:52,719
bro that's right

2251
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:55,359
so but that said in aggregate when you

2252
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:58,399
look at the full span of life

2253
01:13:55,359 --> 01:14:01,119
it's probably you should be getting

2254
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:02,719
a consistent amount of sleep and it

2255
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:05,279
seems like it's in that

2256
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:06,319
seven eight hour range yeah but it's

2257
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:08,880
similar to food

2258
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:10,719
it it's the quality not the quantity

2259
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:14,400
right and and when you get it

2260
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:16,319
so i i look at my my data pretty often

2261
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,839
and what makes a difference to me is not

2262
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:20,399
the amount of hours but

2263
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,199
the quality the depth and the deep sleep

2264
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:22,639
is what

2265
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,719
what'll do it so if i have a lot of

2266
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,000
alcohol before going to sleep

2267
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:27,520
and i can see my heart rate being

2268
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
different but what really kills me is

2269
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,600
that i don't

2270
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,319
get a lot of that deep sleep and i wake

2271
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,840
up you know barely remembering stuff

2272
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,119
so that like you say if you're happy and

2273
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,000
contented and you're not don't have

2274
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:37,599
these

2275
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,439
cortisol chemicals going through your

2276
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,560
body you will more naturally get into

2277
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:42,479
that deep state

2278
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:45,360
and even if you just get four hours way

2279
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:47,198
better than eight hours of none of that

2280
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:49,679
yeah yeah that's beautiful and some of

2281
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:52,399
that could be genetic for me i just

2282
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:54,079
i just fall asleep like this if you want

2283
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:57,198
me to fall asleep right now i can do it

2284
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:58,640
it's it's no um i have no problem with

2285
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:00,639
the combined with coffee i just had two

2286
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,400
energy drinks i could probably

2287
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,000
uh sleep so that i don't know if that's

2288
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:07,359
genetics or

2289
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,960
it's kind of um i don't know what it is

2290
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:10,960
or maybe that i don't have kids that i'm

2291
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:12,480
single so i don't have uh

2292
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,319
i'm almost listening to some kind of

2293
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:16,079
biological signal versus

2294
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:17,519
societal signal on when i'm supposed to

2295
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:20,238
go to sleep so i just

2296
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,520
go to sleep whenever i feel like going

2297
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:23,599
to sleep well that's because you're

2298
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,560
self-employed so most people don't have

2299
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,239
that luxury

2300
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,920
but we're lucky the two of us that we

2301
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:30,000
can make our own hours yeah

2302
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,960
um but yeah it's super important and

2303
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,119
those people who have

2304
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,239
the shift work i mean they they really

2305
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:35,679
need to to

2306
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:38,799
change the way that works because

2307
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:42,000
they're literally killing those people

2308
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:45,119
is there something you can say about the

2309
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,319
the mind and stress

2310
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:51,359
uh in terms of effect on longevity

2311
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:53,119
sort of um because i don't know if you

2312
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:54,639
think about it this way but

2313
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:56,399
when you talk about the biological

2314
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,119
machine it's always these mechanisms

2315
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:00,719
that don't are not necessarily directly

2316
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:02,640
connected to the brain

2317
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,560
or the operation of the brain like

2318
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:08,560
what's the role about

2319
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:10,640
stress and happiness and uh

2320
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,920
yeah the sort of higher cognitive things

2321
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:15,760
going on in the brain

2322
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:17,600
on longevity right well that's a great

2323
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:18,880
point that the brain is is the center

2324
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,840
for longevity actually

2325
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,719
we we do know that first start when when

2326
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,360
i'm stressed

2327
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:27,119
i can see mentally stressed then i can

2328
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,519
see it in my body

2329
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:30,238
heart rate hormones it's clear you know

2330
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,159
that's no

2331
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:35,279
true surprise so you've got to work on

2332
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:38,639
your brain first and foremost if you are

2333
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:41,439
totally freaked out agitated uh

2334
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:43,039
all the time you will live shorter i'm

2335
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:46,238
certain of it you know i keep

2336
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:47,920
fish i'm a big

2337
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:49,599
aquarium guy and you can see the

2338
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,359
difference between the the fish that's

2339
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:53,600
having a good time and dominant

2340
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:55,119
and one that gets picked on yeah it just

2341
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,239
looks like crap

2342
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:58,000
you don't want to be that the little

2343
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:58,559
fish getting picked on if you can help

2344
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,560
it

2345
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,000
so i used to be extremely stressed as a

2346
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,640
kid i was a perfectionist

2347
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
very shy always worried about being a

2348
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,679
failure

2349
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,520
if i didn't get an a plus you know i was

2350
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:12,880
crying in my bedroom that kind of sad

2351
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,800
existence i got into my 20s then in my

2352
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,319
30s and realized

2353
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,920
that's not the way to live so i've

2354
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:18,880
worked very hard to get to this point

2355
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,119
where

2356
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,239
i almost never get stressed never

2357
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:23,679
there's nothing that

2358
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,079
i've never gotten angry in my lab i've

2359
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,039
got 20 kids sometimes it's like a

2360
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:29,359
most of the time it's like a

2361
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:31,600
kindergarten um i

2362
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:32,719
haven't lost my temper i very calm but

2363
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,880
that's intentional

2364
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:35,840
um and i don't worry about stuff

2365
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,960
millions of dollars

2366
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,800
billions of dollars at stake sometimes

2367
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,640
keep it cool it's only life we're all

2368
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,440
headed to the same place anyway

2369
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,560
don't worry about it um but the the to

2370
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:48,479
answer your question i think

2371
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,480
in a better way if you manipulate the

2372
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:51,919
brain of an animal

2373
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:54,879
i'll give you an example if we turn on

2374
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,560
this cert gene that i mentioned sir one

2375
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,000
we a good friend of mine that wash you

2376
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,480
shiny my did this

2377
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,119
they upregulate the operate of that gene

2378
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:05,759
just in the neurons of the animal

2379
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:06,880
it lived longer so that's sufficient to

2380
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,320
extend lifespan

2381
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,920
we also know that you can manipulate the

2382
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:11,679
part of the brain

2383
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,920
called the hypothalamus which leaches a

2384
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:16,319
lot of chemicals into the body

2385
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,119
and proteins most of which we don't know

2386
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,719
yet

2387
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:20,880
but just changing the inflammation of

2388
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:22,960
that little organ

2389
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,880
or part of the brain is sufficient to

2390
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,719
make animals live longer as well

2391
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,359
so get your brain in order first before

2392
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:32,079
you tackle anything else i would say

2393
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:33,039
so you kind of mention this with the

2394
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:35,519
inside tracker

2395
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:36,158
there's a ability to take blood

2396
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,360
measurement

2397
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:40,639
and then infer from that

2398
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:42,399
a bunch of different things about your

2399
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,719
body how you can improve

2400
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:46,238
how you can improve the longevity and

2401
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:49,920
you've also mentioned

2402
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:54,158
saliva and more efficient ways

2403
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:56,000
to uh to get data uh

2404
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:57,439
what does that involve what's the future

2405
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,198
of data collection look like yeah for

2406
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:01,279
the human biological system

2407
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:02,719
right well yeah the the issue with with

2408
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:03,039
blood is you need someone to take it

2409
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,719
it's

2410
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:06,800
it i mean or you prick your finger which

2411
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,000
hurts yes so you gotta have something

2412
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,679
better so i think what the future

2413
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,800
looks like is that you'll spit onto a

2414
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:14,640
little piece of paper and stick it in a

2415
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,840
machine and it'll it'll do that for you

2416
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,320
but we're not there yet so the

2417
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,960
intermediate um

2418
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:22,399
future that that i'm building right now

2419
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,319
is that you would take a

2420
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:25,759
swab of the inside of your mouth which

2421
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:26,719
is the easiest way to take cells out of

2422
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,280
your body

2423
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,399
and just ship them off okay so called a

2424
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:32,238
buckle swab

2425
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:33,519
um i think we we became very used to

2426
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:35,039
that right right now

2427
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,239
because of covert people don't like

2428
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:37,519
going to the doctor as much they don't

2429
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,718
like going out they just want to have

2430
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,719
home tests

2431
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:43,039
and so that i think is the next 10 years

2432
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,640
where you'll get a kit in the mail

2433
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:46,560
you'll swab your cheek stick it back in

2434
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,960
an envelope send it off and

2435
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:50,159
you know a week later you have either a

2436
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,359
doctor's report

2437
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:53,839
or a health recommendation and what can

2438
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:55,519
you get

2439
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,960
off a cheek swab well you can get

2440
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,239
anything you can get hormones stress

2441
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,960
levels

2442
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:02,879
stress hormones blood glucose levels you

2443
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,319
can also tell your age

2444
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,159
reasonably accurately doing that

2445
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:06,719
actually quite accurately and those

2446
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:08,879
clocks

2447
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,079
cannot just tell you how you're doing

2448
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,279
over time

2449
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:13,198
but can be used to give you

2450
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:14,079
recommendations to slow that process

2451
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:15,359
down

2452
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:16,880
because some people sometimes are 10

2453
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:17,599
years older biologically than their

2454
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,639
actual

2455
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,920
chronic chronological age i mean

2456
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,600
why does it matter how many times the

2457
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,800
earth's gone around the sun seriously

2458
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,719
who cares about birthdays

2459
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,400
it's how long your body's clock has been

2460
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:30,079
ticking and how fast

2461
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:32,799
so i could take a cheek swab from you

2462
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:35,679
today lex take it back to my lab

2463
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,800
and we then by tomorrow tell you how old

2464
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:39,520
you are biologically

2465
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,039
based on what we call the epigenetic

2466
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,400
clock

2467
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:44,800
and you might be freaked out you might

2468
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:47,119
be happy but either way we can

2469
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,880
advise you on how to improve the

2470
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:50,719
trajectory because we know that smoking

2471
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:53,119
increases the speed of that clock

2472
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,079
we also know that fasting and people who

2473
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:56,559
eat the right foods

2474
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:58,399
have a slower clock without that

2475
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,920
knowledge you're flying blind

2476
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:01,599
but i like the idea of a swab because

2477
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,960
it's it's just so easy we've a lot of us

2478
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,159
have done something like that for covert

2479
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,158
tests it's not even i've been doing a

2480
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:09,599
non-stop a rapid antigen test

2481
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:11,599
so let me say that particular one

2482
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,280
rapid antigen test they've been a source

2483
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,800
of frustration for me because like

2484
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:16,880
everybody should be doing it

2485
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,119
it's so easy we've also been working in

2486
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,639
my lab on democratizing these tests to

2487
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:22,000
bring them down from a few hundred bucks

2488
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:23,520
to a dollar

2489
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,198
so just to clarify you're talking about

2490
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,679
not research you talk about like company

2491
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:28,879
stuff

2492
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:30,719
like actual facing things i i well

2493
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,800
right the research on bringing the price

2494
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,239
down has occurred in my lab at harvard

2495
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,000
and then that intellectual property is

2496
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:36,959
being licensed and has been licensed out

2497
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,279
to a company

2498
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,600
yeah that that will be uh

2499
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:43,279
consumer-facing so anybody

2500
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,840
for a small amount of money can do this

2501
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:47,920
well you got subscriber number one

2502
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,760
obsessed i think that's a beautiful

2503
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,359
beautiful idea so somebody who

2504
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:54,159
maybe i would have been more hesitant

2505
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:56,399
about it until a covid

2506
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:57,839
uh but home tests are super easy i

2507
01:21:56,399 --> 01:21:59,359
almost wanted to share that data with

2508
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,360
the world

2509
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:02,799
like in some way not not the entirety of

2510
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:05,679
the data but like

2511
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,239
some visualization of like how i'm doing

2512
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:08,880
like

2513
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:10,000
it's almost like uh like you know when

2514
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,679
you share if you had like

2515
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,039
a long run or something like that i wish

2516
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,880
i could share

2517
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:16,800
because it inspires others and then you

2518
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,319
can have a conversation about like

2519
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,320
well what are the hacks that you've

2520
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:21,840
tried and have a conversation about like

2521
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:22,319
how to improve lifestyle and those kinds

2522
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,159
of things

2523
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:25,198
that's grounded in data that's exactly

2524
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:26,000
that's what's that's what's going to

2525
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:27,678
happen now

2526
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,600
everything's anonymous of course we

2527
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:31,600
talked about security there

2528
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:34,000
but once it's anonymized you can then

2529
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:36,880
plot these numbers and i've plotted my

2530
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
epigenetic age versus hundreds of other

2531
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,560
people who have taken this

2532
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
test now and i can tell you where i fit

2533
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,440
relative to others in terms of my

2534
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,960
biological age

2535
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:47,119
and i'm happy to share that with you all

2536
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,560
because it's pretty low

2537
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:50,319
you can choose to share it of course not

2538
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,400
everyone wants to share that

2539
01:22:50,319 --> 01:22:54,079
but when you go to the doctor first of

2540
01:22:52,399 --> 01:22:55,198
all your doctor doesn't

2541
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:56,880
does treat you as though you're an

2542
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:58,479
average person and none of us are

2543
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,319
average there's no such thing

2544
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:01,839
but second of all we never know how

2545
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:03,519
we're doing relative to others because

2546
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,199
we all

2547
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,040
most of us we we don't share our

2548
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:07,919
information so we might have this number

2549
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:09,519
and that number

2550
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,199
but do you know that your numbers are

2551
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,280
good for your age or not

2552
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:14,479
you have no idea no even your doctor

2553
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,000
probably doesn't even know

2554
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:17,439
so this this graph that i'm talking

2555
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,198
about is the beginning of a world where

2556
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,599
you can say how am i doing

2557
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:22,638
i'm a you know for the two of us we're

2558
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,239
white and we're male

2559
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,440
and we're this age and we do this

2560
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:28,879
are we good are we doing the right

2561
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:30,319
things or the wrong things do we need to

2562
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,560
fix certain things

2563
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:34,238
and this is what the future is it's

2564
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,920
forget about

2565
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:37,279
just experimenting and not knowing the

2566
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,399
result i mean who doesn't experiment and

2567
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:40,479
doesn't look at the data

2568
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,599
no one it makes no sense so we're going

2569
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:43,359
to enter a world where we have a

2570
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:46,400
dashboard in our body

2571
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:47,039
the swabs the blood tests the biosensors

2572
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:48,879
where

2573
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:50,079
our doctors can look at that but we can

2574
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,760
also look at it

2575
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:53,039
and they can recommend you know go to

2576
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,320
this restaurant down the road they've

2577
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:56,158
got this great meal

2578
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:57,679
it's high in whatever you need today

2579
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:00,319
because you're lacking vitamin d and

2580
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:03,359
vitamin k2 go for it

2581
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:05,439
ridiculous question or perhaps not if

2582
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:07,759
you look maybe 50 years from now or 100

2583
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:09,359
years from now a person born then

2584
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:12,159
what do you think is a good goal in

2585
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:14,880
terms of how long a person would live

2586
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:17,198
like what is the maximum longevity that

2587
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:20,159
we can achieve through the methods

2588
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:21,279
that we have today of uh or are

2589
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:23,198
developing some of the things we've been

2590
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:25,439
talking about

2591
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:26,479
and in terms of genetics in terms of

2592
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:29,599
biology

2593
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:31,678
what's is there a number

2594
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,280
right uh well so it changes all the time

2595
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,880
because technology's changing so quickly

2596
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:38,000
i keep revising the number

2597
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,440
upward uh but i would say that if you do

2598
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,760
the right things during your life and

2599
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,119
start at an early age let's say 25 we

2600
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,960
don't want malnutrition starvation

2601
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:48,319
that's not what i'm talking about

2602
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:50,079
but in your 20s start eating the kind of

2603
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:53,039
diets that i talked about

2604
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:54,399
skipping meals in animals that gives you

2605
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:57,039
an extra 20

2606
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:58,399
to 30 percent we don't know if that's

2607
01:24:57,039 --> 01:24:59,920
true for humans and that would

2608
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:03,119
you know even five percent more would be

2609
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:05,279
a good a big deal for the planet

2610
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:07,359
i think that we should all aim to at

2611
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:09,439
least reach a century

2612
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:11,439
um i i'm i'm a little bit behind i was

2613
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:13,759
born too early to benefit

2614
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:15,919
the most from all of this discovery

2615
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,679
those of you who are in your twenties

2616
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,800
you should definitely aim to reach a

2617
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:23,199
hundred i don't see why not

2618
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,960
consider this is really important the

2619
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:26,960
average life span of a human

2620
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,439
that looks after themselves and but

2621
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,920
doesn't pay attention

2622
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:33,439
is about 80 okay japan that's the

2623
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,560
average age for a male

2624
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:39,759
bit higher if you do the right things

2625
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,440
in your life which is eat

2626
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,119
healthy food don't overeat don't become

2627
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:44,638
obese do a bit of exercise get good

2628
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:47,039
sleep and don't stress

2629
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,960
that gives you on average 14 extra years

2630
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:51,439
that gets you to 94.

2631
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,399
so getting to 100 if you just focus on

2632
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:54,079
what i'm talking about

2633
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:55,679
it's not a big deal so what's the

2634
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:57,760
maximum well we know that

2635
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:58,960
one human made it to 122 and a number of

2636
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:02,079
them make it into their

2637
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,719
teens i think that's also the next level

2638
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:05,279
of

2639
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:06,719
of uh of where we can get to with the

2640
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:07,519
types of technologies that i'm talking

2641
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,840
about

2642
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,199
medicines like i mentioned rapamycin

2643
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,719
there's one called metformin which is

2644
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:15,359
the diabetes drug

2645
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,960
which i take that in combination with

2646
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:18,238
these lifestyle changes should get us

2647
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,679
beyond a hundred

2648
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:21,678
how long can we ultimately live well

2649
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,520
there's no maximum limit to human

2650
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:24,480
lifespan why can a whale live 300 years

2651
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,239
but we cannot

2652
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:27,759
we're basically the same structure we

2653
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:30,238
just need to learn from them

2654
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,960
so anyone who says oh you max max out at

2655
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:34,399
x

2656
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:35,920
i think is is full of it there's nothing

2657
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:37,920
that i've seen that says biological

2658
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,359
organisms have to die there are trees

2659
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,800
that live for thousands of years

2660
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:42,559
and their biochemistry is pretty close

2661
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,079
to ours

2662
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,159
what do you think it means to live for a

2663
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:48,840
very long time let's say if it's 200

2664
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:51,119
years we're talking about or a thousand

2665
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:54,480
years

2666
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:55,279
there's some some sense you could argue

2667
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:57,439
that there is

2668
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:59,679
immortal organisms already living on

2669
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:02,638
earth like there's bacteria so

2670
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,679
there's certain there's certain living

2671
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:06,719
organisms

2672
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:09,359
that in some fundamental way do not

2673
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:10,319
die because they keep replicating their

2674
01:27:09,359 --> 01:27:13,759
genetic information

2675
01:27:10,319 --> 01:27:17,198
they keep like cloning themselves

2676
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:21,280
is is it the same human

2677
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:24,158
if we can somehow persist the human mind

2678
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:25,279
like copy clone certain aspects and just

2679
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:28,000
keep replacing

2680
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:30,399
body parts um do you think that's

2681
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,639
another way to achieve immortality

2682
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:34,559
to achieve of a prolonged sort of

2683
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:37,039
increased longevity is

2684
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,000
to replace the parts that break easily

2685
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:41,679
and keep

2686
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:44,319
because actually from your theory of um

2687
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,920
aging as a degradation of information

2688
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:49,599
it's an information theory view of

2689
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:51,359
aging like what is what is the key

2690
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:53,760
information that makes a human

2691
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:54,719
can we persist that information and just

2692
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,920
replace

2693
01:27:54,719 --> 01:28:00,239
the the trivial parts uh yeah i mean the

2694
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,679
short answer is yes we're already

2695
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:03,759
replacing body parts but

2696
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:06,239
what makes us human is our brain

2697
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:09,600
everything else is is sub-optimal

2698
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:12,158
except our brain the

2699
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:13,520
ability to replace actual neurons is

2700
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:16,158
really hard

2701
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,880
right i think it might be easy to upload

2702
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:19,119
rather than

2703
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,400
replace neurons because they're so tight

2704
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:22,960
it's such a network

2705
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:23,439
and just perturbing the system you know

2706
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,639
it's

2707
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:28,158
it's uh it's stretching this cat you

2708
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,719
you change everything once you get in

2709
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:32,079
there the problem is um

2710
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:34,000
well i guess the solution let me go to

2711
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:35,439
the solution that's more interesting

2712
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,840
what we're learning is that if you

2713
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:39,439
reverse the age of nerve cells

2714
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,119
they look it looks like they get their

2715
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,559
memories back

2716
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:43,679
right so the memories are not lost

2717
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,480
they're just that the cells don't know

2718
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:46,800
how to

2719
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:47,599
interpret them and function correctly

2720
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,800
and this is one of

2721
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,079
the things we're starting in my lab if

2722
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,279
you take an old mouse that has learned

2723
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:54,079
something when it was young

2724
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:56,319
but forgotten does it get that back and

2725
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:58,559
all evidence points to that being true

2726
01:28:56,319 --> 01:29:00,399
so i'd rather go in and rejuvenate the

2727
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,840
brain as it sits rather than replace

2728
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:03,039
individual cells which would be really

2729
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:04,800
hard

2730
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:06,719
what do you think about like efforts

2731
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:10,159
like neurolink

2732
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:12,158
which basically you mentioned uploading

2733
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:13,519
are trying to figure out so creating

2734
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:15,119
brain computer interfaces

2735
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,719
they're trying to figure out how to

2736
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:18,399
communicate with the brain

2737
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,960
but one of the features that is trying

2738
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:23,198
to record the human brain

2739
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,520
more and more accurately do you have

2740
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:29,039
hope for that

2741
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,639
to um of course there's uh it will lead

2742
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:32,158
to us better understanding

2743
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:33,920
from a neuroscience perspective the

2744
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:36,079
human mind but do you have

2745
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,960
hope for it increasing longevity in

2746
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:39,439
terms of

2747
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,800
how it's used i think that it can help

2748
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:42,479
with certain diseases

2749
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,079
uh but i see at least within our

2750
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:46,079
lifetime that's the best use of it is to

2751
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:46,559
be able to replace parts of the body

2752
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:48,719
that

2753
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,880
are not functioning such as the the

2754
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:51,760
retina and other parts the visual cortex

2755
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,159
back here

2756
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,199
that that's going to be doable in terms

2757
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:57,119
of longevity

2758
01:29:55,198 --> 01:29:58,319
maybe we could put something on the

2759
01:29:57,119 --> 01:29:59,760
hypothalamus and

2760
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:02,158
start secreting those hormones and get

2761
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,159
that back

2762
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:06,319
ultimately i think it the best way to

2763
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:09,439
preserve the brain

2764
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:11,920
uh is going to be to uh

2765
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:13,759
record it but also i think it's going to

2766
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:17,600
require death unfortunately

2767
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:19,440
to then do very detailed scans even

2768
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,520
if you have enough time and money atomic

2769
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:22,399
microscopy and rebuild the brain from

2770
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,679
scratch

2771
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:27,279
rebuild from scratch yeah we are

2772
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:28,800
living more and more in the digital

2773
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:31,119
world

2774
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,960
i wonder if if the scanning is good

2775
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:33,679
enough for the critical things in terms

2776
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,000
of

2777
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:38,000
memories in terms of the particular

2778
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,880
quirks of your cognitive processes

2779
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,960
they're not they're not yeah we're not

2780
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:44,719
we're not close yes but

2781
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,079
we've made quite a bit of progress so

2782
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:48,880
it's uh

2783
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:50,079
if you're um if you're an exponential

2784
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,039
type of person

2785
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:54,639
yeah well let's dream a little here yes

2786
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,399
the way it would work

2787
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:59,279
that i could see it working is so you

2788
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:01,920
take a single cell slice through your

2789
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:03,599
your dead brain and we can now the

2790
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,079
problem the problem with the engineering

2791
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,760
aspect is that the engineering is the

2792
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,319
physical aspect of the brain is is

2793
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,360
not even half the problem the problem is

2794
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:13,759
which genes are

2795
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:15,039
switched on and off this experience that

2796
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,159
we're having here is

2797
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:20,479
is altering certain genes in neurons

2798
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:21,920
that will be preserved hopefully for for

2799
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:23,198
a number of decades

2800
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:25,119
but you cannot see that with a

2801
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:27,678
microscope easily

2802
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:29,519
but there are technologies invented

2803
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:31,279
actually just down the hall

2804
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,440
in the building i'm at george church

2805
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:35,439
invented away his lab invented a way

2806
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:36,719
to look at which genes are switched on

2807
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:38,799
and off

2808
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,079
not only in a single cell which any lab

2809
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,159
can do these days

2810
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:44,000
but in situ where it's situated in the

2811
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:46,158
brain so you can say okay

2812
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,600
this nerve cell had these genes switched

2813
01:31:46,158 --> 01:31:50,559
on and they switched off

2814
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,760
we can recreate that but just scanning

2815
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,039
the brain and looking how the nerves are

2816
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,800
touching each other is not going to do

2817
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:56,960
it

2818
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,079
wow okay so you have to scan the full

2819
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,600
biology

2820
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:01,600
the full details and look at the

2821
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:03,039
epigenome and the apogenome too yeah

2822
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,039
which genes are on and off

2823
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:06,238
it's just easier to reset the epigenome

2824
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:08,639
and get them to work like they

2825
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:10,238
just use we're doing that now use the

2826
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:11,199
hardware already have just figure out

2827
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:14,079
how to uh

2828
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:15,599
make that hardware last longer right

2829
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:18,399
ultimately information will be lost

2830
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:20,079
even genetic information degrades slowly

2831
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:21,920
through mutations so we

2832
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:24,000
immortality is not achievable through

2833
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,679
that means though i think we could

2834
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,479
potentially reset the body hundreds of

2835
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:31,520
times and live for thousands of years

2836
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:34,000
okay so we talked about biology

2837
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,719
let's forgive me but let's talk about

2838
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,960
philosophy for just a brief moment

2839
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:40,880
so somebody i've enjoyed reading ernest

2840
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,840
becker wrote the denial of death there's

2841
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,440
also

2842
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:46,400
martin heidegger there's a bunch of

2843
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:46,399
philosophers who

2844
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:51,920
claim that most people live life in

2845
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:55,199
denial of death

2846
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:58,880
sort of we

2847
01:32:55,198 --> 01:33:00,638
don't fully internalize the idea that

2848
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,800
we're going to die

2849
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,800
the

2850
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:08,158
because if we did as as they say there

2851
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:12,319
will be a kind of

2852
01:33:08,158 --> 01:33:15,759
terror of um i mean

2853
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:17,119
a deep fear of death the fact that we

2854
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:21,039
don't know what's

2855
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:24,719
like we almost don't know what to do

2856
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:25,679
with non-existence with disappearing

2857
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,480
like our

2858
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:30,800
the way we draw meaning from life seems

2859
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:33,839
to be grounded in the fact that we exist

2860
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:35,279
and that we some point will not exist is

2861
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,880
terrifying and so

2862
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:39,519
we live in an illusion that we're not

2863
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,679
going to die and we run from that terror

2864
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:44,000
that's what ernest beckham would say do

2865
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:45,440
you think there's any truth to that

2866
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,800
oh i know there's truth to that i

2867
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:47,678
experience it every day when i talk to

2868
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,920
people

2869
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:50,800
we have to live that way although

2870
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:54,158
unfortunately

2871
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:56,880
i can't but for most people it's

2872
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:57,920
extremely stressing distressing to think

2873
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,400
about their own

2874
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:01,760
mortality we think about it occasionally

2875
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:02,158
and if we really thought about it every

2876
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,000
day

2877
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:06,158
we'd probably be brought to tears how

2878
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:10,000
much we not just miss ourselves but miss

2879
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:12,719
our family our friends we are

2880
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,158
all living life forms have evolved to to

2881
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:16,319
not want to die

2882
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:18,079
and when i mean one biochemically

2883
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:20,319
genetically physically

2884
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,600
that yeast cell the cells that i studied

2885
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:23,759
at mit

2886
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,120
they were fighting for their lives they

2887
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,960
didn't think

2888
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:28,880
but our brain has evolved the same

2889
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,800
survival aspect

2890
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,400
of course we don't want to die but the

2891
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,000
problem for us unfortunately

2892
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:36,000
it's a curse and a blessing is that

2893
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,319
we're now conscious we know

2894
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,238
that we're going to die most species

2895
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:42,399
that have ever existed don't

2896
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:43,519
that's a burden that's a curse and so

2897
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:46,079
what i think's happened is

2898
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:47,440
we've evolved certainly to want to live

2899
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:50,238
for a long time perhaps

2900
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:52,079
never want to die but the thought about

2901
01:34:50,238 --> 01:34:55,039
dying is so traumatic

2902
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:56,079
that there is an innate part of our

2903
01:34:55,039 --> 01:35:00,719
brains and it's probably

2904
01:34:56,079 --> 01:35:02,079
genetically wired to not think about it

2905
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,079
i really think that's part of being

2906
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:05,439
human and it because

2907
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,000
you know think about tribes that

2908
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:09,839
obsessed with longevity every day and

2909
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,760
that were going to die they probably

2910
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:13,199
didn't make much technological

2911
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,119
progress because they were just crying

2912
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:16,000
in their hearts every day or you know on

2913
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:18,319
the savannah

2914
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,279
so i really think that we've evolved to

2915
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:21,279
naturally

2916
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:23,118
deny aging and it's one of the problems

2917
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:25,840
that i face in my career

2918
01:35:23,118 --> 01:35:26,799
and you know when i speak publicly and

2919
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,960
on social media

2920
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,159
is that it's shocking people don't want

2921
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,600
to think about their age but i think

2922
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:34,399
it's getting better

2923
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:36,159
i think my book has helped these tests

2924
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:38,638
that we're developing should help people

2925
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:40,238
understand it's not a problem to think

2926
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:42,079
about your long-term health

2927
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:45,198
in fact if you don't you're going to

2928
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:47,359
reach 80 and really regret it

2929
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:48,319
and the other side of it so again ernest

2930
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:50,319
becker but also

2931
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:51,599
victor franklin recommended highly man

2932
01:35:50,319 --> 01:35:53,840
search for meeting

2933
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,800
uh bernard williams he's a moral

2934
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:58,079
philosopher

2935
01:35:54,800 --> 01:36:00,480
they kind of argue that this knowledge

2936
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:03,760
of death even if we often

2937
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:06,799
don't contemplate it we do at times

2938
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:08,560
and the very the what you call the curse

2939
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:11,199
which i agree with you it's a

2940
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:13,920
it's a curse and a blessing that we're

2941
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:17,118
able to contemplate our own mortality

2942
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,639
that gives meaning to life so death

2943
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:21,359
gives meaning to life

2944
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:22,719
is what viktor frankl's argues i would

2945
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:24,079
probably argue the same there's

2946
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:27,279
something about the scarcity

2947
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:28,479
of life and contemplating that that

2948
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:30,880
makes each moment

2949
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:32,158
that much sweeter is there something to

2950
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,960
that

2951
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:38,000
i think it's individual in my case it's

2952
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:40,319
completely wrong

2953
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,198
i appreciate you saying that i don't get

2954
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:42,799
joy out of

2955
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:44,799
every day because i think i'm going to

2956
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,400
die yeah i get joy out of every day

2957
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,279
because every day is joyous and i make

2958
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:49,198
it that way

2959
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:50,319
and even if i would if i thought i was

2960
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:52,158
going to live forever

2961
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:54,399
i would still be enjoying this moment

2962
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:58,000
just as much

2963
01:36:54,399 --> 01:37:01,439
and i bet you would too well that's uh

2964
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:04,079
i think about that a lot i i think

2965
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:04,960
it's very difficult to know i'm almost

2966
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:06,880
afraid

2967
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,118
that i wouldn't enjoy it as much if i

2968
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,239
was immortal i'm almost afraid to want

2969
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:14,399
to be immortal or

2970
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:14,399
to live longer because

2971
01:37:16,158 --> 01:37:19,198
it perhaps is a kind of justification

2972
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:22,158
for me to

2973
01:37:19,198 --> 01:37:23,759
accept that i'm going to die is saying

2974
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:26,000
like oh if i was immortal i wouldn't be

2975
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,840
able to enjoy life as much as i do

2976
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,238
but it's very possible that i wouldn't

2977
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:33,119
enjoy just as much

2978
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:34,158
of course enjoying life whether you're

2979
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:37,519
mortal or not

2980
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:37,920
takes work like it it requires you to

2981
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:39,920
have

2982
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:41,359
the right kind of freedom of mind you

2983
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,440
can discover

2984
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:44,399
you can focus your mind on the ugliness

2985
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:46,158
of life

2986
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:48,238
there's plenty of ugly things in this

2987
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:49,198
world and you can focus on them you can

2988
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:51,919
complain

2989
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:53,439
whenever like you know if it's raining

2990
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,000
outside

2991
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:57,439
you can you can focus on the fact that

2992
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,920
you have shelter and you enjoy the the

2993
01:37:57,439 --> 01:38:00,158
hell

2994
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,639
out of it or you can enjoy running in

2995
01:38:00,158 --> 01:38:04,719
the rain when it's warm and like

2996
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:06,639
the the beauty of nature just being one

2997
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:08,880
with nature or you can just complain

2998
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:10,319
this [ __ ] weather again in boston

2999
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,719
and there you see they're always raining

3000
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:15,679
or freezing damn it and like

3001
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:18,000
uh the the same the same thing with like

3002
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:21,920
wi-fi going out on airplanes

3003
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:25,679
like you can either complain about like

3004
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:27,440
stupid wi-fi and on jetblue or something

3005
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:29,279
or you could say like how incredible it

3006
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,039
is that i can fly through the sky and in

3007
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:31,679
a matter of hours be anywhere else in

3008
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:34,479
the world

3009
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:36,239
and then it could also on occasion watch

3010
01:38:34,479 --> 01:38:37,519
uh like check email and even watch

3011
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:39,519
movies through this

3012
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,199
while connecting through satellites that

3013
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,639
are flying to space so it's a matter of

3014
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:44,879
perspective and perhaps

3015
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:46,480
there's an extra level of work required

3016
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,560
when you're immortal

3017
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:50,319
because it's easier when you're immortal

3018
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:53,199
or live longer to

3019
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:54,000
uh to be lazy to delay stuff but if

3020
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:55,439
you're not

3021
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,279
you can still derive the same amount of

3022
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:59,759
joy it's possible

3023
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:00,479
it's possible it's definitely possible

3024
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,639
in my life

3025
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:04,158
i i went from being the nothing's

3026
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:06,960
working to

3027
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:08,000
every day is great to wake up to and i i

3028
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:10,319
think even if you

3029
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,079
live i think you're gonna live forever

3030
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:15,118
you can you can enjoy every day

3031
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:16,479
what i do is everything's relative we

3032
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:17,759
can compare ourselves to our neighbor

3033
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:19,359
who has more money

3034
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,800
or to the flight that should have had

3035
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:22,559
wi-fi or

3036
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,840
which is what i do i'm still six years

3037
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:29,039
old remember what a six-year-old does

3038
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:31,199
says look i can when i tell my fingers

3039
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:32,479
to form a fist they actually do that

3040
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:34,638
that's really cool

3041
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:36,319
that's how i live my life you know i'm i

3042
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:37,840
can pick up on your desk here this metal

3043
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:39,920
object it's a metal cube

3044
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,520
about an inch by an inch by an inch and

3045
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,520
i i tell myself not

3046
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,719
not about cubes but about inanimate

3047
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:47,520
objects

3048
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:49,359
probably once a day i'll say i'm a

3049
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,400
living thing i can think i can move i

3050
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:52,960
can eat i am

3051
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:55,679
full of energy and there's that leaf or

3052
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:58,399
this cube here that will never be alive

3053
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:59,039
that's what i look at and compare myself

3054
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:00,479
to

3055
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:02,238
and for as long as i live if it's

3056
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:05,198
forever of course it won't be but

3057
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:07,678
even if it was forever the relative to

3058
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:10,719
this lump of metal on this table here

3059
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,158
we are wondrous things in the universe

3060
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:15,439
and probably the most wondrous things in

3061
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:18,559
the universe yeah we're able to

3062
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:20,960
deeply appreciate the leaf or the cube

3063
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,840
and deeply appreciate ourselves which is

3064
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:25,439
uh

3065
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:27,440
it can be a curse but it's mostly a gift

3066
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:28,960
especially when you're such a beautiful

3067
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:32,000
poem

3068
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:33,198
now i'm six i'm as clever as clever so i

3069
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
think i'll be six

3070
01:40:33,198 --> 01:40:37,839

arthur shorpenhauer

3088

all truth passes through three stages

3089
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:18,239
first it is ridiculed second it is

3090
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:20,560
violently opposed

3091
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:22,158
third it is accepted as being

3092
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,760
self-evident

3093
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:33,599
