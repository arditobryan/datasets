00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,879
the following is a conversation with ray

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:07,679
dalio his second time on the podcast he

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:10,240
is a legendary investor founder of

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,638
bridgewater associates author of a book

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,280
i highly recommend called principles and

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:17,919
also a new book called principles for

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,320
dealing with a changing world order that

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,600
looks at the geopolitics of today

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,000
especially us and china to the lens of

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,160
history providing a fascinating model

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
for the rise and fall of empires that

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,079
can be applied to the analysis of our

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,238
world today

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,239

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,919
in the description and now here's my

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,120
conversation with ray dalio

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,840
when you look at the history of the

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,000
world as you have done in your new book

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,600
principles of dealing with the changing

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
world order

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,239
what is more important more impactful

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,320
money or power

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:59,038
they go hand in hand

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,039
they support each other and they um

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,719
compete with each other

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,680
those who have money

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,519
have power a certain type of power

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,680
um that power

30
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,798
has to do with all that they can buy but

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,920
it also

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,920
has the ability to influence those with

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,719
political power

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680
so

35
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:22,959
um and and so you see this throughout

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,280
history this symbiotic relationship

37
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:29,679
you know um for example between um

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,280
the royal families

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,280
the nobility

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,079
and the church

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,960
so you see that group of people

42
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,519
supporting each other in various ways

43
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,478
and then wrestling around with each

44
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,840
other

45
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:48,959
for the money and power among that group

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,560
so the dynamic that's quite classic is

47
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,798
you could look at

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,600
the parties in power

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,360
back in you know the

50
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:03,280
16th 17th centuries you would look at uh

51
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,920
royal families nobles and um and

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,920
the church if you're in europe and then

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
you would look at

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,159
agricultural land

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,559
and there was a certain dynamic

56
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:19,039
and that varies over time it changes

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,439
as those people get thrown out and

58
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,479
technology changes so when we

59
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,919
evolved when the society evolved so that

60
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,919
it would produce

61
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,399
goods and services

62
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,238
and you have something like the

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,039
industrial revolution the first

64
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,280
industrial revolution you have machines

65
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,000
and you have the talent of people that

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,159
are off the farms

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,360
and then you have a struggling for power

68
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,759
you see that power mix change

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,640
and so we don't see that same power mix

70
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:56,560
anymore but you still see the same

71
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:58,559
dynamic you see those with money

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,479
dealing with those who have

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,598
political power

74
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,840
around those assets that are considered

75
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:09,280
most valuable to particularly the

76
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,680
productive assets that produce money

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,919
and political power is usually centered

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,400
around nation state

79
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,839
so the major locus there's of power is

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,519
the nations

81
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,000
yes in

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,120
1668

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,039
after 30 years of war

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,239
there was

85
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,039
the development of nation states before

86
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,000
then

87
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,158
we had it was really the development of

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,360
countries as we know it that there were

89
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,878
borders

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,640
and that within those borders uh those

91
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:47,439
who had control got to control it and

92
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,839
there was not to be intrusions in those

93
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,359
borders and that's how we established

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,000
the nation state

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,319
and then of course within each country

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,680
there is levels

97
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,518
there is a

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,560
central level

99
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,519
and then there is a typically a province

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,519
or state level down below and then

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,879
there's a municipal level so they each

102
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,480
have different levels of power and it's

103
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:16,399
the coordination

104
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:19,120
of those that determines how the

105
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,078
country is run

106
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,199
you write that the quote archetypal big

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
cycle

108
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,759
governs the rising and declining empires

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,160
and influences everything about them

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,840
including their currencies and markets

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,800
the most important three cycles are the

112
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,039
ones

113
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,000
you mentioned in the introduction the

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,479
long-term debt and capital market cycle

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,600
the internal order and disorder cycle

116
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:46,240
and the external order and disorder

117
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,240
cycle can you describe this

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,639
big cycle

119
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,918
there are two orders

120
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,199
there is an order by a sip order i mean

121
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,159
a system

122
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,879
how the system works

123
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
so

124
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,918
there's an internal order

125
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,520
that is the internal governance system

126
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,799
and it's usually set out in a

127
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,959
constitution or some agreements

128
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,680
and then there's the world order

129
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,079
uh how the world system so for example

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,319
in 1945

131
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,399
um at the end of a war

132
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,639
which is basically a fight for

133
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,560
determining the world order

134
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:30,000
um the winners of the fight

135
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,439
got together and created the world

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,918
system as we now know it 44 they created

137
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,478
the brenton woods monetary system that

138
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,279
determined the money pretty much

139
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:44,000
and because the united states won

140
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,239
and had 80 percent of the world's money

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,079
gold was money then and had 80 of the

142
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
world's gold and it was half the world

143
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,439
economy and it was the great military

144
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
power

145
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,800
the

146
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,599
order was built around an american world

147
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,000
order so that the united nations was in

148
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,319
new york the world bank and the imf were

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,319
in washington and they built that new

150
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,280
order so classically

151
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,639
you have a war to determine whose rules

152
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:13,359
we're following and then you have um the

153
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,560
new water beings constructed

154
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,199
after that

155
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,720
there is usually period of extended

156
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,240
peace and

157
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,199
prosperity

158
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,000
uh peace suits prosperity

159
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,240
um and so there's not and the reason you

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,079
have the peace is because no one wants

161
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
to fight with the

162
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,240
um dominant power you know you're going

163
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,399
to lose you've surrendered there's been

164
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
the surrendering they carve up the world

165
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,359
they say what it's going to look like

166
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,560
who's going to control what and then

167
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,520
you come into that period of of peace

168
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,360
and then

169
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:53,038
prosperity where then there's uh

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,319
a working together usually at that point

171
00:06:53,038 --> 00:07:00,000
you've wiped out a lot of the

172
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,800
debt you've wiped out a lot of the

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,720
issues the class warfare and so on

174
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,960
and then there's good working together

175
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,639
so those great periods

176
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:13,439
um such as the industrial revolution in

177
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,360
the late 1800s

178
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,839
or what we've experienced in the

179
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,160
post-world war ii period are peaceful

180
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,439
and prosperous periods

181
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,840
led largely by the dominant world power

182
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,000
over a period of time

183
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,679
since really 1500

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,800
and maybe before but really 1500

185
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,759
when the

186
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,560
dutch

187
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,479
invented capitalism and what i mean by

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,120
that they invest invented the first

189
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,879
capital markets the first stocks and the

190
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,319
first stock market

191
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,639
um that since then capitalism has been

192
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,520
an effective tool for building wealth

193
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,840
because it got resources into the hands

194
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,560
of inventive people

195
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,318
that's when we moved from agriculture to

196
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,120
the importance of inventiveness of

197
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,439
people they got resources and then they

198
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,918
built that prosperity

199
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:09,199
in that process of doing that

200
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:11,918
they create wealth gaps naturally those

201
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,319
who make a lot of money

202
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,918
make a lot more and than those that

203
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,720
don't

204
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,159
and

205
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:24,000
it also produces opportunity gaps

206
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,400
because uh for example those who earn a

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,639
lot of money have that wealth

208
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,918
they have the power to educate their

209
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,120
children in a way that others don't

210
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,799
and

211
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,479
the gaps grow

212
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:42,000
and also the debts grow at that time

213
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,839
when they go around the world with their

214
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,720
competitiveness

215
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,959
they

216
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,959
earn a lot of money so for example the

217
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,439
dutch the dutch empire

218
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:54,239
learned how to build ships

219
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,720
um and that would go around the world a

220
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,919
key ingredient of this improvement in

221
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,879
this cycle

222
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,199
is the improvement of education and by

223
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:06,000
education i mean the skills that come

224
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,560
from education but also civility the

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
ability to deal with well together

226
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,838
so the dutch

227
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,759
invented ships that could go around the

228
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,680
world and they had military power but

229
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:20,240
they were also very inventive society 25

230
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,359
of the world's new inventions came from

231
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,600
the dutch

232
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,159
and so as they went around the world

233
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,320
they also brought their currency

234
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,480
and they brought their military they

235
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,120
needed their the currency they paid for

236
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,680
things um and that currency and then the

237
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,919
more that happens the more that becomes

238
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,239
a reserve currency

239
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,159
and then they have their military so

240
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,759
they need their military strength and so

241
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:48,159
you see it evolve in all of those ways

242
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:51,120
but over a period of time

243
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,639
um as they become more successful and

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,240
more expensive

245
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,600
um they became they become more

246
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,639
expensive

247
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,159
um

248
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,958
and and

249
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,159
newer countries come along like um the

250
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,119
uk

251
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,319
um

252
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,879
then uh be learned to build ships from a

253
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,399
lot the dutch and could do that less

254
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,679
expensively

255
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,480
and also when they become more

256
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,120
expensive so less competitive and also

257
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,800
the work ethic begins to change they

258
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,519
believe that since they're richer they

259
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,120
can enjoy life more they don't have to

260
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,839
work quite as hard

261
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,919
and so you start to see the tilt

262
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,320
now you start to see the development of

263
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,240
the top and when you have a world

264
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,879
reserve currency

265
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,399
that allows you to borrow a lot of money

266
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:42,559
because those who want to save

267
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,559
want to hold your money and that means

268
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,958
that they'll lend you money and so those

269
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,278
countries get deeper into debt

270
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,278
so you see that they gradually lose

271
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,399
their competitiveness

272
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:57,200
and they um and they get themselves into

273
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,559
financial circumstances which are not

274
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,278
good

275
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,639
and they have large wealth gaps

276
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,879
which set the stage for downturns and

277
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,039
when they have downturns

278
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,919
um the first question is do they have

279
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:16,159
enough money and traditionally you know

280
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:18,958
uh money is is resources um so you

281
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,838
classically see that the coffers are

282
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,838
bare

283
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,800
that they're spending more money than

284
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,160
their

285
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,799
than they are earning and they run out

286
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,919
of money in the coffers

287
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,240
and their granaries are empty rather

288
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,199
than stocked so that they give them the

289
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
buffer

290
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,200
and as that deteriorates that's that

291
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,320
worsens conditions and if they have a

292
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,519
rival power that's also challenging them

293
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,720
they see greater internal conflict over

294
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,200
wealth

295
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,000
and then they have the problems

296
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,519
internally and the problems externally

297
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,799
which usually results in an internal war

298
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,720
or an external war that leads to the

299
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:06,240
change in the to the new world order

300
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,600
and to you the dutch empire is a good

301
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,278
example that

302
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,120
the british

303
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,039
what are some of the key examples that

304
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,039
you think about in the book

305
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,159
of this process that follow the big

306
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,078
cycle

307
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,559
well the leading reserve currency

308
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,759
empires but it applies to all the

309
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,958
empires

310
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,600
um

311
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:28,159
were the the dutch the british uh the

312
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,120
american and the chinese

313
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,078
um but um you could follow the same

314
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,720
pattern

315
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:38,159
um in the book i it was very important

316
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,278
for me to not just use words and

317
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:44,000
concepts because that's subjective it

318
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,720
was very important for me to use

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,440
actual measurements so as you see in the

320
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,920
book you can see every level of this you

321
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,800
can see where is the education level

322
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,199
what is the military power each one of

323
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,199
those and you could see them back going

324
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,399
over the 500 years

325
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,240
and so um you can see the arcs and the

326
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,679
composition of those

327
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,919
arcs and what you see is really in most

328
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,399
countries in most dynasties you can see

329
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,439
that but you also can see through those

330
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,958
numbers

331
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,279
the health um of those countries today

332
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,159
um there are there are statistics that

333
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:25,278
you could that are in the book that show

334
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:28,319
what is the level of education what is

335
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,919
the letter level of economic output what

336
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,800
is the level of

337
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,719
um military strength what is the level

338
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,120
of a number of different measures of

339
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,278
strength so that you can then compare

340
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,519
that and i think that because there are

341
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,320
objective measures of strength that you

342
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,120
could see change

343
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,278
that shows the picture of where we are

344
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,519
today and i think one of the most

345
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,480
important things about the book

346
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,198
is that it allows people to monitor how

347
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,959
those things are transpiring i think for

348
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,679
policy makers

349
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:04,119
um you know are your policy policymakers

350
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,879
doing a good job and there's so much

351
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,919
subjectivity in that but i think it's

352
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:12,078
very simple if those lines on the chart

353
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,360
are improving if your health index is

354
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,519
improving

355
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,079
then you're moving toward a better life

356
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,879
so that's what the book works like also

357
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,000
it was used to create a model for the

358
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,480
future

359
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,078
in other words there are cause effect

360
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,959
relationships

361
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:33,838
everything that happens has reasons

362
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,719
causes that preceded it that made it

363
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,920
happen

364
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,040
and so by having all those in numbers

365
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:44,799
one can see the probabilities of certain

366
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:46,799
things happening so um that's what

367
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,838
that's what you see in in the book it's

368
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,078
not just

369
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,760
you know rey's interpretation i didn't

370
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,000
want to make it raise interpretation

371
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,759
because i don't know if i'm right yeah

372
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,639
so one of the fascinating things in the

373
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,278
book so you have list these 18 measures

374
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
and there's like a little scorecard

375
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,720
for the

376
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,679
countries of the world today so let's

377
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,160
say u.s china and europe

378
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,838
and what it was 20 years ago and looking

379
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,919
at the change from 20 years ago and

380
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,440
that's another indicator to change

381
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,120
itself to see

382
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,440
where things are headed

383
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,560
maybe can you comment on

384
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,000
from a score perspective how is u.s and

385
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,159
china doing

386
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,078
and in the 18 measures what are some

387
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,559
measures that stand out to you is

388
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,278
particularly important to think about

389
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,679
today for the united states for china

390
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,639
well there are a number um

391
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,638
financially

392
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,120
what you see in the united states is

393
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,720
that um

394
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,560
we're borrowing a lot more money

395
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,240
creating a lot of debt

396
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:53,119
and we're uh printing a lot of money

397
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,680
and our capacity to do that

398
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,959
is very much is limited first of all

399
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:01,758
because um when you when there's a sale

400
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:04,319
of a bond when the government

401
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,680
borrows more than it borrows money

402
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,160
because it spends more than it takes in

403
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,198
um you have to sell a bond

404
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,360
and the world right now has a lot of us

405
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,319
dollar denominated bonds because as the

406
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,039
world's reserve currency they sell sold

407
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,560
on them and they have very

408
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,120
bad returns

409
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:27,679
negative real returns negative real

410
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,240
returns significantly and so on

411
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,479
so that um

412
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
means that more bonds has to be sold

413
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,519
than

414
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,560
um are

415
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,919
bought

416
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,479
and that means that the federal reserve

417
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,958
has is faced with the choice of having

418
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,278
to raise the interest rate

419
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,119
to curtail borrowing

420
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,519
which slows the economy and hurts the

421
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,278
markets or by

422
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,360
filling that difference

423
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,879
and producing money the debt

424
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,680
monetization

425
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:03,360
which produces an inflation

426
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:06,639
in goods services and financial assets

427
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,798
so in that regard that's our the united

428
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,839
states's position

429
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:14,480
in china's case its balance of payments

430
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,318
um is a better

431
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,400
um china has

432
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,519
displaced the united states

433
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,280
as the world's largest trading country

434
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,720
in other words more exports to other

435
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:29,519
countries and as a result it's

436
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,279
economically competitive

437
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,000
but it doesn't have the world's reserve

438
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:36,480
currency it's a real blessing so the

439
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,919
united states it has the world's reserve

440
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,880
currency but it is risking it because of

441
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,600
this imbalance so if you look at history

442
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,200
you see that those go slowly but when

443
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:50,000
they go

444
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,558
eventually they go quickly

445
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,720
so there's a risk of of

446
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,359
of that financially

447
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,319
then there's the issue of uh internal

448
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,079
order

449
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,759
so i'm just giving you the major ones

450
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,639
but i'll get into some of the other ones

451
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,160
too

452
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,480
right now um there's a lot of internal

453
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,080
conflict in the united states

454
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:16,000
uh which affects its and um

455
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:18,480
how well it works um in china there's

456
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,160
less internal conflict because it's a

457
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,880
more autocratic

458
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,038
state but also they've created

459
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,280
this bifurcation

460
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:30,160
of what is political

461
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,558
and what is um economic in terms of

462
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,038
producing that prosperity so if you stay

463
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,160
out of the politics pretty much

464
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,400
um

465
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,480
and then you're seeing um

466
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,400
entrepreneurship you're seeing the

467
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,960
finances of new businesses and so on and

468
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,919
so that internal working

469
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,679
um you know that's subject to different

470
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,480
people's interpretations whether they

471
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,960
like it or not but the internal conflict

472
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,360
in terms of those kinds of measures is

473
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,759
is less sorry to pause on that for a

474
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:05,038
second so these measures

475
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,038
i guess you don't want to sort of um

476
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,919
romanticize any one measure or something

477
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:12,640
like that over interpret any one measure

478
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,000
but is internal conflict

479
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,400
always a bad thing is some is this uh

480
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,079
is it a complicated calculation or do

481
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,519
you kind of the way we think about these

482
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,038
measures that you've presented we should

483
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,319
be thinking like

484
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:28,319
the higher the better the lower worse or

485
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,159
i mean of course depending on well

486
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,240
in many cases

487
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,759
the conflict that produces the

488
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,960
revolution

489
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,200
produces revolutionary changes

490
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,960
that lead to

491
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,480
resolutions

492
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,759
that and lead to new starts

493
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,000
and so

494
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,319
their short term

495
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,798
a short-term civil war

496
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:56,879
is a hellacious experience

497
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:59,279
and at the same time it can be um the

498
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,320
transition to a new beginning

499
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,918
um

500
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,038
also there are different types of

501
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,280
conflict

502
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,079
uh competition

503
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:11,519
which makes things makes everything

504
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,720
better is is a productive

505
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,000
conflict

506
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,839
whereas destructive conflicts

507
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,880
are

508
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:23,918
not good over the short time

509
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,520
so you know that's how that those go so

510
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,038
within each measure the story

511
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,599
is complicated

512
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,359
yeah but my measures are are sort of

513
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,798
clear meaning

514
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,639
how much political conflict how much

515
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,480
social conflict

516
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,280
in other words you can measure conflict

517
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,759
you can measure fighting you can measure

518
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,200
crime rates you can measure

519
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:49,679
um

520
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,480
lots of different ways of conflict so

521
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,600
the measures are a composite of

522
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,839
different types of internal conflict

523
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,918
what are some other interesting measures

524
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,918
maybe if you can also mention like for

525
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,320
me in particular interest is education

526
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,880
and innovation yes

527
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,639
the classic cycle the most important

528
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,120
leading indicator

529
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,280
is the quality of education

530
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,839
most importantly

531
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,119
broad-based

532
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:19,839
education drawn as a

533
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:22,399
from the largest population because you

534
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,319
can never tell who the talent is going

535
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,480
to be so where they're going to come

536
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,960
from so for example if you look at the

537
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,120
chinese dynasties the great chinese

538
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,400
dynasties um and the confucian approach

539
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,879
it was meritocratic of um

540
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,440
everybody could sit for exams and so on

541
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,120
broad base of drawing in the populations

542
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,038
and you see that if you go across

543
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,439
societies

544
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:50,798
because that draws on the largest number

545
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:55,200
of population to get education

546
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:57,200
and it also um that creates um

547
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,919
a reality and a

548
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,240
perception that the system is fairer

549
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,559
equal opportunity not just one of

550
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,159
privilege and that helps to create

551
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,918
social stability

552
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:12,159
but education

553
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,480
is not just uh education in

554
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,679
understanding facts and so on it is

555
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,960
education

556
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,360
and um

557
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,120
civility of how to behave together and

558
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,839
so if they're smart

559
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:25,759
they understand how to be productive

560
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,720
because they work well together and

561
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:31,279
they're productive and then that leads

562
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,038
to the next stage you could see in the

563
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:37,519
lines in the charts we i plotted these

564
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,919
so that you could see in a typical cycle

565
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,359
you could see that education is the long

566
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,000
leading

567
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,279
indicator and then you could see as you

568
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,599
mentioned

569
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:51,119
that you what you see is inventiveness

570
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:52,079
and technology measures then follow and

571
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,479
you see

572
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,279
then also competitiveness in world

573
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,240
markets follows for example in the early

574
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,399
stages of a cycle the industries that

575
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,640
they go into um

576
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,880
tend to be very basic industry because

577
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,720
they have cheap labor something like

578
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,360
textiles and

579
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,400
simple manufactured goods and so on but

580
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:18,000
as the education rises then they move up

581
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,559
the value chain to uh tech greater

582
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,679
technologies and so on which raises

583
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:26,000
incomes and raises productivity so yes

584
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,400
those and and you know as you say there

585
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,240
are 18 different measures like that but

586
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,640
education um

587
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,880
and then civility and the inventiveness

588
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,440
so you see it reflected in

589
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,000
in who's inventing what

590
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,679
um and that corresponds then who's

591
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,079
trading with

592
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,320
who's a big trading country and where's

593
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,798
the value of economic output and what

594
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,960
are per capita incomes they all follow

595
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,798
those arcs

596
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,640
yeah like you said the fascinating thing

597
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,000
about your book so there's philosophy

598
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,559
there's wisdom

599
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,798
uh but there's plots

600
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,798
yeah you can see it

601
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,879
so it's not just your opinion it's kind

602
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,278
of like uh you can interpret it any way

603
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,919
you like uh but you're just giving a lot

604
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,919
of of your own insights along with the

605
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,038
numbers

606
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,278
if you were to look at the american

607
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,960
nation the american empire

608
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:19,919
and the trajectory is looking into the

609
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,558
future

610
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,200
given these measures

611
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,678
what is the trajectory that leads to the

612
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,600
collapse of the american empire based on

613
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,880
these measures what are the concerning

614
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:35,439
indicators and if um if those break down

615
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,520
further what does that look like

616
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,759
well all of those indicators

617
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,918
are concerning

618
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,919
um maybe

619
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,919
except for one which is technology

620
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,559
the technology niche

621
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,038
although even in that area the united

622
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:58,720
states is

623
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:01,119
improving at a slower rate than is china

624
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,200
for various advantages that they have

625
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,599
there they put out about eight times as

626
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,519
many computer engineers they have free

627
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:13,199
data and so on but if you look at them

628
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:18,558
so the financial is a is a concern

629
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:21,278
the internal order disorder is a concern

630
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,440
then if you look at education levels

631
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:26,079
the united states

632
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,720
is in many way is is losing its

633
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:32,319
educational advantage if you were to

634
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,200
look at compare it with china

635
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,798
if you take general public education in

636
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,159
the united states

637
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:42,558
it's deteriorated tremendously even in

638
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,720
comparison to developed countries

639
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,798
there are scores pieces scores and so on

640
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,480
and it's you know something like 38th in

641
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,519
the world or something and that was a

642
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,000
big plunge average public education if

643
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,639
you look at the best universities in the

644
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,480
world the united states is unique in

645
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,720
having the best universities in the

646
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,759
world so there are these privileged

647
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,960
spots

648
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:07,440
um that are you know excellent

649
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,278
uniquely excellent so when you look at

650
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,600
the comparison education in china

651
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,400
is improving rapidly

652
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:19,359
and it and the quantity

653
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,320
is a quantity of educated people in the

654
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,359
areas that they're moving in are is is

655
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,119
greater

656
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:28,158
and the resources that they're putting

657
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,759
behind it is greater and so you see the

658
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,000
results are greater

659
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,599
um but um

660
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,359
it's sort of along the lines that i'm

661
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,480
i'm dealing with if you were to follow

662
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,879
through

663
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,679
in terms of um

664
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,039
actual productions i i think uh you you

665
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,600
know in terms of technologies um there

666
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,839
are some areas that the united states is

667
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:52,879
in a lead at the moment there's some

668
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,079
areas that china's in a lead but china's

669
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,440
gaining

670
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,000
very quickly when i first went to china

671
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,600
1984

672
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,079
i would bring 10 calculators and i gave

673
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,839
them away as gifts to high ranking

674
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,678
people and they thought they were

675
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,639
miracle devices

676
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,480
um

677
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,880
right now in terms of areas like quantum

678
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,679
computing and a.i and

679
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,159
and

680
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,360
you know many areas

681
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,760
you have a race going on and so if you

682
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,678
take the trajectory of the

683
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,158
competitiveness not just look at the

684
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,120
current level you have a situation where

685
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,520
they're improving at a much faster rate

686
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:36,479
this is all good for the world if the

687
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:39,200
world can get along

688
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,640
and the main thing i think is

689
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,960
um

690
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,480
in just

691
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,079
how do you have a healthy world and how

692
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,759
do you have a strong economy and how do

693
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:53,439
you have a strong situation is be strong

694
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:56,079
the united states is war is with itself

695
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,150
that's the main war you know it's very

696
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,439
simple in history

697
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,320
[Music]

698
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,519
be financially sound earn more than you

699
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,558
spend

700
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,000
um

701
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,678
and be strong in these ways

702
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,398
and pretty much everything will take

703
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,399
care of itself

704
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,959
but you make it sound simple of course

705
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,880
because there's a momentum when things

706
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,600
degrade when the education system

707
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,000
degrades when you start borrowing

708
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,798
when um i mean all of these indicators

709
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,558
once once they start going down it's uh

710
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,798
there's a momentum to it right so it's

711
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,200
hard to reverse it right and there are

712
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,960
circumstances that you're then in

713
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,798
uh for example

714
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,079
indebtedness

715
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:42,240
you know it's politically

716
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,639
desirable for those in

717
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,519
to borrow money and spend

718
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,120
because their constituencies only look

719
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,278
at what they get

720
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,278
and when they get a lot they don't pay

721
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,759
attention to the balance sheet and how

722
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,960
much debt is on the books so it's always

723
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,480
better to

724
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,798
borrow spend

725
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,759
and then leave the cleanup to the next

726
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,639
guy

727
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:07,119
and so you inherit a lot

728
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,240
you inherited as

729
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:13,278
a new president enters in or new

730
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,640
legislators they have a lot of debt

731
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:19,839
they have a broken down infrastructure

732
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,720
um they don't have enough money to fix

733
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,079
that

734
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,519
and so that's the lay of the land that

735
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:30,879
the prior generations put you in

736
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:33,278
and there you are and so that's right

737
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,320
um it's difficult because when you start

738
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:38,398
to think okay what's healthy well spend

739
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,519
earn more than you spend well that's not

740
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:40,398
so easy

741
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,480
because

742
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,759
you know what does that mean go earn

743
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,200
more i mean okay that's not so easy

744
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,960
spend less

745
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,600
that isn't going to work

746
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,558
so now what do you do okay you have this

747
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,719
debt that you then monetize and that's

748
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,359
why it's classic so yes that's why these

749
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,640
cycles occur because what has created

750
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,719
before put

751
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,720
what happened before created the lay of

752
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,319
the land that is then increasingly

753
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,079
difficult to deal with

754
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,480
so what can great leaders do in this

755
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,359
moment i mean maybe um

756
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,000
my sense is leadership is crucial here

757
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,319
so for example to do very large projects

758
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,079
that invest in the education system that

759
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,119
sort of try to

760
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,759
fix the fundamentals or maybe

761
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,119
invest more and more into the innovation

762
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:29,440
and the develop development of new

763
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:31,839
technologies and so on

764
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,840
it feels like that just doesn't happen

765
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,959
organically

766
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:39,278
so you have to have strong

767
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,679
leaders that

768
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,519
convince the populace of the importance

769
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,559
of these ideas

770
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,839
well i completely agree with your list

771
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,398
what we have is a situation where

772
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:53,038
everybody

773
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:55,359
has their opinions and they have to sort

774
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,278
of get them exactly right and they all

775
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,439
fight with each other about whether

776
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:00,398
their opinions so the most important

777
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,759
thing

778
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,719
is that we are become bipartisan so that

779
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,278
we don't

780
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,159
and we get over our differences i would

781
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,839
have a bipartisan cabinet

782
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,960
i would draw upon

783
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,918
um

784
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,240
both members of both parties the the

785
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,399
moderates who are going to be able to

786
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,240
work together

787
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:27,119
so as then we have one country

788
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,278
and then we deal with those in

789
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,359
a means that works for the majority of

790
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,398
the people in the middle rather than the

791
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:36,158
polarity

792
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:38,798
i think our greatest risk is in not

793
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,679
being able to do that so i would say

794
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,158
that's

795
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,640
a paramount importance

796
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,399
because we have the resources

797
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,440
you know um

798
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:51,439
wealth real wealth and and science and

799
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,320
everything has never been better than it

800
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,480
is

801
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,639
but the notion is that it has to work

802
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,759
for the majority of people

803
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,038
and we

804
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:03,919
have to keep it being productive so that

805
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:07,359
that group has got to calmly and

806
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,080
knowledgeably work together so that they

807
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:12,558
increase the size of the pie and they

808
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:15,519
create broad-based prosperity

809
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:18,798
so that is a paramount importance

810
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:21,839
whatever they do if they do it that way

811
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:24,960
i can say i'm happy about because that

812
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:27,959
other alternative is the really scary

813
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,960
alternative

814
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,319
the

815
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,240
the scary alternative

816
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:35,839
the different ways it has evolved

817
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,440
throughout history

818
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,439
some of it has led to wars

819
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,319
what are the future trajectories that

820
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,599
lead to a potential war with china

821
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,759
cold war

822
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,199
or hot war is this something you think

823
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,079
about is this something you're worried

824
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,399
about

825
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,319
yeah i'd like to talk about both wars so

826
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,719
the war with china

827
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:59,918
as i say there are five kinds of wars

828
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,880
there's a trade war tech um technology

829
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,278
war

830
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,519
geopolitical influence war

831
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,599
um capital war

832
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,359
and military war

833
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:14,240
i um as far as military war goes i only

834
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:16,319
i think it's only a taiwan issue

835
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,839
um but that's a big issue

836
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,720
and we could talk about that for a

837
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,839
minute

838
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,919
but those others there'll be uh rough

839
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:26,319
competitions

840
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,720
and we'll have that type of evolution

841
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,398
over a period of time that's what

842
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,880
that war looks like

843
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,839
taiwan has been

844
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,840
for a long time

845
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
a sovereignty issue to china

846
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,038
and it has its roots in what's called

847
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:50,639
the hundred years of humiliation

848
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:53,679
from the 1840s to 1949

849
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,640
foreign powers came in took advantage of

850
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,679
china

851
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,120
they had the opium wars and such times

852
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,440
and

853
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,959
and that represented the 100 years of

854
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,759
humiliation

855
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,759
and

856
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,759
taiwan

857
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,918
represents is

858
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,760
their sovereignty and

859
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,638
their important thing and

860
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,320
50 years ago starting 50 years ago there

861
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,358
was an agreement that there is one china

862
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,440
and

863
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:24,159
taiwan is part of china

864
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,878
and that there would be

865
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,919
peaceful reunification

866
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,480
the

867
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:33,199
the peaceful reunification hasn't

868
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,358
happened and in their view

869
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,358
that's a very big issue and so it's a

870
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:41,279
big contentious issue

871
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:43,358
and that uh could produce a military war

872
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,119
um could produce a military accident

873
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:48,398
could produce a it's a very tense

874
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,760
situation and if we had a military war

875
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,480
god help us

876
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,679
because of the capacity in all different

877
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,880
new ways to inflict um harm on each

878
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,838
other but anyway that's that's that if

879
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,400
you don't have that military war you'll

880
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:07,440
have the competition between

881
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,280
those other kinds of wars and whoever is

882
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:13,440
strongest in those areas will um win

883
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,480
where do you put cyber war within the

884
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,519
five

885
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,079
well cyber war is a military war i'm

886
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,480
assuming the type of cyber war that

887
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,800
you're using you're referring to is that

888
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,838
which it's used to inflict pain on the

889
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,599
other party through cyber so cyber wars

890
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,838
you'll see cyber war

891
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,800
you could see space war

892
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:38,960
you can see drone warfare

893
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,440
you um new types of warfare not just

894
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,599
the traditional and nuclear type of

895
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,838
warfare but you could see any of the

896
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,838
above

897
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,880
what are the defining characteristics

898
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,440
what are the interesting things about xi

899
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,760
jinping the president of china

900
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,559
as a leader on the world stage

901
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,040
his father was a

902
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:05,059
early

903
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:06,639
leader he was himself

904
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:09,279
[Music]

905
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:11,279
in the cultural revolution at times

906
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,640
treated

907
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,839
brutally

908
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:17,679
um and during that period of time it was

909
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,920
very very difficult

910
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:22,480
and he came up

911
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,480
you know through the ranks and he's a

912
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,480
very

913
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,440
intelligent man

914
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,079
when he first came to power they as you

915
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,639
know they have two five-year terms

916
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,880
and we're now coming to the end of the

917
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:39,039
second of those five-year terms when he

918
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,440
first came to power

919
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,719
he felt that there should be a lot of

920
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,559
reform

921
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:49,279
and reform meant moving to much more of

922
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,239
a market an open economy

923
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,960
when

924
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:56,078
that happened in him coming in

925
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,400
i had some contact with economic

926
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,599
policymakers but and the circumstances

927
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,920
then were that five major banks

928
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,760
lent to state-owned enterprises and

929
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,599
local governments with implied

930
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,160
government guarantees

931
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,559
and so there was not control of that and

932
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:15,598
they and the movement to aim more of a

933
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:18,719
market economy and the development of

934
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,880
markets uh was a primary and also the

935
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,118
dealing with the corruption issue there

936
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,680
was a lot of corruption

937
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,880
prior to that and that was viewed as an

938
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:31,519
existential threat to the system so that

939
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,800
became the primary objective

940
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,480
and then as time progressed

941
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,839
over those 10 years

942
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,400
there was a

943
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,719
a lot of changing

944
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,200
in the world finance their financial

945
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,799
circumstances opening many many other

946
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,960
markets

947
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,200
they particularly getting money to small

948
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,119
and medium-sized enterprises and

949
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:56,399
developing a lending system and then

950
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,440
establishing controls on it so right now

951
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,680
um

952
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,679
there's

953
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:02,559
a vibrant

954
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,838
um

955
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:08,719
capital markets um you can raise capital

956
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,400
you can be an entrepreneur you can

957
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,399
become a billionaire

958
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,240
um in the capital markets and they

959
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,320
develop the markets to be the second

960
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,879
largest capital markets

961
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,920
at the same time um

962
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,599
they had to deal with their um rising

963
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,720
debt issue

964
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,559
which they began to deal with uh really

965
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,199
about four years ago

966
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:33,358
when the second

967
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:35,439
term began

968
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:39,598
and the um

969
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,800
and then uh lu huh became um

970
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:46,240
the vice premier um responsible for that

971
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,119
and to um and deal with uh those issues

972
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:51,679
so you see right now that what's

973
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,440
happening is uh the dealing with the

974
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,919
real estate bubble there was a

975
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,880
development in real estate a bubble

976
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:03,358
which produced um a lot of unproductive

977
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,640
lending and xi ping said

978
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,799
you know

979
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:10,239
houses are meant to live in not to

980
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,079
speculate on and so that was wasteful so

981
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,799
they established what they call three

982
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,680
red lines which are financial ratios

983
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,800
that the property developers had to live

984
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:23,598
within and that is then causing the

985
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,119
adjustments that are going on now which

986
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,119
in my view are very healthy because um

987
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,760
whenever there's uh bankruptcies and so

988
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,160
on the most in the public think okay

989
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,320
that's a problem it's in many cases

990
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,118
really a cleaning up of bad debts and

991
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,200
bad practices and so um that's what's

992
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,519
going on so that's let's say

993
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:48,719
economically at the same time there is

994
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:51,358
the changing relationships the changing

995
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,039
world order the changing relationships

996
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,719
with the united states and other

997
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:59,920
countries which is becoming um much less

998
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:01,919
cooperative and much more war-like much

999
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,119
more confrontational

1000
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,440
um those two things the

1001
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,880
the domestic debt problem and domestic

1002
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,599
has led to

1003
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,480
um what's called core what they call

1004
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,119
core leadership which means

1005
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,240
a leadership more around him

1006
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,680
that

1007
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,039
is less

1008
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,279
challenging

1009
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,679
because they believe in history

1010
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,319
that during very difficult times

1011
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:30,639
um a more centrally controlled

1012
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,639
decision-making process lends itself

1013
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,598
better than to a more fragmented

1014
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,279
political contentious project and that's

1015
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,079
basically what's

1016
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,079
going on now

1017
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,680
you said it very eloquently

1018
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,480
but you mean

1019
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,078
the leadership is surrounded by yes men

1020
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,000
and there's a lot of

1021
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,240
centralized control

1022
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,358
that characterization

1023
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:57,039
is view is much more black and white

1024
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,920
than it really is

1025
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,838
uh but it leans towards that direction

1026
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,079
they're like for example of the standing

1027
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:07,119
members of the polar bureau four are

1028
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,359
more eligi allied him

1029
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,440
three or less so

1030
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,559
you have to understand that it's kind of

1031
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,159
a collective leadership at the top

1032
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,639
and then of course there's just

1033
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,559
jockeying for power um you know in a

1034
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:24,480
highly political sense

1035
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:28,639
um at the top uh but no one leader can

1036
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,199
be successful against the uh all those

1037
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:33,679
powers at the top so it's very

1038
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,078
politically negotiating it's you know

1039
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,159
it's very much more like if you put

1040
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,079
um in the united states the democrats

1041
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,920
and the republicans and they had to be

1042
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,039
in the same government and they work it

1043
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,440
out uh it's kind of something like that

1044
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,679
and then so that's that struggle but

1045
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,358
it's an internal struggle

1046
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,399
where do you put the importance of some

1047
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,078
of these

1048
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,200
ideas at the founding of the united

1049
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,318
states

1050
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,159
when then

1051
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:02,318
now we're talking about at the context

1052
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:03,920
of china the freedom of speech freedoms

1053
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:05,920
what china is doing with the central

1054
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,400
management of a lot of things it's

1055
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,880
enabling a lot of growth

1056
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,119
but it's also limiting

1057
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,160
people on the very basic level in terms

1058
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,559
of freedom the kind of freedom that

1059
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,318
i think can lead to entrepreneurship to

1060
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,239
starting new businesses to having big

1061
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:24,480
dreams and chasing those dreams and then

1062
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,879
creating totally new things in whatever

1063
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,920
the space maybe in technology

1064
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,240
in business and whatever

1065
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,880
what how important is that as a metric

1066
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:39,279
for society well they have a view which

1067
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,440
is the idea of a dialectic which means

1068
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,760
that two things are at obvious that

1069
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,400
everything comes with pros and cons and

1070
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,800
two opposites exist

1071
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,200
and you want the benefits of those two

1072
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,800
opposites and how do you deal with the

1073
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:57,279
benefits of those two opposites right so

1074
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,720
let's say you want the capital markets

1075
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,880
because it gets uh money into the hands

1076
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:05,279
of the entrepreneurs who are motivated

1077
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,720
they build fortunes and that drives an

1078
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,240
economy to do very well and at the same

1079
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:14,239
time um it produces uh the other

1080
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,799
problems the wealth gaps the other

1081
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:19,118
problems then the debt cycle that we're

1082
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,920
talking about and so on and deng

1083
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,280
xiaoping you know how do you reconcile

1084
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,079
communism

1085
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,560
and

1086
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,880
um the market economy and the capital

1087
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:33,119
markets and he uh famously said um

1088
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,880
and if it doesn't matter if it's a white

1089
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,760
cat or a black cat just as long as it

1090
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,559
catches mice in other words if it if it

1091
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,400
works in making the country richer

1092
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,400
then that becomes the objective and then

1093
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,838
they move that along so there are these

1094
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,079
conflicts

1095
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:49,599
um and um

1096
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,079
one of the leaders

1097
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,160
described it to me as follows because

1098
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,599
it's confusion and it goes back over a

1099
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:58,000
period of time

1100
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,640
there's a a hierarchy and it's an

1101
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,159
extension of uh the family he described

1102
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:05,199
it and he said the united states is a

1103
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,598
country

1104
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:13,519
of individuals and individualism

1105
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,039
and that is its vibrancy that um

1106
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,400
we see

1107
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:19,489
the individual

1108
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,800
rights to speak up the individual

1109
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:22,959
[Music]

1110
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,359
protection of the individual individual

1111
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,559
property rights and all of those things

1112
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:30,239
as of uh paramount importance and we

1113
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,480
build our organization that's why

1114
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,399
democracy is from the bottom up or even

1115
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,358
a company we'll get together and we'll

1116
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,838
be partners to proper prosper together

1117
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,920
that is the american approach

1118
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:44,960
um he was describing

1119
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,559
that in china it's an extension of the

1120
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,199
confucian family essentially and so it's

1121
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:54,318
almost like um um you know there's a

1122
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:56,559
hierarchy and so what they think about

1123
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:59,279
is the common good

1124
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:01,519
uh not the individualism

1125
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,160
so for example if they want a high-speed

1126
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:06,639
rail to go from one place to another and

1127
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,879
that's best in the common good

1128
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,199
then the individual protections that

1129
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,599
would stand in the way of doing that

1130
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:17,439
would be of secondary concern

1131
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,280
so that notion of uh controlling so it

1132
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,679
it for example

1133
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,119
um the what what they're doing with uh

1134
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:24,159
video games

1135
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,400
um

1136
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:29,118
they um control

1137
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,079
uh what type of video games and how

1138
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,039
many hours a day kids can be on video

1139
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,079
games

1140
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,559
um

1141
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,800
operating in that way because they

1142
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,639
believe that that's good for the society

1143
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,039
and that's very controlling

1144
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,960
in the united states i i think probably

1145
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,440
most parents would say leave it to me

1146
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,559
and it's it's a matter between me and my

1147
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,960
kids the same thing has to do with data

1148
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,039
in other words in the united states who

1149
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,679
controls the data

1150
00:45:55,039 --> 00:46:00,800
does the company control the data do you

1151
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:03,440
individually control the data and so the

1152
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,519
inclination would be to figure that out

1153
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,838
but nobody would say that the government

1154
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,719
is going to control the data because of

1155
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,759
our inclination of really

1156
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:14,078
anti-government control

1157
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,839
in china it would be that the government

1158
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,079
will control the data

1159
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:20,559
because that's going to be best for the

1160
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,519
society and it depends who you trust but

1161
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,199
that's

1162
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:28,000
so that difference in philosophy is very

1163
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:31,039
much at the um you know at the heart of

1164
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,679
that as far as um your question in terms

1165
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,519
of

1166
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,358
effectiveness it really is in china's

1167
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,920
case it's how you balance the things

1168
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:42,480
right so what they're attempting to do

1169
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,720
is to create a lot of freedom and

1170
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:49,199
creativity um in areas that are not

1171
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,159
uh political let's say

1172
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,159
and

1173
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,679
and so you see on a lot of

1174
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,000
entrepreneurship

1175
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,639
you see a lot of product development you

1176
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,280
see a lot of creativity

1177
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:04,078
um happening in that way so the

1178
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,640
stereotype that you don't see creativity

1179
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,560
happening is is an old stereotype

1180
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,799
where's a lot of creativity certainly

1181
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,199
happening and the system can work well

1182
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,440
if they can achieve that kind of balance

1183
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:19,118
it's proven to have worked well since i

1184
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:21,200
started going there in 1984 per capita

1185
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,920
income real per capita income has

1186
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:27,199
increased by 26 times the um longevity

1187
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,920
rate has

1188
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:31,919
increased by 10 years the poverty rate

1189
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,639
has fallen from 88

1190
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,838
to less than 1 in terms of you know

1191
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:39,838
basics like starvation and things and if

1192
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:42,318
you read history

1193
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:43,599
plato's republic you know he talks about

1194
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,119
the cycles

1195
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,480
democracy

1196
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,599
you know an autocratic and the

1197
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,000
benevolent

1198
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,359
despot and all of that

1199
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,199
each has

1200
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,920
their own vulnerability

1201
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:59,439
the vulnerability of democracy which has

1202
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,240
been a remarkable remarkable system and

1203
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:06,000
i don't have to extol the benefits of it

1204
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:09,679
um but the vulnerability of it

1205
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,119
has always been uh the um internal

1206
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:16,078
conflict that produces itself as anarchy

1207
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,559
um in world war ii

1208
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,680
uh four democracies

1209
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,240
chose to be

1210
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:25,759
autocracies

1211
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:28,078
um because there was internal disorder

1212
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,400
and there was this is the belief will

1213
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,720
somebody bring about order and get

1214
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,639
control of the situation you know that

1215
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:40,480
was in um germany italy uh japan and

1216
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:42,879
spain um they were parliamentary dictat

1217
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:47,318
systems that uh turned themselves over

1218
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,358
to that so both systems um have

1219
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:51,759
vulnerabilities um

1220
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:53,199
i think the main thing now that we need

1221
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,400
to think about

1222
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:59,838
is those vulnerabilities democracy is an

1223
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,639
amazing system because it requ

1224
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:05,279
the the adherence to the rules and the

1225
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:07,440
system and the checks and balances is

1226
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,640
quite amazing and it gives it a

1227
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,318
flexibility to change without civil wars

1228
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,078
um um

1229
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,920
but there has to be the respect of the

1230
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,839
rules and when you see something like

1231
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,200
that they will not

1232
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:24,719
accept

1233
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:27,838
elections or they will not accept rules

1234
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:30,000
and history has shown when the causes

1235
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:32,400
that people are behind are more

1236
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,199
important to them than the system the

1237
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,160
system is in jeopardy so we have a

1238
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:39,358
situation that's very much like that

1239
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,838
in terms of

1240
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:45,759
let's say the 2024 elections

1241
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:49,199
i believe that there's a very high

1242
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,559
chance that neither side will accept

1243
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:54,239
losing

1244
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:56,880
for example and so we um

1245
00:49:54,239 --> 00:50:00,000
we have that kind of a situation so

1246
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,680
one would hope that one could rise above

1247
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,519
the disagreements

1248
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:08,399
and rely on the system uh for resolving

1249
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:13,199
disagreements because if if that doesn't

1250
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:15,440
happen then we have our own uh chaos

1251
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:18,399
so the kind of the trend that started in

1252
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,679
2020 this or i mean i mean i suppose

1253
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,440
it's been there

1254
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:23,118
it's been growing

1255
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,599
a rep one representation of this

1256
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,760
internal disorder has been the growing

1257
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,519
trend of being skeptical about the

1258
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,599
results of the election

1259
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,559
well it started before that

1260
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:38,318
there was the emergence of populism

1261
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:39,839
where before uh president uh trump was

1262
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:42,079
elected

1263
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:44,400
he was basically elected

1264
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,720
as a populist because there was a large

1265
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,599
percentage of the population

1266
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,558
that felt that the system didn't work

1267
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,119
for them

1268
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:56,000
and he tapped into that and he was

1269
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,559
largely elected as a populist leader

1270
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,760
first populous leader in a developed

1271
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:04,079
country

1272
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:06,400
um and so populism began that then

1273
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,519
and that was a battle of one group

1274
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,240
against the other group and so since

1275
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:15,199
then it's been like that and it

1276
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,199
continued to grow

1277
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:23,199
you've mentioned

1278
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,358
the vulnerability of democracy that

1279
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:28,078
internal disorder is the vulnerability

1280
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:31,119
of democracy what's the vulnerability of

1281
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,280
a system like china maybe one way to say

1282
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,200
is put china aside and look at history

1283
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,160
like a soviet union what's the

1284
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:39,759
vulnerability of a communist

1285
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:42,799
type system

1286
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,079
well i'll call it both communist

1287
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,400
and

1288
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,960
autocratic sure

1289
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,400
depending on how much autocracy

1290
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:56,480
is that it lacks flexibility

1291
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,079
it it lacks um the ability

1292
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,240
so but i should deal with them

1293
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,000
differently um in other words there's

1294
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:04,799
the economic system

1295
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,079
the economic system um threatens

1296
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,880
motivation

1297
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,240
and productivity so communism or

1298
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,519
socialism

1299
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:16,959
uh has to be done in a way where

1300
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:19,280
um you can threaten productivity

1301
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,440
capitalism has

1302
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,559
and what i mean by that i mean free

1303
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,240
markets and capital markets

1304
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,400
i have been an effective way of

1305
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,959
allocating resources

1306
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,400
and also creating the

1307
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,079
the incentives

1308
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,318
and the resources providing the

1309
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:40,480
resources for the inventiveness of new

1310
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:42,960
ideas and so if i compare that

1311
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,679
what the chinese have done to a large

1312
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,039
extent is to recognize that and have

1313
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:50,078
made a move

1314
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:52,558
that's why the uh seeming

1315
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:55,440
dialectic or the conflict between those

1316
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:58,800
two things exists but anyway that's it

1317
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:02,480
as far as an autocratic system

1318
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,160
rather than um one man one vote from the

1319
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,280
population up

1320
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:10,480
the risks of the autocratic system

1321
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,240
is that there's enough discontent that

1322
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,880
arises

1323
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,399
that the system doesn't have the

1324
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,599
flexibility

1325
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,639
and that rather than bending um it

1326
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,318
breaks

1327
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:27,759
um that's that's the big risk um the

1328
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:30,079
notion of trying to control a

1329
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,680
um if there's that rather than giving it

1330
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,318
the flexibility

1331
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,480
um so that's the that would be the big

1332
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:37,358
risk of the autocratic system what's the

1333
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,559
human

1334
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:39,920
uh

1335
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,400
because you mentioned like the top gets

1336
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,599
bigger with empires

1337
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,160
and you start taking things for granted

1338
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,720
is the some of this just human nature

1339
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:53,199
so the concern with with china

1340
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,598
with autocratic nations

1341
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,598
the concern with the

1342
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,838
the third reich

1343
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,680
the soviet union

1344
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,440
was that

1345
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:06,318
fundamentally at the individual level

1346
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,800
the humans involved at the top

1347
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:11,039
they start becoming they're starting to

1348
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,240
lose touch with reality

1349
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,079
in a way that

1350
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:15,759
no longer makes them i guess that's the

1351
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,318
representation of the flexibility that

1352
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,319
you're referring to well i'm i mean in a

1353
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:22,159
democracy

1354
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,318
you could change you can go as far left

1355
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:26,879
or as far right you can change the

1356
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:27,920
leaders easily and so the people don't

1357
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,920
become

1358
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,838
um you know they pretty much only have

1359
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,240
themselves to blame uh yeah you know and

1360
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:39,279
one of the problems of that is they may

1361
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,639
not choose the best leaders

1362
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,280
but they

1363
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,239
they have that flexibility so if vote

1364
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,079
and

1365
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:48,078
you get what you wanted

1366
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,318
in the case of the autocratic let's say

1367
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:54,000
leaders and then the movement from

1368
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:55,199
democracies to autocracies

1369
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,920
what you

1370
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:00,399
see normally that movement is that one

1371
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,159
of the systems is it is not working

1372
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,000
let's say the democracy is not

1373
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:05,440
effectively everybody's arguing with

1374
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,480
each other and nobody's getting anything

1375
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,639
done and

1376
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,440
you know like mussolini the trains are

1377
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,759
not running on time and that would be

1378
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,559
the example jesus this place has gotten

1379
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,839
chaotic will somebody get into control

1380
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:22,319
and then they then you get the

1381
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:26,400
autocratic um and then he's autocratic

1382
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:28,880
enough to boss people around and um and

1383
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,519
then you follow those kinds of orders

1384
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,440
and it's like a maybe a ceo in a

1385
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:35,199
powerful company ordering around and

1386
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,200
that could work well or it could work

1387
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:39,039
badly you know most

1388
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:42,000
um companies

1389
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:44,000
are run as um

1390
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,920
like autocracies in a sense you know

1391
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,519
there's the hierarchy and you the

1392
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:54,079
command economy and that kind of thing

1393
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:56,318
and now that can work well or not um but

1394
00:55:54,079 --> 00:56:00,400
then what quite often when you get the

1395
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:03,279
populist autocratic their personality is

1396
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:06,880
something that they want to fight

1397
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,480
and they become more nationalistic

1398
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,760
and they tend to become more

1399
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,760
militaristic and human nature at that

1400
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,839
stage

1401
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,839
lends itself to fighting there's an arc

1402
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:20,239
here that when we think

1403
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:22,960
it's we think of a country

1404
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,919
um and we say we when we think of a

1405
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,559
country

1406
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,960
um it's not true it's not like that

1407
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,960
there are individuals who change

1408
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,880
one generation dies and another

1409
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,358
generation comes along

1410
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,680
and one of those arcs is that um

1411
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,519
the ones who have been through war

1412
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,558
don't want to go to war

1413
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:47,838
and are more happily you know willing to

1414
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,720
um abide by whatever the rules are

1415
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:52,639
as you get farther along into that cycle

1416
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:54,480
and you get a new generation and they

1417
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:56,879
forget about wars and the horrors of

1418
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,838
wars then they um

1419
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,680
then they want to uh uh fight and so

1420
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:05,199
you're seeing right now

1421
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:08,480
the emergent of fight for right and and

1422
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:09,759
what that means is you see it internally

1423
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:13,039
uh fight

1424
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,720
where are you and fight for that thing

1425
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:17,920
and they mean fight

1426
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:20,399
and then into externally fight are you

1427
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:23,200
going to be uh the strong one who will

1428
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,639
fight and win and that develops on both

1429
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:30,159
sides this fight and win and each side

1430
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:33,199
is cheering each other on into uh a war

1431
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:35,039
but that's comes by those who really

1432
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:38,639
have not experienced war because it

1433
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:40,480
comes in their part of their lifetime

1434
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,400
humans are fascinating

1435
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,599
humans are fascinating and by the way

1436
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,880
human nature has not changed

1437
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,440
over the

1438
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,119
thousands of years so it's the it's so

1439
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,920
interesting because like in doing this

1440
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,760
study and it comes across in the study

1441
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,599
it's like watching the same movie over

1442
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,559
and over again

1443
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,960
you you know you see the ark and you see

1444
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,798
it happen over and over again the only

1445
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:09,000
things that seem to change are the

1446
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:09,000
clothes people wear and the technologies

1447
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,318
uh

1448
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,599
yeah and then somebody probably will

1449
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:15,199
disagree with you about the clothes

1450
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,440
maybe there's also cycles within

1451
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,480
fashions maybe we're not even creative

1452
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,720
there

1453
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:24,240
uh what do you um

1454
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:25,759
make of uh russia and vladimir putin

1455
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:27,679
what do you think about putin as a

1456
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,319
leader as a human being on this world

1457
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,639
stage within the context

1458
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:33,759
of the cycles of empires that you think

1459
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:34,558
about

1460
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,480
well

1461
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,200
putin came to power

1462
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,838
at the failure of

1463
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:45,118
russia's last order so there was there

1464
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:46,880
was the end of communism

1465
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,880
and there was the development of the

1466
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,760
market economy the collapse of the

1467
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,000
soviet union

1468
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,440
and at that time

1469
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,719
he

1470
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:01,920
was appointed by yeltsin

1471
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:03,118
who was an alcoholic and had problems

1472
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,000
managing

1473
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,559
and was put into power and the

1474
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,159
conditions in the russian were the work

1475
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,880
there was anarchy

1476
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:15,759
um there was no money it was it had the

1477
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,160
classic end of cycle ingredients it was

1478
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,480
broke it was people were fighting with

1479
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,440
each other was the anarchy and that's

1480
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,039
when he

1481
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,079
came to power

1482
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,599
and um there were not

1483
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,359
institutions

1484
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,838
the whole thing had collapsed and it was

1485
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:34,078
not effective ministry of education

1486
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:36,960
ministry of anything

1487
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:39,920
and so the idea

1488
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:43,599
was that they needed 25 years of

1489
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,119
stability and they needed a democracy

1490
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:47,838
and they needed

1491
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:50,960
the the improvement of capital markets

1492
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:54,639
um so he's been in that position

1493
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,480
as a um as

1494
00:59:54,639 --> 01:00:01,519
i guess i would call him

1495
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:04,318
um a semi-autocratic leader in that

1496
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:06,079
from all indications he would respect

1497
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:09,039
the democracy

1498
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:11,599
um and he's very popular he's won

1499
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:14,719
democratic elections because he's been a

1500
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:18,720
strong leader and he's brought uh peace

1501
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:21,118
and stability to the soviet u to to

1502
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,239
russia after the breakup of the soviet

1503
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,000
union

1504
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:26,000
and um

1505
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,400
he's a strong leader

1506
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,599
in pursuit of

1507
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,838
the

1508
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,559
the country's interests

1509
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:37,759
in um a way where

1510
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:41,119
russia is not

1511
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:43,680
a significant economic power

1512
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,880
and but it is a significant military

1513
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:48,798
power

1514
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,200
um so um the issues and then there's a

1515
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,239
strong alliance between russia and china

1516
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:56,798
now

1517
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:59,358
um so that's kind of the lay of the land

1518
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:00,960
and then there are sensitivities the

1519
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:05,679
ukraine issue

1520
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:07,519
is uh a sensitivity um because of

1521
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:08,798
there are a lot of russians who live in

1522
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:11,679
the ukraine

1523
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:13,119
and there's also the issue of nato on it

1524
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:15,440
on their border

1525
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,760
um so there are those kinds of things

1526
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,920
and he has military power and he has a

1527
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:24,000
strong alliance with china

1528
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:27,119
um and i guess that's my best summary of

1529
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,400
um what his position is

1530
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,180
strong leader um popular

1531
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,480
um

1532
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:35,199
[Music]

1533
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,679
these are not subjective interpretations

1534
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:39,759
these are uh objective interpretations

1535
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:42,480
yeah it's interesting just in this

1536
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,079
conversation you're not

1537
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,318
sort of um

1538
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,920
doing the usual criticism of any one

1539
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:49,599
particular system you're looking at

1540
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,920
these systems from the perspective of

1541
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,798
history you're just describing how they

1542
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,119
work

1543
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:57,038
it's often times when you talk about

1544
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,599
what russia is today or what the soviet

1545
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:01,839
union was or what china is today is you

1546
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,838
start to criticize well they they do

1547
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:05,920
this kind of censorship or they do this

1548
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:06,960
kind of they limit freedoms in this kind

1549
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,200
of way

1550
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,559
but you're just kind of describing this

1551
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:13,118
as a nation

1552
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,119
with ideas what they think is right

1553
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,960
this is how they hope to get it to work

1554
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,838
this is why it's working this is what's

1555
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,838
not working here's metrics that show

1556
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:23,838
that it's not working i think that's a

1557
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:25,279
refreshing way to think about it it's

1558
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:27,519
easy though i mean you got some

1559
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,280
criticism um

1560
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:30,798
saying that i think china's a strict

1561
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,240
parent

1562
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:33,599
um

1563
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:35,919
you know some people criticize these

1564
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:38,960
countries for doing

1565
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,798
uh so for violating human rights i

1566
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,480
suppose there's some

1567
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,798
people that criticize the united states

1568
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,199
violating human rights but what are your

1569
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:47,199
thoughts

1570
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,798
on the world stage today

1571
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,119
about some of the

1572
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:57,038
behaviors of this government in terms of

1573
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:00,640
respecting the rights the basic rights

1574
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,760
of human beings you described accurately

1575
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:04,719
how i

1576
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,599
just try to look at things in an um a

1577
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:09,598
non

1578
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:12,000
i don't want to impute my values yes on

1579
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,000
anybody um

1580
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
i mean there are intolerable things so

1581
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,559
i'm not saying there aren't intolerable

1582
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,599
things but um one of the great things of

1583
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:24,319
being an american here is that i grew up

1584
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,480
with all different nationalities having

1585
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:28,558
all different points of view and all

1586
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,400
different religions and all different

1587
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:34,000
ways of operating

1588
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,519
and i've come to treasure the fact that

1589
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,358
that is

1590
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,519
you know what's their business is their

1591
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:41,679
business and then the question is where

1592
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,318
do you cross the line under what

1593
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:47,078
circumstances that that others have got

1594
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:48,639
to do it my way and then when you do it

1595
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:51,119
internationally

1596
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:54,159
uh the ob the issue of what is a

1597
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:56,240
sovereign state you know which um as i

1598
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:58,639
say in the piece of west failure and you

1599
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:01,279
have borders and you then when do you

1600
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:03,118
cross the line that um

1601
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,720
my way of doing things has got to be

1602
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,599
their way of doing things or what are

1603
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:10,480
the various rights and so that's a very

1604
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,920
uh delicate question or a very difficult

1605
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,039
question

1606
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,960
and we all have responsibilities to

1607
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,280
different parties and we all have

1608
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:22,559
different levels of knowledge about

1609
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,839
those particular things so um so for

1610
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,920
example

1611
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:29,119
as an international investor i have a

1612
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,119
responsibility to my investors

1613
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:33,680
those who run companies have a

1614
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:36,640
responsibility to theirs of how do they

1615
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:38,480
run that so if you're taking

1616
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,798
nike or

1617
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,440
stinkers and so on and americans can

1618
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:45,358
decide whether they want to buy product

1619
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,679
chinese products or not buy chinese

1620
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:49,358
products we are all faced with those

1621
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:51,199
types of choices

1622
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:52,798
so you have what do you want to do in

1623
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,759
your constituency and you have your

1624
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:58,480
choices and then beyond that in many

1625
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:00,960
cases the issues are quite complex like

1626
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,960
there are geopolitical questions that

1627
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:07,519
enter into it so um uh and then i i

1628
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:10,720
believe that if if you

1629
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:14,159
disconnected if all those

1630
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:16,399
if entities like myself the businesses

1631
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:19,519
uh doing business with china

1632
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:22,400
disconnected i think that that would be

1633
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:25,280
disastrous economically disastrous and

1634
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:28,400
it would also be um reduce

1635
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,480
um the the understanding that comes from

1636
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:33,920
working together that helps to reduce

1637
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,358
wars and so these are all complicated so

1638
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,559
what we do

1639
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,038
is uh

1640
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,798
and and who makes it my opinion matters

1641
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,240
the most why should it be my opinion

1642
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,358
that matters the most in making that

1643
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:47,519
decision so i largely look at the guide

1644
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:49,838
the government guidance that i get not

1645
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:52,079
only from my own government but from the

1646
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:55,599
other governments and i follow the rules

1647
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:57,440
i'm in 40 we invest in 40 countries

1648
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:00,079
and we want to do that in the best way

1649
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,760
to provide the diversified portfolio and

1650
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,480
we sort of need that

1651
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,440
every one of those countries has

1652
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,440
similar complexities there are always

1653
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,599
one issue or another and then and

1654
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,679
there's only so much that we really

1655
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:17,359
understand about all of those issues so

1656
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,759
we rely largely on the guidance that we

1657
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:19,920
you have get

1658
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,839
empathize and show respect to the the

1659
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,358
culture of the place the way things are

1660
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:26,558
done

1661
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:28,318
you don't necessarily um

1662
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,640
the way you heal

1663
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:33,199
relationships between nations is like

1664
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:35,199
like you said you work together and that

1665
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:37,598
requires

1666
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:40,078
kind of um

1667
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:43,280
to listen maybe more than you talk

1668
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,079
and i think people in the public sphere

1669
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,079
uh

1670
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,519
talk a lot about china without really

1671
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,280
listening without understanding much

1672
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:51,119
about china without one of the things

1673
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,599
that makes me really sad because i know

1674
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,680
how to speak russian

1675
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:57,519
and i can i know how much is lost in

1676
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,519
translation

1677
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:02,559
it makes me sad that i'll never really

1678
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:04,079
get to know the chinese culture because

1679
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,480
like i'll never really get to know the

1680
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:08,240
language the literature the

1681
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,000
just talk to regular people it's not

1682
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:11,838
just the government or officials or

1683
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,920
scientists just regular folks get the

1684
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:15,759
culture i think if you don't understand

1685
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,720
the culture

1686
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,640
uh

1687
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:20,078
just the basics of the human nature of

1688
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,239
what people

1689
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,880
love about their country about their

1690
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,399
family or the kind of hopes they have

1691
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,000
you know what kind of values they have

1692
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,798
without that you're not going to be able

1693
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,159
to um

1694
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:34,880
fully

1695
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:36,960
um connect with them and you have to do

1696
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,640
that first to have a chance of building

1697
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,519
a good world i couldn't agree with you

1698
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,798
more i was very lucky because as i say

1699
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:46,159
uh

1700
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:47,679
you know since 1984 so for more than

1701
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:49,358
half of my life

1702
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:50,879
i've been going there and i and the

1703
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:52,960
common people

1704
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:56,160
and all sorts of people and i've got to

1705
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:58,880
meet them i don't speak the language

1706
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:01,679
but it a combination of through

1707
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:04,559
translators or men them speaking english

1708
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:07,519
and being in situations i had my son go

1709
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:09,839
to school a local school

1710
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:12,079
and we we developed those kinds of

1711
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:13,199
understandings i think that

1712
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,160
um

1713
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:16,399
but

1714
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:19,920
the not wanting

1715
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:22,158
to know the other perspective

1716
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:25,600
is the thing that's most scary yeah like

1717
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:28,559
i'm right now in the middle and um

1718
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:31,679
and all i want to try to do is

1719
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,679
to help mutual understanding

1720
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,920
you're right if there were questions

1721
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,158
probing me asking me

1722
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,560
what is it i'm not on one side or

1723
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:43,278
another i get i don't want to be on one

1724
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,199
side or another i believe that each has

1725
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,960
their right within there to approach

1726
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:49,519
their different culture in their own way

1727
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:52,960
so many ways you gave an example it uh

1728
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:55,359
um if they're not um doing harm to

1729
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,798
others i mean so but

1730
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:58,480
that issue

1731
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:01,278
of um

1732
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:02,079
trying to understand

1733
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,640
is

1734
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,640
so much better that doesn't mean agree

1735
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,319
with

1736
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,920
if you are

1737
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:13,039
wanting to

1738
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:15,600
out-clever and out-compete somebody it

1739
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:16,960
still pays to understand what they're

1740
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,600
thinking

1741
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,198
so to achieve understanding of what

1742
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,440
they're thinking even if you want to go

1743
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,198
to war with them that understanding is

1744
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:28,000
the best thing to have

1745
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:31,678
what we have now is a situation

1746
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,439
in which there's an enemy mentality and

1747
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:37,920
that means that anything that serves the

1748
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:40,238
seems to be like understanding or

1749
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,759
conveying understanding seems to

1750
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:46,639
mistakenly create the notion of i'm on

1751
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:48,560
their side in a war and that's kind of a

1752
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,679
dangerous thing because

1753
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,480
um there's a momentum here to fight

1754
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:56,079
henry kissinger praises your new book

1755
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:57,439
and you thank him in it in the

1756
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:59,519
dedication

1757
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:01,359
what's your relationship like with him

1758
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,199
what makes him interesting

1759
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:04,719
maybe what makes him controversial what

1760
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:06,479
makes him such a central figure in

1761
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:09,359
history the first

1762
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:11,678
most importantly he's unique about

1763
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:14,559
seeing things through all

1764
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:17,520
the others eyes

1765
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:21,440
so if you were it's like there's a chess

1766
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:23,920
game i mean i think geopolit geopolitics

1767
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:26,559
is like a chess game but with multiple

1768
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,560
chess players playing the same game yes

1769
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,679
so imagine there are

1770
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:34,560
six people around playing the chess game

1771
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,840
and he could sit in each seat

1772
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:41,039
and he could know how they see it

1773
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:44,000
okay and see it in a calm way of how

1774
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:47,119
they see it he's unique in that way he's

1775
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,920
98 years old and he's equally able to do

1776
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:50,319
that

1777
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:53,119
and he has a background

1778
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:55,679
that in which he's a historian so he

1779
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:57,760
really understands history

1780
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,719
super

1781
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,440
um

1782
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:03,840
he doesn't understand economic history

1783
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:06,639
as much so that's why to some extent we

1784
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,640
enjoy having a conversation because he's

1785
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,480
interested in the act and in the

1786
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,360
economic piece he doesn't know and i'm

1787
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:15,599
so interested in the geopolitical piece

1788
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:17,920
that i don't know as well but anyway

1789
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:21,440
he's able to do that but not only a

1790
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:25,119
historian but a practitioner

1791
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:27,678
so when you go from an academic

1792
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:29,679
to a practitioner

1793
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,079
who has that talent

1794
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:35,359
to see things through others eyes in an

1795
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:37,359
objective way and to be strategic rather

1796
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:39,119
than just tactical

1797
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:41,839
that's a very special person and that's

1798
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,880
why henry is uh to me a very special

1799
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,199
person

1800
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:48,319
yeah he's lived a fascinating life

1801
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:49,678
just all all of the world events he's

1802
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,920
been involved in

1803
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:54,480
is fascinating and like you said that's

1804
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,480
such an interesting skill to have to

1805
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:58,399
consider what are the concerns the hope

1806
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:59,839
the dreams the fears of the all the

1807
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:01,039
people at the table what are they

1808
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,440
thinking

1809
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:05,679
i find that people don't

1810
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:07,198
once again don't do that enough when

1811
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:10,239
it's the obvious thing you should be

1812
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:13,759
doing whether it's business deals or

1813
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:15,198
um political negotiation or geopolitical

1814
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,199
negotiation

1815
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:20,399
i'm often surprised again sorry to go to

1816
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:22,559
the russian thing because i i i hear

1817
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:23,679
sort of like i hear putin talk in

1818
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,280
russian

1819
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,359
and you start to infer certain

1820
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:30,158
intentions and like not the trivial

1821
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:32,319
stuff like the human being what is

1822
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:34,399
what is that human being hoping for

1823
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:37,119
himself for his country

1824
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:40,079
for his close in a circle for the bigger

1825
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:42,399
like and i i just see that that's often

1826
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:45,279
just lost in translation i just see like

1827
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:47,119
american leaders talking to putin

1828
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,679
and it's just not

1829
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:52,399
it's there's not a connection absolutely

1830
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,119
i know exactly what you're talking about

1831
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:56,238
you

1832
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:59,439
i it has never failed that in my

1833
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:01,039
listening to a conversation and or even

1834
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:02,000
reading a speech

1835
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:05,119
or

1836
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,319
and you see then it reported

1837
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:10,000
the inevitably the reporter

1838
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:12,319
picked some

1839
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,800
headline characterization

1840
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:17,840
that has very little to do with what was

1841
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,960
really happening but might be a headline

1842
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,039
grabber

1843
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,960
that's at some kind of distortion and

1844
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:25,039
there's a lack of understanding of

1845
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,719
really what's going on

1846
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:29,519
if it's okay let me ask you a couple

1847
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:31,119
questions about cryptocurrency

1848
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,040
uh you've had a few opinions about

1849
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:36,319
bitcoin over the years what are your

1850
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:39,039
thoughts about bitcoin today its role

1851
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:41,279
in the global financial system and just

1852
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:43,679
in human society in general

1853
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:46,719
well the evolution of bitcoin over the

1854
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,399
years is one of the things that

1855
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:51,600
has

1856
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:52,399
influenced changes in my view

1857
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,440
it

1858
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:58,319
has proven itself

1859
01:13:55,439 --> 01:14:00,399
something like 10 11 years ago imagine

1860
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:02,880
the programming of this and here's the

1861
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,719
you throw it out and that's the idea it

1862
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,719
has not been hacked

1863
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:10,560
it has um

1864
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:12,079
um operated it is built it has come an

1865
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:16,159
amazing way

1866
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:17,198
um over that 11 years to be um

1867
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:19,839
maybe

1868
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:22,879
probably the most excited topic

1869
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:27,360
among a lot of people um and has been

1870
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:30,960
used and and is now um has obtained you

1871
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:34,079
know the status of having imputed value

1872
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,119
at the same time it is one of those

1873
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:37,760
assets

1874
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:40,000
that is an alternative money i think

1875
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,400
we're entering an era

1876
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,719
where um there's going to be a

1877
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:45,679
competition of monies

1878
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:49,119
um

1879
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:51,199
because of the printing of fiat money

1880
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:52,800
um and the

1881
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:56,238
depreciated value

1882
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:59,440
there will be a competition of monies um

1883
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:01,599
and bitcoin is part of that competition

1884
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:04,000
but there'll be many monies not just

1885
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,840
crypto monies but there'll be central

1886
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,479
bank crypto monies

1887
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,520
um but they'll be uh different kinds of

1888
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:13,039
monies

1889
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:17,440
um and even monies um are things that

1890
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:19,600
you buy and sell nfts can become a money

1891
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:21,039
uh a type of money you own it and it's

1892
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,640
an investment and you could say i'd

1893
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:27,679
rather own it than own uh bitcoin

1894
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,560
has ray dalia bought any nfts not yet

1895
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,840
okay

1896
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,120
um

1897
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:35,360
but um only only just because like i i

1898
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,198
definitely want to buy nfts to just

1899
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:39,679
experience them you know like i think

1900
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:41,519
think i should produce one yeah and i

1901
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:43,840
should uh i should have asked that have

1902
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,360
you made it have you minted an empty you

1903
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,199
probably should just to know what it's

1904
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:50,158
like yeah that's right this stuff is

1905
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:53,599
happening yeah this stuff is real okay

1906
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:55,439
and how it operates but like all new

1907
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,840
real things

1908
01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:00,079
um some are gonna go and so i'm gonna

1909
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,920
you know it's like in the internet in

1910
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:04,800
the year 2000

1911
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:07,440
um you know pets.com could have been a

1912
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,440
great but maybe pets.com doesn't make it

1913
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:11,919
and who knows that's the beauty of the

1914
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:13,519
competitive system that will evolve and

1915
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,760
some things will be treasured and some

1916
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:19,520
things will be uh trashed

1917
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:22,079
so um um but when i look at it um i

1918
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,840
think we are in an environment of you

1919
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:26,158
know what is an alternative money a

1920
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:29,440
money has two purposes a medium of

1921
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:32,000
exchange and a storehold of wealth

1922
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:33,599
and we are looking for

1923
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,079
and it's portable

1924
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:38,400
and you can and it's best if it's

1925
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:43,039
recognized in other countries

1926
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:46,399
um so gold is one of those so i look at

1927
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:48,319
it as an alternative gold

1928
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:49,920
but i look at a number of things as

1929
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:53,039
alternative gold

1930
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,719
um and i think that and i think and gold

1931
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:57,600
is still my favorite

1932
01:16:54,719 --> 01:17:00,800
because of certain qualities for example

1933
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:03,039
um you can't trace it in in bitcoin you

1934
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,039
can trace who owns it where it's going

1935
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:07,519
and and so on governments can't have

1936
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:09,679
that ability to trace it and so on a

1937
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,239
gold piece of coin it's it's not

1938
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:15,119
connected i think not connected has

1939
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:18,000
benefits particularly in a world where

1940
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:19,599
maybe connections can be more risky

1941
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,719
um so

1942
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:25,840
and then also gold has been

1943
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:28,560
for many thousands of years universally

1944
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:31,440
recognized as a source of money and

1945
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:34,159
central banks it's the third largest

1946
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,359
uh source of money in central bank

1947
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:37,839
reserves

1948
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:40,319
and i don't think bitcoin is going to

1949
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,199
serve those types of purposes and so on

1950
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:45,599
so for various reasons i prefer gold to

1951
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:46,799
the other but it's a little bit part of

1952
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,880
my mix

1953
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:52,640
but then you look at it it hit i think

1954
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:54,319
69 000 this year as the high bitcoin hit

1955
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,440
do you think it's possible you mentioned

1956
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:57,840
gold

1957
01:17:55,439 --> 01:18:00,799
do you think it's possible it reaches

1958
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,239
very high numbers like 1 million some

1959
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,239
people talk about

1960
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:08,158
i don't i don't think that's possible

1961
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:11,359
because the way i look at it is

1962
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:11,920
there's a certain amount of

1963
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:13,599
um

1964
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,679
[Music]

1965
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,840
a certain amount of it

1966
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:21,199
and there's a certain amount of gold

1967
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:24,239
i'll use gold as a benchmark

1968
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:26,639
the amount of it is worth about five uh

1969
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:29,678
about one trillion dollars

1970
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:32,400
total cryptos about 2.2 trillion but

1971
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,679
let's say bitcoin uh it's one trillion

1972
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:36,719
dollars

1973
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:38,399
if you take the amount of money that is

1974
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:39,359
in um

1975
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,238
gold

1976
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:45,198
that is not used for jewelry purposes

1977
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:47,599
and not used by central banks and i

1978
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:50,559
assume bitcoin won't be used for jewelry

1979
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:53,520
purposes or central bank purposes

1980
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:55,039
um that amount in gold is about five

1981
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,600
trillion dollars

1982
01:18:55,039 --> 01:19:00,719
so right now if you were to

1983
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:04,400
have a portfolio that has um gold and

1984
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:07,439
crypto um gold then bitcoin it's worth

1985
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:10,399
about 20 of the value of gold

1986
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:12,479
do i think it's going to be uh worth

1987
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:14,079
more than gold

1988
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:16,079
in terms of that mix

1989
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:19,840
i don't think it'll be worth more than

1990
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:22,000
gold but let's say it became worth

1991
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,159
as as much as gold i don't believe it

1992
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,840
will be i think that 20

1993
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:28,399
sounds kind of about right i really

1994
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,800
don't know that what the right answer is

1995
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:33,759
um and then there's the question of what

1996
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:36,079
is all of that pool of money

1997
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,640
that let's say gold and gold equivalents

1998
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:39,760
relative to everything else does it go

1999
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,840
from

2000
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,239
you know let's call it

2001
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:46,159
six seven eight trillion to sixteen

2002
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:47,599
trillion maybe it could double it

2003
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:50,319
depends what it is in the world

2004
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:52,000
environment but basically if you use

2005
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:56,079
gold as a measure

2006
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,560
i um there's no it just makes no sense

2007
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:00,238
that it's going to be used um

2008
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,480
that much more

2009
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:06,079
am i sure about that i'm not sure about

2010
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:09,279
anything but logically it seems to me

2011
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:11,519
that there's a limitation on its price

2012
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:13,198
in relationship to other things that are

2013
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,120
like it

2014
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:17,359
let me ask for your deep financial

2015
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,359
analysis on a very important issue

2016
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:21,679
uh i've just talked a couple days ago

2017
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:23,519
the elon musk he wants to put a literal

2018
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,039
dogecoin on the moon

2019
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,480
uh what are your thoughts about deutsche

2020
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:28,880
coin

2021
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:30,959
uh and uh do you think he'll be the

2022
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,679
official currency

2023
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:37,600
maybe uh reserve currency on the moon

2024
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:40,319
and on mars my reaction is that's cute i

2025
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,639
remember elon when he first got he he

2026
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:43,920
first got his money from paypal i think

2027
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:45,359
he said to me

2028
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,600
it was

2029
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,920
he got 180 million dollars 90 million

2030
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,800
dollars he decided to say why aren't we

2031
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,520
going

2032
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:56,880
to outer space and he

2033
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,239
wanted to take a spaceship that would be

2034
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:04,960
modified

2035
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:06,158
using russian technology to put a um

2036
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,239
a plant

2037
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,079
and a watering can

2038
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:11,359
on the moon

2039
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:13,519
um

2040
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:17,198
or on mars i think it was

2041
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:20,239
um and and and he said first life on

2042
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:22,399
mars or first line

2043
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:23,678
as an inspiring

2044
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:26,559
uh notion

2045
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:29,440
and so then there's always what's behind

2046
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:32,960
it i have a lot of respect for

2047
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:37,198
elon's ability to do other things behind

2048
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:39,439
it uh and so i would take that as um

2049
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:41,759
symbolic and i'd be asking him what's

2050
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:43,919
behind it what's what's next and i'm

2051
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:46,159
also just on the topic of deutsche coin

2052
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:48,480
and meme coin and uh there's some aspect

2053
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:51,198
of humor and lightheartedness

2054
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:53,119
that's that's really interesting about

2055
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,079
the way we communicate what ideas become

2056
01:21:53,119 --> 01:21:56,479
viral

2057
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:57,760
how to captivate people

2058
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:59,119
with ideas

2059
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,119
there's something about taking things

2060
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:03,519
too seriously that somehow slows it all

2061
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:05,519
down and it's interesting you're right

2062
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:09,440
that's part of human nature somehow so

2063
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,440
like humor is part of this whole thing

2064
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,319
you've uh talked about the importance of

2065
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,439
writing ideas down

2066
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:18,158
and uh you have

2067
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:19,519
principles in particular in principles

2068
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:22,479
and you have this really nice thing in

2069
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:24,800
your in your book we actually um

2070
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:25,759
i think there's such a brilliant way

2071
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,079
okay

2072
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:30,639
uh you have such a brilliant way of

2073
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:33,279
highlighting which parts are

2074
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,119
extra important and you make them bold

2075
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:36,880
that's a brilliant idea but let me just

2076
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:40,238
ask the high-level question of what's a

2077
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:42,000
good system for um

2078
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:42,879
taking notes

2079
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,439
well

2080
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,440
i find that almost everything happens

2081
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:48,479
over and over again

2082
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:50,960
um

2083
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:53,759
and we're in this the blizzard of these

2084
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,880
things happening and what i found is

2085
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,239
that

2086
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,840
if i'm making a decision

2087
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:02,000
that

2088
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,880
that after i make the decision usually

2089
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:08,800
or right at the time if i pause and

2090
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:11,119
reflect and i write my principle down in

2091
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,239
other words principle is sort of a

2092
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:15,119
recipe

2093
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:17,678
what would i use to how would i make

2094
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:20,079
that decision and what are the criteria

2095
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,880
around it i find that i make it much

2096
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:24,079
more

2097
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:26,639
clear it becomes clearer and it applies

2098
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:27,359
to the next thing that comes along it'll

2099
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,679
be

2100
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:31,439
that way because everything happens over

2101
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:34,239
and over and over again and i think

2102
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:36,479
people make the mistake of looking at

2103
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:38,399
just the one like it's the first one

2104
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:40,799
they have i don't know they have the

2105
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:42,960
first problem of this sort of the first

2106
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,199
child or whatever it is and this has

2107
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,679
been happening plenty of times and so if

2108
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:50,079
you have the principles i found that

2109
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:53,039
that helped me think more clearly about

2110
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:54,319
it and it helped me communicate better

2111
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:57,279
like why

2112
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:58,799
and so over the years over the last 30

2113
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:00,559
years or so

2114
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,800
that's what i've done i did it

2115
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:05,039
originally to communicate very well with

2116
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:07,360
the people i work with um you know i set

2117
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:09,279
up my company and and i it was very

2118
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:11,920
important to have good communication and

2119
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:13,920
then we could debate the principles and

2120
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:17,359
so that's the process

2121
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:20,000
i urge people to do that there are many

2122
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:22,399
excellent decision makers um

2123
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:25,198
and i just wish that they wrote down

2124
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:26,079
their principles when this set

2125
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:27,678
so

2126
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:29,920
for example

2127
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,440
we talked about henry kissinger and his

2128
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,119
new book is going to come out with a

2129
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:36,879
book on leadership

2130
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:39,599
um and don't just describe the leaders

2131
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:42,480
describe then what about them were the

2132
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:45,039
essential elements to make a good leader

2133
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:48,479
under what circumstances and so if we

2134
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:51,679
think about that when then also then you

2135
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:53,759
begin to think in a principled way

2136
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:56,719
and then when you start to think in a

2137
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:58,639
principle way life becomes

2138
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:01,520
it's so much easier to make decisions

2139
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:04,560
and it's so much less confusing because

2140
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:08,320
it's like coming up on a species and you

2141
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:11,039
say okay well what species is it not

2142
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:13,359
just another it's a thing no what

2143
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:16,479
species is it and how do i deal with

2144
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:18,880
that species effectively and and so

2145
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:21,439
that's what that is and so i encourage

2146
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,520
people to write it down i wish anybody

2147
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:25,519
who's successful wrote down their

2148
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,960
principles or their recipes for making

2149
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:31,280
those types of decisions so the events

2150
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,239
of interest here happens over and over

2151
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:34,158
and over

2152
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:35,678
in similar ways as you're looking for

2153
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:37,519
the patterns and you're defining the

2154
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:39,279
process

2155
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,199
that's right to respond

2156
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:42,880
to those patterns and you call that the

2157
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:44,238
principles

2158
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,840
and

2159
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:48,399
that allows you to deal with the future

2160
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,800
effectively so like that codifies the

2161
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:52,719
lessons from the past to be able to deal

2162
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,639
with the future

2163
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:57,679
what advice do you have for young folks

2164
01:25:54,639 --> 01:26:00,400
today in high school in college thinking

2165
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:02,880
about how to live uh

2166
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:05,279
have a career they can be proud of or

2167
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,119
maybe have a life they can be proud of

2168
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:09,279
know yourself

2169
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:11,359
follow your passion

2170
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:12,559
make your work and passion the same

2171
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:15,359
thing

2172
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,039
while considering the money part because

2173
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:19,119
money will get you

2174
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:20,880
freedom and choice and be able to make

2175
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:22,719
that but

2176
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,639
if you know yourself

2177
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:26,399
feel the pull

2178
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:29,039
um and

2179
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:32,158
um and pursue that passion

2180
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:34,639
um and along those lines by the way i

2181
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:36,879
found um that

2182
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:39,600
using personality profile tests has been

2183
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:41,840
very helpful i've used those for about

2184
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:43,360
25 years for people to help to

2185
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,560
understand themselves and understand

2186
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:47,519
each other so i created a free one

2187
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:51,120
that

2188
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,639
is called principles you it's online

2189
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:55,359
it's

2190
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:57,520
had remarkable

2191
01:26:55,359 --> 01:27:00,238
loving people who've taken it learn

2192
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:02,000
about themselves but also you can put in

2193
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:04,879
somebody else and it'll tell you about

2194
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,039
your relationship with them that's like

2195
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:10,159
30 minutes is a quick discovery but the

2196
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:12,399
main thing is to understand on your

2197
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:15,759
journey your hero's journey

2198
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,960
when you're um that you will have uh

2199
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,199
mistakes

2200
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:22,000
and you will have weaknesses

2201
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:24,960
and to

2202
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,679
understand those not fight those

2203
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,679
because by understanding

2204
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:32,319
mistakes you will learn not to make

2205
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:37,199
mistakes again i have a principle which

2206
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:40,319
is pain plus reflection equals progress

2207
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:42,559
and so that reflection is important to

2208
01:27:40,319 --> 01:27:45,599
know yourself know your pulls

2209
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:47,520
know your weaknesses and when you also

2210
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,800
know your weaknesses and the strengths

2211
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:52,719
of other people there are people who um

2212
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,800
have strengths where you're weak and you

2213
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:57,439
have strengths where they're weak and to

2214
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,840
be able to work well together is the

2215
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:02,319
most effective way of

2216
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:04,880
achieving uh success

2217
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:07,279
so yeah it's that journey

2218
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:09,600
and there's a life arc and there's a

2219
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:13,119
journey and you want to make it the best

2220
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:15,920
that you can make it and it has

2221
01:28:13,119 --> 01:28:18,399
it's like a video game you know it has

2222
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:21,119
the challenges and the

2223
01:28:18,399 --> 01:28:24,238
obstacles and the learning experiences

2224
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:26,639
and the temptations and all of that and

2225
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:29,599
the maximizing learning to go where you

2226
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:31,840
want to go to achieve the life you want

2227
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:35,120
is the most important that's kind of

2228
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:38,239
maybe a long-winded way of suing it but

2229
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:41,599
to learn i think i'll try to say it

2230
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:42,638
simply there's a five-step process step

2231
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,920
one

2232
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:45,920
is

2233
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,239
know your goals

2234
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,079
know what you're going after

2235
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:52,238
you could have almost anything you want

2236
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:54,000
but you can't have everything you want

2237
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:56,638
and so you have to prioritize and you

2238
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,319
move in that direction on the way to

2239
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:00,960
your goals you're going to encounter

2240
01:28:58,319 --> 01:29:04,238
your problems and your obstacles

2241
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:05,039
so identifying step two is understanding

2242
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,799
your

2243
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,679
problems and your obstacles identify

2244
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,119
them

2245
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:11,520
step three

2246
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:13,760
is to diagnose them to get at the root

2247
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,440
cause of the problem

2248
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,280
and that could be

2249
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:19,519
many root causes but it could also be

2250
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:22,079
your weaknesses or weaknesses of others

2251
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,960
but you have to be objective about them

2252
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:28,079
once you diagnose them then you go to

2253
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:30,239
step four which is to design a way to

2254
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:31,198
get around them

2255
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:33,839
and

2256
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:36,238
then after you have that design

2257
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:39,440
you implement that design so you have to

2258
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:42,158
follow through and do it and you do that

2259
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:44,719
and and that will then produce its new

2260
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:46,719
results which should be better results i

2261
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:49,119
have i call this kind of the looping

2262
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:50,158
process it's the evolutionary looping

2263
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:51,679
process

2264
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:53,599
and um

2265
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:56,000
you do you just keep doing that and you

2266
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,320
learn over a period of time and you move

2267
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
in the direction that you want

2268
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:02,479
last question and you only have one

2269
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,399
minute to answer it

2270
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:07,119
you dedicate the book

2271
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,559
quote to my grandchildren and those of

2272
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:10,000
their generation

2273
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,800
who will be participants in the

2274
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,600
continuation of the story

2275
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,760
may the force of evolution be with you

2276
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:20,400
so let me ask where is this force of

2277
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:23,600
evolution taking human civilization

2278
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:24,559
and what in this story that evolution is

2279
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,400
writing

2280
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,480
gives you hope

2281
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:31,279
evolution isn't

2282
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:35,678
a direction toward improvement

2283
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:40,079
um and the greatest force is

2284
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:42,880
a man's capacity to adapt and invent

2285
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:46,559
and so you see in the charts in the book

2286
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:49,039
you see that um this upward movement

2287
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:50,320
life expectancy

2288
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:51,119
um

2289
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:54,158
uh

2290
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:57,039
health or all the things that we think

2291
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:59,198
are better you see the there's a chart

2292
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:01,119
and it shows that over a period of time

2293
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:04,879
and you barely see

2294
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:06,000
the downturns from depressions and wars

2295
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:09,119
in that

2296
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,679
that is the greatest power man's ability

2297
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:14,800
to invent and adapt

2298
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:17,199
is evolution and that's the greatest

2299
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:19,920
power and that is what

2300
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:21,759
gives me justifiable hope

2301
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,158
and a continuation of that like we

2302
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:26,480
mentioned with elon maybe we'll become a

2303
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:28,799
multi-planetary species so not only will

2304
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:30,559
we keep creating amazing things here on

2305
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,760
earth will keep expanding out into the

2306
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:35,039
cosmos

2307
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:38,000
my time horizon isn't doesn't have me

2308
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:41,359
analyzing that yet but i i

2309
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,960
i hope so and i uh agree that that would

2310
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:44,880
mean the nature so i'm not going to ask

2311
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:47,279
you for the best financial system on

2312
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:49,119
mars um i think we'll focus on earth for

2313
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:50,800
now right thank you so much for your

2314
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:52,158
brilliance for the for the books you've

2315
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,639
written for the works you've done for

2316
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:56,079
the inspiration from of millions so and

2317
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:57,679

every time you confront something

2327
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,279
painful you are at a potentially

2328

the opportunity to choose healthy and

2330
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:21,599
painful truth

2331
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,520
or

2332
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:27,280
