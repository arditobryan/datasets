6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,278
eve 2021 conversation with the one and

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,679
only mr michael

8
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:23,679
mallis

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,800
dostoevsky wrote in the idiot my favor

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,479
of his books

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,520
through the main character prince

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,519
mishkin that beauty will save the world

13
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:44,000
these words seemingly naive and

14
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,280
ultimately at least to me profound what

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,238
do they mean to you

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,239
beauty will save the world naive really

17
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,640
i don't think they seem naive at all

18
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,479
well uh sheldon jensen actually for his

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,198
1970 nobel prize

20
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,038
speech talked about this line a lot

21
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,358
and he thought for most of his life that

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,039
was a silly line there was just words

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,478
thrown out there because

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,879
with all the suffering that's in the

25
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,000
world what has beauty has actually ever

26
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:12,079
done oh my god i hate this so much

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,760
i i [ __ ] trash about soldiers yeah i

28
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,759
am okay um

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,040
and this is perfectly sets up this theme

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,200
you know why i said let's do this

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,000
episode start the new year on a positive

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,159
note give people hope give people joy

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,599
uh you and i both have friends who are

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,560
models

35
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,478
right

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,920
and it's a silly profession to some

37
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,798
extent of course

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,359
but

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
you are actually a model you are my

40
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,560
friend yeah that's right that's true i

41
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,519
haven't had a remodel i was trying to be

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,280
subtle

43
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,078
but for those people who actually you

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,040
know deserve to be models

45
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,000
um when you look at someone who is a

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
model

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,438
and in some of their photos

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,720
and these these people look perfect now

49
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,000
in real life they're not perfect they

50
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,840
have flaws they'll be the first to admit

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,438
it so on and so forth but when you look

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,079
at beauty

53
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:03,039
it is almost impossible

54
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,399
to maintain a sense of cynicism and

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,840
hopelessness

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,080
because if there's even one moment when

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,120
some uh element of perfection has been

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,000
actualized if there's one moment where a

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,200
beauty has been realized and captured

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
you can't say well it's never gonna

61
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,479
happen again

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,599
so i think beauty

63
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,199
it means hope i think

64
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:28,878
i hate

65
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,679
that cynical idea of like um

66
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,280
i i get i i appreciate soulja nissan's

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,239
broader point in that a lot of times

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,080
people there's something called the

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,159
deepity where people throw words

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,840
together to sound profound and if you

71
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,519
take it apart like this is just complete

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,800
gibberish i don't think this is an

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,640
example of that i think beauty inspires

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,480
and it more importantly it proves to you

75
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,199
this is something that can actually

76
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,518
happen on this earth plato right the

77
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,000
platonic theory of forms like this world

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,280
is imperfect but these perfect forms

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,800
exist in another dimension and that's

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,199
where our concepts come from you know he

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
was an early uh person trying to figure

82
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,439
out where our concepts come from and

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,519
epistemology and so on and so forth um

84
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,479
but that is something that is real in

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,360
here

86
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,039
so i completely disagree with his

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,640
analysis of that and i don't know if

88
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,560
it'll save the world but it's certainly

89
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,679
a prerequisite and what's the point of

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,680
fighting

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,200
for your values if you don't want to

92
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,719
make the world a more beautiful place

93
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,318
well it's also how you define beauty

94
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,359
because beauty could be just aesthetic

95
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,238
beauty it could be art of course art

96
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
could be

97
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,719
could encompass a lot a lot more than

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,158
just literature and paintings it can

99
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,400
encompass

100
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,560
the full

101
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
life the full dance of life

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
but then beauty could be something

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,599
just uh

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,080
deeper like

105
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,518
whatever that aw you feel

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,760
when you pause

107
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
and hear the music

108
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,840
just

109
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,238
hear

110
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,319
and like look up at the stars like for

111
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,640
some reason when i see rockets go up for

112
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,719
me it's like science what is that

113
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,559
the awe that we're able to accomplish

114
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,840
that as humans you know that's funny

115
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
because you know there's lots of

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,680
different schools of thought like these

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,239
people versus these people and and you

118
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,879
know maybe vegans versus uh

119
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,959
steakhouse people i think in terms of

120
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,639
the sciences and i guess you and i would

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,478
be on opposite sides here

122
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,800
you have the

123
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,758
astronomy people versus the zoology

124
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,759
people

125
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,720
like the the big question is would you

126
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,680
rather

127
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,199
spend

128
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,759
10 minutes on the moon or would you

129
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,560
rather spend 10 minutes in the deep sea

130
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,560
and for me it's clearly the deep sea

131
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,759
the zoology that's down there there's

132
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,639
something i would encourage people to

133
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,439
look up

134
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,439
called deep staria which is a jellyfish

135
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,600
then the scientists what's amazing when

136
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,399
you watch these deep-sea dives

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
on youtube is that the scientists are

138
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,039
they're they're nature dorks like

139
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
everybody else they're they went into

140
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,400
this field and there's none of this

141
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,879
maybe soulja nation-style cynicism of

142
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,879
when they see an amazing animal

143
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,759
in its natural environment you know

144
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,918
exhibiting these crazy behaviors they

145
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,120
lose it they're on the mic like oh my

146
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,599
god like it's so exciting to watch so

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,079
uh i i'm not a rocket person but i'm

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,439
definitely a zoology so animals and

149
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,279
plants in the sea

150
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,199
and also it's so mathematical there's so

151
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,799
many so many forms there's there's this

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,120
um

153
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,038
there's this plant called areospermum

154
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,160
titan up soybeas

155
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,120
i don't know how to pronounce it because

156
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,039
they're always in latin you never hear

157
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,560
them pronounced you said sperm aerial

158
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,079
sperm yeah because it's a woolly seed is

159
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,160
the is the genus

160
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,839
um the leaf it's just always puts out

161
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,439
one leaf

162
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,799
but the leaf is covered in little

163
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:43,120
magnifying glasses uh lenses to make it

164
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,759
maximize the sunlight so it looks like

165
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,600
this little crystal seashell it's tiny

166
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,520
it's like two centimeters but

167
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,960
it's just this amazing thing that that

168
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,959
grows out of the

169
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,879
sands in south africa

170
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,680
just a defense old jensen for a second

171
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,360
so

172
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,160
if i may read a couple of his lines from

173
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,680
the speech sure so he said uh one day

174
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,759
that's how he introduces it one day

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,720
dostoevsky threw out the enigmatic

176
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,560
remark beauty will save the world

177
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,280
what sort of a statement is that for a

178
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,519
long time i considered it mere words how

179
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,079
could that be possible when in

180
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,120
bloodthirsty history did beauty

181
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:21,758
ever save anyone from anything

182
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,560
and then later he goes on to argue with

183
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,600
himself in the speech as a older wiser

184
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,600
man now

185
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,639
but perhaps that ancient trinity of

186
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,280
truth goodness and beauty is not simply

187
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
an empty faded formula as we thought in

188
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,799
the days of our self-confident

189
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,800
materialistic youth

190
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,918
if the tops of these three trees

191
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,400
converge as the scholars maintained but

192
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:46,159
the two blatant to direct stems of truth

193
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,120
and goodness are crushed

194
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,680
cut down not allow through then perhaps

195
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,160
the fantastic unpredictable unexpected

196
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,439
stems of beauty will push through and

197
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,080
soar to that very same place and in so

198
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,879
doing will fulfill the work of all three

199
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,120
in that case the stavsky's remark beauty

200
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,159
will save the world was not a careless

201
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,959
phrase but a prophecy

202
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,199
uh which of yours which of these three

203
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,638
things are your favorites truth goodness

204
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,720
or beauty

205
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,918
what did he call truth and goodness

206
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,280
the blatant to direct stems of truth and

207
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:22,560
goodness

208
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,478
um

209
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,120
versus the

210
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,560
fantastic unpredictable unexpected stems

211
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,879
of beauty which is how i see your

212
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
twitter account i don't think that i

213
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,439
think there's a certain directive beauty

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,120
if you had my twitter account that's for

215
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:39,038
sure uh it's certainly no goodness um

216
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,478
or truth yeah yeah

217
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:41,360
it's twitter there's no truth to be

218
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,519
found

219
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
uh i would

220
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,038
i will answer the question i will of

221
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,000
course point out that having this kind

222
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:49,598
of

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,598
you know distinction between the three

224
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,759
things is i think kind of synthetic i

225
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,038
think they very heavily overlap if not

226
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,319
if i could probably make the argument

227
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,560
they're synonymous

228
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,919
um in fact i do believe that they're

229
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,918
largely synonymous um

230
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,719
goodness that's such an interesting word

231
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,478
goodness um uh which of those three is

232
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,599
my favorite

233
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,279
uh

234
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,560
i think truth

235
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,638
is overrated in the sense that if

236
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,478
something is a

237
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
good story

238
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,598
the story doesn't have to be true or

239
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,840
real in order to motivate you and and

240
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,598
move you

241
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:31,519
um a lot of times

242
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,799
we can delude ourselves about somebody

243
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,559
uh

244
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,000
and that might actually serve a purpose

245
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,038
to some extent you know if you have

246
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,360
someone who's

247
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,360
maybe a family member and you kind of

248
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,278
ignore bad things that they do

249
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,560
there might be reasons for that

250
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,039
um

251
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,559
of the three which is most important

252
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,799
i think

253
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,079
i would say probably goodness

254
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,719
i would say of the three the most

255
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,200
important is goodness because

256
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
if you don't appreciate goodness then

257
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,160
beauty is

258
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
just empty it's just

259
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,559
it's just a picture or

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,519
it's nice um bad people appreciate

261
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,000
beauty

262
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,480
uh you know bad people are often you

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,720
know seductive or or have a beauty about

264
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,959
them and in terms of action

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,680
i think it takes a lot of skill and work

266
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,919
to create beauty or to create truth or

267
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,399
to express truth and express beauty but

268
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:26,159
i think goodness is a

269
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,278
it's like um the easiest default state

270
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,719
of being just being good to others

271
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,559
yeah like you know like

272
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
there'll be things where

273
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,799
these videos where like one dog is

274
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
drowning and like another dog jumps in

275
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,120
and saves it from the

276
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,519
pool like that to me is

277
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,799
just really amazing stuff uh and it's

278
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,080
very moving

279
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,278
um so just to me goodness means

280
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,440
integrity

281
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,200
and it means kindness

282
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,800
um

283
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,200
and yeah i think of the three that's the

284
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,399
knife would be the one i pick

285
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,240
yeah yeah and i think people are

286
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,720
interrupting i think people also have

287
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,278
this idea which is inculcated to them

288
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
especially by corporate america that as

289
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,078
you get older

290
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:10,399
it's okay to do the wrong thing

291
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,799
sometimes blah blah blah i don't buy

292
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,839
that and so i think goodness gets rarer

293
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:18,240
and rarer um and and i think people know

294
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,040
better and they tell themselves lies

295
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,000
yeah

296
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,719
but

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,399
once you get allow yourself the chance

298
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959
to just

299
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,639
be good i think it makes for a better

300
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,958
life yeah it's like it's not that much

301
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,958
work like it's not like going to the gym

302
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,359
and working out that's a lot of work and

303
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,439
it's great afterwards but like goodness

304
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,440
is easy once you get into the habit of

305
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
it i suppose working out the same way

306
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,720
there's a lot of stuff if you make it a

307
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,799
habit

308
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,959
you're going to get the rewards of it

309
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,120
and it's going to be easy the rewards of

310
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,518
goodness i think are uh more immediate

311
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,320
than the rewards of working out

312
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,078
as opposed to the hard drugs yeah if uh

313
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,320
you mentioned this quote on one of your

314
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,439
uh live streams i think if you save one

315
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,600
life you save the world yeah

316
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,600
that's such a cool line i think i

317
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,278
remember reading about paul farmer i

318
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,240
think his name is he's a doctor that

319
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,399
really

320
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,519
i mean um doctors in general they kind

321
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,839
of don't care about

322
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,078
like what they're doing as a broad

323
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,680
policy across

324
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,359
hundreds of thousands of millions of

325
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,278
people they just care about the human in

326
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,278
front of them which is so interesting

327
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:28,639
they don't care it's gonna cost like in

328
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,958
this case to save one child it will cost

329
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,879
him hundreds of thousands of dollars

330
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,879
they don't care about that they can't

331
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,078
they know very well

332
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,958
that what their actions cannot be scaled

333
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:44,399
but they can't help but help the child

334
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,479
in front of them and it's so interesting

335
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,320
that's such an interesting way to live

336
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,399
and that's the way i kind of think when

337
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,000
i try to do something positive

338
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,440
is

339
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,759
will this help one person

340
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,920
and i just kind of imagine a specific

341
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,439
person depending on the thing

342
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,039
that that would help with like what i'm

343
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,200
trying to create something whether it's

344
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,599
a piece of hardware or or a video or

345
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,560
anything like that or educational

346
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,680
material lecture that kind of stuff

347
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,599
i don't know what what do you think

348
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,319
about this quote like what is it

349
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,839
profound or just just poetic i think

350
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,680
it's more profound than it sounds at

351
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,959
first uh the example i think of is

352
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,359
michelle bachman she was a former

353
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,199
congresswoman from minnesota she clearly

354
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
had crazy eyes something weird is going

355
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,440
on with the husband

356
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,879
but she adopted like like 20 kids terry

357
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,440
schappert's another friend of mine he's

358
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,799
like a either navy seal or marines i

359
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,079
whatever is terry i apologize i'm not

360
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,559
trying to be funny and he adopts like

361
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,000
elder dogs so

362
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,000
going back to bachmann it's like yeah

363
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,519
you can say she's crazy you can make fun

364
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,039
of her politics all you want and all

365
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,120
that stuff's legitimate

366
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,120
but if you save a kid

367
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,480
give them a home and you save them from

368
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,919
the foster system

369
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,920
um and you put a roof over their heads

370
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,919
and make them feel loved and appreciated

371
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,399
it's really hard for me

372
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,240
to sit here and call you

373
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,879
like a totally bad person

374
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,000
i think that kind of thing is nick

375
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,838
cersei's another one he adopted a kid

376
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,120
and i said you're i think you're a hero

377
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,480
like if you there's some you know

378
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,919
one of the things that's very hard for

379
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,759
me i'm writing as you know i talk about

380
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:21,278
this endlessly this book the white pill

381
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,799
but writing about when people do hurtful

382
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,439
things to children

383
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,719
it really is hard to watch and it's hard

384
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,920
to because when you're an author you

385
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,879
have to kind of empathize with the

386
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:30,799
character you have to where's this

387
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,480
character coming from explain their

388
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,838
point of view and that's the one that's

389
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,720
the hardest for me to wrap my head

390
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,760
around like cruelty to children yeah or

391
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,759
or

392
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,519
and yeah sadism to children it's just

393
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,120
like this is a

394
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,480
this is something even animals know not

395
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,919
to do you know what i mean like dogs

396
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,039
right when you see them around kids

397
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,958
they're very

398
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,879
protective like if the kid pokes their

399
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,638
eyes out the dog doesn't do anything

400
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,120
so it's like if you can't even get to

401
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,198
that level uh what kind of person are

402
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,198
you so i think that quote

403
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,039
um

404
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,519
is a profound one and it's an important

405
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:06,240
one uh it also means

406
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,078
we're not all called upon to be superman

407
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,639
right you only have a very finite

408
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,479
ability to move the needle

409
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,480
but at the same time

410
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,360
if you have actually you know saved the

411
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,199
life

412
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,560
you can go to meet your maker you you

413
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,919
did your part you know you left the

414
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,919
world a little bit better than you found

415
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,719
it and that's all you could ask anybody

416
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:27,679
also i think from a policy perspective

417
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,360
it seems we just do better when we focus

418
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,000
on doing a small thing

419
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,278
helping uh helping one person because it

420
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,720
feels like when you start talking about

421
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,320
communism and all those kinds of things

422
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,639
when you start to believe you could do

423
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,560
good by a lot of people that's where

424
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,399
your mind somehow

425
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,399
stops being able to do good by a lot of

426
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,720
people that's when you start to think

427
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,720
about utopias and somehow utopia's ghost

428
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,319
feeds power into the brain to where it

429
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,120
deludes you completely and then you

430
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,879
start

431
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,440
it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an

432
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,958
omelet kind of reasoning and you run

433
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,839
into trouble it seems like it's much

434
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,439
better

435
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,000
even when you have the power and the

436
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,560
money and so on to achieve scale to

437
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,799
focus on one and then

438
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,759
or locally yeah locally yeah right

439
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,519
because then suppose you have the

440
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,278
feedback exactly right so if you have

441
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,039
some kind of program you know in austin

442
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,480
or brooklyn or something like that and

443
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,599
you're you can you can watch oh this is

444
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,600
working this isn't working then you

445
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,000
could port it out to other places but

446
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,199
top-down helping is you know

447
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,120
at the very least it's going to be

448
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,198
inefficient and also i think it's a lot

449
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,639
more useful when you're helping people

450
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,039
when it's a one-on-one

451
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,480
relationship because then it's less i

452
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,799
don't know embarrassing but certainly

453
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,639
less something to receive help and you

454
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,919
also feel if it's one thing if you get a

455
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,919
check from the government you know food

456
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,439
stamps it's nothing if someone's like

457
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,120
hey i'm gonna buy you groceries until

458
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,800
you get back on your feet you have this

459
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,399
kind of motivation i think for most

460
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,120
people to be like you know what this

461
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,720
person believed in me i'm gonna

462
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,560
make it worth their while that they

463
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,360
believed in me yes i didn't believe in

464
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,359
me

465
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,720
yeah i had when i was giving lectures at

466
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,480
mit there was one uh was scarce shitless

467
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,839
and uh i mean everybody you know how

468
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,440
students are and all that kind of stuff

469
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,199
they're kind of bored yeah and they

470
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,360
don't they don't understand that you're

471
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:11,599
human too they're yeah

472
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,879
or this is it could be just me but they

473
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,839
don't understand you're trying to pass

474
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,320
this human i know uh but there's one one

475
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,639
uh gentleman in the audience and he went

476
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,000
to all the lectures uh all the gentlemen

477
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,560
he was a faculty at mit and he just

478
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,879
without very kind of nonchalant just

479
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:32,078
said uh after the lectures he would kind

480
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:35,198
of nod at me and say he did great

481
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,799
and uh before like one time he said in a

482
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,519
non-creepy way i know this is gonna come

483
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,439
off as creepy he said uh

484
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,839
you look great today

485
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,160
like he said that you know um i don't in

486
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,959
the way so he's like 60 70 or whatever

487
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,240
like

488
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,879
he

489
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,278
in this i don't know it's in a wise sage

490
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,958
way because i was wearing a suit and tie

491
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,120
like i look like you know when you dress

492
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,239
up like a young kid

493
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,320
yeah

494
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,320
yeah so he was just like all right

495
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,400
yeah you were uh you're all dressed up

496
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,558
you look great yeah you got this i don't

497
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,038
know that has a lasting impact that kind

498
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,399
of pat on the back but i agree with you

499
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,919
um

500
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,160
cruelty towards other adults

501
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,199
is somehow understandable

502
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,480
because it's uh a world full of conflict

503
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,318
but cruelty towards children

504
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,759
doesn't

505
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,240
it doesn't quite

506
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,480
i can't i can't understand it

507
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,400
i can't understand how you could

508
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,599
act in a way that directly causes

509
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,080
suffering to a child in front of you

510
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,599
yeah that is like the the i don't think

511
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,000
i've ever talked to you this might be a

512
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,599
good time to ask you about this

513
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,160
what do you make what lessons do you

514
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,000
draw about human civilization from

515
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,480
jeffrey epstein

516
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,919
from just laying out

517
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,679
everybody thinks about different things

518
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,038
when you talk to eric weinstein he

519
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,919
thinks about

520
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:00,319
intelligence and like who like jeffrey

521
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,320
epstein is a front for something else

522
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,159
that's what he he thinks about

523
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:09,119
i think about the weakness of grown

524
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,840
men in the face of uh charismatic evil

525
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,399
which is like for me directly as mit i

526
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,319
didn't know i actually was i guess i was

527
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,120
at my team when jeff epstein was just at

528
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:20,079
the very end he must have been there

529
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,038
um

530
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:26,000
i didn't know any of this but it really

531
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:28,160
bothers me that nobody was able to see

532
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,400
through this man because he's obviously

533
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,759
what is also obvious to me is that he

534
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,880
was very charismatic like

535
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:40,558
i mean i i tried to think about

536
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,840
human nature from this perspective is um

537
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,599
directly like we said help one life

538
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,240
would i know

539
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,399
a jeffrey epstein if he was in my life

540
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,160
would i would i know evil when i saw

541
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,880
evil even if it's sitting across from

542
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,759
you

543
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,160
even

544
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,038
i mean you

545
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,600
so

546
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,099
exactly the evil left thank you the the

547
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,678
thing

548
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:06,000
[Laughter]

549
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,280
well it's a necronomicon well the thing

550
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,279
i and

551
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,798
i'm sure we'll talk about it maybe not

552
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,200
it doesn't really matter we we see

553
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,558
things you and i michael very

554
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,798
differently about a lot of things

555
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,399
politically and so on the reason i like

556
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,879
you a lot the reason i like

557
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,919
uh the people i do in my life is there's

558
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,840
a

559
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,000
there's a warmth there's a kindness

560
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,439
there's a humanity underneath it all i

561
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,359
don't really care what you believe i

562
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,279
don't care like

563
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,959
i don't care what your twitter says you

564
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,639
you know it's easy to mistake your

565
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,400
twitter to indicate that there's not a

566
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,960
deeply human

567
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,960
love for humanity in there and that's

568
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,440
why i'm detecting that

569
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,880
i think i would be able to detect

570
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,160
jeffrey epstein protect i'm just

571
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,160
imagining the t-1000

572
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,960
detected

573
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,320
yes

574
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,960
uh i imagine i hope i would be able to

575
00:19:54,319 --> 00:20:00,000
not uh detect that

576
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,159
epstein uh lacks that completely even if

577
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,079
he's charismatic and the in the humor he

578
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,240
has

579
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,158
even if he is uh charismatic in the

580
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,720
expression of curiosity for science

581
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,520
which he did he was curious about like

582
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,839
uh

583
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,759
not just like boring

584
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,759
uh minutiae of science he was interested

585
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,000
about the big questions in science which

586
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,798
i could see that become exciting to

587
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,400
scientists like oh wow here's a person

588
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,000
who's thinking big that's always

589
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
exciting to when somebody goes into a

590
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
room

591
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,440
and thinks about like how do we solve

592
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,600
intelligence how do we travel faster

593
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,600
than the speed of light that's exciting

594
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,279
to people especially people with money

595
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,839
because it's like all right so we might

596
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,440
be able to actually do big things here

597
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,918
uh but you could see through the

598
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,159
[ __ ] the the dead the deadness in

599
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,960
the eyes i don't know uh so i think

600
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,559
about that because i feel like i have

601
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,200
the responsibility for me as an

602
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,079
individual to detect evil

603
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,880
so

604
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,720
i do you know who michael alleg is

605
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,240
okay this is going to be a whole long

606
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,240
this is going to be on next clips but

607
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,319
this is a whole long story so there was

608
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,919
a scene in new york in the 90s called

609
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,759
the club kids

610
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,440
and they would go out to different

611
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,200
nightclubs at night they would all dress

612
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,960
in really kind of crazy

613
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,360
um costumes

614
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
and but the costumes were all like like

615
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,240
goofy and like just thinking like an

616
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,640
angel this was dressed like a nurse it

617
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,200
was there's a juvenile aspect to it

618
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,440
they're all taking you know ketamine and

619
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,919
ecstasy to all hours this is kind of

620
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,200
rape culture was coming up in there and

621
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,440
the head of it and in fact there's um

622
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,159
a clip on youtube i think it was the

623
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,240
jane whitney show of the club kids and

624
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,159
gigi allen gigi allen is a

625
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,319
you know kind of punk rock performer

626
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,480
hard rock performer who

627
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,759
passed away and the audience and gigi

628
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,000
allen was very

629
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,599
uh aggressive and like a crazy person my

630
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,519
friend once saw him

631
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,439
in a concert and he

632
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,359
took a dump on stage

633
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,480
smeared it all over his face grabbed the

634
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,119
girl from the audience and gave her a

635
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,440
big kiss and as she walked by him she

636
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,279
just went like this like excuse me like

637
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,200
went to the bathroom so the audience is

638
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,119
screaming at gg allen because he's very

639
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,319
visibly over the top whereas you got a

640
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,558
bunch of these kids dressed in these

641
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,918
silly costumes you guys just having fun

642
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:13,839
well the head of the club kids michael

643
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,840
alleg ended up killing someone

644
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:17,279
there was a kid called angel menendez

645
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,759
who hung around with them he would

646
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,558
always have angel wings and boots uh one

647
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,279
time they're at michael's condo

648
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,918

649
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,519
freeze they got into a fight some angel

652
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,400
what are we gonna do with the body uh

653
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,240
they put it on ice in the bathtub they

654
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,240
had a party so everyone's going the

655
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,599
bathroom while angel's body's there

656
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,200
michael got they're like all right we

657
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,119
got to take care of this michael got

658
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,798
extremely high in heroin

659
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:49,119
had like uh sil cutlery from macy's saw

660
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,798
the body in pieces put in a box

661
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,000
they took him in the cab the cab driver

662
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,079
helped them throw the body into the

663
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,400
river and then michael starts walking

664
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,480
around manhattan wearing angel's boots

665
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,559
and would tell people i killed angel now

666
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,159
because he was a super effeminate

667
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:03,759
over the top like he would pee in

668
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,679
people's beer kind of guy everyone's

669
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,200
like oh god michael like like you and

670
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,120
your stupid pranks

671
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,519
uh but it was true

672
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,319
and he got caught um and he got sent to

673
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,400
jail

674
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:17,599
so i was in a store in manhattan in soho

675
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
and it was one of those stores we have

676
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,759
like all sorts of things for sale

677
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,000
and i saw a painting and it said malice

678
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,519
and i'm like wait what and it was m aleg

679
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
it was a michael alec painting he had

680
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,639
painted while in jail so my mom bought

681
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,720
it for me for my birthday i remember a

682
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,799
birthday that was and i started writing

683
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,200
him in prison he was going to write a

684
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,599
memoir called eligula which is clever

685
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,960
and then i actually went to visit him

686
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,879
like i want to see what this person is

687
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,720
like because on the on one hand he's

688
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,960
king of new york nightlife this goofy

689
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
person and it's also kind of ironic that

690
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,840
gigi allen is like maybe he's gross he's

691
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,120
not killing anybody he's probably an

692
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,119
accountant off the stage and michael

693
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,959
actually killed someone and then bragged

694
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,000
about it tongue-in-cheek

695
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,600
so

696
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,240
but meeting him

697
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,240
he passed away last december um on

698
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,839
christmas actually this uh christmas uh

699
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,960
20

700
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,558
uh 20.

701
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,600
um he was clearly a sociopath

702
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,278
and i'd never met a sociopath before now

703
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,798
a lot of times we'll read these like

704
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,640
you'll take a buzzfeed quiz like are you

705
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:15,918
a sociopath but it's like oh

706
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,038
my feelings weren't hurt when i was mean

707
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,440
to someone

708
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,038
it's not a thin line

709
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,759
between like

710
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,519
me and you and him it's a thick thick

711
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,278
line because when you're talking to

712
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,119
someone like that at least in this

713
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,400
specific case he was being very friendly

714
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,278
he wasn't and it's not like he was going

715
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,559
to kill anyone or is a threat to me

716
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,240
but

717
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,558
there's that sense like something's

718
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,038
really off here and he was talking to me

719
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,480
about how after he had

720
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,879
killed angel

721
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,960
he would just talk about it because

722
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,880
he felt so much guilt he just wanted to

723
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,400
get caught it's like no no you what he

724
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,960
was describing wasn't guilt he was

725
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,640
describing just he didn't like the um

726
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,159
the knife over his head

727
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,679
like waiting to get caught i'm like you

728
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,679
don't even know what guilt is so it was

729
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,278
kind of like oh wow

730
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,519
so

731
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,599
as for jeffrey but the thing is michael

732
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,639
aleg is it was in a very low social

733
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,918
position

734
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,038
and the thing is when someone is

735
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,559
powerful

736
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,798
very high status

737
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:16,240
and they do something

738
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:18,720
we are as kind of hierarchical animals

739
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,519
we kind of defer to their

740
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,839
norms yeah so if you're at a party

741
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,079
with let's suppose uh or either of us

742
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,759
and it's like a jeffrey epstein party

743
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,399
and everyone at the party is doing some

744
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,480
sort of weird drug we've never heard of

745
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,360
we wouldn't really feel comfortable

746
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,240
judging them because like their norms

747
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,119
kind of become the norm for that space

748
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,079
um

749
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,918
the lesson for me about jeffrey epstein

750
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,399
uh it's the sev there's a lot of them

751
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,240
because i think this the to me the the

752
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,440
biggest moment was the amy rohrbach

753
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,640
situation amy rohrbach was caught on a

754
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,080
hot mic

755
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,480
saying that they had all the goods on

756
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,558
him they had all the names and that

757
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,759
buckingham palace called them they

758
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,440
killed the story because they weren't

759
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,119
going to get a megan mark interview out

760
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,200
of it so that

761
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,359
the willingness of

762
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,679
those in power to

763
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,278
do the wrong thing for this flimsiest

764
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,720
pretext which i think was a big

765
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:14,558
important lesson

766
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,240
also the fact that

767
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,720
no one at abc

768
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,960
had any consequences for this in fact

769
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,798
the only person who got in trouble for

770
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,600
all this was someone who used to work at

771
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,599
abc went to i believe cbs and they got

772
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,959
fired from cbs because apparently they

773
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,000
had access to footage at one point even

774
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,120
though they weren't the ones who had

775
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,079
leaked it

776
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,239
um

777
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,158
so whistleblowers are like the only for

778
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,240
example the case in um

779
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,799
uh uh eric garner the guy who was

780
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,440
selling lucy cigarettes in new york city

781
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,720
uh who was arrested he had a heart

782
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,600
attack or whatever it was on the way to

783
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,360
jail he died the only person so the cops

784
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,879
had a situation there the only person

785
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,439
who got in trouble because of that was

786
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,080
the guy filming it like he went to jail

787
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,278
so i think there is if there's a lesson

788
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,278
in terms of

789
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,480
we look at julian assange right there's

790
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,440
a huge

791
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,440
amount of power exercised by elites to

792
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,798
make sure that what is done on the cover

793
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,440
of darkness remains in the cover of

794
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,038
darkness and also kevin mccarthy who was

795
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,880
currently the house minority leader

796
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:16,720
leader of the republicans he wrote a

797
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,240
letter to abc news like you had this guy

798
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,519
maybe you couldn't call in the

799
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,200
authorities but you could have leaked it

800
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,119
to somebody why hasn't anything come

801
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,038
forward nothing happened as a result of

802
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:26,959
this we also have to keep in mind that

803
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,240
the longest serving republican speaker

804
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,840
of the house in history dennis hastert

805
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,399
went to jail because of things related

806
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,639
to pedophilia and things like that so

807
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:36,558
as russians and this is something i

808
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,679
think you and i have mentioned before

809
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:42,879
uh americans are very naive often

810
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,480
decreasingly so about the nature of evil

811
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,399
they think an evil person is someone

812
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,640
who's like getting kickbacks

813
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,158
um or you know like the cuomo's are

814
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,480
colluding something like that i would

815
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,840
hardly even call that evil um

816
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,319
no no this is

817
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,839
the sort of things that are so depraved

818
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,278
that you would never think about it in a

819
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,119
million years in your own home you don't

820
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,480
think in these terms and and i think

821
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,959
they get off

822
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,640
on doing things that if the average

823
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,399
person heard about it the average person

824
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,080
would be shocked because that gives them

825
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,918
this sense of weird above them we're

826
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,359
different from them

827
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,600
the rules don't apply to us there's a

828
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,879
lot to say here so one is the norm thing

829
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,918
you said at a party it's really

830
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,399
interesting

831
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,038
for an nrcas to say that

832
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,038
well no it's this no well i know i know

833
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:27,240
so i'm not sorry this that came off as

834
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,599
criticism i meant it as harsh criticism

835
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,880
[Laughter]

836
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:35,278
no i i think about that a lot like um

837
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,278
as uh the you know i found myself in

838
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,480
situations where i'm invited

839
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,038
uh to

840
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,319
these kinds of parties where people have

841
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,558
nice things

842
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,079
and i find it deeply uncomfortable for

843
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,158
that reason

844
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,240
i i don't want to be sort of an activist

845
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,960
that goes in and ruins a party that's

846
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,038
that's a i think that's uh

847
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,038
that's not the courageous act

848
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,879
neither is it courageous when everyone's

849
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,200
doing some weird drug that you mentioned

850
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,159
to join in i think

851
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,880
courageous is more

852
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,000
being remaining yourself sticking to

853
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,679
your principles calmly in that room

854
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,119
where everybody is doing the drug and

855
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,038
just don't do the drug yeah sure don't

856
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,959
make a scene about it but also don't

857
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:19,278
don't do it and i think

858
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,120
that little act of courage over time is

859
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,519
the way you resist jeffrey epstein that

860
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:25,519
exactly the thing you said

861
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,240
is is probably the situation where

862
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:30,000
charisma works so one charismatic person

863
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,240
gets the little crowd going and the

864
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,278
crowd is everybody sort of uh

865
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,120
establishes a norm at the little crowd

866
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,200
and yes there could be some dynamics

867
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,199
that allow that norm to be established

868
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,880
like you said like rich and powerful

869
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,159
people might

870
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,080
enjoy

871
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,679
being rich and powerful and better than

872
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,240
everybody else kind of

873
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,278
kind of thing but

874
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,159
like i

875
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,159
especially for scientists i i thought

876
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,679
they should have integrity and courage

877
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,840
enough to

878
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,240
to see through that not again as an

879
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,000
activist like so you can tweet about it

880
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,720
how courageous you are but just

881
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
literally see there's something off here

882
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,440
there's something off here and i'm not

883
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,519
going to participate i'm going to defend

884
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,600
these scientists because

885
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,599
something off first of all you're always

886
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,398
defending academia it's disgusting it's

887
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,000
my favorite thing i think that first of

888
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,558
all this is going to sound like a joke

889
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,519
and it's not i bet you

890
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:27,119
90

891
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,079
of those mit scientists are on the

892
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,038
spectrum

893
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:30,960
so everyone they're going to meet is

894
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,319
going to be a little off right so i'm

895
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,840
sure part of their brains like okay this

896
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,439
person is weird this is just them being

897
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,119
on the spectrum like the lights but

898
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,440
spectrum i couldn't even finish the joke

899
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,038
okay guys

900
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,080
number two is

901
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:42,879
off

902
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,639
we

903
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,640
we tend to

904
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,880
there's this poem i forget who wrote it

905
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,600
it was like nick cave or something and

906
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,240
it was describing um like

907
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:57,359
i think it was gerbils hair normal

908
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,000
height normal weight normal what do you

909
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,038
expect horns right so

910
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,319
when you meet someone you think

911
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:03,599
something's off

912
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,119
there's going to be a bell curve of what

913
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,398
that could be right it could be that

914
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,398
they're twitchy

915
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:11,038
or maybe they're completely asocial and

916
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,879
then you have jeffrey epstein over here

917
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,640
you're going to need a lot of evidence

918
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,519
to be like oh i feel something off there

919
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,360
for this guy's the head of an

920
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,278
international you know sex trafficking

921
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,519
ring so

922
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,278
yeah you might be like okay but at the

923
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,599
same time if their extended relationship

924
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,278
is this guy is interested in my work

925
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,798
he's going to fund my work and i don't

926
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,359
have to give him anything in return he's

927
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:33,839
clearly intelligent he's appreciating it

928
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,918
and being a scientist is a thankless job

929
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,359
uh i i know what it's like as an author

930
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,038
when i was writing dear reader the north

931
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,798
korea book my friends are sick of

932
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:41,919
hearing all these north korean anecdotes

933
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:43,599
because at a certain point it's like

934
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,799
okay we get it just saved for the book

935
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,158
and you know you've got to be in that

936
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:47,278
lab you're looking at the springtails

937
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,720
whatever it is you're looking at no one

938
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,798
knows what a springtail is i just

939
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,159
disagree with you so the that'd be

940
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,960
interesting to draw the distinction

941
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,440
between science and writing because the

942
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,759
scientific process itself is fun as [ __ ]

943
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,679
it's you're solving little puzzles sure

944
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:04,720
so like in itself

945
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,399
it's fun so like it's rewarding like the

946
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,120
reason you go into

947
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,678
uh science is you can continue really

948
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,639
without a boss to continue having fun

949
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,240
and solving puzzles that's that's

950
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,960
literally so like

951
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,960
uh unless you become cynical and tired

952
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,558
of the whole thing so the the people the

953
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,960
administration or when you're running a

954
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,558
large lab and you what you get sick of

955
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,798
is the emails and the meetings and all

956
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:32,720
that kind of stuff the actual act of

957
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:35,038
being in the lab is still fun as [ __ ]

958
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,919
if you allow it to be writing i feel

959
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,558
like

960
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,200
is there's more priority to publishing

961
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:43,839
like would you enjoy it the tree falling

962
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,600
in the forest would you still enjoy

963
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,038
any of the books you've written if they

964
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,959
never got published

965
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,798
not to the same extent not even close

966
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,919
right right i think that the thing about

967
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,759
science

968
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,000
it's almost like you get a peek into the

969
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,640
mysterious yeah but this is okay let me

970
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,839
this is where i'm coming from

971
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,000
since moving to austin i've bought 150

972
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:06,398
over 150 plants look are you doing the

973
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,079
the politician thing

974
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,518
let me let me be clear

975
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,720
all right

976
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,278
it's not

977
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,880
oh you you are running in 2024 this is

978
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,880
very interesting

979
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,320
i bought 150 succulents from my house

980
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,600
they're they're thriving here in austin

981
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,119
as they wouldn't have in brooklyn you

982
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,678
have a great video about it people yeah

983
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,879
one of those plants i have is the photo

984
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,640
i took on my instagram there's no other

985
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,840
photos on the internet none of my

986
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,679
friends care

987
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,199
or they care like ostensibly but like

988
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,600
that's cool like i have a better plant

989
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,519
collection in my house than like almost

990
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,119
any botanical succulent collection than

991
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,798
any would santa garden in america other

992
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,719
than probably the huntington and no one

993
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:41,519
cares this is what ego looks like by the

994
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,679
way

995
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,839
i i can prove it to you no i know but

996
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,919
you don't have to rub it in well they

997
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,519
have a big budget i don't so if i can

998
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,399
put it together they should be able to

999
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,319
right so i can only imagine that a

1000
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:55,359
scientist who studied

1001
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,599
you know

1002
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:59,439
those spiders that look like ants

1003
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,359
like at a certain like

1004
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,600
oh and this species does this with the

1005
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,199
gender dimorphism their friends are only

1006
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,879
going to care so much so if you meet

1007
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,280
someone who has a lot of money who now

1008
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,919
cares about aunt spiders it's going to

1009
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,280
be exciting it will be very exciting but

1010
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:18,000
i i just wanted to push back on the

1011
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,320
i think the act itself should be the

1012
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,960
biggest reward i think you're always

1013
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,039
safe we're talking about goodness being

1014
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,639
a safe default i think it's a good

1015
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,358
default

1016
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,480
for for plants and for writing it for

1017
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,799
science

1018
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,199
is to just enjoying the act even if

1019
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,679
nobody cares okay this is where this

1020
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,039
okay now i'm even now i'm wondering why

1021
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,240
i'm pushing back so hard and i realized

1022
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,599
what it was

1023
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,358
because

1024
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,039
i've made this point several times and

1025
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,119
i'm glad i can make it again

1026
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,480
there's this window of time that

1027
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,079
happened in my life and i know it

1028
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,519
happens to a lot of people

1029
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,079
when you're in you're like 24 to 27 28

1030
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:57,358
right so 21 to 24 like you still have

1031
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,599
your friends from college so on and so

1032
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,239
forth right but then it's kind of like a

1033
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,680
poker game and you know every so often

1034
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,679
people cash out they're like i'm out i'm

1035
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,559
out they get married they get a job they

1036
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:08,319
move

1037
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,000
and if you are someone who is a young

1038
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,559
ambitious creative

1039
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,559
that window is a very rough one because

1040
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,799
you're doing the right thing right and

1041
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,400
you're not being you know drug addict

1042
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,839
you're not being a philanderer not that

1043
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,160
those things are wrong but just like

1044
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:23,679
you're playing by the rules you're

1045
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,719
creating your stuff what you want to be

1046
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:25,838
known for

1047
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,159
contribution you want to make for the

1048
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,279
world and no one cares and it gets very

1049
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,399
lonely

1050
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,880
and there's this

1051
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,000
very emotional disconnect about how is

1052
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,800
it that

1053
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,800
i'm creating and i'm working hard and

1054
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,119
i'm making something happen and it's

1055
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,280
just radio silence so that

1056
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,358
i don't think it's that easy when you're

1057
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,599
you're the scientist not me

1058
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,239
when you don't have any kind of external

1059
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,680
validation humans only have so much

1060
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,479
fuel

1061
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:57,279
nothing worth having is easy michael by

1062
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,800
the way yesterday talked on the phone

1063
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,440
with a person he said he was deeply

1064
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,400
moved the first time you mentioned

1065
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,119
this uh age group of 24 to 27 he's like

1066
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,760
he he's 26 he said

1067
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,680
and uh he feels the full responsibility

1068
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,800
of that and the excitement so he left

1069
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:16,319
his like um corporate typey job to

1070
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,240
pursue something that he's really

1071
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,559
passionate about and that that that was

1072
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,118
like you were an inspiration to him

1073
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:26,960
which i i was deeply saddened by that i

1074
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,559
also inspired michael alex

1075
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,880
the

1076
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,239
the the amount of mass murder um those

1077
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,800
that were inspired by you will

1078
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,239
eventually uh lead to is is uh truly

1079
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,400
horrifying

1080
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,399
what were we talking about so jeffrey

1081
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,000
absolutely oh one thing i wanted to ask

1082
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,480
you so

1083
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,760
let's put scientists aside what about

1084
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,719
like

1085
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,400
uh world leaders uh bill clinton

1086
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,919
your favorite person

1087
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,440
why would he fly with jeffrey epstein

1088
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,280
why would he

1089
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,320
interact with that guy

1090
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,079
i mean

1091
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,760
don't you think that

1092
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,760
that's kind of the deal

1093
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,920
that i'm the president

1094
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,119
and i get big and powerful people flying

1095
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,119
around their jets and that's the

1096
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,760
symbiotic relationship

1097
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,519
yeah but don't you also have a good bs

1098
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,960
detector like the

1099
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,039
don't you have a good detector for

1100
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,240
people who just want to be in your

1101
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,159
presence

1102
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,838
like i already

1103
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,838
understand that there's people like this

1104
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:24,719
out there like there's people that kind

1105
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:26,960
of

1106
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,000
want to use me for stuff

1107
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,880
and

1108
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,358
you mean tim dylan tim dillon

1109
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,358
um

1110
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,800
uh i love that guy you guys met we

1111
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,880
haven't met yet here we have met oh yeah

1112
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,359
wow we met before in new york but we had

1113
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,960
not since i've moved here yeah so

1114
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:46,319
you should be able to detect that though

1115
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,920
there's those people and there's the

1116
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,280
people that have kindness in their heart

1117
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,720
even if they can benefit from the

1118
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,480
interaction with you but they have like

1119
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:53,759
they're good human beings i feel like

1120
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,280
you want to

1121
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,839
you run into a lot of trouble if you

1122
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,320
surround yourself or have any people

1123
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:02,400
that are manipulative but i think you

1124
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,240
like that bad example because like let's

1125
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,960
look at clinton and let's look at obama

1126
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,039
right

1127
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,639
so obama even though their politics are

1128
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,000
very close i'd say in many ways obama is

1129
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,078
apparent we don't know i don't know

1130
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,079
either of them but to me it seems very

1131
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,280
apparent that he's very similar behind

1132
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,560
closed doors as he did from the camera

1133
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,320
yeah he's he's barack to me oh yeah yeah

1134
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,559
he's good yeah

1135
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,359
clinton seems very clearly

1136
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,799
to be much more of a performer he's in

1137
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,480
front of the cameras he puts on a roll

1138
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,560
but behind the cameras he very much has

1139
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,920
a temper he's known for that he's much

1140
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:35,519
more of a letch

1141
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,480
um

1142
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,759
perfect

1143
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,000
oh lech with an e l e t c h yeah oh cool

1144
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,560
yeah letch is that like uh that's a cool

1145
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,239
term so i can use that in the internet

1146
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,239
like you're a ledge yeah you could use

1147
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,639
an internet you're a dirty watch well

1148
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:54,239
it's a dirty's implied um oh so it's

1149
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:56,000
okay yeah so being redundant yeah um but

1150
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,919
it just feels like it needs an adjective

1151
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,800
to give it more power anyway i'm sorry

1152
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,960
so uh clinton is a letch right so

1153
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,200
you can see how

1154
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,280
there's people who want to meet you know

1155
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:08,639
the surface bill clinton and i'm sure

1156
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,680
that guts old for him because he has to

1157
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,440
be on

1158
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:13,519
but then there's the good old boys where

1159
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,760
he could be a pervert and this guy's

1160
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,599
like yeah i know what it's like and then

1161
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,200
he feels like he's himself but i'm also

1162
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,359
we're all speculating i mean i don't

1163
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:23,039
know what bill clinton is like what was

1164
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,358
in it for him he certainly had could

1165
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,480
afford private jets if he wanted to uh

1166
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:28,000
there's no shortage of people who want

1167
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,440
to fly around the world to give speeches

1168
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,199
you know at you know can he satisfy the

1169
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,440
lech within

1170
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,039
uh in without hanging out with the

1171
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,880
jeffrey epstein's of the world like

1172
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,279
can't he get i mean this is the monica

1173
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,920
lewinsky question to me i'm i'm confused

1174
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,519
by all of this can't he get

1175
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,320
uh women in a legitimate way of like

1176
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,280
not not using his power not hanging out

1177
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,400
with these

1178
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,400
shady

1179
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,519
rich people but just like

1180
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,079
having a

1181
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:00,320
normal mistress like jfk had well jake

1182
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,000
had a lot i know i understand that but

1183
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,318
in the normal way or i don't i don't

1184
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,679
know enough about you i i i don't

1185
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,679
understand

1186
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,199
the clinton psychology

1187
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:10,799
first of all the fact that you're

1188
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,598
hooking up with someone who's close to

1189
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,160
your daughter's age to me i think was is

1190
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,160
inherently disturbing but she's an adult

1191
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,838
so okay that's not that that

1192
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:20,960
you know beyond the pale

1193
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,920
but

1194
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,679
also the idea that oh if i don't

1195
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,800
physically fornicate with you it's not

1196
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,799
cheating

1197
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,800
like that whatever you tell yourself or

1198
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,800
like if i don't ejaculate it's not

1199
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,440
cheating like

1200
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,359
these rules then maybe it leads to some

1201
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,440
kind of slippery slope like you start

1202
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:41,119
not having the rules of

1203
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,639
who you fool i mean if you told your

1204
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,559
wife like listen

1205
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,000
it wasn't cheating she only you know

1206
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,199
performed on me

1207
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,760
you're going to say this with a straight

1208
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,239
face like do you at a certain point when

1209
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,480
something is so brazen you wonder if the

1210
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:56,399
person even has to believe it because

1211
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,240
who are you fooling

1212
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,160
but like we started this this

1213
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:01,118
conversation with them there is a line

1214
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:05,358
between

1215
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:08,559
young women older than 18 and

1216
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:10,159
young teen like 12 13 kids have you

1217
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,039
ever when's the last oh because you're

1218
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,480
it's different for you because you're at

1219
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:16,800
mit i was hanging out with uh uh blair

1220
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,800
white uh and she had a couple of fans

1221
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,119
with her of hers and they were like 22

1222
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,359
23 and they were like children to me

1223
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,240
yeah like i'm like

1224
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:28,000
to me as someone who is in his late 60s

1225
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,919
to look at these people

1226
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,079
as adults like

1227
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,119
they look completely like kids

1228
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,480
so

1229
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,800
that now of course there's exceptions

1230
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,318
like i've interacted with a young 20 20

1231
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,839
year olds

1232
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,400
that are like

1233
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:44,239
you're way more mature than i'll ever be

1234
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,119
like the wisdom that comes out of them

1235
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:49,039
is quite fascinating visually

1236
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,920
the the energy and the way they look

1237
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:54,159
they looked so young to me and the the

1238
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,480
way they carried themselves it was the

1239
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,920
the idea that my

1240
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,599
instinct was

1241
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,760
let's tuck you in and read you a bedtime

1242
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,359
story and not let me like touch you or

1243
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,200
something it was just like

1244
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:06,559
like it was just wouldn't enter my head

1245
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,559
so

1246
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,318
there's but the thing is

1247
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,599
is it possible that in order to want to

1248
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:12,960
be the president you have to be a crazy

1249
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,680
person

1250
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,920
that you have some kind of weird

1251
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,719
view on power it could be a power thing

1252
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,200
too

1253
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:24,078
yeah like like you can get away with

1254
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,919
stuff like if i was clinton's age

1255
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,200
nothing about monica lewinsky to me

1256
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,960
would be

1257
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,639
attractive and also i would just feel

1258
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,159
bad for her because i know she's going

1259
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,838
to catch feelings

1260
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,960
and it's kind of like feeling yeah it's

1261
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:36,400
true

1262
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,400
it's just like why would i do this to

1263
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,559
this kid for what just because i want to

1264
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,440
get some like momentary pleasure

1265
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,440
come on

1266
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,920
beauty is in the eye of the beholder i'm

1267
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,240
sure she looked uh gorgeous to him in

1268
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,480
the moment

1269
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:53,099
well let me ask uh we started talking

1270
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,000
about beauty uh who are you wearing

1271
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:59,519
[Laughter]

1272
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,880
so as a model under you usually have

1273
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,639
don't have a shirt on when you're

1274
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,720
modeling

1275
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,838
so it's nice to see you uh dressed up

1276
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:06,349
today

1277
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,119
um

1278
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:11,920
[Laughter]

1279
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,160
nice and warm this is because so for

1280
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,920
those who don't know if russians don't

1281
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:17,759
celebrate christmas obviously with the

1282
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,559
soviet union christmas was illegal no

1283
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,240
thanksgiving basically no major

1284
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,559
holidays where everyone gets together

1285
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,118
this is the one holiday yeah it's not a

1286
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,719
call and instead of i remember as a kid

1287
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,960
instead of santa claus we have dead

1288
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,879
marrows who's the same thing basically

1289
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,960
it's like android and iphone is it's

1290
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,480
like a cheap version of christmas he's

1291
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,240
got this girl with him she's like snow

1292
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,679
white or whatever and

1293
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,759
russian kids they go to sleep on

1294
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,519
december 31st and they wake up january

1295
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,359
they have a present under their pillow

1296
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,239
um and i remember as a kid this happened

1297
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:48,078
once

1298
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,159
and it just blew my mind you know what i

1299
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,440
mean it's just like i went to bed my

1300
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,039
dad's like oh you know you're going to

1301
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,318
have denmark is going to bring you your

1302
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,400
present if you've been a good kid i'm

1303
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:57,679
like i think i was a good kid

1304
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,680
like but you don't even remember a year

1305
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,279
of your life when you're four uh you

1306
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,879
remember like you remember those moments

1307
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,200
yeah and then i woke up and there was a

1308
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,880
present in my pillow and i'm i was it

1309
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,199
just blew my mind and

1310
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,960
that building is still there 1461 sure

1311
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:12,559
parkway in brooklyn so

1312
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,440
um

1313
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:17,519
and it it's just all so funny like uh

1314
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,838
what i really like about kids you know

1315
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:22,318
being an uncle now is kid logic

1316
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:24,960
because there have very little bit of

1317
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,719
data but they're using logic to make

1318
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,559
sense of it and sometimes it gives them

1319
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,318
to the completely wrong conclusions for

1320
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,599
the completely right reasons

1321
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:32,880
i remember

1322
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,880
you know i

1323
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,960
my bedroom as a kid was right off the

1324
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,400
kitchen and i'd be scared in the dark a

1325
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,318
little bit so they'd leave the light on

1326
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,358
the kitchen while i went to sleep

1327
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:43,599
and

1328
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:44,960
at the same time my parents had told me

1329
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,280
you don't leave the lights on the house

1330
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,679
it costs money waste electricity right

1331
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,359
so i would be worried because i'm like

1332
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,440
oh my god my parents leave the lights on

1333
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:55,440
the kitchen all night

1334
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,960
and now it's costing them so much money

1335
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,159
not realizing that you know five minutes

1336
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,000
after i'm out obviously they're turning

1337
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,078
the lights off but like in my kid logic

1338
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,880
this was a concern of mine

1339
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,800
yeah and memories work that same way i

1340
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,880
have a collection of memories that are

1341
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,720
stitched together logically somehow but

1342
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,559
they they also don't really make sense

1343
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,559
there's a there's a few defining things

1344
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,239
so i grew up in in russia and

1345
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:20,559
experienced a lot of

1346
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:22,159
new years in russia there's a there's a

1347
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:25,358
a lot of incredible things about that

1348
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,519
tradition that just warms my heart

1349
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:28,239
so one as a kid you mentioned these kind

1350
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,559
of

1351
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:33,358
stories that's the one night of the year

1352
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,838
that kids are allowed to be adults

1353
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:37,358
in the following way like you in in in

1354
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:38,880
kid logic

1355
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,519
you're allowed to stay up all night oh

1356
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,280
yeah okay that was uh as late as you

1357
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,838
want which actually ends up being you're

1358
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,160
not used to it

1359
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,559
you crash but no you get to

1360
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:53,279
uh you know two three four at night you

1361
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,799
stay up and when you get to witness

1362
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,560
it's almost like alice in wonderland

1363
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,640
goes into this world

1364
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,039
you get to witness what is the adult

1365
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,838
world really like now obviously it's not

1366
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:07,358
an actual adult world

1367
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:09,039
merriment like like laughing fighting

1368
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:12,480
arguing but also

1369
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,279
like in in our case like singing and

1370
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,358
uh

1371
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,000
like yeah arguing like philosophical

1372
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,279
stuff but also like um

1373
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,079
if i may

1374
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,519
how would i describe it

1375
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,920
this is also probably a little bit

1376
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,358
russian culture but like flirtation in

1377
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,680
all of its forms

1378
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,440
meaning like men and women just being

1379
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,759
like because they dress up yeah yeah

1380
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,240
it's like it's uh it's joy it's like you

1381
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,640
get to show off like

1382
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:41,118
dresses whatever you got you show it off

1383
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,559
this is fun and then um

1384
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,358
men too just

1385
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,279
like friends laughing and like arguing

1386
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,039
just showing off the best they got with

1387
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,920
delicious food obviously that there's a

1388
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:54,239
thanksgiving element there yeah

1389
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,480
where there's just so many just you

1390
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,759
bring out all the traditional stuff

1391
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,480
uh the the avs salad just everything

1392
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,079
just

1393
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,760
the full thing with the desserts and

1394
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:09,359
obviously the vodka a lot of vodka and

1395
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,440
at the time so this is the soviet union

1396
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:13,279
like the biggest stuff and this is so

1397
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,480
sad that these are the things i remember

1398
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,400
is like

1399
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,280
uh coca-cola oh yeah like american like

1400
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,440
that

1401
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,480
uh i'll probably kill somebody for dr

1402
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,960
pepper

1403
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,119
it's so fascinating that um

1404
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,280
you take it for granted sort of the

1405
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,599
results of capitalist

1406
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,800
society with the material things that

1407
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,760
are created

1408
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,559
but that was the ultimate

1409
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,400
happiness is to experience this new

1410
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,240
thing sugar

1411
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,639
i don't know um you know there's like

1412
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,719
there's scarcity there's like communist

1413
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,199
czech republic

1414
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,799
so basically they try to rip off coke

1415
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,159
yeah and it's just like

1416
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,359
it's like they just threw whatever they

1417
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:55,679
could together

1418
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,960
and it was a very poor knockoff as you

1419
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,318
can imagine i forget what it's called

1420
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,760
and all the czech people right now are

1421
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,159
getting very angry at me because i can't

1422
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,599
think of it but they have it now

1423
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:07,519
and the slogan is good or weird

1424
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,680
so it's like this so they kind of

1425
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:10,960
reclaimed this kind of hipster soda yeah

1426
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,639
oh that's awesome it's almost like a

1427
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,318
parody right yeah but i think the

1428
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,159
thing i really remember is the

1429
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:19,599
camaraderie

1430
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,199
like the

1431
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,599
love for each other

1432
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,879
and neighbors too

1433
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,480
like um

1434
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,559
like you and i are neighbors now we

1435
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,240
don't see each other that often

1436
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,119
i hope that changes but a lot of it is

1437
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:34,639
also me i'm just a deep introvert

1438
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,160
you're also the hardest working person i

1439
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:40,719
know yeah so it's time but you know

1440
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:43,598
like it's not like i'll go in the middle

1441
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:45,838
of the night at like 4 a.m and go to

1442
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:48,160
7-eleven just sit there

1443
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,719
sipping a slurpee for an hour thinking

1444
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,318
about life so it's not like i'm

1445
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,598
always working

1446
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:55,119
yeah i don't know what i mean is like

1447
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,960
you get to meet your neighbors and you

1448
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,119
get to experience their

1449
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,760
uh their highs and their lows and you

1450
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,160
get to [ __ ] about life about government

1451
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,440
about corruption about the unfairness of

1452
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:07,199
life together

1453
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,519
well it's also i think what people don't

1454
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:11,759
appreciate as americans is it's very

1455
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:14,239
rare and russia to have a safe space

1456
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,640
yeah so you know that

1457
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,318
that january 1st no one's going to

1458
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,639
snitch on you you know they're not going

1459
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:23,279
to be informants probably so you can

1460
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:25,519
vent and and you know that's the thing

1461
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,960
with people in totalitarian countries

1462
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:28,880
you have to have the public facing

1463
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,559
persona and then behind closed doors is

1464
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,318
very different it all comes out and i

1465
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,960
also remember the arguments and i've

1466
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:38,480
i've been uh going on um

1467
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,480
clubhouse recently into russian rooms

1468
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,000
well just to practice russian

1469
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,079
and uh they it's so beautiful to watch i

1470
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,480
mean clubhouse is a very specific

1471
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,480
collection of russian people maybe it's

1472
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,838
a little bit political

1473
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,400
but and they're a little bit older

1474
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:59,519
and it's interesting to watch how much

1475
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,400
they love to argue

1476
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,199
yeah and so like it will be literally

1477
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,639
um

1478
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:06,719
it's you could think of it as a

1479
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:09,358
nonlinear dynamical system okay from an

1480
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,239
engineering perspective

1481
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,039
it

1482
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,479
whenever any positive topic comes up

1483
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,318
it's you could you could feel the

1484
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,119
skepticism and then wait a minute this

1485
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,558
is not good and they'll start like uh

1486
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,000
perturbing it

1487
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,640
until you're like

1488
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,719
uh they'll find some way to say like

1489
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,239
come on now that is the dumbest thing

1490
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,159
i've ever heard and then it goes back

1491
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:31,199
into argument it's so fun to watch

1492
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:33,039
because

1493
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,239
uh in one sense you could see it as

1494
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:36,400
negative

1495
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:39,439
in another you could see it as free to

1496
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,200
express yourself because

1497
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,159
it feels like you can solve a lot of

1498
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:45,919
problems by allowing yourself to just uh

1499
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,000
be emotional and

1500
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,760
both both emotional and say hard truth

1501
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,519
and all those kinds of things without

1502
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,200
like um

1503
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:55,838
without patting yourself on the back

1504
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:58,960
about it uh but also

1505
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:00,960
it just sort of those russian rooms

1506
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,000
make me realize how constrained american

1507
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,159
speech is

1508
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,760
how careful people are in the way they

1509
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:08,078
express it even the michael mouses in

1510
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,880
the world you're you're constantly being

1511
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:13,359
like nuanced

1512
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,880
there they just say crazy [ __ ] oh yeah

1513
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:16,239
and then they correct themselves and

1514
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,960
make fun of themselves and they

1515
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:22,239
completely shift opinions a minute later

1516
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,159
and it's it's chaos yeah and is i mean

1517
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:26,639
it's it's beautiful so i i love that

1518
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,960
that culture is it's funny given

1519
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,639
the current regime in russia like how

1520
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,800
that's coupled with

1521
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,358
how people are talking and

1522
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,400
um yeah i don't know and i have those

1523
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:40,318
memories of childhood of of friends that

1524
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,960
i had of just having that true freedom

1525
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:43,279
of

1526
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,599
talking and somehow that leads to uh

1527
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,880
deep bonds together

1528
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,760
when the life when you're poor when life

1529
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,000
is

1530
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,680
has a lot of elements that are unfair

1531
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,920
when the government is corrupt there's

1532
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,759
sort of it's just um especially in the

1533
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,680
soviet union there's uncertainty about

1534
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,240
the future all of it you just get closer

1535
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:04,078
together like penguins huddling together

1536
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:05,439
in the cold like that much of the

1537
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,280
penguins movie

1538
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,159
that i don't know uh the the friends

1539
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,400
i've gotten there

1540
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:12,399
like

1541
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,679
i get

1542
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,040
emotional every time i kind of

1543
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:19,519
think about those friends because it was

1544
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,679
so close that friendship was so [ __ ]

1545
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,000
but i just really hate the the russian

1546
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,759
cynicism i know you do and i actually

1547
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,760
disagree with you about it

1548
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,440
you see it as cynicism

1549
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,000
i see it as um

1550
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,318
waves on top of the water like surface

1551
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,920
cynicism and the depths as i see the

1552
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:40,000
beauty of the russian soul so we like

1553
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,519
yes that cynicism can negatively affect

1554
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,519
a lot of people like you i think you've

1555
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:47,440
talked about like as a parent like

1556
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:48,559
being cynical about the world and then

1557
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,159
you have

1558
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,240
dire negative consequences on your

1559
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,159
children they become cynical they don't

1560
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,639
ever take big risks to take on both

1561
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:58,879
things and i have those arguments

1562
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:01,679
um because the cynicism is exhausting

1563
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,559
it's destructive yes and anti

1564
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,919
creative but so in in their perspective

1565
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:09,359
is this is what the russian folks would

1566
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,920
say well yes that's our role like

1567
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:13,838
being cynical is being reasonable about

1568
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,639
the world it's not it's completely

1569
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:19,279
unreasonable it's a complete lie i know

1570
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:21,279
but their argument is yes but

1571
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,519
we're we're giving you this force and

1572
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,880
it's your job to resist against it

1573
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:28,239
so it's a test i love the idea that if

1574
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,599
you're going to be creative and

1575
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:31,919
innovative you don't have enough up

1576
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,440
against you yeah exactly this is exactly

1577
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,800
oh i don't know it's not hard enough

1578
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,400
already that i want to be an author now

1579
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,640
you got to be like well what let me just

1580
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,440
put some fire ants on top of it

1581
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:44,239
so i i just want to separate i agree

1582
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,519
with you that the cynicism is is bad and

1583
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:46,318
destructive

1584
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:49,119
but

1585
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,880
the idea that life is suffering

1586
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,200
and

1587
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,039
thinking from that as a first principle

1588
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:56,639
i think there's a lot of beauty to be

1589
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:00,480
discovered through that so there's a

1590
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:01,519
cynicism and then there's a horrible

1591
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,838
message

1592
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,039
uh life is suffering

1593
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,599
no not

1594
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:11,039
well yeah i mean kamu

1595
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:13,200
kamu doesn't think that

1596
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,639
now we're going into uh definitions of

1597
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,558
suffering then

1598
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,639
because absurd

1599
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,400
what see life is absurd is life is

1600
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:22,000
suffering or not even close to the same

1601
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,358
concept well then you're just defining

1602
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,960
the terms differently well that's

1603
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,199
because they're different terms yeah

1604
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,800
well so is love and beauty but like so

1605
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:30,558
let's define okay wait you're selling if

1606
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,240
your baby's in the crib like with a

1607
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,920
fever you're like oh that's absurd no

1608
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:36,959
it's the kid's suffering it's not the

1609
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,639
same so yes starvation see you've been

1610
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,519
for white pill researching a lot of

1611
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,358
actual specifically defined suffering

1612
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,280
sure but also a lot of

1613
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:48,000
wonderful things

1614
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,000
right yeah yeah but the the word

1615
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,039
suffering can encompass more than just

1616
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,239
specifically starving and

1617
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,920
it could

1618
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,358
it can encompass like a lot of the

1619
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,960
philosophers

1620
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,480
uh talk about it encompass like

1621
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,440
philosophical suffering the fact that

1622
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,318
there is

1623
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,400
if if you're not careful life was can

1624
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:09,519
appear meaningless you can fall into a

1625
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,599
nihilistic view like it it's it's it's

1626
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:13,920
difficult to have the responsibility of

1627
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,838
freedom to act in this world because you

1628
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,039
can [ __ ] up in so many different ways

1629
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,759
and then

1630
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,920
life is seemingly unfair

1631
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,680
in this in the sense that

1632
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,838
good things happen

1633
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:28,000
for no apparent reason and terrible

1634
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:29,279
things happen

1635
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,760
like what you know it's the old

1636
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,920
religious question of why does evil

1637
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,119
uh happen in the world or what why do

1638
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,240
terrible things happen in the world

1639
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,640
there's this book called six word

1640
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:41,039
memoirs right where all these different

1641
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:43,039
personalities are awesome were you in it

1642
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,639
no i'm in it with so you had to

1643
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,679
basically write your autobiography in

1644
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,519
six words

1645
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,759
and mine was good things happen to bad

1646
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,679
people

1647
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,880
you see there you go there's humor yes

1648
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:54,159
that's your way of dealing with the

1649
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,680
suffering but i don't think life is

1650
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:57,358
inherent if life was suffering we

1651
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:58,399
wouldn't be able to have

1652
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,318
happiness

1653
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,480
no out of suffering

1654
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:04,318
happiness is born so like it's it's the

1655
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,280
ups and downs of life and what it means

1656
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:08,880
like

1657
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,119
i don't this i just i don't agree at all

1658
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,280
that you need to suffer in order to be

1659
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,039
happy i agree you have to work hard but

1660
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,640
that's not the same thing

1661
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,079
yeah all right so the way i'm using

1662
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,920
suffering i think a lot of them use

1663
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,400
suffering is the way you use

1664
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,400
like gravity so in order for the roller

1665
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,480
coaster to work you need gravity

1666
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,599
there needs to be a force that bring you

1667
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,480
down sure in that same way there's

1668
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,680
like

1669
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:37,039
you have to resist the natural

1670
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:38,399
pull of nature that wants to

1671
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,279
destroy you

1672
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,119
no nature wants you

1673
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,280
to nature's indifferent

1674
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,519
but we have the capacity

1675
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,200
because we're blessed with minds and

1676
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:51,838
we're blessed with friends yeah to

1677
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:54,078
transcend yes nature yeah no i know but

1678
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:58,558
i think it's a it's a word

1679
00:56:54,079 --> 00:57:00,480
that captures something about life

1680
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,359
that there's no reason to it that is

1681
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,679
absurd i think to me oftentimes the way

1682
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:07,920
i think about the word suffering is

1683
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:11,118
synonymous with absurdity

1684
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,119
this is not suffering

1685
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:14,239
but this is absurd i just noticed

1686
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,960
there's a box

1687
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,959
with the big bow on it next to you

1688
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,480
what's in the box michael it's your

1689
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,720
present so it's your present for new

1690
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,719
year's uh can we open it yeah sure

1691
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,480
what's in the box it's gonna take and

1692
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,440
you brought up suffering this is gonna

1693
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,760
be very unpleasant here you go

1694
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,880
i packed it myself

1695
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:40,880
yeah there's a whole process in there

1696
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,480
so there's three presents in there

1697
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,000
lex

1698
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,000
i'll read the card first okay

1699
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:53,279
something about opening presents

1700
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:55,280
like tearing stuff

1701
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,960
makes me feel like because like i just

1702
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,280
tore this sheet of paper yeah so it'll

1703
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,000
never be the same again

1704
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,519
it's entropy it's entropy times

1705
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,519
you've got a powerful voice

1706
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:09,838

1709
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:16,480
card first

1710
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,400
you've got a powerful voice listening to

1711
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,159
what you have to say always puts me in a

1712
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,039
hopeful place i feel like this is

1713
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,879
building up to something you show me how

1714
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:27,199
change can happen when you face the

1715
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,240
world with pride confidence and a voice

1716
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:33,358
that can't be silenced keep speaking up

1717
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:35,598
the world is listening yeah

1718
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:37,279
there's no cynicism in this card no this

1719
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,119
is about this is new year's this is all

1720
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,440
about helping joy

1721
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:44,240

thank you brother my pleasure

1731
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,119
let's get to the present

1732
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,679
okay

1733
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,838
it's a it's a pc box

1734
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:18,000
this is very promising

1735
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:19,279
it better not be sex toys there's

1736
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,639
nothing this is all there's nothing

1737
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,240
inappropriate

1738
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,400
at all why would it

1739
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,838
why would sex toys be inappropriate

1740
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,639
because you're sex positive because

1741
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:28,639
you're a virgin

1742
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,838
yeah bring a knife to a party

1743
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:41,279
how clever is it to put it in a pc box

1744
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:43,279
well i had it i just got a new pc

1745
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,839

[Laughter]

wrenches

1790
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,319
okay so let me tell you the story behind

1791
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:42,318
that

1792
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:43,599
toy

1793
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:47,038
tonka

1794
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:49,039
robots that turn into vehicles so when

1795
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,200
you there when i was a kid

1796
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:53,280
you had transformers

1797
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,519
but for us poor people

1798
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,519
you had gobots right

1799
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:58,880
so the gobots there were four main

1800
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:02,318
characters for the good guys it was

1801
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,318
leader one small foot turbo and scooter

1802
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:05,920
and what was annoying is when you had

1803
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:07,358
the action figures

1804
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,039
you couldn't find the ones that were on

1805
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:11,440
the tv show

1806
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:13,680
and i was a big gobots fan as a kid

1807
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,119
and i went once to the toys r us

1808
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:17,279
in caesars bay in brooklyn with my

1809
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,640
grandfather my grandfather was always

1810
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,559
very lucky like just good things

1811
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,719
happened to him every so often

1812
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,559
and i went there i remember very vividly

1813
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,639
they must have just unpacked

1814
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,079
just loaded the shelves and how they had

1815
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:29,199
the shelving it would be like like a

1816
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,359
grid you know you'd have like it was

1817
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:35,038
like one two three four five

1818
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:36,880
five rows and like uh five by five

1819
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,559
and i remember it was like two up and

1820
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,798
then you have to do you have to sit by

1821
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,559
the side and kind of sort through them

1822
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:43,838
and with the gobots each package had a

1823
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,760
picture of the different figures so the

1824
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:47,759
packaging wasn't uniform and they just

1825
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,960
had scooter there she was just sitting

1826
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,559
there and i was like holy crap so

1827
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,519
that feeling

1828
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,798
when you're a kid and you find that

1829
01:03:55,519 --> 01:03:58,798
just sitting on the shelf it is right

1830
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,880
there it's just it was such this was

1831
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:02,880
this that scooter no i have it though

1832
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,079
but that one is for you i thought you if

1833
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,240
you want to put it next to your other

1834
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:09,280
robots yeah open it up i can open it up

1835
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:11,118
yeah yeah it's for you and that way uh

1836
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,079
it's that symbol of joy when you have

1837
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:14,160
when you're a kid when you find

1838
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:16,000
something you really want i think it

1839
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:17,519
just is really like so when people look

1840
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,358
at it they'll be like

1841
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:21,358
don't be hopeless i'll open this

1842
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:23,199
carefully later no do it just yeah i

1843
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:24,960
should do it yeah okay there's no way to

1844
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:26,480
open it carefully

1845
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,639
kids don't open stuff carefully you rip

1846
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,719
that crap open but then you break it and

1847
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:33,838
you cry that's what happens when you're

1848
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:35,838
kid i never did that okay

1849
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:39,239
me neither i never cried but never got

1850
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,239

01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:02,239
i think there's instructions on the back

1857
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:04,078
how to transform her

1858
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:06,078
to her i only found out as an adult that

1859
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:09,839
it was supposed to be a girl yeah

1860
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,839

the thing is these are easy to break i

1873
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:35,119
remember

1874
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,318

1875
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:39,838

yep so that's that

1879
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:49,440
the arm scout

1880
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:51,920
i'm having visions of like baby michael

1883
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,960

1884
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,959
oh

1885
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,079
all right

1886
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:04,239
i'm gonna follow the instructions in a

1887
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:07,519
bit and i'll leave yeah i'll leave this

1888
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:09,358
failed project of yours

1889
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:10,159
oh there's a wheel out

1890
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:13,598
look

1891
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:14,399
i don't like this in between form

1892
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:17,200
well

1893
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,720
this is how it's gonna be okay

1894
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,239
because we're going to be accepting of

1895
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:22,798
the transformation

1896
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:25,919
that takes time okay

1897
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:25,920
i got uh

1898
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,798
i saw this

1899
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,280
oh it's this little thing when i was

1900
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:35,199
walking on congress and it says resist

1901
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,960
it's a bracelet it made me think of you

1902
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,399
the reason i got it is because there's

1903
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,358
two bracelets

1904
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,358
so one said lucky [ __ ]

1905
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:45,679
and the other one said resist

1906
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:47,759
now i first saw resist and i'm like and

1907
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:52,239
then i saw the lucky [ __ ] and i realized

1908
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:54,400
i'm a lucky [ __ ] to find a relevant

1909
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:56,479
it makes me think of you this is very

1910
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,039
nice resist the powerful

1911
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,039
that's true

1912
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,440
i saw this somewhere the

1913
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:04,798
oh yeah yeah yeah

1914
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,838
um

1915
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:07,838
this has to do with

1916
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:12,798
in terms of resist you often bring up

1917
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:15,519
the book uh machiavellians by james

1918
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:17,759
burnham and

1919
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:19,599
uh so as i was looking through i was

1920
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,760
reading different parts it's it's tricky

1921
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:24,880
read it's a little bit

1922
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:27,119
uh but there there is a ebook kindle

1923
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,318
version now that i've been um working

1924
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:30,720
through this i think there's an actual

1925
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:33,119
audiobook too anyway yeah i just bought

1926
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:35,358
some the machiavellians is is james

1927
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,200
burnham's analysis of four

1928
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:39,358
uh thinkers that he regards as the

1929
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:43,759
machiavellians who's guytana moscow

1930
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:48,318
filfredo paredo george sorelle and

1931
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:50,240
i'm blanking on the moscow pareto sorel

1932
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:54,558
and george michelle and i just got

1933
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:54,558
pareto's autograph in the mail this week

1934
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,480
so he he talks about freedom and liberty

1935
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,318
this is the interesting

1936
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,240
um line

1937
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:06,400
that i'd like to get your opinion on in

1938
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:09,038
terms of resist in terms of liberty

1939
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,039
there's no one force it goes quote

1940
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,680
there's no one force no group and no

1941
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,839
class that is the preserver of liberty

1942
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:19,679
liberty is preserved by those who are

1943
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:22,079
against the existing chief power

1944
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,880
oppositions which do not express genuine

1945
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:27,359
social forces are as trivial in relation

1946
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,880
to entrenched power as the old chord

1947
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,759
gestures

1948
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,838
so

1949
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,279
i mean the question here is can

1950
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:36,000
liberty is

1951
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:39,600
are you comfortable with that definition

1952
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,920
or that view of liberty of freedom

1953
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,759
that it at its highest ideal is

1954
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,920
expressed through the resistance to the

1955
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:48,238
powerful as opposed to existing in its

1956
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,719
own i think his point

1957
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:53,919
broadly speaking which i agree with

1958
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:56,798
is the only thing that can work to

1959
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:59,838
mitigate power is other power

1960
01:08:56,798 --> 01:08:59,838
that it's um

1961
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,399
uh talk is cheap

1962
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,519
and persuasion it has very limited

1963
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,879
efficacy

1964
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,960
it's like

1965
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,960
if there's a burglar right and one

1966
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,158
person will give you a speech about

1967
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,158
property rights and you shouldn't be in

1968
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:15,519
this person's house and the other person

1969
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:17,519
has a gun

1970
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,839
you know it's it's clear which is

1971
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,839
going to be more

1972
01:09:18,838 --> 01:09:23,278
persuasive yeah but can't you just be

1973
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:25,759
free without

1974
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:26,480
the struggle without this conflict i

1975
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:28,880
mean

1976
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:32,879
what i'm uncomfortable with this view

1977
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:35,039
is how closely it uh links

1978
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,920
freedom and conflict

1979
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:40,560
like why does this world have to have

1980
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,560
conflict for you to be free can't i mean

1981
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,920
it's uh and part of it is just emphasis

1982
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,400
are you just saying suffering is what

1983
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,079
leads to joy

1984
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:49,920
see and now you're in agreement thank

1985
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,399
you that's i just did that just so you

1986
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,000
can come around and agree i win

1987
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:56,158
next topic

1988
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,158
one

1989
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,960
wow i'm playing 3d

1990
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:03,519
chess here

1991
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,760
okay

1992
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,080

this is this is now december 31st i

1994
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:12,719
think that's how it works but in 1973

1995
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,480
okay actually we recorded this before

1996
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,119

1997
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:18,158
oh no um years after you're born 60 you

1998
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:20,719

and all of it the whole thing like what

2017
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,600
what stands out to you about 2021 uh the

2018

fact that for the first time in my life

01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,360
part of me that regrets it or misses new

2022
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,080
york

2023
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,519
so that was a very big deal for me what

2024
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:22,319
do you uh

2025
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:25,440
about this move about austin itself but

2026
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:28,000
maybe the move itself

2027
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,519
maybe just the act of moving what what

2028
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,198
um

2029
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,480
what's great about it to you

2030
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:36,238
the fact that i had forgotten what it's

2031
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:38,319
like to have a huge

2032
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:40,319
social network which i had in new york

2033
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,639
before people started falling away and

2034
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,960
then it really escalated as a result of

2035
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,199
de blasio and the coveted restrictions

2036
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,760
so to have a big crew here

2037
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:52,000
um is something that was very

2038
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,760
validating the thing that's also

2039
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
exciting about austin

2040
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,239
is that boston isn't a particularly big

2041
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,238
town it's not particular great town but

2042
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:02,479
everyone here at least in the circles i

2043
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:04,718
travel in is kind of a refugee from

2044
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:06,399
their towns so there is this sense of

2045
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:08,640
camaraderie there is the sense of we're

2046
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:10,399
building something together back in new

2047
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,920
york when you meet someone

2048
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:13,759
it would be like who is this person why

2049
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,840
am i talking to them like are they a

2050
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,039
normie are they going to be weird and

2051
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,319
here there's

2052
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:20,399
very little of that i think there's much

2053
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:21,599
more sense of trust with one another

2054
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:23,599
when you meet new people so that's

2055
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,199
something that's really exciting about

2056
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,239
um like i've been introducing all my

2057
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:28,079
friends to each other and everyone's

2058
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:30,158
been hitting it off like gangbusters

2059
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:31,039
it's really great so i really enjoy that

2060
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:33,599
about

2061
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:35,359
um austin i'm enjoying you know the

2062
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,239
weather the space

2063
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:39,439
uh you ready kerouac any of this stuff i

2064
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:41,439
have on the road i read and i read a

2065
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:42,799
biography of him

2066
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:45,119
i don't know if it was on i think it was

2067
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:48,159
on the road uh where he

2068
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:50,319
he talks about that feeling when um you

2069
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:52,719
go into some place you're leaving a

2070
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:54,960
place and you're going somewhere else

2071
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:57,439
and the place you're leaving disappears

2072
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,079
behind you yeah and all the people and

2073
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:00,158
all

2074
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:02,000
like that you just think about that life

2075
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:05,920
and it's forever gone and there's some

2076
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,520
inkling of that where

2077
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:11,520
you get to realize you're almost

2078
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:12,880
mortality because okay that's a chapter

2079
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,400
and there's not many more and it was a

2080
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,560
beautiful chapter

2081
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,559
but now on to the next chapter is there

2082
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,920
a melancholy feeling there no it's the

2083
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,600
opposite i feel like i've been given a

2084
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,199
new lease on life because i didn't

2085
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,280
realize to what extent there was this

2086
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:27,678
subtext of hopelessness in new york and

2087
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:29,119
also people who in new york you don't

2088
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:30,399
appreciate or you appreciate it

2089
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:32,800
consciously but you can't escape it

2090
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:35,359
emotionally how much the winters get to

2091
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,039
you psychologically uh it's it's tough

2092
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:38,639
it gets dark so early it gets cold you

2093
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:40,079
can't walk around like that's the thing

2094
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,520
that's fun about or what's fun about new

2095
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:43,279
york is that you know when the weather's

2096
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,880
warm you could walk for an hour and just

2097
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:46,880
enjoy the sunshine and there's a lot to

2098
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,199
see and do but in the winter you don't

2099
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,560
have any of that it's it's brutal and

2100
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:51,839
here it's just

2101
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,840
so that is something there's no

2102
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,239
melancholy at all

2103
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,079
well that's because there's

2104
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:00,399
can we say something beautiful about new

2105
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:01,119
york not the way it is now but the way

2106
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:02,719
it

2107
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:04,079
i could go on for days about how great

2108
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,520
new york was

2109
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:07,679
what did you learn about human

2110
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:10,159
civilization just life that was

2111
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:14,640
beautiful from new york

2112
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:15,519
i learned that there's a lot

2113
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,640
of

2114
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,120
really

2115
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:21,520
unique special people out there

2116
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,198
who are doing their little part to move

2117
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,080
the envelope and make the world a better

2118
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:26,839
place

2119
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:28,880
and that when you have

2120
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,719
a city

2121
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,000
where they're all there together at the

2122
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,600
same time

2123
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
then that really moves the world and i'm

2124
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,520
thinking of paris in the 20s in harlem

2125
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,238
in the 20s and

2126
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,159
new york in the 70s and

2127
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:44,479
la in the late 60s and san francisco

2128
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:46,238
especially in late 60s things like this

2129
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:48,238
uh they really punch above detroit

2130
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:50,879
certainly at its heyday they punch above

2131
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:54,158
their weight and and just really kind of

2132
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,760
philadelphia in 17 1700s things really

2133
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:56,960
start happening and that ripples

2134
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,920
throughout the world

2135
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:02,719
you think austin has a chance to be a

2136
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,000
paris that's in some way yes because

2137
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,920
again it wasn't

2138
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,920
all of paris it was the left bank of

2139
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,399
paris and gertrude stein and hemingway

2140
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,440
and all them in a little area so

2141
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:14,079
you know when you read these history

2142
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:16,158
books these scenes it's like 50 people

2143
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:17,359
like in a 10 block radius these aren't

2144
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:20,319
these huge

2145
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:23,198
like davos conventions

2146
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:25,359
okay so the move the big move yeah what

2147
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:28,639
else what else stands out to you again

2148
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:30,799
all both personally and socially like

2149
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,560
zooming in and zooming out i did a book

2150
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:35,279
with the ufc fighter

2151
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,360
and i was making the point uh he was a

2152
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:39,599
nine-time world champion that i would

2153
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:41,599
never be as good at my job as he was at

2154
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,840
his yeah and then when i dropped

2155
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,199
anarchist handbook in may and it was the

2156
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,360
top

2157
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:48,799
non-fiction book on amazon for like most

2158
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:50,719
of the day

2159
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,800
like oh i'm the top nonfiction writer in

2160
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,800
america just for today i was like oh

2161
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,199
crap okay so i guess i was wrong that

2162
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,679
that was a major deal i was i was still

2163
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:01,759
shocked and delighted by the way

2164
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:04,239
congratulations i'm

2165
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,280
truly happy for you man it well it's i'm

2166
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:06,799
so proud

2167
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:08,559
but it's also

2168
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,560
i i'm proud

2169
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:13,199
because these are people

2170
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:15,600
who had points of view

2171
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:17,198
and they didn't have it easy

2172
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,719
and they fought for what they believed

2173
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:22,799
in and in so far as i get to

2174
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,640
rescue them to some extent from the

2175
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,079
dustbin of history and say these people

2176
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,440
really mattered and they really are

2177
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:30,719
worth hearing i i i that i love i love

2178
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:32,879
stuff like that

2179
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:36,079
um you know i was talking a friend of

2180
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,760
mine topher uh like a year ago

2181
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:39,600
and because we're in a weird position

2182
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,960
with what kind of jobs we have

2183
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,320
so like i'll be talking in my live

2184
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,760
streams about people like candy darling

2185
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:44,960
or wallace thurman

2186
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,400
and

2187
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,119
like these are not household names at

2188
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:48,799
all

2189
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:50,800
and then i'd be like proud of myself

2190
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,679
that i'm the one who brings them to some

2191
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,520
sort of

2192
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:55,119
more prominence and then you want to

2193
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,480
tell yourself well get over yourself who

2194
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:57,760
you think you are but it's like but no

2195
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:01,039
one else is talking about these people

2196
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:03,520
or very few so to be able to kind of

2197
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:05,600
give them some kind of stature and

2198
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,520
platform that they deserve i think is i

2199
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,280
i love being able to do that so you have

2200
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,080
a strong voice yourself

2201
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:12,079
and

2202
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:14,840
to sort of join them in it's like john

2203
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:16,880
lennon joining in with the beatles

2204
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,840
as like a

2205
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:21,119
a chorus of very different views on

2206
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,360
anarchism

2207
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:25,359
just it's celebrating the individuals

2208
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,119
it's celebrating the idea

2209
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:29,599
and you are

2210
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:31,439
i think will be remembered as a

2211
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,440
a powerful philosophy yourself but like

2212
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,678
you're almost taking

2213
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:38,000
just the humility of being in a room

2214
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:40,560
with powerful minds together in one book

2215
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,238
it's cool yeah and that these people

2216
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,719
mattered and they had a unique

2217
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:46,238
perspective um and as i said in the

2218
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:47,679
introduction to the book i remember i

2219
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:49,839
was in college and

2220
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:50,480
we were studying bioethics and there was

2221
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,239
a

2222
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:54,718
like a graph in the book

2223
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:56,639
and one part says antinomianism which

2224
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:59,600
was the view that at one side said

2225
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:01,840
legalism right the two extremes legalism

2226
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,360
is what is legal is defined by the

2227
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,840
government or what is moral is defined

2228
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,439
by government and once said anthonyism

2229
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,520
which is nothing

2230
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:10,799
stands above moral law and then there

2231
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,760
was like well since no one believes in

2232
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,360
this the answer is something to the

2233
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,719
other side it's like well why is it in

2234
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:17,359
the charge normally if it has a name

2235
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:19,119
someone believes in it you know so

2236
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:21,920
you know anarchism is a word that's

2237
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:23,439
bandied about and in a dismissive way

2238
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,800
and it's like you don't have to like me

2239
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:26,960
or agree with what i'm saying but you

2240
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,000
can't pretend that they weren't tolstoy

2241
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,359
you're going to tell me tolstoy doesn't

2242
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,760
know what he's talking about completely

2243
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:32,880
he's in there uh he was an anarchist so

2244
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,199
um

2245
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,440
it was it was a big accomplishment

2246
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:39,039
it was really cool to get a chance to

2247
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:40,879
do the audiobook

2248
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:42,719
for you you did an incredible thing

2249
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,760
which is got a bunch of really cool

2250
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,079
people

2251
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,840
uh to read a lot of interesting varied

2252
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:49,519
people yeah so what i did for the

2253
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,199
audiobook which i

2254
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,800
it's i don't like the idea that hard

2255
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:54,719
work is inherently good because

2256
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,560
sometimes being lazy is actually the

2257
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,960
right choice yeah so i'm like wait a

2258
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,640
minute why am i reading all 23 chapters

2259
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,119
when it's 23 different authors does it

2260
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:05,280
make sense so i hit my rolodex and i had

2261
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:07,519
different people read different chapters

2262
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:08,719
to make it sound literally

2263
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,800
like you have

2264
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:12,399
the different voices in the book thank

2265
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,679
you very much you did my because i was

2266
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:14,639
going to read my chapter wait a minute

2267
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,000
like all the other authors are being

2268
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,039
voted by somebody else let's have lex

2269
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,439
read mine

2270
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:21,359
the one chapter i am

2271
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:24,238
most moved by

2272
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:26,639
is i d uh lauren chen she's a podcaster

2273
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:28,479
as well she's expecting now so we wish

2274
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:31,280
nothing but the best for lauren and liam

2275
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:32,718
and the baby um there's a chapter there

2276
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:34,639
by this guy named charles robert

2277
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:37,279
plunkett called dynamite

2278
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:39,039
and he's advocating for

2279
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:40,479
making bombs and killing people uh

2280
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:41,920
killing you know the forces of

2281
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:42,879
capitalism

2282
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,279
and

2283
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,640
emma goldman uh it was published in her

2284
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,399
essay while she was in lecture tour and

2285
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,360
she was just like why is this in here

2286
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:50,559
this is

2287
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:52,719
this is just really going to make us

2288
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,280
look bad so on and so forth

2289
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:57,600
and when you're dealing with any kind of

2290
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,920
you know h.l menken has that quote about

2291
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,280
every rational man must at times be

2292
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,440
tempted to

2293
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:05,359
spit on his hands hoist the black flag

2294
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:08,960
and begin slitting throats

2295
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:10,319
so i wanted to talk sound like the

2296
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,239
seductive

2297
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:13,359
aspect of violence like that's the

2298
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:14,879
problem like when you deal with

2299
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:16,960
terrorism when you're dealing with

2300
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,800
political violence

2301
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,719
to be able to understand how people can

2302
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,480
fall for this how people can be

2303
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,480
persuaded to think

2304
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:26,399
this is a good idea that i'm going to

2305
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:28,158
make some dynamite and throw it into

2306
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:29,839
this crowd and kill

2307
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:32,158
you know police officers and innocent

2308
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,560
people possibly in service about it you

2309
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:36,319
have to it's easy to say oh they're all

2310
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,280
crazy but they're not you know

2311
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:39,119
even

2312
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:40,399
not most people who are crazy don't do

2313
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:43,840
these things you know

2314
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:45,920
so to have a woman read that chapter and

2315
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:48,319
i told her kind of read it like a phone

2316
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,480
sex operator because i wanted to have

2317
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:51,679
that siren song of like so you can

2318
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:53,759
understand

2319
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:55,039
why this calls out to people who are in

2320
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,840
the rope the people who are like

2321
01:20:55,039 --> 01:21:00,319
marginalized and she did such a superb

2322
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,239
job with that chapter

2323
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:04,639
that's such a beautiful vision yeah

2324
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:06,559
because violence that's uh violence is

2325
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:07,760
part of human history

2326
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:11,360
uh

2327
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:12,639
to a degree that it must be seductive it

2328
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:14,479
must be

2329
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:17,119
there must be a strong pull like it's

2330
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:18,479
not insane people

2331
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:21,920
it's there's something probably deep

2332
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:23,279
within our nature that craves violence

2333
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,279
and then when there's charismatic

2334
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:26,079
leaders that inspire that

2335
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:28,880
and

2336
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:31,600
revolution

2337
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:33,600
plus violence that that i could see that

2338
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,440
being extremely seductive to us like

2339
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,360
when you're truly suffering in your

2340
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:38,799
current situation whatever is you're

2341
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:40,799
being oppressed by governments or being

2342
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:44,079
oppressed by the powerful

2343
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,079
violent revolution is

2344
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:48,079
probably there's something deep within

2345
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:49,759
us that belongs to that and also this

2346
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:52,158
kind of the julian maxwell to jeffrey

2347
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:54,719
epstein right you need that woman

2348
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:56,879
to be like no no this is okay honey yeah

2349
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,319
come along it's not a big deal don't

2350
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,119
listen to what your parents told you

2351
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:02,960
they're just prudes it's a siren song

2352
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:05,439
what do you uh what do you think about

2353
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,039
just laying maxwell into the trial and

2354
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:09,279
so on

2355
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:11,119
again maybe the interesting story there

2356
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:12,719
is

2357
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:15,439
about the coverage

2358
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,600
of the trial so like the story is more

2359
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:19,759
complex and interesting than the actual

2360
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:22,000
horrific acts themselves

2361
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,440
so to me i don't maybe i'm not

2362
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,359
knowledgeable enough

2363
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:29,519
but to me she's also truly evil

2364
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,839
i don't know where to

2365
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,679
maybe you can help me to figure out

2366
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,679
who is more evil

2367
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:37,359
the uh

2368
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,359
just like you said now the person says

2369
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:40,639
it's okay it's okay that uh

2370
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:43,039
helps

2371
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:44,880
the evil doer or is it the evildoer

2372
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:47,039
themselves i don't know but i think

2373
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,800
she's a she scares me more than jeffrey

2374
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:50,158
epstein somehow

2375
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,880
yeah there's people like that in the

2376
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:52,238
world

2377
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,800
like a twitter poll do you think it's

2378
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:56,718
more evil or less evil to kill someone

2379
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,159
because you've been paid to do it

2380
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:01,039
and

2381
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:02,719
and people the winning answer was more

2382
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:03,920
evil and i said it was

2383
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,000
less

2384
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,679
because i think in that case you can

2385
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,158
kind of check out you could be like this

2386
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:12,158
isn't my i'm just doing a job yeah i i

2387
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:14,238
don't you know you kind of can

2388
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:16,000
i think in a sense

2389
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:17,439
if you have a certain mindset like

2390
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,319
intellectual remove yourself from the

2391
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,919
situation i'm just a conduit uh when

2392
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,559
you're talking like i haven't been

2393
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:26,158
following her case that that much

2394
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:29,199
just because you mostly watched cnn and

2395
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:32,238
cena is not covering it well i think

2396
01:23:29,198 --> 01:23:33,759
my broader point would be

2397
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:35,519
people who are

2398
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,960
untouchable and who know they're

2399
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,080
untouchable

2400
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,279
do

2401
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:43,600
much worse things than those of us

2402
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:46,960
who aren't that way can appreciate like

2403
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,880
i'm i was just talking about on twitter

2404
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,520
about rosemary kennedy

2405
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:54,079
she was one of jfk's sisters

2406
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,480
it's not clear whether she was

2407
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:58,559
developmentally disabled or had

2408
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:00,839
like depressive mental illness there was

2409
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:04,400
something clearly off with her to some

2410
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:06,719
capacity and at age 23

2411
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:08,319
they gave her a lobotomy

2412
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,679
and the thing with the lobotomy is you

2413
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:11,039
have to be conscious

2414
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,239
you know they don't put you under so you

2415
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:14,319
have to be counting backwards while

2416
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:15,599
their scalpels in your brain and they

2417
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:17,039
stop but

2418
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,199
they stopped

2419
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:20,880
they did too far she became mentally

2420
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:22,238
like a two-year-old you know never had

2421
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,719
bladder control for the rest of her life

2422
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:27,039
couldn't really talk or walk

2423
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,520
and when that happened they

2424
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:31,039
just put her away to some home and they

2425
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,639
never mentioned her again or they didn't

2426
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:34,719
tell the brothers or sisters where she

2427
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:36,319
went the lobotomy was only revealed in

2428
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:38,960
1987

2429
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:41,279
um and they pretended oh she's uh you

2430
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:44,480
know in this home for kids with special

2431
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:47,439
needs and it's just like

2432
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,439
like that to me is very very scary

2433
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:51,198
that someone could you know do this to

2434
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:52,879
their that people are i saw people

2435
01:24:51,198 --> 01:24:55,279
respond like oh that was you know

2436
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:57,359
cutting edge technology at the time haha

2437
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:58,639
but i'm like i don't think that that was

2438
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:00,880
really

2439
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:02,560
uh done that that frequently or be

2440
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,000
hearing more about it all these you know

2441
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,760
botched lobotomies and my understanding

2442
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,158
is lobotomies are

2443
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:10,079
very hard to

2444
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:11,439
like you they would want to do something

2445
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:12,639
like a mass murderer or like like if

2446
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:14,799
someone's really bad like if the

2447
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:16,639
person's left an invalid like who cares

2448
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,480
kind of situation but you're dealing

2449
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,159
with something like this like

2450
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:21,678
she's not killing people she's not

2451
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:23,119
assaulting people

2452
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:26,480
she's just difficult because she's

2453
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:29,039
making your vaunted family look bad so

2454
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:30,559
um so that's to you that's what is it

2455
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:32,079
like psychopathy or something like that

2456
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,840
like you don't care about

2457
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:36,079
you just you you do horrific things and

2458
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:39,039
you don't really care i can't diagnose

2459
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:40,559
joe kennedy but what i would say like

2460
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:42,800
which elaine maxwell

2461
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,560
i can't empathize because i don't

2462
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,239
underst i first of all even in a

2463
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,440
positive sense i don't know what it's

2464
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:49,678
like to be

2465
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:51,919
grooming my son to be the president and

2466
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:53,520
lost you know the other son in war i

2467
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,359
don't know what that's like uh i don't

2468
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,040
know what it's like to be so wealthy

2469
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:58,079
like i have you have to give joe kennedy

2470
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:00,719
credit because a lot of what he was

2471
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:03,039
fighting for was to allow you know irish

2472
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:05,439
people and catholic people acceptance

2473
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:07,198
into like high society and he was up

2474
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:08,399
against a lot of pressure with that and

2475
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:09,759
he's like i'm gonna

2476
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:11,279
you know screw these people i'm gonna be

2477
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,039
recognized and we're gonna make people

2478
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:13,759
recognize so that somebody said for that

2479
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:15,198
but

2480
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,560
i mean

2481
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:20,158
i i i can't relate to people like him

2482
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,280
yeah

2483
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:25,119
but i mean that like is just terrifying

2484
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:26,880
like i mean one of the big reasons i'm

2485
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:28,479
an anarchist is

2486
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,319
like when you have someone who has that

2487
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:31,279
sense of amount of power over somebody

2488
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:33,119
else

2489
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:34,000
a lot of times they're gonna do bad

2490
01:26:33,119 --> 01:26:36,238
things

2491
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,639
and have no consequences

2492
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:40,799
do you think uh in the just lane maxwell

2493
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:43,440
case and epstein case would

2494
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,679
do you think they were

2495
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:47,439
trying to blackmail people like trying

2496
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:49,359
the what the conspiracy theorists kind

2497
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:51,198
of described

2498
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:52,960
that's probably not too far away from

2499
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:55,678
reality

2500
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:57,520
um did they intentionally try to put

2501
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,880
powerful people in compromising

2502
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,440
situations

2503
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,279
so that they can um

2504
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:05,039
basically get more and more power yeah i

2505
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:07,039
think that was a vanity fair piece that

2506
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:08,719
you're referring to or

2507
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:10,238
oh sorry i'm just referring to a general

2508
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,840
concept oh there was so there was an

2509
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:13,599
article that broke this down because

2510
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,199
this article is either fortune business

2511
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,360
week vanity fair i remember a major

2512
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:18,559
major reputable outlet and they were

2513
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:20,238
they

2514
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,239
made the reporter made the point they

2515
01:27:20,238 --> 01:27:23,759
asked around and they go this guy's a

2516
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:26,559
billionaire or extremely wealthy at

2517
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,760
least no one i know ever traded with him

2518
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,360
like where is his money coming from

2519
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:32,560
there's no there's no paper trail so

2520
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:34,319
they're like okay if if it's not

2521
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,000
trading and trades are public often you

2522
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:37,439
know where's this money coming from and

2523
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,920
it's also like why

2524
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:41,519
are all these people allowing epstein to

2525
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,119
be their business manager

2526
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,840
when he has no kind of track record to

2527
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:48,238
show for it so the hypothesis was he

2528
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:50,560
would get people into uncompromising

2529
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:51,599
situations with underage girls secretly

2530
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:53,600
film it

2531
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,520
and then he would you know black they'll

2532
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,520
mail them accordingly well i guess that

2533
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,840
would make sense i know it makes sense

2534
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:02,560
but i also see a lot of evidence that

2535
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:05,199
he's just very charismatic in a room

2536
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,480
so so and i've also seen you know that's

2537
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:08,799
how

2538
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:10,479
human connections get made like business

2539
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,480
deals get made yeah but how

2540
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:13,839
where's his money coming from

2541
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:14,959
oh like they

2542
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,639
rich people

2543
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,079
without blackmailing

2544
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,600
just uh

2545
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:21,840
like

2546
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,520
him close like him as a friend not

2547
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,480
arguing that like okay i like jeff

2548
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,239
epstein

2549
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:28,879

over him to be my money manager to have

01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:41,759
20 of my state fine

2555
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,119
where is he making the money for that

2556
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,400
twenty percent

2557
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:46,158
that's the thing that there's no paper

2558
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:48,879
trail have him trading or anything so i

2559
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:51,759
can understand why oh i see yeah

2564
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:04,559
it just really stands out to me it's

2565
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:08,079
very moving which is why i bring it up

2566
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:10,239
no uh moving here so move moving here

2567
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:11,840
but for me

2568
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:13,279
i i think we actually didn't cover that

2569
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,279
with you and i'd love to get your

2570
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:16,719
comment uh

2571
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,559
because you said this for the first time

2572
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:21,198
in your life you moved so it's not just

2573
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:25,280
about the death the place you go to it's

2574
01:29:21,198 --> 01:29:27,359
the actual act of moving is also a leap

2575
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:29,759
the decision was

2576
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:31,839
that i'm going to

2577
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,520
give away my salary at mit so stop

2578
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,639
taking salary

2579
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:39,440
give away the group so students no more

2580
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:41,199
research the grant funding i still keep

2581
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:42,319
an mit affiliation just because i have

2582
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:44,479
friends and colleagues they're still

2583
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:46,639
doing research but giving away

2584
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:49,759
really primarily is the source of money

2585
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:53,359
so no salary and let it go to zero let

2586
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:54,560
my bank account go to zero and uh

2587
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:56,399
take a leap

2588
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:57,520
in san francisco

2589
01:29:56,399 --> 01:29:58,879
or

2590
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,280
elsewhere

2591
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,639
and as covid broke out

2592
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:04,399
and a lot of people started talking to

2593
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:06,800
me about san francisco about the

2594
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:09,279
cynicism there and i'll go there and

2595
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,960
there is a kind of

2596
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:12,719
so it's not all the woke stuff and all

2597
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:15,920
that kind of things which is also a

2598
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:17,679
problem it's less it's uh less about

2599
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,279
dreaming about a big future about

2600
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:21,440
building a big future

2601
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:24,079
and more about some kind of identity

2602
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:25,839
politic battles that they're just

2603
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:28,479
you could say some some aspect in the

2604
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,319
positive light is important but

2605
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:32,000
in a place like silicon valley to me the

2606
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:36,000
most important thing is

2607
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:39,039
to do big things um and

2608
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,960
for that to be most of the conversation

2609
01:30:39,039 --> 01:30:43,600
and so that cynicism was there and then

2610
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,840
i went to look at austin and austin it

2611
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:48,320
was the opposite yeah it's the optimism

2612
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,000
and you have people like as i talked to

2613
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:52,079
so elon

2614
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,600
was the optimistic about

2615
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:55,600
making this the capital of artificial

2616
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,360
intelligence and technology and so on

2617
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,960
and then um

2618
01:30:57,359 --> 01:30:59,759
mr joe rogan

2619
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:02,079
now

2620
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,400
just the optimism about making this the

2621
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:06,639
cultural capital of the world of uh i

2622
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:09,519
mean specifically comedy but like it

2623
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:12,000
just radiates from just the excitement

2624
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,000
and uh i've seen not many people of that

2625
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,639
nature in my life and when i see that in

2626
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,920
their eyes that engine that fire of

2627
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,199
wanting to create something special

2628
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,440
about the place

2629
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:22,879
first of all those people rarely fail

2630
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:25,759
that's first of all and second of all

2631
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:28,000
that's contagious it's contagious yes

2632
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,119
and so all that combined

2633
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,079
for me

2634
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:34,880
2021 was this the the actual leap of

2635
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:38,238
taking the leap saying all right well

2636
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,840
um i'm actually going to do this so not

2637
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:42,479
just giving away the salary not giving

2638
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,800
away all that but the whole thing

2639
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:47,279
that's it you just move to a place

2640
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:50,320
there's an empty building

2641
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:51,759
you know and you're moving into it

2642
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:54,319
um

2643
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:56,639
and this is a new life and that leap i

2644
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:58,639
don't know it's a scary leap to take

2645
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:00,560
because i've taken that leap many times

2646
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,079
in my life and this is where you know

2647
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,560
parents and all those kinds of

2648
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:05,760
cynicism's really destructive because

2649
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:08,400
you know

2650
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:10,239
um from a cynical perspective is you

2651
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:11,279
know i worked at google so why leave

2652
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:13,839
google

2653
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:14,880
a very high paying salary that you can

2654
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,920
have google

2655
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,560
then mit why leave mit

2656
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:23,039
like that's mit this is you've always

2657
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:26,480
dreamed about like why do you get a phd

2658
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:28,000
yeah you've loved mit or why leave mit i

2659
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:29,599
mean it's the same process i've gone

2660
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,119
through with a lot of things in life

2661
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,679
like you've been saying

2662
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:35,599
every single stage and you need that

2663
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:36,800
um you need friends you need support

2664
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,560
groups and all those kinds of things

2665
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,560
that are extremely important but in the

2666
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:43,920
end it's about taking the leap

2667
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:45,920
and for me 2021 was this leap and to me

2668
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:48,000
that one one of the most beautiful

2669
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,319
things you can do in life is to take

2670
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,920
those leaps and that's something that i

2671
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:54,158
think is no longer a thing in new york

2672
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:56,079
there's no sense of hope you don't go to

2673
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:58,960
new york now if if

2674
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:00,559
there's been such an assault and

2675
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,840
intentionally are there otherwise maybe

2676
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,760
it's inevitable they didn't have a

2677
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,440
choice but there's been such an assault

2678
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,400
on creativity and small business in new

2679
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:08,879
york

2680
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:10,319
that no one or very few people who are

2681
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,039
in new york right now think things are

2682
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:15,359
going to get great soon whereas here

2683
01:33:13,039 --> 01:33:17,198
i feel it's every day is just something

2684
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:18,639
exciting is going to happen

2685
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:21,119
and that's part of the culture and how

2686
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:23,600
the conversation goes it's just in vogue

2687
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:26,399
to be cynical in new york and san

2688
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:28,159
francisco i hope it changes because what

2689
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:30,238
i love about new york and what i love

2690
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:31,519
about austin also

2691
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:34,000
is um

2692
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:36,880
the weirdos the characters they

2693
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,960
the just the variety of personalities

2694
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,880
that if you just walk around you get to

2695
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,639
meet them and i think new york still has

2696
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,239
that but it has the extra cynicism on

2697
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:46,560
top of it yeah

2698
01:33:44,238 --> 01:33:47,919
that's a negative i mean just becoming

2699
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,480
friends with joe

2700
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:52,960
he inspired me to be nicer to people to

2701
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:55,599
not take myself seriously to be humble

2702
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,198
to um

2703
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,880
to celebrate friends

2704
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:01,678
not to be competitive

2705
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:03,039
you know like all those things

2706
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:04,960
since i started listening to his podcast

2707
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:06,719
from the very beginning it was it just

2708
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,960
radiated from the guy

2709
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:11,439
the thing that people don't appreciate

2710
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:14,239
is joe rogan

2711
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:15,919
likes it when you bust his chops yeah

2712
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:18,079
i mean it's a lot of people at that

2713
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:19,199
level like if it's oh mr rogan you're

2714
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,840
laughing at everything they say they

2715
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:22,960
don't want that it's very uh phony and

2716
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,920
they feel uncomfortable because they

2717
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,480
know that everything they say is

2718
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,800
hilarious um i remember i went with him

2719
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:30,799
he was doing a performance here

2720
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,560
and

2721
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,079
i was yeah you were there and he was

2722
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:36,000
doing his set

2723
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:37,600
and i i'd reached the point now where i

2724
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,359
don't think of him as joe rogan you know

2725
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,560
it's just like my buddy's doing stand-up

2726
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:42,719
you forget and then i looked at the

2727
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,159
audience and i remember i'm like oh this

2728
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,480
is like a religious experience for these

2729
01:34:44,158 --> 01:34:48,158
people but you forget who he is because

2730
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:51,039
he doesn't carry himself

2731
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:52,799
like a big shot yeah yeah and still i

2732
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:54,719
mean he gets competitive as [ __ ] like i

2733
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,039
argue with him a lot i mean

2734
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:58,960
uh when i talked to francis collins and

2735
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:00,960
pfizer ceo you better believe i heard

2736
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,198
from joe

2737
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,359
and then we would just get super drunk

2738
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:07,359
and argue about it so it's um i mean

2739
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:09,839
it's beautiful and he he gets really

2740
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:12,399
passionate so it's not like

2741
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:14,000
it's not like easy to argue with him but

2742
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:15,839
that's great

2743
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,920
when you don't take it personally

2744
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:19,279
that's fun as you and i discussed and

2745
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,920
i'm sure he wouldn't mind

2746
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:23,840
us saying this but like

2747
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,079
that moment when you first get a text

2748
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,560
from joe rogan and it's some boomer meme

2749
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:30,880
like i i finally felt like i've arrived

2750
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:32,080
as a person a boomer meme uh what kind

2751
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,520
of boomer me what are we talking about

2752
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:34,559
like he just some silly meme but it's

2753
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,000
just like this is the kind of thing you

2754
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,080
can imagine someone's uncle posting on

2755
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,118
facebook yeah it's joe rogan texting it

2756
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:41,359
to you

2757
01:35:39,118 --> 01:35:43,519
yeah i mean for me also with elon

2758
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:45,759
obviously there's a few people i'm just

2759
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,600
saying folks that people know

2760
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,280
also jim keller who's

2761
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,960
worked with elon uh so i've had

2762
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:54,158
conversations with them because it's

2763
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:55,679
just my line of work they're realizing

2764
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:57,279
that everything is possible in this

2765
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:59,679
world yeah yeah

2766
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:01,759
which is not the russian mindset yeah

2767
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,399
well okay all right that's

2768
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,400
let's uh

2769
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:09,599
style it down a notch

2770
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:12,719
yeah it's uh when elon calls first

2771
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:14,400
principles thinking but really it's just

2772
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:17,359
not being limited by the constraints of

2773
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:18,879
the past yes and so saying like okay

2774
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:20,960
this is how things have been done but

2775
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,118
can be done much much better

2776
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:26,399
and uh that has to do with manufacture

2777
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:28,559
like how do we how do we do this 10

2778
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:30,399
times cheaper

2779
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:32,400
like everyone says it's this it's super

2780
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:33,920
expensive but is it does it really need

2781
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:35,599
to be this is more of a question about

2782
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,359
manufacturing about how to take build a

2783
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,719
product how to actually have a product

2784
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:40,559
at scale that

2785
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:42,239
has an impact and just having a very

2786
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,560
serious engineering

2787
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:48,079
like to the level of physics

2788
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:50,560
of discussion about building a thing and

2789
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:54,079
[ __ ] doing it and just being around

2790
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:56,080
people that did it and uh

2791
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:58,800
you know basically

2792
01:36:56,079 --> 01:37:00,319
literally or figuratively said [ __ ] you

2793
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,679
to everybody in the room that said they

2794
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:04,079
can't do it

2795
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:06,319
and that that energy so that i've gotten

2796
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:08,079
to know elon a lot better in 2021 that

2797
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:10,238
to me it's like

2798
01:37:08,079 --> 01:37:11,920
everything the whole thing that moving

2799
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:13,519
here and being surrounded by the

2800
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,199
optimistic energy

2801
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,400
and then the individual interactions

2802
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:18,079
with people

2803
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:21,198
that refuse

2804
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:23,118
to be like brought down by the

2805
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:25,759
yeah the cynicism and the nature yeah

2806
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:27,198
the naysayers it's um

2807
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:30,360
that to me is what i'm gonna remember

2808
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:32,799
this year for and i hope it like

2809
01:37:30,359 --> 01:37:34,880
materializes into a

2810
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,039
something concrete here in austin and i

2811
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:39,920
feel is is doing that i really am

2812
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:41,359
curious to be a fly on the wall i'm sure

2813
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,440
it'll happen at some point watching you

2814
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:45,279
and elon talk to each other because he's

2815
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:48,158
even more of a robot than you

2816
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:49,679
he was on the babylon b podcast and i

2817
01:37:48,158 --> 01:37:51,439
was honored to be able to be in the room

2818
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:54,399
while this was happening

2819
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:56,638
and with the guys at the be do um at the

2820
01:37:54,399 --> 01:37:58,479
end of every podcast they have like like

2821
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:00,000
10 questions i don't think this worm

2822
01:37:58,479 --> 01:38:01,359
with this is one of those no no this and

2823
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,920
they go to elon

2824
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:05,279
um would you would you rather be batman

2825
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,639
or iron man you know because they're

2826
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:07,840
both like multi-millionaire

2827
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:10,560
industrialists

2828
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,760
and elon being elon is like well let's

2829
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,960
think this through

2830
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,480
there's different kinds of bats you've

2831
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,520
got you know fruit bats and you've got

2832
01:38:14,479 --> 01:38:16,959
insect

2833
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:19,280
well it's called batman batman sure

2834
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,480
it'll fly right that's comply i mean

2835
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:23,118
iron man and i'm just sitting there

2836
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:26,559
holding dude just answer the question

2837
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:28,960
it was so literal i was like damn

2838
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:31,280
i guess by this point uh i've released a

2839
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:33,840
podcast with him that's uh

2840
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:36,000
several hours and it's exactly as as you

2841
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,639
would imagine it's exactly as you would

2842
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,840
imagine there was this super technical

2843
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,840
the movie her

2844
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,079
yes of course so there's that one scene

2845
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:46,000
it's when um what is it joaquin who's

2846
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:47,679
the lead character yeah a walking

2847
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,118
phoenix yeah so he's the lead and he

2848
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:50,880
falls in love with siri basically he was

2849
01:38:49,118 --> 01:38:51,679
played by scarlett johansson

2850
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,760
and

2851
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,880
there's another artificial ai that she's

2852
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,600
talking to

2853
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:59,359
and she's like oh can i uh permission to

2854
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,719
go into nonverbal communication with

2855
01:38:59,359 --> 01:39:01,359
this professor and

2856
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,279
and

2857
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:04,799
the guy's like sure and they just start

2858
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:06,238
talking to each other in their robot and

2859
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,840
i'm just imagining the two of you having

2860
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:10,238
this mind-meld

2861
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,199
well that so there's both the humor of

2862
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:13,678
that

2863
01:39:11,198 --> 01:39:15,839
but also the practical nature of the

2864
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:17,760
kind of conversations to have it's so

2865
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:20,480
great because it's uh

2866
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:22,000
it's problem solving mode okay yeah yeah

2867
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:24,399
okay it's so that is fun that is

2868
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,399
exciting because like you stop

2869
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:28,399
completing sentences i actually feel at

2870
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:30,559
home because you don't need to say the

2871
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:31,279
full sentences anymore you could just

2872
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,119
like

2873
01:39:31,279 --> 01:39:35,599
say random words and you start to

2874
01:39:33,118 --> 01:39:37,599
understand what you're talking about and

2875
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,960
then you can have multiple conversations

2876
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,360
at the same time and go on these

2877
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:44,000
tangents one of the biggest problems i

2878
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:46,158
have with podcasting for me talking i

2879
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,319
have to finish my sentences i have to

2880
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:50,000
actually finish making a point yeah

2881
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:51,920
which is a big problem because there's

2882
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,760
like a listener that needs to hear the

2883
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,960
point being finished as opposed to

2884
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,239
completing

2885
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,079
your

2886
01:39:56,238 --> 01:40:00,959
sentences uh

2887
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:02,800
in inside your own mind and like the the

2888
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:05,198
thing i find is useful to elon does

2889
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:08,159
exact same thing is

2890
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:11,198
when the line of thinking is no longer

2891
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:12,638
useful you just ran you just switch to

2892
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:14,319
the next thing you just leave that whole

2893
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:16,480
thing behind you don't need a nice

2894
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:18,639
transition you don't need any of that

2895
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:20,079
and also just um

2896
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:23,039
it's the first principles thing it's

2897
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:25,439
like zooming in on the

2898
01:40:23,039 --> 01:40:27,519
on the elephant in the room i love that

2899
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:29,839
it's so energizing it's just that that's

2900
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:31,360
what i love about engineers it's not the

2901
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,560
it's not it's not the maybe most

2902
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:35,279
eloquent

2903
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:37,280
communication style but i um

2904
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:39,198
i love it what about you so you said

2905
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:42,238
moving

2906
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:44,079
the book the book what else

2907
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:46,158
um

2908
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:46,880
and you've been really excited about

2909
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:48,719
so

2910
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,199
that's anarchist handbook but you've

2911
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:53,520
also been non-stop excited about white

2912
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:55,359
bill that was most of this year you've

2913
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:57,920
been actually made significant progress

2914
01:40:55,359 --> 01:40:59,279
yeah i'm on page 40 of the second draft

2915
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:02,319
and it's really kind of funny because

2916
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:04,639
when you're doing your i think 10th book

2917
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:06,319
i lost track already um

2918
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:07,679
the first draft is actually pretty good

2919
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:08,799
like i'm going back and like all right

2920
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:10,079
this is gonna be a whole slog i'm like

2921
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,719
oh i just have to cut and paste this and

2922
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:13,760
basically tweak a few words so

2923
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:15,679
um

2924
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:17,760
i did a good job with the first draft

2925
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:18,719
it's uh it's also funny when you're

2926
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,320
writing

2927
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:21,279
um

2928
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:22,960
how

2929
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:24,960
and i guess this is the mark of a good

2930
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,800
professional writer

2931
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,840
the

2932
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:32,800
my personal feelings don't match

2933
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:35,679
how the characters in the book come off

2934
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:37,440
like i have a lot of fondness um

2935
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:39,199
for people like emma goldman and

2936
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:40,238
alexander berkman and they're early on

2937
01:41:39,198 --> 01:41:42,479
in the book

2938
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:44,079
but they're not good people like and i'm

2939
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:45,279
writing and i'm writing it objectively

2940
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:48,639
and whatever and i'm reading this i'm

2941
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:49,679
like they come off much worse than my

2942
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:51,840
personal

2943
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:53,440
um appraisal of them

2944
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,360
um so it's kind of interesting as a

2945
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:57,359
writer when you're watching it i guess

2946
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:59,359
kind of like an attorney right like you

2947
01:41:57,359 --> 01:42:01,279
can have in a situation where you as an

2948
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:02,158
attorney you have a lot of fondness for

2949
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:03,759
your

2950
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:05,920
client but you realize that they

2951
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,360
probably did this thing or you could not

2952
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,039
they could be the other way like they're

2953
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:10,399
innocent but you you're it's hard for

2954
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:12,238
you to make a good case for them because

2955
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:13,920
the data is not there can you actually

2956
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:15,599
talk about your writing process sure

2957
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:18,079
several ways so one your writing process

2958
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:18,960
but two by way of advice of how how to

2959
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:20,319
write

2960
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,399
you've talked about in the past like

2961
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:23,198
your your first draft is these kind of

2962
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:25,679
uh

2963
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:27,359
disparate or more chaotic and that yeah

2964
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:28,960
in the same way maybe i was saying in

2965
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:31,519
the engineering discussion you don't

2966
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,880
complete the sentences yes thoughts the

2967
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:35,360
first

2968
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,400
like real good writing advice i remember

2969
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:38,880
getting

2970
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:41,039
was this book by peggy noonan called

2971
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:42,960
what i sought the revolution

2972
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:44,399
and she was ronald reagan's speechwriter

2973
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,279
she still writes for the wall street

2974
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:47,839
journal

2975
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:49,679
um i the book i bought was at a used

2976
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,840
bookstore in louisburg pennsylvania when

2977
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:54,158
i was in college and the spine is cocked

2978
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,039
i still have it it was 99 cents

2979
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:56,319
um

2980
01:42:55,039 --> 01:42:58,719
and she talked you know when you're

2981
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:00,639
writing for a president this is no joke

2982
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:02,158
especially for a president who's this no

2983
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,719
the great communicator reagan you know

2984
01:43:02,158 --> 01:43:06,638
so and you have to you have to be very

2985
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:08,639
inspirational but also not come off as

2986
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:10,480
corny which is very hard to do

2987
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:12,960
and she in the book talks about how she

2988
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:14,879
wrote speeches for him how she'd you

2989
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:16,560
know i'm paraphrasing her and this i

2990
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:19,039
haven't read her book in a couple

2991
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:20,960
decades but basically she would write

2992
01:43:19,039 --> 01:43:22,319
like a brain dump and it's just garbage

2993
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:25,118
and she was like that's okay just get it

2994
01:43:22,319 --> 01:43:26,639
all out there um and then you know

2995
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:28,158
there's that expression all writing is

2996
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:30,639
editing so

2997
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:32,319
for the white pill specifically this is

2998
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:33,840
i don't know if it's the most ambitious

2999
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:35,279
book i've ever done your reader i think

3000
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,639
is more ambitious because that's all of

3001
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:37,920
north korea's history and it's written

3002
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:40,800
somebody else's voice that person's

3003
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:43,118
abortion and you like you mentioned you

3004
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:45,199
had to read a giant number six books

3005
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:46,799
that says research yeah well maybe can

3006
01:43:45,198 --> 01:43:48,559
we just pause can you say what white

3007
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:50,719
pill is about

3008
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:52,560
sure it's a tale it's it's about hope

3009
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:54,319
and it's a tale of good and evil and i

3010
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,880
think that's i i don't want to tip my

3011
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:58,158
hand too much okay but people always

3012
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,920
like how do you think why are you so

3013
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:02,158
hopeful and i'm not hopeful on an

3014
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:03,760
emotional level i'm hopeful because

3015
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:05,839
looking at history i think there's

3016
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,719
certain things that

3017
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,719
not

3018
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:10,560
not will certainly happen again but it's

3019
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:12,639
not all implausible to happen again and

3020
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:15,920
that the the good guys will win and this

3021
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:16,800
is one of those cases so

3022
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,440
you know

3023
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,880
i had the book took on a life of its own

3024
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:22,559
it's very different from how originally

3025
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,960
conceived it i originally conceived it

3026
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:28,239
as a kind of retelling of camus

3027
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:29,520
philosophy um ryan holiday

3028
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:30,879
who he used to be close friends with

3029
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,719
i've talked to him in a while he has a

3030
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,560
whole kind of cottage industry based on

3031
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:36,079
the stokes of the past i'm like okay can

3032
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,440
i ask them once can i do this with kamu

3033
01:44:36,079 --> 01:44:40,639
he said sure

3034
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:43,279
and then i reread camus and recently and

3035
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:45,118
it wasn't what i was had remembered oh

3036
01:44:43,279 --> 01:44:46,479
it's like pausing that i apologize to

3037
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:48,158
interrupt so

3038
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:50,319
it's interesting so he kind of took

3039
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:52,799
ideas from stoics

3040
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:54,960
and started to kind of

3041
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:56,560
use it as a book

3042
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:59,279
it gives you advice about how to live

3043
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,960
life from historic perspectives and

3044
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,118
you were thinking

3045
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:06,000
is there something in existentialism

3046
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:08,238
absurdism or something specifically

3047
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,760
in camus thinking or

3048
01:45:08,238 --> 01:45:11,439
i think you've mentioned

3049
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:13,679
sisyphus yes specifically like his

3050
01:45:11,439 --> 01:45:15,279
philosophical work yeah

3051
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:19,359
so you were trying to see like is there

3052
01:45:15,279 --> 01:45:19,359
can i resurrect this that's actually uh

3053
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:23,199
i would think

3054
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:26,880
that's an interesting project

3055
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:26,879
and it's it's sad to hear that

3056
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:32,000
it was uh it didn't materialize in

3057
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:34,158
exactly that form because i thought

3058
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,840
there would be a lot in that so i had

3059
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:37,118
douglas murray on my show and he also

3060
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,800
made the point like when you go back and

3061
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:40,559
read kamu there's not that much there

3062
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,360
the myth of sisyphus

3063
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,520
is

3064
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:46,238
not at all how i remembered it yeah the

3065
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,679
vast bulk of that book is like literary

3066
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:48,718
criticism so he's talking about dust

3067
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:50,399
deaths you know there's different people

3068
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:52,000
who are embodiments of the absurd but

3069
01:45:50,399 --> 01:45:53,839
i'm like this isn't there's not much to

3070
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,840
take from here this the actual title

3071
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:59,360
essay is basically like a like sixth

3072
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:01,679
chapter uh essay at the back of the book

3073
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:03,759
which you know it's it's it's it's good

3074
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:06,719
for what it is but there's not that much

3075
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:08,320
there to draw i'm extremely um

3076
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:11,039
he's a great hero of mine i think his

3077
01:46:08,319 --> 01:46:12,559
life is just enormously admirable he

3078
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:14,800
fought very hard against the you know

3079
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,960
the nazi occupation uh his book the

3080
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:18,800
plague which i find unreadable is an

3081
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,319
allegory about you know

3082
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:22,880
germany conquering france and so on and

3083
01:46:20,319 --> 01:46:25,039
so forth wait a minute why is the plague

3084
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:26,639
unreadable it's the kind of book where

3085
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:28,960
reading the book doesn't add anything to

3086
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:31,520
the plot the plot is

3087
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:33,279
a play comes sweeps over the town

3088
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,480
destroys a lot of life and vanishes as

3089
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:36,238
quickly as it came you don't need to

3090
01:46:34,479 --> 01:46:38,959
read the book now like you get the point

3091
01:46:36,238 --> 01:46:41,359
that i i deeply disagree have you

3092
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:43,600
yes of course i've read the plague to me

3093
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:46,399
i mean the plague is about the doctor

3094
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,600
and it's about love and it's about

3095
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:50,559
the different

3096
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:53,760
roles that humans take in

3097
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:55,440
a time of tragedy like the plague

3098
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:57,280
also it's an allegory

3099
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:58,879
so you can start to think about like

3100
01:46:57,279 --> 01:47:00,559
what you know you could whether it's

3101
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,600
nazi germany whatever you think that is

3102
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,840
yeah

3103
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:06,239
um to me though that was about love and

3104
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:08,159
about like the role like the the highest

3105
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:10,638
ideal being the doctor that like

3106
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:12,960
sacrifices themselves for others

3107
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:16,079
and like still has love and hope i mean

3108
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,679
i did to me it that the way that story

3109
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:19,439
is told

3110
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:20,719
i think has a lot of meaning it's like

3111
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:22,559
it to me

3112
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:24,560
you're saying that's interesting you say

3113
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,639
it this way but to me it's like saying

3114
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,639
animal farm

3115
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:31,279
doesn't need to be read

3116
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:32,800
because it's an obvious story

3117
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:34,238
i don't think there's much plot to the

3118
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:37,440
plague

3119
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:39,919
i think animal farm has a very long plot

3120
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:42,079
and a complex plot but there's

3121
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:44,000
experiences within

3122
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:46,319
so the situation is set up and plague

3123
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,479
and there's experiences that start to

3124
01:47:46,319 --> 01:47:49,359
reveal a philosophy

3125
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:52,638
so

3126
01:47:49,359 --> 01:47:55,118
yeah it's not very plot driven yeah but

3127
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:56,560
but the so i i would say you still

3128
01:47:55,118 --> 01:47:59,198
should read it

3129
01:47:56,560 --> 01:48:01,039
but the plot doesn't like you you didn't

3130
01:47:59,198 --> 01:48:02,879
give away anything currently

3131
01:48:01,039 --> 01:48:05,920
right that that's

3132
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:08,400
so some books are just i mean iran is

3133
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:10,719
similar to that in a sense like the plot

3134
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:13,039
is not as important as the behavior of

3135
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:15,118
the different people in that plot i

3136
01:48:13,039 --> 01:48:16,960
think she's very plot heavy

3137
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:19,279
no she has plot but i'm saying that's

3138
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,960
not necessarily the important thing to

3139
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:22,719
me the behavior of the people is the

3140
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:24,480
important thing sure but you could you

3141
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:27,039
could you could like separate it into a

3142
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:29,599
bunch of blog posts and they stand on

3143
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:30,840
their own i i would have to

3144
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,920
think about that with

3145
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,440
iran she cr she does through the plot

3146
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,520
create a world where you start to

3147
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:39,439
understand right different values that

3148
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:41,600
people have

3149
01:48:39,439 --> 01:48:44,319
but yeah

3150
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:46,159
but that's what the plot serves

3151
01:48:44,319 --> 01:48:47,759
yeah i don't know i would have to think

3152
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:49,439
but in the plague it's the behavior of

3153
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,800
the people that's really important and

3154
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:52,559
the same

3155
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,960
i mean the stranger too i mean these

3156
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:57,119
like um

3157
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:58,800
i'm sure i'm trying to scramble here for

3158
01:48:57,118 --> 01:49:01,759
books i i really appreciate that don't

3159
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:02,480
have a plot i mean uh

3160
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:04,639
no

3161
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:06,638
uh notes from underground

3162
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:08,079
so obviously this desk has a huge amount

3163
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:10,319
of plot in

3164
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:12,719
in most of his work herman hess has a

3165
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:13,840
huge amount of plot thomas man doesn't

3166
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:15,679
have the pl he's the one who doesn't

3167
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:17,520
have plots that was right yeah would you

3168
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:19,920
say kafka has a plot

3169
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,840
i think kafka is very heavy plot driven

3170
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:23,039
yeah but i just don't see that i guess i

3171
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:25,039
guess metamorphosis doesn't really have

3172
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:26,960
a plot

3173
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:28,560
yeah but when there's like crawling

3174
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,800
around it's like a vignette it's not

3175
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,480
really like a this is not sure yeah

3176
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:34,400
a hunger artist

3177
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:35,839
one of my probably favorite short

3178
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:37,839
stories is that kind of a short story

3179
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:40,239
it's a pretty long short story of

3180
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:41,760
kafka's is really interesting

3181
01:49:40,238 --> 01:49:44,559
as a is about a man i don't know if you

3182
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:46,159
read it no i think so um it's about a

3183
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:50,320
man that

3184
01:49:46,158 --> 01:49:52,879
uh it's like a freak in a sense that um

3185
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:54,719
his skill is that he can fast for a long

3186
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,480
time okay and then people gather on the

3187
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:58,480
cage and look at him as he

3188
01:49:56,479 --> 01:50:00,079
as he fasts i don't actually remember if

3189
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:00,799
he's in the cage or not but

3190
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:03,439
the

3191
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:05,360
and uh eventually he fast so long that

3192
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:06,559
people don't even care anymore like they

3193
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:10,079
just leave

3194
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:12,320
so there's a there's a

3195
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:14,399
it has to do something it makes me think

3196
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:17,198
about like

3197
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:20,319
don't become the way you live

3198
01:50:17,198 --> 01:50:21,279
don't become like a freak show a circus

3199
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:24,880
act

3200
01:50:21,279 --> 01:50:26,719
like live for an idea live live for um

3201
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:28,400
something that brings you joy or don't

3202
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:30,800
live for the sake of attention for the

3203
01:50:28,399 --> 01:50:34,079
sake of attention that's yes but yeah

3204
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,039
um yeah anyway so uh you i rudely

3205
01:50:34,079 --> 01:50:36,719
interrupted because you were talking

3206
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:38,560
about the plague and connecting it to

3207
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,000
the writing process of

3208
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,239
white pill yeah

3209
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,039
well anyway so you know how i was

3210
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:47,519
writing this one i just had a

3211
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:49,599
first draft of notes and there were it's

3212
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:51,360
not in chronological order it's like i

3213
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:53,119
read certain books as research and then

3214
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:54,000
i had the pull quotes that was necessary

3215
01:50:53,118 --> 01:50:56,158
there

3216
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,319
um and now i'm basically rearranging

3217
01:50:56,158 --> 01:50:59,598
everything and putting it so the book

3218
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:01,039
started as

3219
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:01,840
ryan holidays

3220
01:51:01,039 --> 01:51:03,920
right

3221
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:06,000
by holiday s caboo the working title

3222
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:09,599
would have been the point of tears

3223
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,520
because this is great comeu is a great

3224
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:14,000
quote maker and he has this line about

3225
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:16,239
man must live live to the point of tears

3226
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,118
which i think is just what i love about

3227
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:18,959
him

3228
01:51:17,118 --> 01:51:21,198
is

3229
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:23,279
camus you always comes off as like he's

3230
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:25,439
clenching his teeth he's clenching his

3231
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:29,198
teeth both in terms of

3232
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:30,879
like barely mitigated rage and injustice

3233
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:33,198
like when he sees people suffering it

3234
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:34,800
just it just really makes him like just

3235
01:51:33,198 --> 01:51:36,158
upset to the core

3236
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,880
but also

3237
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:41,118
this sense of

3238
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:43,199
uh not taking life for granted

3239
01:51:41,118 --> 01:51:45,839
and kind of just pushing yourself and

3240
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:47,198
pushing the boundaries and and

3241
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,560
you know his point being that life is

3242
01:51:47,198 --> 01:51:50,319
inherently meaningless which gives a

3243
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:53,199
great opportunity to impute meaning to

3244
01:51:50,319 --> 01:51:56,639
it and to create our own meaning to life

3245
01:51:53,198 --> 01:51:59,519
so taking the the the main essay from

3246
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:01,199
mythic sisyphus that was the the origin

3247
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,639
story for the white pill but then it

3248
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:04,719
became something completely different

3249
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:06,719
and so then it became

3250
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:07,920
how are you so optimistic in the face of

3251
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:09,840
everything that's going on in the world

3252
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,118
and i started writing it when kovitz

3253
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,079
started hitting

3254
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:12,880
and

3255
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:14,800
i

3256
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:16,480
because again i'm not optimistic because

3257
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:19,119
of some temperament of my temperament of

3258
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:20,879
mine i'm optimistic because

3259
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:23,279
you know people talk about how if the us

3260
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:24,800
didn't exist china would just

3261
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:25,759
become an empire and take over

3262
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,079
everything

3263
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:29,280
empires are expensive and they're

3264
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:31,198
they're they

3265
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:33,279
ex like look at the british empire you

3266
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:34,319
know look at the soviet union like it's

3267
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:37,198
not

3268
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:40,319
automatically sustainable it costs a lot

3269
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:42,799
of a lot of things to make sure when

3270
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:45,039
you're geographically you know all over

3271
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:47,360
the all over the world literally to keep

3272
01:52:45,039 --> 01:52:49,039
everyone in line it's not at all like a

3273
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:53,118
super villain in a movie like once it

3274
01:52:49,039 --> 01:52:54,800
happens it's happy ending for them so

3275
01:52:53,118 --> 01:52:57,839
yeah that was the start and i'm like all

3276
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:59,840
right let me tell um

3277
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:02,480
one thing i'm good at is telling stories

3278
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:05,360
so this is really uh so this is

3279
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:07,519
narrative uh plot driven very very plot

3280
01:53:05,359 --> 01:53:09,279
driven and also heavily character driven

3281
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:13,199
but the characters are real

3282
01:53:09,279 --> 01:53:15,439
yeah got it so it's interesting to kind

3283
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:17,439
of mention what kind of what does the

3284
01:53:15,439 --> 01:53:18,158
first draft kind of look like in terms

3285
01:53:17,439 --> 01:53:19,759
of

3286
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:22,399
what what kind of things do you plop

3287
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,320
down oh so it'll be like let's suppose i

3288
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:25,759
just read like you know some book called

3289
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:28,399
the guillotine at work which was an

3290
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:30,320
early book attacking lenin from the

3291
01:53:28,399 --> 01:53:31,598
narco communist perspective so it'll

3292
01:53:30,319 --> 01:53:33,198
just be like all the different quotes

3293
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:36,000
like a paragraph here double space

3294
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:38,000
another paragraph you know blah blah

3295
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,479
so on and so forth whereas for other

3296
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,840
sections where i wasn't just using a

3297
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:43,279
book as research

3298
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:45,279
there would be like talking about

3299
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:46,960
mckinley getting shot like it's just me

3300
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:48,319
writing the narrative

3301
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,560
and that i could just pretty much copy

3302
01:53:48,319 --> 01:53:53,118
paste into the second draft by way of

3303
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:55,199
advice would you give

3304
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:57,359
that is advice is that's a good way to

3305
01:53:55,198 --> 01:53:58,960
do it is that a very peculiar way your

3306
01:53:57,359 --> 01:54:00,479
brain no so this is this is actually

3307
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:02,079
advice i feel comfortable giving to

3308
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:03,279
people who are trying to write

3309
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:05,039
uh

3310
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:08,719
because it's just like with the gym

3311
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:10,960
right if you did seven sets seven excuse

3312
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:12,800
me reps last week and you did eight this

3313
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:14,158
week it's psychologically motivating

3314
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:17,599
because you're going the right direction

3315
01:54:14,158 --> 01:54:19,359
and your mind extrapolates so

3316
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:22,319
make sure tell yourself i'm gonna get a

3317
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:23,439
page done today or two pages done sit

3318
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:25,519
your ass on the computer you're not

3319
01:54:23,439 --> 01:54:26,479
allowed to get up to get those two pages

3320
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:27,520
it doesn't matter if they look at

3321
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:29,759
garbage

3322
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:30,800
because if you have a 300 page first

3323
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,159
draft

3324
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:33,920
and it's crap

3325
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:35,598
at least you have something to work with

3326
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:37,840
and that's a big number

3327
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:39,920
so if you're gonna the thing is since

3328
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:41,599
the first draft is gonna be crap if

3329
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:43,520
you're editing as you're right it's

3330
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:45,679
gonna be extremely discouraging and it's

3331
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:47,280
also trying to drive and then doing

3332
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:49,679
reverse at the same time it's it's a

3333
01:54:47,279 --> 01:54:52,079
completely nonsensical way to do it get

3334
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:53,520
it all out there don't look it over if

3335
01:54:52,079 --> 01:54:56,000
you have a great line put in your phone

3336
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:58,480
and then add it to the the draft so

3337
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,920
it'll be a complete slog but editing

3338
01:54:58,479 --> 01:55:01,439
that slog is gonna be a lot easier than

3339
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:03,920
creating it to begin with and when you

3340
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:07,118
see those disparate lines all laid out

3341
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:08,800
on the page how difficult is it to

3342
01:55:07,118 --> 01:55:10,000
then start stitching it together do you

3343
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,960
find that

3344
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,960
when you look at a list of those things

3345
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:16,800
the final product will look very

3346
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,639
different yeah how will you actually use

3347
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:21,039
those lines no i will use those lines

3348
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:22,639
then i have a file called scraps so like

3349
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:24,319
if the line's no longer used i put in my

3350
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:26,159
scrap pile

3351
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:28,079
i'd love to see what's in this grab pile

3352
01:55:26,158 --> 01:55:29,198
okay yeah sure

3353
01:55:28,079 --> 01:55:30,960
one of the things i've been pulling

3354
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:32,479
scraps is a lot of times when i was

3355
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:35,279
earlier writing

3356
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:38,000
i would have contemporary references

3357
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:39,279
and i realized that that's bad because i

3358
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,158
want the

3359
01:55:39,279 --> 01:55:44,479
the the reader to be in the past as the

3360
01:55:42,158 --> 01:55:46,638
present so if you're talking about let's

3361
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:48,399
say 1901 and you're referring to obama

3362
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:50,319
that screws people up so i have to pull

3363
01:55:48,399 --> 01:55:51,920
all those

3364
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:53,279
okay let's talk about some new year's

3365
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:55,039
resolutions

3366
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:56,639
do you ever do new year's resolutions do

3367
01:55:55,039 --> 01:55:58,399
you ever think like that like take a

3368
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:00,639
special day

3369
01:55:58,399 --> 01:56:02,399
in the year to think about how you're

3370
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:04,000
going to try to change yourself or you

3371
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:05,920
do you try to transform yourself every

3372
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,679
single day when you wake up

3373
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:09,440
well i usually have several projects i'm

3374
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:11,679
working on at once so there's always

3375
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:12,960
incremental progress on those right but

3376
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:14,560
like you know it's nice to have a

3377
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:16,880
deadline by the end of

3378
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:19,520
2022

3379
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:21,440
i'll accomplish this kind of a

3380
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:23,040
like to hold yourself responsible and

3381
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:24,479
then you could do that at the end at the

3382
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:25,599
beginning of the year to think about

3383
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:27,919
that

3384
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:28,880
both philosophically like what kind of

3385
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:31,199
big

3386
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:33,118
magic not projects that you can quantify

3387
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:34,799
but more like how can i change my life

3388
01:56:33,118 --> 01:56:36,319
or like i mentioned take the leap of

3389
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:39,279
different kinds and then there's

3390
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:40,319
specific things like finish the book

3391
01:56:39,279 --> 01:56:43,679
i

3392
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:45,840
years ago and i'm so i'm i think on some

3393
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:48,079
level you much less than me but i think

3394
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:50,319
you're increasing in this direction

3395
01:56:48,079 --> 01:56:53,118
i realized it's more i have to learn how

3396
01:56:50,319 --> 01:56:54,960
to be a surfer and not a driver

3397
01:56:53,118 --> 01:56:57,839
because when you reach the level we're

3398
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:58,880
at in our careers or in our place in the

3399
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,480
culture

3400
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:03,039
a lot of this is luck

3401
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:04,959
yeah and a lot of this is just like

3402
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:06,000
like i'm just going along for the ride

3403
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:08,000
because

3404
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,760
it's kind of counter-intuitive like you

3405
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,679
know like the success of the anarchist

3406
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:12,560
handbook was counter-intuitive

3407
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:14,239
um

3408
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:17,119
so

3409
01:57:14,238 --> 01:57:18,399
all i'm hoping for is you know getting

3410
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:20,000
the book done

3411
01:57:18,399 --> 01:57:22,319
i am

3412
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,520
extremely proud of it

3413
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:25,759
um

3414
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:28,080
and and just also

3415
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:29,920
you know building a

3416
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:31,198
you know we had thanksgiving together at

3417
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:33,039
blair's house

3418
01:57:31,198 --> 01:57:36,158
just building a great

3419
01:57:33,039 --> 01:57:39,118
uh upcoming community here in austin

3420
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:41,118
which is it has happened very quickly i

3421
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:42,479
was there was going to be another

3422
01:57:41,118 --> 01:57:44,238
um

3423
01:57:42,479 --> 01:57:47,198
surprise here there's a girl named

3424
01:57:44,238 --> 01:57:49,198
natalie um sidesurf and she makes these

3425
01:57:47,198 --> 01:57:50,479
ultra realistic cakes like if you've

3426
01:57:49,198 --> 01:57:52,079
seen those cakes online where it looks

3427
01:57:50,479 --> 01:57:54,079
like cutting a puppy like she makes

3428
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:57,039
those kind of things so she's here

3429
01:57:54,079 --> 01:57:58,399
um in austin yeah you know so like moved

3430
01:57:57,039 --> 01:57:59,920
permanently i think she's been here for

3431
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:02,719
a while i've never i haven't met her yet

3432
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:04,319
but i just kind of chatted with her so

3433
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:05,679
there's just it's just so many there's

3434
01:58:04,319 --> 01:58:07,759
so many um

3435
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:10,000
scenes happening here

3436
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:13,119
um that are overlapping

3437
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,639
so in general finish the book

3438
01:58:13,118 --> 01:58:15,839
keep building your community i mean

3439
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:17,359
you've already been doing that here

3440
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,960
you've been here several months i've

3441
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:20,399
been making a point to introduce people

3442
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:22,000
to each other and everyone's just really

3443
01:58:20,399 --> 01:58:23,279
getting along very well

3444
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,599
that's great

3445
01:58:23,279 --> 01:58:27,679
and the book is the focus the book is

3446
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:30,480
the focus what about the podcast that

3447
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:32,800
you're doing you're welcome yes

3448
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:36,238
i mean i enjoy it and it's been growing

3449
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:38,159
a lot i finally got a new computer

3450
01:58:36,238 --> 01:58:41,678
which my friend jay installed so i can

3451
01:58:38,158 --> 01:58:44,319
have a decent camera because of my old

3452
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:45,039
this is my mindset as a hoarder like i

3453
01:58:44,319 --> 01:58:47,359
was

3454
01:58:45,039 --> 01:58:49,118
more interested in spending money on a

3455
01:58:47,359 --> 01:58:51,359
pareto autograph than actually getting a

3456
01:58:49,118 --> 01:58:52,960
computer that's from the

3457
01:58:51,359 --> 01:58:54,158
20th century

3458
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:55,760
um

3459
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:59,118
so

3460
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:01,679
but i i i'm such an old school person

3461
01:58:59,118 --> 01:59:04,079
in that in my head

3462
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:05,279
podcasts are like so ephemeral

3463
01:59:04,079 --> 01:59:07,519
like i don't

3464
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:09,198
like there's some episodes of my podcast

3465
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:10,560
i'm really proud of and there's a lot of

3466
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:12,319
friendships i've made as a result of it

3467
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:14,400
that really mean a lot to me no question

3468
01:59:12,319 --> 01:59:16,719
it's made my life a family better place

3469
01:59:14,399 --> 01:59:18,399
but it's not the same as that book on

3470
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:19,359
the shelf especially when the book is

3471
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:20,559
something

3472
01:59:19,359 --> 01:59:22,719
that i think

3473
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:24,320
matters much more than i do

3474
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:25,198
yeah there's a permanence to it there's

3475
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:27,519
a

3476
01:59:25,198 --> 01:59:29,279
seriousness to laying down the words on

3477
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:31,440
paper yeah like really giving him

3478
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:33,840
thought yeah

3479
01:59:31,439 --> 01:59:35,439
that's true but pocket i mean i'm a huge

3480
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,039
fan of podcasts you're just you're you

3481
01:59:35,439 --> 01:59:38,879
don't listen to podcast much which is

3482
01:59:37,039 --> 01:59:40,639
fascinating to

3483
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:43,840
yeah like at all and i like i don't know

3484
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:43,840

3487
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:56,000
the realness of the medium that's really

3488
01:59:53,279 --> 01:59:57,279
nice i just understood for the it's

3489
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,639
starting to click

3490
01:59:57,279 --> 02:00:00,238
because

3491
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:01,359
like my pal blair white she was just on

3492
02:00:00,238 --> 02:00:03,519
rogan

3494
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:06,880
i i was

3495
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:08,560
i was so angry like i was sitting there

3496
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:09,920
like yelling at the screen

3497
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:11,199
because joe

3498
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:12,239
and blair

3499
02:00:11,198 --> 02:00:14,479
you would think that they're going to

3500
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:16,959
start talking about you know trump or

3501
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:18,718
trans issues or moving to austin they

3502
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:20,560
start talking about shark reproduction

3503
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:22,560
yeah and neither these dumbasses knew

3504
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:23,920
anything about it and i know a lot about

3505
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:25,119
it and they're like oh is it like this

3506
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:26,480
or do the sharks lay eggs and i'm

3507
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:28,639
sitting there like if you don't know why

3508
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:31,039
you're talking about this

3509
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:33,279
why why are you talking and i could also

3510
02:00:31,039 --> 02:00:34,238
see why people like these shows because

3511
02:00:33,279 --> 02:00:35,439
they feel like they're friends with the

3512
02:00:34,238 --> 02:00:36,638
people like they're sitting in the room

3513
02:00:35,439 --> 02:00:38,559
because i felt like it was in that room

3514
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:40,560
and i wanted to shake both of them

3515
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:42,639
you're in the room so know what about

3516
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:44,560
transforming yourself any any

3517
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:47,520

he's exaggerating he's not at that

3530
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:12,239

couldn't gain weight as a kid so when i

3538
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:25,800

like a flag but he could also do do this

3557
02:02:02,399 --> 02:02:05,679
while

like ghetto places around austin there

3596
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:19,520

02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:46,960
they're also just weird like you don't

3640
02:04:44,238 --> 02:04:48,319
become a comedian for not being like

02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:07,599
and but so that this whole story of

3650
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:09,679
everything that happens is is lex like

3651
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:13,520
40 hours fasted

3652
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:16,158
with joe rogan drinking a lot of whiskey

3653
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:17,920
and so you're drinking too oh heavy on

3654
02:05:16,158 --> 02:05:19,679
40 oh my god that's crazy so it is

3655
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:22,158
calories that was my only source of

3656
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:24,158
calories is the whiskey and i

3657
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:26,399
so i didn't trust myself with carbs when

3658
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:29,198
i'm drunk i just don't enjoy it because

3659
02:05:26,399 --> 02:05:31,439
i'll forget and i just enjoy eating like

3660
02:05:29,198 --> 02:05:33,279
a strict healthy diet when i'm drunk

3661
02:05:31,439 --> 02:05:35,359
because

3662
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:38,000
i'd rather eat more food that's healthy

3663
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:39,839
yeah versus not and so anyway so then we

3664
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,118
went to to vegas

3665
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:42,800
together

3666
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:44,799
and then uh

3667
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:46,239
just kept doing wild thing after another

3668
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:48,480
wild thing uh

3669
02:05:46,238 --> 02:05:50,000
rogan opened up for whitney cummings

3670
02:05:48,479 --> 02:05:51,839
he just like showed up at a random party

3671
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,599
that he wasn't invited and he did a

3672
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:56,719
thing he almost started a fight because

3673
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:59,520
some guys said stop spread yelled at him

3674
02:05:56,719 --> 02:06:00,480
said stop spreading misinformation

3675
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:03,520
uh

3676
02:06:00,479 --> 02:06:04,799
and then uh we run into david goggins at

3677
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:07,520
vault this is my first time meeting

3678
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:09,199
david i i've talked to david a lot

3679
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:11,119
over the phone and we were supposed to

3680
02:06:09,198 --> 02:06:12,879
do a thing together and this is me trash

3681
02:06:11,118 --> 02:06:14,479
out of my mind

3682
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:16,639
meeting david for the first time with

3683
02:06:14,479 --> 02:06:18,319
his incredible wife oh rogan's wife was

3684
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:20,960
there by the way

3685
02:06:18,319 --> 02:06:23,198
joe rogan's wife david's wife

3686
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:24,399
made me realize that i really want to be

3687
02:06:23,198 --> 02:06:25,598
married

3688
02:06:24,399 --> 02:06:27,279
because

3689
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:28,840
they're not

3690
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:33,679
they make

3691
02:06:28,840 --> 02:06:35,840
um their partners better yeah like that

3692
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:37,920
i was

3693
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:39,520
um there's a certain aspect of marriage

3694
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:41,520
that i'm afraid of that like your

3695
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:44,719
partner takes you away from life you

3696
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:46,400
don't get to experience life as much um

3697
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:48,399
but this was like they were enriching

3698
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:50,078
them i don't know it's like

3699
02:06:48,399 --> 02:06:52,238
the world's most powerful support group

3700
02:06:50,078 --> 02:06:54,238
it was cool anyway so then of course

3701
02:06:52,238 --> 02:06:56,718
drunk lex is uh

3702
02:06:54,238 --> 02:06:58,718
challenges goggins to push-ups i saw

3703
02:06:56,719 --> 02:07:00,560
this on instagram whatever we're in the

3704
02:06:58,719 --> 02:07:02,560
middle of this and you're in your suit

3705
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:04,800
in this suit in the middle of casino

3706
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:06,719
there's a crowd gathering

3707
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:08,719
like it's joe rogan

3708
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:10,239
me and david goggins and i'm just doing

3709
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:12,399
push-ups with him and rogan is like

3710
02:07:10,238 --> 02:07:14,718
commentating and yelling and screaming

3711
02:07:12,399 --> 02:07:16,319
it was it was surreal and just going on

3712
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:18,960
to the next thing and next thing the

3713
02:07:16,319 --> 02:07:19,840
next thing like this and then drove

3714
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:23,279
um

3715
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:25,760
all the way from vegas back to uh to la

3716
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:26,559
with with joe and whitney and his wife

3717
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:28,719
and

3718
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:30,800
it was like what what is this and all of

3719
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:33,679
it is done in 24 hours

3720
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:35,360
the one valuable lesson is don't fast

3721
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:37,118
and drink

3722
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:39,279
like excessively

3723
02:07:37,118 --> 02:07:42,078
so i've learned that because what

3724
02:07:39,279 --> 02:07:44,399
happens is um

3725
02:07:42,078 --> 02:07:47,359
liquor hits your mind my mind sorry i'll

3726
02:07:44,399 --> 02:07:49,679
speak about my particular mind

3727
02:07:47,359 --> 02:07:52,238
like the intellectual part of my brain

3728
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:54,639
got hit really hard really fast so i was

3729
02:07:52,238 --> 02:07:56,559
not able to even more so than usual

3730
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:58,400
stitched together sentences i understood

3731
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:01,760
everybody well

3732
02:07:58,399 --> 02:08:01,759
so like major immigrant again

3733
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:07,360
so like meeting david i want to say so

3734
02:08:05,439 --> 02:08:11,678
many things he's so inspiring to me

3735
02:08:07,359 --> 02:08:14,000
right but all i said was like hello

3736
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:16,000
and uh and i like i remember like

3737
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:18,158
opening my mouth to like try to say more

3738
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,679
and i was like

3739
02:08:18,158 --> 02:08:22,479
and then i would just close my mouth and

3740
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:23,679
not be able to say anymore this is why

3741
02:08:22,479 --> 02:08:24,959
this is one of the reasons i don't drink

3742
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:27,440
ever damn

3743
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:30,078
it removes certain

3744
02:08:27,439 --> 02:08:32,238
barriers like it allows you to maybe

3745
02:08:30,078 --> 02:08:34,559
have fun that you wouldn't otherwise but

3746
02:08:32,238 --> 02:08:36,718
yeah definitely for a person who values

3747
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:38,320
intellectual

3748
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:40,239
eloquence and but i also hate being

3749
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:42,319
hungover the hungover party yeah that's

3750
02:08:40,238 --> 02:08:43,839
the worst yes and you also like i did

3751
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:45,198
this to myself

3752
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:47,119
yeah

3753
02:08:45,198 --> 02:08:48,559
but it also teaches me that this too

3754
02:08:47,118 --> 02:08:50,880
shall pass

3755
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:52,960
because i've been hungover and i've quit

3756
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:54,800
drinking so many times in my life

3757
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:57,118
that it realizes it makes you realize

3758
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:58,719
that all the unpleasant feelings

3759
02:08:57,118 --> 02:09:01,359
all you have to do is just wait it out

3760
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:03,118
okay fine it took me a long time to

3761
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:05,359
realize that that expression means the

3762
02:09:03,118 --> 02:09:06,799
other thing what's the other thing if

3763
02:09:05,359 --> 02:09:08,000
things are going great this too shall

3764
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:10,000
pass

3765
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,118
yeah i always talk about suffering no i

3766
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,399
always thought about it as being more

3767
02:09:11,118 --> 02:09:13,759
like don't worry if things are bad it'll

3768
02:09:12,399 --> 02:09:15,279
pass it's like it's also like if

3769
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:16,960
something's going great it's not gonna

3770
02:09:15,279 --> 02:09:19,198
be this way forever

3771
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:21,118
it's like buckowski said love is a fog

3772
02:09:19,198 --> 02:09:23,598
that fades with the first daylight of

3773
02:09:21,118 --> 02:09:23,598
reality

3774
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:29,039
do you think love can last

3775
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:32,560
oh yeah we're gonna win

3776
02:09:29,039 --> 02:09:34,319
who's we the good guys

3777
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:36,719
didn't hitler also think he's the good

3778
02:09:34,319 --> 02:09:38,979
guys he's wrong

3779
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:41,439
because you know why why he didn't win

3780
02:09:38,979 --> 02:09:44,000
[Laughter]

3781
02:09:41,439 --> 02:09:46,559
so you think it's permanent so the this

3782
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:49,679
one time the good guys winning it will

3783
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:51,679
last it won't pass

3784
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:55,679
because i think all of it passes

3785
02:09:51,679 --> 02:10:00,000
unfortunately i think we're going to

3786
02:09:55,679 --> 02:10:01,760
win and win big in the not so dis future

3787
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
do you have specific things in mind or

3788
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:07,280
no or just a sense about human

3789
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,679
civilization about society waking up

3790
02:10:07,279 --> 02:10:11,519
i don't know about waking up but i think

3791
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:12,840
the um

3792
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:14,880
increased

3793
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:17,199
understanding on

3794
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:18,239
all sides of the political spectrum

3795
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:19,519
that

3796
02:10:18,238 --> 02:10:21,439
um

3797
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,800
corporate america and corporate news

3798
02:10:21,439 --> 02:10:25,598
outlets

3799
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:28,400
uh are self-motivated actors and those

3800
02:10:25,599 --> 02:10:31,440
motivations are often inimical

3801
02:10:28,399 --> 02:10:32,960
to what others would regard as desirable

3802
02:10:31,439 --> 02:10:33,759
is something that i think is happening

3803
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:36,000
with

3804
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:37,679
increasing frequency

3805
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,238
so what do you think about

3806
02:10:37,679 --> 02:10:41,920
the the political landscape in general

3807
02:10:40,238 --> 02:10:43,678
you had a great conversation with glenn

3808
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:45,920
beck and he said that

3809
02:10:43,679 --> 02:10:47,760
uh he talked to trump and believes that

3810
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:50,800
trump is uh donald trump is definitely

3811
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:53,360
running in 2024 or very likely running

3812
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:57,039
in 2024. uh i think he said he thinks

3813
02:10:53,359 --> 02:10:58,799
he'll have a good chance of winning or

3814
02:10:57,039 --> 02:11:00,000
i don't remember that but

3815
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:02,560
the fact that he was running was a

3816
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:05,359
surprise to you do you think uh donald

3817
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:08,079
trump would be running in 2024 uh given

3818
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:10,319
that glenn beck

3819
02:11:08,078 --> 02:11:12,880
you know has a much better relationship

3820
02:11:10,319 --> 02:11:14,319
with trump than i do to put it mildly if

3821
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:16,319
glenn beck is certain this is going to

3822
02:11:14,319 --> 02:11:17,439
happen i would defer to glenn beck's

3823
02:11:16,319 --> 02:11:18,880
judgment

3824
02:11:17,439 --> 02:11:20,879
um do you think he has a chance of

3825
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:22,560
winning do you think he'll win anyone in

3826
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:24,239
a binary political system who's the

3827
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:26,639
nominee has a chance like whoever the

3828
02:11:24,238 --> 02:11:29,279
republican democrat has a chance i think

3829
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:30,880
also it's a lot easier to vote for

3830
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:31,840
someone that you have voted for in the

3831
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:33,279
past

3832
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:34,639
so that's why incumbents have a big

3833
02:11:33,279 --> 02:11:37,439
advantage there's not that psychological

3834
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:39,279
barrier to cover i think it's also

3835
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:42,638
useful for trump that he's banished for

3836
02:11:39,279 --> 02:11:43,519
social media because then

3837
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:45,920
he doesn't have to have the

3838
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:47,840
responsibility of governing um and all

3839
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:49,118
the costs of that you know because no

3840
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:50,078
matter what decisions you make while

3841
02:11:49,118 --> 02:11:51,359
governing some people aren't going to

3842
02:11:50,078 --> 02:11:53,439
like that

3843
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:55,118
so he gets to kind of be

3844
02:11:53,439 --> 02:11:56,000
above the radar or below the radar

3845
02:11:55,118 --> 02:11:58,319
rather

3846
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:01,679
to some extent i don't think it's at all

3847
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:02,960
a given that he would get the nomination

3848
02:12:01,679 --> 02:12:05,440
when i say the good guys are going to

3849
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:06,800
win i certainly don't mean donald trump

3850
02:12:05,439 --> 02:12:08,078
i don't think

3851
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:09,920
victory is going to come as a

3852
02:12:08,078 --> 02:12:12,559
consequence of washington

3853
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:14,639
do you want to make america great again

3854
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:15,520
i think america is great

3855
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:18,800
so

3856
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:21,199
uh this is my failed attempt at humor uh

3857
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:23,119
one of many uh there there are also hats

3858
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:24,158
that giuliani and jim jeffords wore that

3859
02:12:23,118 --> 02:12:25,920
said

3860
02:12:24,158 --> 02:12:27,519
people can look this up they said

3861
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:32,440
because they were in south the border

3862
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:32,440
make mexico great again also

3863
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:40,638
like that to me it was like like

3864
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:42,960
just the syntax there

3865
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:45,199
uh okay

3866
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:47,359
so you you you don't even think you

3867
02:12:45,198 --> 02:12:50,158
might get the nomination

3868
02:12:47,359 --> 02:12:52,559
if you who else might i mean they

3869
02:12:50,158 --> 02:12:53,439
if you had asked two year three years

3870
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:55,520
out

3871
02:12:53,439 --> 02:12:58,238
who the nominee in 2020 would be donald

3872
02:12:55,520 --> 02:13:00,159
trump wasn't even or 2016 rather wasn't

3873
02:12:58,238 --> 02:13:03,279
even on the on the radar screen so we

3874
02:13:00,158 --> 02:13:05,039
have a long way to go uh two years is a

3875
02:13:03,279 --> 02:13:07,039
long way to go yeah

3876
02:13:05,039 --> 02:13:08,719
um especially because we're coming out

3877
02:13:07,039 --> 02:13:10,399
of covid there might be some governor

3878
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:11,840
who becomes a rock star for some reason

3879
02:13:10,399 --> 02:13:13,198
maybe someone's gonna have some moment

3880
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:14,960
some congressmen

3881
02:13:13,198 --> 02:13:17,118
might have some big moment where they're

3882
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:18,560
you know screaming at somebody and

3883
02:13:17,118 --> 02:13:20,559
all of a sudden they become a rock star

3884
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:23,280
in the republican party it could be one

3885
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:24,960
of the celebrities we don't um

3886
02:13:23,279 --> 02:13:26,000
think about i mean donald trump is

3887
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:27,760
essentially

3888
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,520
not a political figure before right

3889
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:32,960
exactly so it could be

3890
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:34,719
any of the famous republic like um

3891
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:36,158
right-leaning

3892
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:37,520
celebrities

3893
02:13:36,158 --> 02:13:39,439
um

3894
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:41,520
i don't even know which way mcconaughey

3895
02:13:39,439 --> 02:13:43,198
lee uh leans no i think he's the lefty

3896
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:45,119
or he's the democrat but he's not

3897
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:47,039
running but but like people like that

3898
02:13:45,118 --> 02:13:48,319
just might step into the ring yeah i

3899
02:13:47,039 --> 02:13:49,359
don't think they'd have that much of a

3900
02:13:48,319 --> 02:13:51,840
chance because they're i think the

3901
02:13:49,359 --> 02:13:54,158
republican party there's a asymmetry

3902
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:55,440
they'd be much more skeptical of like an

3903
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:57,039
actor than the democrats would be

3904
02:13:55,439 --> 02:13:59,678
because they would regard that actor as

3905
02:13:57,039 --> 02:14:01,198
coming as a kind of um venturing

3906
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:03,199
candidate or whatever right but there's

3907
02:14:01,198 --> 02:14:04,960
other kinds of celebrities like uh jacob

3908
02:14:03,198 --> 02:14:06,638
could run as a as a republican that's a

3909
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:08,319
good example yeah yeah

3910
02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:10,239
that would be interesting so military

3911
02:14:08,319 --> 02:14:12,880
person right yeah

3912
02:14:10,238 --> 02:14:14,638
but already like for example dr oz is

3913
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:16,800
thinking of running force is going to

3914
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:18,800
run for the senate in pennsylvania and

3915
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:20,960
there's already been a lot of research

3916
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:22,960
people slamming him on twitter and

3917
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:24,239
social media for past positions he's

3918
02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:25,599
taken so

3919
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:26,718
um

3920
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:28,480
you know

3921
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:29,760
desantis is the figure of the moment but

3922
02:14:28,479 --> 02:14:31,598
scott walker was the figure of the

3923
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:34,560
moment in the 2016 cycle and he didn't

3924
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:34,560
even make it to iowa

3925
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:38,639
yeah and i wonder what

3926
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:40,639
role does covet play in all of this

3927
02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:42,239
right in terms of

3928
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:44,480
um

3929
02:14:42,238 --> 02:14:45,439
you know i'm mostly optimistic and

3930
02:14:44,479 --> 02:14:46,718
hopeful

3931
02:14:45,439 --> 02:14:49,519
about the world like when i look at the

3932
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:51,760
world i'm excited by most things i've

3933
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:53,199
been a little bit uh or a lot

3934
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:55,199
disappointed by

3935
02:14:53,198 --> 02:14:58,319
the lack of great leadership in a time

3936
02:14:55,198 --> 02:14:59,039
of trouble because to me one of the

3937
02:14:58,319 --> 02:15:01,519
uh

3938
02:14:59,039 --> 02:15:03,760
one of the great things about

3939
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:05,520
a difficult time

3940
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:07,360
is it brings out

3941
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:09,199
the great leaders

3942
02:15:07,359 --> 02:15:10,799
again it's the up and down things like

3943
02:15:09,198 --> 02:15:13,759
you don't want to ask for war you don't

3944
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:14,880
want to ask for pandemics but when they

3945
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:17,679
happen

3946
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:19,599
um it's it's a great opportunity for the

3947
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:21,760
human spirit to flourish and the fact

3948
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:24,159
that it didn't quite in the way that i

3949
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:25,679
hoped it would it's disappointing

3950
02:15:24,158 --> 02:15:28,000
i think there's still time too because

3951
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:29,199
people are trying to figure out

3952
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,279
what to do

3953
02:15:29,198 --> 02:15:32,559
as we emerge from the fog

3954
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:35,359
yeah

3955
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:36,400
so i'm excited by 2024 somebody said

3956
02:15:35,359 --> 02:15:39,118
this

3957
02:15:36,399 --> 02:15:40,960
dark cynical thing i i hope this is not

3958
02:15:39,118 --> 02:15:42,559
true but like that

3959
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:45,359
there was some doubt about the results

3960
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:47,360
of the election in 2020

3961
02:15:45,359 --> 02:15:48,960
that in 2024

3962
02:15:47,359 --> 02:15:51,039
both sides

3963
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:52,239
like it will just start becoming

3964
02:15:51,039 --> 02:15:53,359
standard

3965
02:15:52,238 --> 02:15:54,879
to

3966
02:15:53,359 --> 02:15:57,039
completely

3967
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:58,639
reject the results of an election no

3968
02:15:57,039 --> 02:16:00,800
matter who wins well that's my

3969
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:02,719
perspective i don't regard elections as

3970
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:04,320
legitimate um and i see what you're

3971
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:05,599
saying not in the terms of that that

3972
02:16:04,319 --> 02:16:07,519
basically the process itself was

3973
02:16:05,599 --> 02:16:08,880
illegitimate yes there's like cheating

3974
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:11,040
or something yeah but i think that

3975
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:13,440
that's pretty much

3976
02:16:11,039 --> 02:16:15,359
a given uh has been a given like it's

3977
02:16:13,439 --> 02:16:17,439
the republicans often say oh they got

3978
02:16:15,359 --> 02:16:18,559
all these illegals to vote you know or

3979
02:16:17,439 --> 02:16:20,479
the americans will say the voting

3980
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:21,920
machines were hacked or the media and so

3981
02:16:20,479 --> 02:16:23,919
on and so forth

3982
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:25,118
because despite all the

3983
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:26,239
people flapping their guns about

3984
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:27,839
democracy

3985
02:16:26,238 --> 02:16:30,479
they only like democracy when it gives

3986
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:32,159
them the results that they want

3987
02:16:30,479 --> 02:16:33,519
to ask about something else that glenn

3988
02:16:32,159 --> 02:16:35,519
beck said that i thought was really

3989
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:37,519
interesting i agree with him very much

3990
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:39,120
on this

3991
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:40,880
and it was refreshing to hear although

3992
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,719
he kind of made it

3993
02:16:40,879 --> 02:16:44,959
turned into a point about why trump is

3994
02:16:42,718 --> 02:16:47,279
great or whatever um

3995
02:16:44,959 --> 02:16:48,398
but the point was the following which is

3996
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:50,479
he doesn't

3997
02:16:48,398 --> 02:16:53,358
want to talk to anybody who can't say at

3998
02:16:50,478 --> 02:16:55,358
least one nice thing about

3999
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:56,960
everyone so like

4000
02:16:55,359 --> 02:16:59,359
if you don't like donald trump if you

4001
02:16:56,959 --> 02:17:01,119
don't like joe biden

4002
02:16:59,359 --> 02:17:03,840
you should still be able to say one nice

4003
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:05,599
thing like legitimate nice not just like

4004
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:08,799
a dismissive nice thing but legitimately

4005
02:17:05,599 --> 02:17:10,079
say what is one nice thing they did or

4006
02:17:08,799 --> 02:17:13,039
like uh

4007
02:17:10,079 --> 02:17:15,599
or who they are as a person

4008
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:17,679
not not like saying donald trump

4009
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:19,840
it's funny sometimes like no like

4010
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:21,920
legitimate where you really mean it and

4011
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:23,439
it's been really troubling to me how few

4012
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:24,879
people are able to do that about

4013
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:27,679
political figures

4014
02:17:24,879 --> 02:17:29,598
i had a lot of people

4015
02:17:27,679 --> 02:17:31,519
i've i think i tweeted something like

4016
02:17:29,599 --> 02:17:33,840
this leading up to the election

4017
02:17:31,519 --> 02:17:36,398
saying like you should be able to say

4018
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:38,719
something nice about both joe biden and

4019
02:17:36,398 --> 02:17:39,840
donald trump and i've had

4020
02:17:38,718 --> 02:17:41,358
um

4021
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:42,478
old friends

4022
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:45,120
um

4023
02:17:42,478 --> 02:17:46,959
i don't want to say specific i guess to

4024
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:49,120
call them out but they

4025
02:17:46,959 --> 02:17:51,358
several people one in particular like

4026
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:54,319
wrote me this long like several page

4027
02:17:51,359 --> 02:17:56,318
email saying sam it was sam harris this

4028
02:17:54,318 --> 02:17:57,039
is

4029
02:17:56,318 --> 02:17:59,039
no

4030
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:00,960
uh but

4031
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:03,280
uh i have a lot of conversations with

4032
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:05,199
sam harris now and joe on both sides

4033
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:07,040
it's like the devil and the the angel on

4034
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:08,800
both my i don't know which one is which

4035
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:11,840
but just angel

4036
02:18:08,799 --> 02:18:11,840
they're both devils

4037
02:18:12,638 --> 02:18:18,159
uh and they said how could you say

4038
02:18:15,679 --> 02:18:20,079
how could you even consider

4039
02:18:18,159 --> 02:18:22,000
like that there's something positive

4040
02:18:20,079 --> 02:18:24,398
about donald trump yeah here's an easy

4041
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,879
one he uh he has three

4042
02:18:24,398 --> 02:18:28,398
wives with three kids with each but they

4043
02:18:26,879 --> 02:18:30,239
all the kids get along

4044
02:18:28,398 --> 02:18:32,638
i think that's really commendable yeah

4045
02:18:30,239 --> 02:18:34,558
that donald trump jr and eric trump and

4046
02:18:32,638 --> 02:18:36,000
baron can all get along with each other

4047
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:37,840
given the circumstances i think that

4048
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,799
speaks to something as some someone as a

4049
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:41,840
father

4050
02:18:38,799 --> 02:18:44,239
ivanka so on the family level and i i

4051
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:45,920
see the same thing with actually uh one

4052
02:18:44,239 --> 02:18:48,799
of the reasons i

4053
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:50,879
always found joe biden fascinating is

4054
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:53,039
he's had a lot of really traumatic

4055
02:18:50,879 --> 02:18:55,119
things happen in his life yeah

4056
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:58,479
and uh if i [ __ ] my pants in front of

4057
02:18:55,120 --> 02:19:00,800
the pope i'd be traumatized too

4058
02:18:58,478 --> 02:19:02,799
i'm talking to a master troll about

4059
02:19:00,799 --> 02:19:05,199
something sensitive and beautiful that

4060
02:19:02,799 --> 02:19:06,478
is a man suffering with a loss i kind of

4061
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:09,359
know what he feels like right now i'm

4062
02:19:06,478 --> 02:19:09,358
pretending to the pope

4063
02:19:09,519 --> 02:19:14,159
this chair's ruined

4064
02:19:12,079 --> 02:19:17,120
sorry elon

4065
02:19:14,159 --> 02:19:17,119
you'd have to sit in it

4066
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:20,319
why is this chair feel

4067
02:19:26,638 --> 02:19:32,398
it's a pretty good elon impression

4068
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:35,120
uh but yeah i mean uh like one criticism

4069
02:19:32,398 --> 02:19:37,199
i tell joe

4070
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:38,800
rogan is like he

4071
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:40,960
he has trouble finding one positive

4072
02:19:38,799 --> 02:19:43,119
thing to say about joe biden for example

4073
02:19:40,959 --> 02:19:44,718
and i just don't i don't i don't like

4074
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:46,160
that i i want

4075
02:19:44,718 --> 02:19:47,759
i think

4076
02:19:46,159 --> 02:19:49,280
i mean i'm a big believer in the [ __ ]

4077
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:50,960
sandwich

4078
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:52,720
sticking on top here's an easy one i

4079
02:19:50,959 --> 02:19:54,318
think joe biden clearly is a very

4080
02:19:52,719 --> 02:19:55,920
amiable person

4081
02:19:54,318 --> 02:19:57,760
like what's the amiibo it gets along

4082
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:59,200
with people like it seems really clear

4083
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:00,719
that maybe before president because it's

4084
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:01,840
different near the president but that he

4085
02:20:00,719 --> 02:20:03,119
could call a lot of these republican

4086
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:05,040
senators get them on the phone and have

4087
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:06,640
a conversation with them yeah and it's

4088
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:07,600
not some kind of manipulation to some

4089
02:20:06,639 --> 02:20:09,760
extent it is because they're all

4090
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:11,280
politicians but they he clearly seemed

4091
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:13,760
to be able to get

4092
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:16,399
wasn't like a an ideologue

4093
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:17,840
yeah yeah i mean but there's i mean

4094
02:20:16,398 --> 02:20:20,000
maybe i'm a sucker for that kind of

4095
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:22,159
thing but uh the blue collar thing like

4096
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:25,359
riding the train you know the there's

4097
02:20:22,159 --> 02:20:27,359
ways to connect with people and not it's

4098
02:20:25,359 --> 02:20:29,359
seeing them as equals no matter where

4099
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:31,120
their walks of life are and i love it

4100
02:20:29,359 --> 02:20:32,159
when presidents do that

4101
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:35,200
uh

4102
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:37,359
to some degree because of the wealth

4103
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:39,760
under which donald trump existed for a

4104
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:43,200
lot of his recent life he's less able to

4105
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:45,200
do that quite naturally

4106
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:47,200
maybe sometimes obama wasn't quite able

4107
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:49,439
the question i who's more blue collar

4108
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:51,760
trump or or biden and you you can easily

4109
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:53,760
make the case for both i think you could

4110
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:56,239
no not the blue collar but like

4111
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:58,880
like literally be able to fit in at a

4112
02:20:56,239 --> 02:21:00,559
bar at a local bar and just like

4113
02:20:58,879 --> 02:21:02,559
i can see both of them yeah you're right

4114
02:21:00,559 --> 02:21:04,478
i could do both of them yeah and in fact

4115
02:21:02,559 --> 02:21:05,760
obama doesn't quite no because he's got

4116
02:21:04,478 --> 02:21:07,119
that ivy league if you had the ivy

4117
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:08,079
league thing yeah yeah

4118
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:09,920
um

4119
02:21:08,079 --> 02:21:12,559
yeah you're right

4120
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:13,600
uh somehow donald trump can too easily

4121
02:21:12,559 --> 02:21:15,279
yeah you can see him having a beer with

4122
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:18,159
the guys and yelling at the screen this

4123
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:20,399
is [ __ ] change the channel

4124
02:21:18,159 --> 02:21:21,760
yeah and yeah i hope people do i think

4125
02:21:20,398 --> 02:21:23,599
that's one of the

4126
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:24,840
most unpleasant things to me

4127
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:28,079
is

4128
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:29,760
um they're not able to

4129
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:31,439
empathize with the fact that half the

4130
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:33,200
country voted for another well it's also

4131
02:21:31,439 --> 02:21:34,880
then it's just a bad strategy if you

4132
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:36,240
can't figure out why

4133
02:21:34,879 --> 02:21:38,159
half the country is voting for someone

4134
02:21:36,239 --> 02:21:39,199
you guard is like a demon well then how

4135
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:41,039
are you gonna supposed to fight this

4136
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:43,920
demon like you know when i did your

4137
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:45,439
reader the north korea book it's like

4138
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:47,040
don't you want to understand

4139
02:21:45,439 --> 02:21:49,040
how these people

4140
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:50,399
get to where they got it's no one's

4141
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:51,840
saying that he's a good person but like

4142
02:21:50,398 --> 02:21:53,760
there's a logic to their there's a

4143
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:55,200
method to their madness

4144
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:57,760
you've uh you've talked about national

4145
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:59,520
divorce a few times i've seen a couple

4146
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:00,880
videos recently where you're responding

4147
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:02,239
to articles

4148
02:22:00,879 --> 02:22:03,920
it's kind of cool

4149
02:22:02,239 --> 02:22:04,879
um

4150
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:07,280
can you

4151
02:22:04,879 --> 02:22:09,039
talk about this idea of national divorce

4152
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:12,880
and as it stands today

4153
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:14,560
uh arguing for it maybe and if you could

4154
02:22:12,879 --> 02:22:16,239
just out of curious in the context of

4155
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:18,000
those videos if you can steal man an

4156
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:20,000
argument against

4157
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,559
uh so i was the first one to kind of

4158
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,000
bring this issue back into the national

4159
02:22:22,559 --> 02:22:25,359
um

4160
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:28,639
conversation i wrote a piece for

4161
02:22:25,359 --> 02:22:30,800
observer in 2016. then jesse kelly had a

4162
02:22:28,639 --> 02:22:32,719
piece a few months after that daver boy

4163
02:22:30,799 --> 02:22:34,478
just recently did a piece on his stub

4164
02:22:32,719 --> 02:22:37,199
stack earlier this year

4165
02:22:34,478 --> 02:22:39,920
and it's become enough of a

4166
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:41,200
mainstreamed idea that um paleontology

4167
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:42,960
outlets like the national review have

4168
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:45,359
felt the need to respond to them

4169
02:22:42,959 --> 02:22:46,719
so the point being that america has had

4170
02:22:45,359 --> 02:22:47,680
at least two cultures since the

4171
02:22:46,719 --> 02:22:49,519
beginning

4172
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:51,600
and that there's absolutely no reason

4173
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:54,399
and these cultures in recent years and

4174
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:55,920
this was in 2016 not mentioned 2021 have

4175
02:22:54,398 --> 02:22:57,840
been increasingly antagonistic toward

4176
02:22:55,920 --> 02:23:00,398
one another and have even lost the

4177
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:01,840
ability to communicate they're using

4178
02:23:00,398 --> 02:23:03,119
language in different ways

4179
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:05,760
and that there's no reason for this to

4180
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:06,960
continue any uh further

4181
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:08,398
um and

4182
02:23:06,959 --> 02:23:10,719
you know just

4183
02:23:08,398 --> 02:23:12,799
you live your life we'll live hours and

4184
02:23:10,719 --> 02:23:14,959
you know good goodbye and good luck

4185
02:23:12,799 --> 02:23:16,159
there's no harm no ill will

4186
02:23:14,959 --> 02:23:17,679
um

4187
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:19,200
now there's lots of arguments against

4188
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:21,439
them some of this are

4189
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:23,040
are completely i think stupid uh the

4190
02:23:21,439 --> 02:23:25,200
stupidest one

4191
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:27,439
is well that's what china wants okay

4192
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:29,040
well i i mean i'm not going to live my

4193
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:30,398
life saying i'm just going to do the

4194
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:33,040
opposite or whatever china wants that

4195
02:23:30,398 --> 02:23:34,959
that's that's not logic that's not a

4196
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:36,399
good pathway now i'm not saying that

4197
02:23:34,959 --> 02:23:37,919
right or wrong but that's not a reason

4198
02:23:36,398 --> 02:23:40,239
one way or another yeah you bring up

4199
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:42,639
china or russia you know that's exactly

4200
02:23:40,239 --> 02:23:45,680
what uh china and russia want but sort

4201
02:23:42,639 --> 02:23:46,398
of the strong way to phrase that

4202
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:48,720
is

4203
02:23:46,398 --> 02:23:48,719
um

4204
02:23:48,879 --> 02:23:54,239
it weakens

4205
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:56,159
america like not just

4206
02:23:54,239 --> 02:23:59,840
the one america but

4207
02:23:56,159 --> 02:24:02,318
like both sides in the divorce will be

4208
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:03,520
much weaker than they individually were

4209
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:06,079
together

4210
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:08,319
so in that sense not that you have to

4211
02:24:06,079 --> 02:24:10,318
care about what china thinks but like

4212
02:24:08,318 --> 02:24:12,239
it's a step but it's a big step

4213
02:24:10,318 --> 02:24:13,680
backwards yes i think in the short term

4214
02:24:12,239 --> 02:24:15,680
it is absolute big step backwards in

4215
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:17,439
terms of power uh there's no question

4216
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:18,880
that you know when you're trying to

4217
02:24:17,439 --> 02:24:20,720
reestablish a society there's going to

4218
02:24:18,879 --> 02:24:22,719
be a transition period that transition

4219
02:24:20,719 --> 02:24:24,478
is going to be costly uh each side

4220
02:24:22,719 --> 02:24:25,599
starts wondering wait a minute why are

4221
02:24:24,478 --> 02:24:26,879
we still doing this we don't have to

4222
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,960
anymore we're not living with them so on

4223
02:24:26,879 --> 02:24:30,000
and so forth so that's going to be a

4224
02:24:28,959 --> 02:24:32,719
concern

4225
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:33,840
um i don't think that the whole point of

4226
02:24:32,719 --> 02:24:36,159
america

4227
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:37,760
uh or even a large primary point of

4228
02:24:36,159 --> 02:24:40,079
america is to be a bulwark against

4229
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:42,318
chinese power and there's gonna be very

4230
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:45,600
few people on earth you know given my

4231
02:24:42,318 --> 02:24:47,680
work who have as much uh informed hatred

4232
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:51,600
and contempt for the chinese government

4233
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:53,520
as i do uh certainly um you know next to

4234
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:56,559
the north korean people maybe the people

4235
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:58,560
from eritrea there's few populations who

4236
02:24:56,559 --> 02:25:00,478
i'm as worried about as uh the people

4237
02:24:58,559 --> 02:25:02,478
under the rule of the red chinese

4238
02:25:00,478 --> 02:25:04,398
my steel man argument is

4239
02:25:02,478 --> 02:25:05,920
there's no way this is gonna be peaceful

4240
02:25:04,398 --> 02:25:08,478
because the lines don't separate out

4241
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:10,559
well so all you're doing is basically

4242
02:25:08,478 --> 02:25:12,639
just replicating the problem because the

4243
02:25:10,559 --> 02:25:14,000
disparity isn't between you know like

4244
02:25:12,639 --> 02:25:15,760
during the civil war north and south

4245
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:17,920
it's like it's between new york city and

4246
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:20,159
upstate new york between chicago

4247
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:23,280
downstate chicago once you get outside

4248
02:25:20,159 --> 02:25:25,680
of la and like sacramento uh california

4249
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:28,079
in many ways like kentucky so it doesn't

4250
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:29,359
make sense so that's a strong argument i

4251
02:25:28,079 --> 02:25:31,280
mean you've talked about that this

4252
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:33,120
process would be painful right it can't

4253
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:35,120
be pain and we're not just talking about

4254
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:37,040
violence it could be just

4255
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:39,439
even the civil war you could divide it

4256
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:41,520
clean somewhat cleanly

4257
02:25:39,439 --> 02:25:43,200
obviously the kind of national divorce

4258
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:45,040
you might be suggesting

4259
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:47,040
is yeah people are living amongst each

4260
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:49,120
other so you have to literally move it's

4261
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:51,280
complicated right so that is a very

4262
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:52,880
strong argument it's i think a cogent

4263
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:54,319
argument against it

4264
02:25:52,879 --> 02:25:56,478
two is

4265
02:25:54,318 --> 02:25:57,920
it's not just china it's that there's a

4266
02:25:56,478 --> 02:26:00,079
lot of

4267
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:01,680
bad actors in the world who maybe aren't

4268
02:26:00,079 --> 02:26:03,520
like china certainly wants to carry

4269
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:06,479
itself and have an appearance at least

4270
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:09,439
on the world stage as civilized and a

4271
02:26:06,478 --> 02:26:10,959
leader there's lots of smaller countries

4272
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:12,239
who without us

4273
02:26:10,959 --> 02:26:13,759
are going to feel comfortable doing some

4274
02:26:12,239 --> 02:26:15,039
very nefarious things

4275
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,159
um and

4276
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:17,840
they're not going to be scared of us

4277
02:26:16,159 --> 02:26:19,520
anymore and so that would be a bigger

4278
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:21,200
concern in many regards than china so i

4279
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:24,560
think that's a reasonable one

4280
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:27,200
um it could be that both sides if this

4281
02:26:24,559 --> 02:26:28,000
happens are gonna instead of work toward

4282
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:29,520
better

4283
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,760
the things that make each side bad would

4284
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:33,280
get worse yeah and that's you know

4285
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:34,960
having those pushed towards the

4286
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:37,520
malevolent extremes is i think a very

4287
02:26:34,959 --> 02:26:39,119
legitimate criticism and a concern

4288
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:41,200
i mean as you suggested there's no

4289
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:42,160
guarantee that won't happen correct at

4290
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:43,439
all

4291
02:26:42,159 --> 02:26:45,119
also

4292
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:46,559
there's a i think a reasonable argument

4293
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,760
to make is like are you

4294
02:26:46,559 --> 02:26:49,680
america

4295
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:51,520
just as a symbol and the myth of america

4296
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:53,439
and i don't mean myth in a negative

4297
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:54,560
sense do you really want to throw that

4298
02:26:53,439 --> 02:26:56,000
on the garbage

4299
02:26:54,559 --> 02:26:57,920
like this meant a lot for a lot of

4300
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:59,840
people and a lot for history you're just

4301
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:01,680
going to be like okay good

4302
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:02,960
good work we're we're done here let's

4303
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:06,639
shut the lights so that's a i think a

4304
02:27:02,959 --> 02:27:09,919
reasonable argument so those are the

4305
02:27:06,639 --> 02:27:10,799
um biggest ones i would say and and

4306
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:13,280
still

4307
02:27:10,799 --> 02:27:14,079
what is the case for national divorce

4308
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:18,239
and

4309
02:27:14,079 --> 02:27:20,398
along which lines so like um

4310
02:27:18,239 --> 02:27:22,559
in making the case for national divorce

4311
02:27:20,398 --> 02:27:24,239
if it is desired

4312
02:27:22,559 --> 02:27:25,840
based on which kind of ideas do you

4313
02:27:24,239 --> 02:27:27,600
think it should be

4314
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:29,600
uh carried through i honestly i don't

4315
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:32,399
know that it has to be idea based like

4316
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:35,200
for example when czechoslovakia broke up

4317
02:27:32,398 --> 02:27:37,599
when norway and sweden broke up it

4318
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:40,159
wasn't really ideological

4319
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,960
it was more cultural

4320
02:27:40,159 --> 02:27:43,359
so

4321
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:44,639
i always say divorce into two but it

4322
02:27:43,359 --> 02:27:46,239
would probably make more sense if it was

4323
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:48,079
like five

4324
02:27:46,239 --> 02:27:50,000
because the northeast certainly new

4325
02:27:48,079 --> 02:27:52,159
england has their own culture

4326
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:54,639
the west coast has their own kind of

4327
02:27:52,159 --> 02:27:56,879
culture i don't know the thing is

4328
02:27:54,639 --> 02:27:59,519
in any kind of

4329
02:27:56,879 --> 02:28:01,279
persuasion technique right like once

4330
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:02,319
people are start

4331
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:04,159
this there's there's a difference

4332
02:28:02,318 --> 02:28:06,478
between convincing someone they want to

4333
02:28:04,159 --> 02:28:07,359
buy a car and what features you want so

4334
02:28:06,478 --> 02:28:08,639
if you're at the point where we're

4335
02:28:07,359 --> 02:28:10,159
arguing about the features then my work

4336
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:12,000
here is done you know what i mean like i

4337
02:28:10,159 --> 02:28:12,959
don't have a dog in the fight in terms

4338
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,239
of what it's going to look like i just

4339
02:28:12,959 --> 02:28:16,719
want to get to the point where you're at

4340
02:28:14,239 --> 02:28:18,239
least considering seriously the idea of

4341
02:28:16,719 --> 02:28:19,438
breaking up america and i would

4342
02:28:18,239 --> 02:28:20,719
encourage people to go look at my

4343
02:28:19,439 --> 02:28:22,800
article to see

4344
02:28:20,719 --> 02:28:24,879
which i'm sure the arguments still hold

4345
02:28:22,799 --> 02:28:28,318
uh five years later do you have a kind

4346
02:28:24,879 --> 02:28:30,478
of vision of which of the two or which

4347
02:28:28,318 --> 02:28:34,000
of the five

4348
02:28:30,478 --> 02:28:34,000
like you actually have specific

4349
02:28:34,079 --> 02:28:40,959
cultures i'll tell you exactly yeah if i

4350
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:43,200
told you and everyone listening in 2014

4351
02:28:40,959 --> 02:28:44,879
we weren't that long ago long ago

4352
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:46,079
which of these two things is more likely

4353
02:28:44,879 --> 02:28:47,599
to happen

4354
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:49,439
2014

4355
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:51,600
texas secedes

4356
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:53,439
or declare secession from america or

4357
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:55,280
donald trump gets elected president

4358
02:28:53,439 --> 02:28:57,040
everyone's voting for texas

4359
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:59,600
like in terms of prediction which is

4360
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:00,800
more likely so we had this one so it's

4361
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:02,479
not all unlikely we're going to have

4362
02:29:00,799 --> 02:29:05,358
this one i don't know if that logic

4363
02:29:02,478 --> 02:29:07,358
carries through you can't just say

4364
02:29:05,359 --> 02:29:09,520
here's an unlikely thing that happened

4365
02:29:07,359 --> 02:29:10,880
therefore anything can happen i just

4366
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:12,880
said you just earlier said anything had

4367
02:29:10,879 --> 02:29:14,478
happened this episode didn't you life is

4368
02:29:12,879 --> 02:29:17,039
suffering i wasn't listening to half the

4369
02:29:14,478 --> 02:29:18,639
things you're saying you said it i said

4370
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:20,240
it yes you said anything can happen i'm

4371
02:29:18,639 --> 02:29:22,079
definitely not here i'm like you with

4372
02:29:20,239 --> 02:29:24,639
podcasts i do a podcast but i don't

4373
02:29:22,079 --> 02:29:24,639
listen to it

4374
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:28,960
okay

4375
02:29:26,239 --> 02:29:30,398
so yeah yeah it can happen but in which

4376
02:29:28,959 --> 02:29:32,318
i guess i'm asking would you stay in

4377
02:29:30,398 --> 02:29:35,199
texas a hundred percent so texas and i'd

4378
02:29:32,318 --> 02:29:36,559
run for office probably it'd be fun

4379
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,920
no i'm gonna be the first president of

4380
02:29:36,559 --> 02:29:40,719
texas

4381
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:42,000
i attended a debate between uh yaran

4382
02:29:40,719 --> 02:29:43,840
brooks and

4383
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:45,359
joram

4384
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:47,760
hazoni i don't know if you know who that

4385
02:29:45,359 --> 02:29:49,520
is the nationalist guy yeah he wrote a

4386
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:50,639
book called the virtue of nashville i

4387
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:52,159
read that book

4388
02:29:50,639 --> 02:29:54,000
and then actually did a podcast with

4389
02:29:52,159 --> 02:29:55,359
them they did a debate

4390
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:57,680
they both run here

4391
02:29:55,359 --> 02:30:00,399
okay it was quite interesting and i

4392
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:03,600
tried to wear my michael mal's hat

4393
02:30:00,398 --> 02:30:06,079
so the you're wearing it

4394
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:07,680
you now that from me yeah

4395
02:30:06,079 --> 02:30:10,079
um

4396
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:11,600
it's funny because the metaphor applies

4397
02:30:10,079 --> 02:30:14,639
across

4398
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:17,680
all of these level of collectivism so he

4399
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:19,279
was arguing that for the power of nation

4400
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:21,920
so you he would be arguing against

4401
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:25,359
national divorce but he was also

4402
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:27,520
arguing for marriage the power of actual

4403
02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:30,559
marriage between individuals like

4404
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:32,880
um i think he's a conservative and what

4405
02:30:30,559 --> 02:30:35,359
i really like about him is there's a

4406
02:30:32,879 --> 02:30:38,639
clear philosophy of conservatism that he

4407
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:41,040
expresses and i think a lot of people

4408
02:30:38,639 --> 02:30:44,239
get behind that philosophy because uh to

4409
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:46,880
me like conservatism and liberalism

4410
02:30:44,239 --> 02:30:48,639
often is very kind of used loosely yes

4411
02:30:46,879 --> 02:30:50,559
he has a clear philosophy that he's

4412
02:30:48,639 --> 02:30:53,039
expressing there and is grounded in

4413
02:30:50,559 --> 02:30:54,559
tradition he has a lot of value in

4414
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:57,200
tradition and so

4415
02:30:54,559 --> 02:30:58,959
it's the thing you said about america

4416
02:30:57,200 --> 02:31:02,159
like one of the one of the arguments

4417
02:30:58,959 --> 02:31:05,358
against national divorce is like listen

4418
02:31:02,159 --> 02:31:07,119
um we've been at it for a while like

4419
02:31:05,359 --> 02:31:08,640
there is a lot of value

4420
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:10,399
in the fact that we've been at it for a

4421
02:31:08,639 --> 02:31:12,478
while don't just throw it all away all

4422
02:31:10,398 --> 02:31:15,680
the time so he says like philosophically

4423
02:31:12,478 --> 02:31:18,639
he seems in a lot of walks of life

4424
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:21,200
revolution is should be

4425
02:31:18,639 --> 02:31:23,680
avoided as much as possible i agree and

4426
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:25,200
so it's kind of interesting

4427
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:27,439
so he makes the case that there's

4428
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:29,120
something fundamentally powerful about

4429
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:32,159
the nation

4430
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:35,280
that we uh it's a it's a

4431
02:31:32,159 --> 02:31:36,799
it's a nice way to group a culture

4432
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:38,880
and

4433
02:31:36,799 --> 02:31:41,519
so national divorce i guess goes against

4434
02:31:38,879 --> 02:31:43,279
that i mean do you find some aspect of

4435
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:44,479
the virtue of nationalism as you would

4436
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:46,479
put it

4437
02:31:44,478 --> 02:31:49,119
powerful

4438
02:31:46,478 --> 02:31:50,799
well powerful and in in a good sense or

4439
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:52,319
in a good sense so sorry yeah in a good

4440
02:31:50,799 --> 02:31:54,559
sense like well yeah it brings out the

4441
02:31:52,318 --> 02:31:56,000
best in humans i know at the best but it

4442
02:31:54,559 --> 02:31:57,600
certainly brings out good things i have

4443
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,959
that line i always say about i love my

4444
02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:00,479
country i hate the government because i

4445
02:31:58,959 --> 02:32:02,478
love my country yeah

4446
02:32:00,478 --> 02:32:03,840
so there is a love of country i think

4447
02:32:02,478 --> 02:32:06,318
it's value but i i don't know that

4448
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:07,840
that's the i think

4449
02:32:06,318 --> 02:32:10,000
it's also the case because the country

4450
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:12,639
happens to be america like i don't know

4451
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:14,559
if i was living in you know whatever i

4452
02:32:12,639 --> 02:32:17,039
don't want to insult someone's country

4453
02:32:14,559 --> 02:32:18,239
um uh canada yeah if i was living in

4454
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:20,000
canada i don't know that would be the

4455
02:32:18,239 --> 02:32:22,000
truth this is a guy who calls basically

4456
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:23,600
every other country [ __ ] country

4457
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:25,680
yeah that's true that's that's that's

4458
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:27,520
the fact yeah yeah so it's either you're

4459
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:30,398
either there's two types of countries

4460
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:33,200
texas or shitholes um oh wow you went

4461
02:32:30,398 --> 02:32:34,719
full texas so you you you you're okay

4462
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:35,760
burning the northeast of the ground at

4463
02:32:34,719 --> 02:32:37,519
this point

4464
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:38,639
okay i'm hoping for it i'm gonna call

4465
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:40,479
hope

4466
02:32:38,639 --> 02:32:42,159
what they've done to new york city i

4467
02:32:40,478 --> 02:32:44,318
will never forgive these people

4468
02:32:42,159 --> 02:32:46,639
um and i hope that they suffer

4469
02:32:44,318 --> 02:32:48,159
enormously uh consequences for what

4470
02:32:46,639 --> 02:32:51,199
they've done to new york

4471
02:32:48,159 --> 02:32:53,439
um it's unforget it's unconscionable

4472
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:56,000
the assault they've done and and no

4473
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:57,760
remorse over how many uh uh creative

4474
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:59,439
outlets that they've destroyed yes the

4475
02:32:57,760 --> 02:33:01,120
cultural hub cultural center of the

4476
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:03,680
world

4477
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:06,240
new york was the sim this was the place

4478
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:08,479
where you go to put up your shingle and

4479
02:33:06,239 --> 02:33:11,039
and move the needle and make things

4480
02:33:08,478 --> 02:33:12,959
happen uh and i would understand if it

4481
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:14,240
was like okay we gotta suffer through

4482
02:33:12,959 --> 02:33:17,438
this for a year but we're gonna make

4483
02:33:14,239 --> 02:33:19,119
sure all these businesses have a

4484
02:33:17,439 --> 02:33:20,880
kind of safety net to make sure that

4485
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:23,439
they kind of get through and survive

4486
02:33:20,879 --> 02:33:25,599
this which they did to the banks in 2008

4487
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:27,600
for example um and i'm saying this is an

4488
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:29,120
anarchist and there was none of that so

4489
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:31,840
i i

4490
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:33,680
burn it down and salt the earth uh it's

4491
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:34,478
it's because it's like watching like a

4492
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:36,479
zombie

4493
02:33:34,478 --> 02:33:37,920
it's on it's unnatural it's it's an

4494
02:33:36,478 --> 02:33:40,159
abomination

4495
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:41,840
so i mean sort of on the on the white

4496
02:33:40,159 --> 02:33:44,559
pill side of things i i don't know about

4497
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:47,120
you maybe i have a sense that uh both

4498
02:33:44,559 --> 02:33:48,799
silicon valley that for me personally

4499
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:50,479
maybe i have the same intensity of

4500
02:33:48,799 --> 02:33:52,719
feeling as you do about

4501
02:33:50,478 --> 02:33:53,760
new york it's just disappointing to see

4502
02:33:52,719 --> 02:33:56,079
it

4503
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:58,559
be consumed with cynicism

4504
02:33:56,079 --> 02:34:00,559
and a lot of other paralyzing forces but

4505
02:33:58,559 --> 02:34:04,318
i still have hope for that place

4506
02:34:00,559 --> 02:34:05,119
i think it's maybe it's the

4507
02:34:04,318 --> 02:34:07,439
uh

4508
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:09,439
yoram kind of tradition hope that

4509
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:12,398
through momentum

4510
02:34:09,439 --> 02:34:15,520
this the strong reemerges

4511
02:34:12,398 --> 02:34:17,760
so like i have hope for new york i think

4512
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:20,159
new york will continue like

4513
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:21,680
not maybe on a scale of years but a

4514
02:34:20,159 --> 02:34:23,280
scale of decades

4515
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:26,079
it would be ups and downs where it

4516
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:28,319
reemerges as a cultural center i just

4517
02:34:26,079 --> 02:34:31,439
can't imagine a place like new york is

4518
02:34:28,318 --> 02:34:33,039
like paris there's going to be long

4519
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:34,960
stretches of time

4520
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:36,560
where it leads the world

4521
02:34:34,959 --> 02:34:38,639
paris has not been a cultural hub for a

4522
02:34:36,559 --> 02:34:40,959
very long time yeah

4523
02:34:38,639 --> 02:34:45,840
yeah you know the days of matisse and

4524
02:34:40,959 --> 02:34:45,839
picasso and gertrude stein are long gone

4525
02:34:46,799 --> 02:34:50,879
it's still it still is a hub even london

4526
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:52,880
isn't like yeah

4527
02:34:50,879 --> 02:34:55,199
you know you're not there but what it is

4528
02:34:52,879 --> 02:34:56,959
then london is still london paris is

4529
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:59,600
still paris yeah it's not the paris of

4530
02:34:56,959 --> 02:35:01,039
old right london of all london is still

4531
02:34:59,600 --> 02:35:03,359
a place

4532
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:05,680
it's a it's a tech hub it's a fashion

4533
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:07,840
hub it's a music hub i mean it's still a

4534
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:10,079
pretty strong hub yeah but not like

4535
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:12,000
during the beatles era right it's not

4536
02:35:10,079 --> 02:35:14,478
like or during the sex pistols era but

4537
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:16,639
that's it could be just us romanticizing

4538
02:35:14,478 --> 02:35:18,478
the past because what is a hub then no

4539
02:35:16,639 --> 02:35:20,879
it's not rem without romanticizing the

4540
02:35:18,478 --> 02:35:22,879
past because a hub is

4541
02:35:20,879 --> 02:35:25,438
the place where everyone on earth our

4542
02:35:22,879 --> 02:35:26,799
eyes are on you so in the late 60s the

4543
02:35:25,439 --> 02:35:28,720
british and the mid 60s you see the

4544
02:35:26,799 --> 02:35:30,478
british invasion you know the kinks and

4545
02:35:28,719 --> 02:35:32,639
all these other bands coming out of

4546
02:35:30,478 --> 02:35:34,398
uh great britain like they were the

4547
02:35:32,639 --> 02:35:36,239
innovators this was the this this was

4548
02:35:34,398 --> 02:35:38,318
the place that was happening well in

4549
02:35:36,239 --> 02:35:41,359
that sense like and brooklyn you know 15

4550
02:35:38,318 --> 02:35:43,920
years ago

4551
02:35:41,359 --> 02:35:46,960
but i guess uh maybe in that sense in

4552
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:49,200
the 21st century geographical hubs are

4553
02:35:46,959 --> 02:35:51,199
becoming a thing of the past so like um

4554
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:54,000
you can be a hub in the digital space

4555
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:54,880
now so like it's not maybe you'll never

4556
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,478
have

4557
02:35:54,879 --> 02:35:58,239
i don't think i think there will always

4558
02:35:56,478 --> 02:36:00,000
be

4559
02:35:58,239 --> 02:36:01,600
i mean what i'm saying digital space

4560
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:04,159
makes it easier for let's suppose

4561
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:05,520
cleveland to be a hub right because all

4562
02:36:04,159 --> 02:36:07,359
you need like 10 people who happen to

4563
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:10,479
live in cleveland or you know akron was

4564
02:36:07,359 --> 02:36:12,800
a minor all it takes is 10 to 50 people

4565
02:36:10,478 --> 02:36:15,279
to create a yeah and maybe even less

4566
02:36:12,799 --> 02:36:16,879
maybe it's just uh two or three

4567
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:18,399
affordable i mean there's been no

4568
02:36:16,879 --> 02:36:20,959
shortage of articles talking about

4569
02:36:18,398 --> 02:36:22,799
austin and what's happening here um and

4570
02:36:20,959 --> 02:36:25,119
i know some of joe's plans and and you

4571
02:36:22,799 --> 02:36:26,159
and i and and blair and and all these

4572
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:28,160
other people that you know my buddy

4573
02:36:26,159 --> 02:36:29,840
andrew heaton moved here he's just one

4574
02:36:28,159 --> 02:36:31,439
of the best people i know it's just i'm

4575
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:33,120
really really excited

4576
02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:34,880
can i ask you some weird thing about

4577
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:40,240
friendship of course because you

4578
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:41,679
mentioned um sam he's mr harris to you

4579
02:36:40,239 --> 02:36:43,760
and then didn't that bother you how he

4580
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:45,120
went after joe uh what did he do he's

4581
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:46,639
like oh in case you guys have brain

4582
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:48,560
damage from watching rogan's last

4583
02:36:46,639 --> 02:36:50,398
episode like watch here's the answer and

4584
02:36:48,559 --> 02:36:52,000
it's all like digs like that yeah yeah i

4585
02:36:50,398 --> 02:36:53,920
didn't like that i didn't like that

4586
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,239
either uh i think sam doesn't like it

4587
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:58,000
either about himself okay

4588
02:36:56,239 --> 02:36:59,520
uh he regressed those things because

4589
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,959
it's very easy to say from his

4590
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:02,800
perspective

4591
02:37:00,959 --> 02:37:04,000
look

4592
02:37:02,799 --> 02:37:05,920
this isn't the full size we're all going

4593
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:07,760
to show you the full size story here's

4594
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:09,040
the other side of the story please watch

4595
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:10,960
this and be informed that's a very

4596
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:12,800
reasonable thing to say

4597
02:37:10,959 --> 02:37:15,119
yeah i don't quite understand this so

4598
02:37:12,799 --> 02:37:17,438
they do this about each other now

4599
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:19,760
um i'll put three people on the table

4600
02:37:17,439 --> 02:37:21,520
which is joe rogan sam harrison and

4601
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:24,239
brett weinstein

4602
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:27,280
and they have a way of talking like the

4603
02:37:24,239 --> 02:37:28,079
other person is creating a lot of harm

4604
02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:30,399
like

4605
02:37:28,079 --> 02:37:33,520
publicly would say things like that and

4606
02:37:30,398 --> 02:37:37,358
i understand there's emotion in it

4607
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:40,239
but like these are human beings

4608
02:37:37,359 --> 02:37:41,600
that are friends of yours but i'll go

4609
02:37:40,239 --> 02:37:43,439
the other way let's suppose it is true

4610
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:45,040
that joe's doing a lot of harm spreading

4611
02:37:43,439 --> 02:37:47,040
misinformation

4612
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:48,399
being sarcastic isn't going to be

4613
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:50,640
persuasive

4614
02:37:48,398 --> 02:37:53,279
whereas if you're like he's wrong

4615
02:37:50,639 --> 02:37:55,119
here's the facts or hears or be informed

4616
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:56,399
that i to me but then i'm not sam harris

4617
02:37:55,120 --> 02:37:57,600
i'm not a he's got a bigger audience to

4618
02:37:56,398 --> 02:38:00,478
me so maybe he's the one who's right i'm

4619
02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:02,318
wrong no he's well he's just human

4620
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:04,719
okay well i can't relate

4621
02:38:02,318 --> 02:38:06,239
well have you seen your twitter lately i

4622
02:38:04,719 --> 02:38:07,920
mean you're twi you get very you have a

4623
02:38:06,239 --> 02:38:09,520
lot of fun on twitter i feel like

4624
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:11,359
twitter lets

4625
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:14,720
i've never done that with someone i'm

4626
02:38:11,359 --> 02:38:17,200
friends with i never would okay let's

4627
02:38:14,719 --> 02:38:18,799
put that on record it trolls me because

4628
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:21,359
if there's an issue with you i'm getting

4629
02:38:18,799 --> 02:38:22,879
you on the phone yeah

4630
02:38:21,359 --> 02:38:24,239
good i mean because then i'm not backing

4631
02:38:22,879 --> 02:38:26,398
you into a corner publicly it doesn't

4632
02:38:24,239 --> 02:38:29,840
make any sense strategically yeah and

4633
02:38:26,398 --> 02:38:32,559
actually um brett weinstein

4634
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:34,239
um tweeted something sort of criticizing

4635
02:38:32,559 --> 02:38:36,159
something i did already forgot what but

4636
02:38:34,239 --> 02:38:38,879
he texted me first saying like is it

4637
02:38:36,159 --> 02:38:40,000
okay if i tweet this yeah and i i said

4638
02:38:38,879 --> 02:38:42,639
yep

4639
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:44,959
like i was excited yeah but i think

4640
02:38:42,639 --> 02:38:46,478
there's some level of just

4641
02:38:44,959 --> 02:38:50,318
be compassionate privately and be

4642
02:38:46,478 --> 02:38:53,199
compassionate publicly like well civil

4643
02:38:50,318 --> 02:38:55,439
civil yeah i i i for some reason i don't

4644
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:58,560
like the word civility because it

4645
02:38:55,439 --> 02:39:00,720
it's like polite i do like it it's uh

4646
02:38:58,559 --> 02:39:02,719
it'll be cordial is that better no what

4647
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:04,639
i mean is like

4648
02:39:02,719 --> 02:39:06,478
it seems funny to you it seems phony

4649
02:39:04,639 --> 02:39:08,478
like you should radiate love in whatever

4650
02:39:06,478 --> 02:39:11,199
way so even if you're rough with the

4651
02:39:08,478 --> 02:39:13,760
other person you should still show like

4652
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:15,520
respect and love for that person and

4653
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:16,639
that that gets back to the russian rooms

4654
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:19,040
where they're yelling at each other but

4655
02:39:16,639 --> 02:39:22,159
there's still love underneath it i mean

4656
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:23,280
uh the question i want to ask for you

4657
02:39:22,159 --> 02:39:26,079
is uh

4658
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:27,920
i think you and i have a different view

4659
02:39:26,079 --> 02:39:30,000
on some things okay we have a different

4660
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:31,840
approach to things but just on on the

4661
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,920
surface level but also a different view

4662
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:36,398
on some things like i have a lot of hope

4663
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:39,040
for institutions i i

4664
02:39:36,398 --> 02:39:40,879
i have so maybe it's a gut instinct like

4665
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:42,960
your gut instinct is like

4666
02:39:40,879 --> 02:39:45,279
centers of power are

4667
02:39:42,959 --> 02:39:46,719
like burn them down first and then let's

4668
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:48,640
figure it out

4669
02:39:46,719 --> 02:39:50,559
well maybe that's a funny rough way of

4670
02:39:48,639 --> 02:39:53,119
saying that's about right and then for

4671
02:39:50,559 --> 02:39:55,840
for me it's like no let's

4672
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:56,880
understand the institution and slowly

4673
02:39:55,840 --> 02:39:58,559
um

4674
02:39:56,879 --> 02:40:01,279
revolutions from within versus

4675
02:39:58,559 --> 02:40:02,559
revolutions from the doubt and

4676
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:04,079
um

4677
02:40:02,559 --> 02:40:05,439
but like we can have those disagreements

4678
02:40:04,079 --> 02:40:07,200
and there may be times when those

4679
02:40:05,439 --> 02:40:08,159
disagreements will be i could see in the

4680
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:10,399
future

4681
02:40:08,159 --> 02:40:13,200
i could see i'll be attacked

4682
02:40:10,398 --> 02:40:15,039
by my friend michael malus which i very

4683
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:16,319
look forward to it i'm not attacked but

4684
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:18,880
you know what i mean on the surface

4685
02:40:16,318 --> 02:40:21,119
level in the idea space anyway

4686
02:40:18,879 --> 02:40:22,719
you're shaking your head now you won't i

4687
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:25,760
guess i'm

4688
02:40:22,719 --> 02:40:27,840
maybe this also goes to sam harrison

4689
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:29,680
uh joe rogan i would love to be able to

4690
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:32,000
disagree

4691
02:40:29,680 --> 02:40:34,880
disagree in big ways unimportant things

4692
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,478
and still be close friends and i don't

4693
02:40:34,879 --> 02:40:38,159
understand why those are should be

4694
02:40:36,478 --> 02:40:39,358
contradictions yeah and that's the

4695
02:40:38,159 --> 02:40:41,680
tension that's been the most

4696
02:40:39,359 --> 02:40:42,640
heartbreaking thing to me about

4697
02:40:41,680 --> 02:40:43,439
sam

4698
02:40:42,639 --> 02:40:45,599
and

4699
02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:47,439
brett and joe

4700
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:48,800
with in the case of brett it's me i

4701
02:40:47,439 --> 02:40:51,040
don't know brett so i'm just like

4702
02:40:48,799 --> 02:40:52,639
looking as a somebody who just enjoys

4703
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:54,080
having these voices out there and it

4704
02:40:52,639 --> 02:40:55,680
seems like kovic has brought out the

4705
02:40:54,079 --> 02:40:57,439
worst than some

4706
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:59,840
many folks

4707
02:40:57,439 --> 02:41:03,200
and it just feels like it's so sad to me

4708
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:05,600
to see their friendship

4709
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:07,760
somewhat deteriorating or maybe i'm just

4710
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:10,239
being an um no it seems clear that's

4711
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:13,040
deteriorated enormously

4712
02:41:10,239 --> 02:41:14,559
i'm sad but that's the case yeah so my

4713
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:16,560
like i've had people come at me because

4714
02:41:14,559 --> 02:41:18,639
i'm friends with you and they were like

4715
02:41:16,559 --> 02:41:19,359
oh lex authored some paper about masks i

4716
02:41:18,639 --> 02:41:21,278
don't even know what the hell they're

4717
02:41:19,359 --> 02:41:23,279
referring to i don't care um i always

4718
02:41:21,279 --> 02:41:24,880
say and mean

4719
02:41:23,279 --> 02:41:26,319
i don't care

4720
02:41:24,879 --> 02:41:28,079
whether someone agrees with me i care

4721
02:41:26,318 --> 02:41:29,519
how they treat me

4722
02:41:28,079 --> 02:41:30,959
and it goes the other way because i'll

4723
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:32,560
have a lot of people on twitter who are

4724
02:41:30,959 --> 02:41:33,919
like oh i'm on your team and blah blah

4725
02:41:32,559 --> 02:41:34,719
i'm like i don't know you you're not my

4726
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:35,920
team

4727
02:41:34,719 --> 02:41:38,398
and just because you happen to agree

4728
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:39,680
with me it's of no value to me like i

4729
02:41:38,398 --> 02:41:40,719
don't know you and i'm interested in

4730
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:42,398
knowing you

4731
02:41:40,719 --> 02:41:44,478
many of my friends i don't know their

4732
02:41:42,398 --> 02:41:46,239
politics there i don't care like i care

4733
02:41:44,478 --> 02:41:48,318
how we hang out we have a good time we

4734
02:41:46,239 --> 02:41:50,318
watch dumb movies watch youtube go to

4735
02:41:48,318 --> 02:41:51,359
the store whatever um i don't know your

4736
02:41:50,318 --> 02:41:53,680
politics are i don't care what your

4737
02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:55,680
politics are um

4738
02:41:53,680 --> 02:41:57,760
chris williamson who you know he's just

4739
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:59,120
here he's gonna be moving to austin i

4740
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:00,800
only learned what his politics are in

4741
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:02,319
the last we've been we chat like almost

4742
02:42:00,799 --> 02:42:04,159
every day because he took the world's

4743
02:42:02,318 --> 02:42:05,439
smallest political quiz

4744
02:42:04,159 --> 02:42:06,799
and he figured out what his answers were

4745
02:42:05,439 --> 02:42:09,600
i had no idea where he was communist he

4746
02:42:06,799 --> 02:42:11,358
said well obviously yeah yeah marxist

4747
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:12,960
yeah let's be honest

4748
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:15,359
um

4749
02:42:12,959 --> 02:42:16,639
so like stuff like that like it never

4750
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:19,760
and people

4751
02:42:16,639 --> 02:42:21,599
uh i think because politics is often so

4752
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:22,478
tribal especially now

4753
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:23,840
uh

4754
02:42:22,478 --> 02:42:25,840
they'll be like oh i could never be

4755
02:42:23,840 --> 02:42:27,120
friends with someone who voted for x

4756
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:29,359
really what if they're like grandma

4757
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:30,319
worked in that campaign what if you know

4758
02:42:29,359 --> 02:42:32,399
it's this

4759
02:42:30,318 --> 02:42:34,159
you can't think of one steel man

4760
02:42:32,398 --> 02:42:36,719
argument why this would happen but if

4761
02:42:34,159 --> 02:42:39,359
they just want to spite their boss

4762
02:42:36,719 --> 02:42:41,278
so i i don't like that approach at all

4763
02:42:39,359 --> 02:42:42,399
it makes no sense to me

4764
02:42:41,279 --> 02:42:44,479
um

4765
02:42:42,398 --> 02:42:45,760
we could still have debates i mean

4766
02:42:44,478 --> 02:42:47,039
like i would still like to have those

4767
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:48,800
conversations and still have

4768
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:49,920
disagreements

4769
02:42:48,799 --> 02:42:52,559
like uh

4770
02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:54,879
i disagree with joe and kovid a lot on a

4771
02:42:52,559 --> 02:42:56,478
bunch of different things very kind of

4772
02:42:54,879 --> 02:42:58,398
but it's never like

4773
02:42:56,478 --> 02:43:00,079
it's not tense at all it's it's it's

4774
02:42:58,398 --> 02:43:02,478
just

4775
02:43:00,079 --> 02:43:03,600
it's uh it doesn't have the arrogance

4776
02:43:02,478 --> 02:43:06,239
that seems

4777
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:07,359
a lot of kobe conversation seems to have

4778
02:43:06,239 --> 02:43:09,439
like

4779
02:43:07,359 --> 02:43:11,920
uh talking down to people from both

4780
02:43:09,439 --> 02:43:13,200
directions yeah yeah it's um so i would

4781
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:15,040
love to have those because i love the

4782
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:17,120
debate though i love debates it takes a

4783
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:20,000
lot to get me triggered and when the

4784
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:21,920
babylon b were interviewing elon

4785
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:24,159
and he had this thing he goes well i

4786
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:26,478
don't know anyone who wants to you know

4787
02:43:24,159 --> 02:43:27,760
abolish the fda and the faa and i'm

4788
02:43:26,478 --> 02:43:29,920
standing there

4789
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:30,960
and i'm shaking and the guys look at me

4790
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:33,680
and they're like oh we actually have an

4791
02:43:30,959 --> 02:43:34,559
anarchist here and the example he used

4792
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:36,800
was

4793
02:43:34,559 --> 02:43:37,920
you know look if you're playing football

4794
02:43:36,799 --> 02:43:39,278
you're gonna have a referee there and

4795
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:41,120
you want the referee you know you don't

4796
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:43,040
but the referee started playing the game

4797
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:44,560
is this a good thing

4798
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:46,640
and i'm sitting there like the referee

4799
02:43:44,559 --> 02:43:49,039
doesn't work for the state yeah the

4800
02:43:46,639 --> 02:43:50,478
referee is a private individual working

4801
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:53,359
for this organization

4802
02:43:50,478 --> 02:43:55,199
yeah and there's no reason at all that

4803
02:43:53,359 --> 02:43:57,680
food quality which is something

4804
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:59,200
crucially important has to be or can

4805
02:43:57,680 --> 02:44:02,079
only be delivered through the state in a

4806
02:43:59,200 --> 02:44:02,079
government monopoly

4807
02:44:02,318 --> 02:44:05,199
that's actually really interesting just

4808
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:07,120
to link on that

4809
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:08,880
just just just just a little bit with

4810
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:11,920
the vaccine and stuff like that with the

4811
02:44:08,879 --> 02:44:13,839
antiviral drugs the fda say like are you

4812
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:15,439
comfortable like who should be the

4813
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:16,318
referee

4814
02:44:15,439 --> 02:44:18,000
right

4815
02:44:16,318 --> 02:44:20,159
like do you have an idea like what's the

4816
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,359
best referee for the vex it's it's just

4817
02:44:20,159 --> 02:44:23,520
the market

4818
02:44:21,359 --> 02:44:25,920
just let people decide this is tricky

4819
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:27,680
because the thing the thing that

4820
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:30,079
i have not been following covetous

4821
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:33,920
closely is joe and sam as mr harris

4822
02:44:30,079 --> 02:44:36,318
excuse me and mr musk the point is

4823
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:37,200
when anything like this is developing

4824
02:44:36,318 --> 02:44:38,879
there's going to be a lot of

4825
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:41,040
misinformation out there

4826
02:44:38,879 --> 02:44:42,478
even from the scientists because it's a

4827
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:44,080
dynamic process they don't know what

4828
02:44:42,478 --> 02:44:45,679
they're dealing with a lot of it has to

4829
02:44:44,079 --> 02:44:46,799
be speculative they don't know long-term

4830
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:48,000
effects because it hasn't been around

4831
02:44:46,799 --> 02:44:49,278
for a long time

4832
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:51,279
so

4833
02:44:49,279 --> 02:44:52,239
i think it is very

4834
02:44:51,279 --> 02:44:53,760
um

4835
02:44:52,239 --> 02:44:56,478
dangerous

4836
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:58,478
when you know when joe was mocked for

4837
02:44:56,478 --> 02:45:00,559
taking a laundry list of things under

4838
02:44:58,478 --> 02:45:02,719
his doctor's advice

4839
02:45:00,559 --> 02:45:04,719
and they kind of latched on to the

4840
02:45:02,719 --> 02:45:06,000
ivermectin and then they specifically

4841
02:45:04,719 --> 02:45:07,438
said it was horse paste although it's

4842
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:09,120
veterinary medicine why didn't they say

4843
02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:11,680
dog paste or cat paste

4844
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:14,880
it's like well he's not dead

4845
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:16,800
so and he's also taking drugs

4846
02:45:14,879 --> 02:45:18,639
which are used in other circumstances

4847
02:45:16,799 --> 02:45:19,438
the very least maybe they're pointless

4848
02:45:18,639 --> 02:45:21,358
but

4849
02:45:19,439 --> 02:45:23,279
if the drug is being allowed for

4850
02:45:21,359 --> 02:45:24,239
pharmaceutical reasons the odds are

4851
02:45:23,279 --> 02:45:27,200
quite low that they're going to have

4852
02:45:24,239 --> 02:45:28,879
deleterious side effects uh in general

4853
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:31,600
so

4854
02:45:28,879 --> 02:45:33,759
i think this kind of insistence

4855
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:36,479
that there has to be one

4856
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:37,520
a officially approved

4857
02:45:36,478 --> 02:45:39,599
outcome

4858
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:42,159
that we're all doing that is kind of

4859
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:44,079
dangerous thinking in general by the way

4860
02:45:42,159 --> 02:45:46,398
i don't know if you saw i got a chance

4861
02:45:44,079 --> 02:45:47,840
to talk to the pfizer ceo

4862
02:45:46,398 --> 02:45:50,159
and uh

4863
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:52,000
i had uh help collecting questions i got

4864
02:45:50,159 --> 02:45:53,760
a lot of questions and people put at the

4865
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,639
top a question for michael malus oh

4866
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:56,960
really

4867
02:45:54,639 --> 02:45:58,879
no the

4868
02:45:56,959 --> 02:46:01,358
uh ask him

4869
02:45:58,879 --> 02:46:03,119
what he likes best about me oh what does

4870
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:04,318
he like best yeah yeah so i actually had

4871
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:07,600
that in my list of questions i was going

4872
02:46:04,318 --> 02:46:09,439
to ask him and my plan was i'll ask him

4873
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:11,760
uh michael malus wants to know what you

4874
02:46:09,439 --> 02:46:13,840
like best about him and then my guess is

4875
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:16,000
he'd be like who and i'd be like exactly

4876
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:18,639
and then go on

4877
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:20,559
but i thought like how it was such a

4878
02:46:18,639 --> 02:46:21,680
tense conversation that i thought there

4879
02:46:20,559 --> 02:46:23,278
would be no

4880
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:26,159
of course room for levity the question i

4881
02:46:23,279 --> 02:46:28,880
would ask him is can you acknowledge

4882
02:46:26,159 --> 02:46:31,920
that there is an enormous incentive

4883
02:46:28,879 --> 02:46:34,318
for your company to force everyone in

4884
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:36,719
america or everyone on earth to be a

4885
02:46:34,318 --> 02:46:38,318
consumer of your product yeah that's my

4886
02:46:36,719 --> 02:46:40,639
question so i danced around that

4887
02:46:38,318 --> 02:46:42,959
question quite a lot like is

4888
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:43,920
uh i i phrased it differently which is

4889
02:46:42,959 --> 02:46:45,599
uh

4890
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:47,680
a conflict of interest and attention

4891
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:49,279
between making a lot of money and

4892
02:46:47,680 --> 02:46:51,279
actually helping people

4893
02:46:49,279 --> 02:46:53,279
get the and

4894
02:46:51,279 --> 02:46:55,600
i mean i've asked a lot of really heavy

4895
02:46:53,279 --> 02:46:57,840
questions in that and i still and

4896
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:59,120
a lot of people wrote to me with support

4897
02:46:57,840 --> 02:47:01,840
saying like

4898
02:46:59,120 --> 02:47:04,960
that was a really uh great conversation

4899
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:08,639
and a lot of people wrote saying that i

4900
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:10,398
mean saying that it was just um

4901
02:47:08,639 --> 02:47:11,840
uh too soft

4902
02:47:10,398 --> 02:47:13,840
and it um

4903
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:15,840
i don't know i think about that a lot

4904
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:18,159
like how do you have that conversation i

4905
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:19,600
don't think it was too soft

4906
02:47:18,159 --> 02:47:21,119
and actually just for the record i want

4907
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:21,920
to say that

4908
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:23,520
they

4909
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:24,478
didn't see any of the questions i'm

4910
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:26,800
asking

4911
02:47:24,478 --> 02:47:29,039
they the they didn't see the final

4912
02:47:26,799 --> 02:47:33,759
interview i can ask anything i want

4913
02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:36,080
and so so any questions that i asked

4914
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:38,559
and and failed to ask

4915
02:47:36,079 --> 02:47:40,000
is my own

4916
02:47:38,559 --> 02:47:41,840
shortcomings

4917
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:43,760
um also

4918
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:46,079
not being a coward i was afraid of

4919
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:48,239
nothing like what it what do i have to

4920
02:47:46,079 --> 02:47:50,079
gain or lose exactly well you have

4921
02:47:48,239 --> 02:47:52,879
something to lose because if you're

4922
02:47:50,079 --> 02:47:54,559
i do so only to do softballs because if

4923
02:47:52,879 --> 02:47:56,559
i'm going to make it

4924
02:47:54,559 --> 02:47:57,600
uh difficult for someone to come to my

4925
02:47:56,559 --> 02:47:59,039
show

4926
02:47:57,600 --> 02:48:00,880
a lot of people will be disincentivized

4927
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:02,560
to do the show because like i don't need

4928
02:48:00,879 --> 02:48:04,719
this i see oh yeah i wasn't thinking

4929
02:48:02,559 --> 02:48:05,680
like that but i was i don't like to what

4930
02:48:04,719 --> 02:48:08,318
i think

4931
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:11,200
some fraction of folks wanted me to do

4932
02:48:08,318 --> 02:48:13,278
is to yell at a person

4933
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:14,159
like criticize them not even ask

4934
02:48:13,279 --> 02:48:17,680
questions

4935
02:48:14,159 --> 02:48:19,520
yeah how dare you yeah but to me

4936
02:48:17,680 --> 02:48:21,920
my goal my hope is with these

4937
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:24,079
conversations is not just to do how

4938
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:26,639
great you are all that kind of stuff is

4939
02:48:24,079 --> 02:48:28,318
to bring out some deeper truth

4940
02:48:26,639 --> 02:48:30,398
like the beautiful things is when you

4941
02:48:28,318 --> 02:48:32,799
can together realize some

4942
02:48:30,398 --> 02:48:33,680
truth like you mentioned

4943
02:48:32,799 --> 02:48:36,159
that

4944
02:48:33,680 --> 02:48:38,000
you know the incentive to uh

4945
02:48:36,159 --> 02:48:40,719
for everyone to take the vaccine is

4946
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:44,000
obviously high for the maker of a

4947
02:48:40,719 --> 02:48:46,239
vaccine yeah right and for them to

4948
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:48,318
arrive at that truth together like that

4949
02:48:46,239 --> 02:48:49,760
is a really difficult

4950
02:48:48,318 --> 02:48:52,000
um

4951
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:53,680
truth to operate under

4952
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:56,159
like for example

4953
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:57,200
i had a whole exchange with him about

4954
02:48:56,159 --> 02:48:58,719
um

4955
02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:00,319
this is jordan peterson asked this

4956
02:48:58,719 --> 02:49:01,679
question i used that as a kind of

4957
02:49:00,318 --> 02:49:03,519
springboard

4958
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:05,760
which is the

4959
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:09,200
the the kind of open doors between the

4960
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:10,960
fda the cdc and pfizer right like some

4961
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:13,680
people work at pfizer and then go to

4962
02:49:10,959 --> 02:49:16,398
work at the fda and then vice versa

4963
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:19,520
and i brought up

4964
02:49:16,398 --> 02:49:22,000
this is my safe space uh maybe yours too

4965
02:49:19,520 --> 02:49:24,479
just going back to the soviet union

4966
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:27,520
to look at the lessons of of human

4967
02:49:24,478 --> 02:49:28,799
nature and corruption i said like

4968
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:31,439
like this

4969
02:49:28,799 --> 02:49:33,119
there's two things this looks bad

4970
02:49:31,439 --> 02:49:34,559
and two this naturally leads to

4971
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:36,560
corruption

4972
02:49:34,559 --> 02:49:38,639
and i pushed this with several questions

4973
02:49:36,559 --> 02:49:41,278
but polite and respectful and he

4974
02:49:38,639 --> 02:49:43,439
ultimately said you know there's rules

4975
02:49:41,279 --> 02:49:45,439
uh we there's the rule of law and

4976
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:47,840
there's very strict rules about this and

4977
02:49:45,439 --> 02:49:50,079
we have to follow those rules otherwise

4978
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:52,398
we get punished severely and so like his

4979
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:53,279
response is like people reacted to them

4980
02:49:52,398 --> 02:49:55,119
as like

4981
02:49:53,279 --> 02:49:57,439
okay that's the ceo doing the political

4982
02:49:55,120 --> 02:49:58,479
but there's also truth to what he's

4983
02:49:57,439 --> 02:50:00,000
saying

4984
02:49:58,478 --> 02:50:02,079
that one of the beautiful things about

4985
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:03,520
america is that the the

4986
02:50:02,079 --> 02:50:05,200
you can criticize the rule of law

4987
02:50:03,520 --> 02:50:07,520
currently but it's still

4988
02:50:05,200 --> 02:50:09,920
it's better than soviet

4989
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:11,600
in the in the soviet union where

4990
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:14,318
people bribed each other

4991
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:16,318
and but still

4992
02:50:14,318 --> 02:50:18,719
he made it seem like

4993
02:50:16,318 --> 02:50:21,119
there's no corruption

4994
02:50:18,719 --> 02:50:22,959
people often ask me

4995
02:50:21,120 --> 02:50:25,200
why i describe myself as an anarchist

4996
02:50:22,959 --> 02:50:26,559
and not an anarcho-capitalist because

4997
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:28,479
they think my views are more in line

4998
02:50:26,559 --> 02:50:30,159
with that school of anarchism

4999
02:50:28,478 --> 02:50:32,559
and one of the other reasons you just

5000
02:50:30,159 --> 02:50:34,000
gave me a good one is that if i am

5001
02:50:32,559 --> 02:50:36,478
talking to

5002
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:37,439
someone who's a major ceo

5003
02:50:36,478 --> 02:50:39,760
i am

5004
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:42,639
i have that hardcore left anarchist view

5005
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:44,639
that this person is if not the devil

5006
02:50:42,639 --> 02:50:45,680
certainly going to be

5007
02:50:44,639 --> 02:50:49,039
sinister

5008
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:50,880
at the very least and if you can't say

5009
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:52,640
listen this happens inevitably with

5010
02:50:50,879 --> 02:50:54,079
elites it's you know it happens in

5011
02:50:52,639 --> 02:50:56,000
universities it happens in the food

5012
02:50:54,079 --> 02:50:57,680
industry there's only so many people at

5013
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:59,600
the top of these things there's a the

5014
02:50:57,680 --> 02:51:01,200
field is small and everyone's going to

5015
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:03,279
know each other which is kind of you

5016
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:05,279
know just the dynamics of any market

5017
02:51:03,279 --> 02:51:06,479
that would kind of be more reasonable

5018
02:51:05,279 --> 02:51:08,159
and just say

5019
02:51:06,478 --> 02:51:09,438
it's easy to caricature us because

5020
02:51:08,159 --> 02:51:11,279
you're not in the boardroom but we're

5021
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:12,800
not you know we are trying to produce a

5022
02:51:11,279 --> 02:51:14,159
product that people want

5023
02:51:12,799 --> 02:51:15,358
so

5024
02:51:14,159 --> 02:51:17,600
unlike

5025
02:51:15,359 --> 02:51:19,600
the people who criticized me

5026
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:22,000
i was bothered by i wasn't bothered by

5027
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:24,318
most things but i was bothered by the

5028
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:26,639
fact that he didn't show more worry

5029
02:51:24,318 --> 02:51:28,639
about the corrupting nature of money and

5030
02:51:26,639 --> 02:51:31,599
power like he should

5031
02:51:28,639 --> 02:51:33,920
he if you say that there's no corruption

5032
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:36,239
you should show that because we

5033
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:37,920
constantly worry about it right

5034
02:51:36,239 --> 02:51:39,600
not because like

5035
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:42,000
look there's rules

5036
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:45,439
yeah which are enforced by you yeah

5037
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:48,159
exactly so like i think the only way to

5038
02:51:45,439 --> 02:51:51,680
avoid force for time

5039
02:51:48,159 --> 02:51:53,200
the corrupting force of power is to

5040
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:54,398
freak out about it

5041
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:56,159
nonstop

5042
02:51:54,398 --> 02:51:57,358
the impression i always get from people

5043
02:51:56,159 --> 02:51:59,840
like him and i haven't seen the

5044
02:51:57,359 --> 02:52:01,279
interview and i won't be watching it is

5045
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:02,880
um

5046
02:52:01,279 --> 02:52:04,159
they're genuinely convinced of the good

5047
02:52:02,879 --> 02:52:05,039
guys

5048
02:52:04,159 --> 02:52:07,200
yeah

5049
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:09,840
and if you're the good guy sure

5050
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:10,560
corruption is a concern theoretically

5051
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:12,880
but

5052
02:52:10,559 --> 02:52:14,879
i know this guy at the fda i know this

5053
02:52:12,879 --> 02:52:16,559
senator sure we disagree sure they do

5054
02:52:14,879 --> 02:52:18,318
some things i don't like but in terms of

5055
02:52:16,559 --> 02:52:19,519
corrupt they're not getting briefcases

5056
02:52:18,318 --> 02:52:21,760
full of money

5057
02:52:19,520 --> 02:52:24,239
they're not going to sell a vaccine that

5058
02:52:21,760 --> 02:52:25,680
you know kills people in georgia so yeah

5059
02:52:24,239 --> 02:52:27,039
it's a concern theoretically but this is

5060
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:28,318
the 21st century

5061
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:31,120
the thought process i think writes

5062
02:52:28,318 --> 02:52:33,359
itself i i think uh yeah having the

5063
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:35,439
humility i do this all the time to maybe

5064
02:52:33,359 --> 02:52:37,439
to a destructive level thinking that i

5065
02:52:35,439 --> 02:52:38,960
might be doing bad for the world i might

5066
02:52:37,439 --> 02:52:40,239
be wrong i might be that kind of

5067
02:52:38,959 --> 02:52:42,159
thinking is very

5068
02:52:40,239 --> 02:52:44,079
you should do at least some of that not

5069
02:52:42,159 --> 02:52:46,000
to a point being paralyzed but a little

5070
02:52:44,079 --> 02:52:47,520
bit you're actually in the right mindset

5071
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:49,920
for me to

5072
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:51,920
to ask you them for advice okay you're

5073
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:54,159
you're in this compassionate thoughtful

5074
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:57,200
mood i like it the compassion thoughtful

5075
02:52:54,159 --> 02:52:58,959
michael so for future conversations like

5076
02:52:57,200 --> 02:53:00,399
that

5077
02:52:58,959 --> 02:53:03,039
so um

5078
02:53:00,398 --> 02:53:05,039
the person that offered a conversation

5079
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:06,880
that first i avoided but i might return

5080
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:08,800
to is anthony fauci

5081
02:53:06,879 --> 02:53:10,559
so there's anthony fauci but then

5082
02:53:08,799 --> 02:53:12,398
there's also trump and biden things

5083
02:53:10,559 --> 02:53:14,559
people like that

5084
02:53:12,398 --> 02:53:17,039
like if you had them on your show

5085
02:53:14,559 --> 02:53:18,478
or or just giving me advice on how to

5086
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:20,880
talk to them what do you think is the

5087
02:53:18,478 --> 02:53:23,519
right way

5088
02:53:20,879 --> 02:53:25,119
to talk to them and forget about future

5089
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:27,040
guests

5090
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:29,600
but like to get us something

5091
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:31,359
new you know together like get at

5092
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:33,359
something not for views or likes or

5093
02:53:31,359 --> 02:53:34,720
clicks or any of that but discover

5094
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:36,640
something new through the mode of

5095
02:53:34,719 --> 02:53:38,478
conversation well like let's take those

5096
02:53:36,639 --> 02:53:40,879
one at a time so if i had a talking to

5097
02:53:38,478 --> 02:53:43,519
trump i i told reuben to ask trump this

5098
02:53:40,879 --> 02:53:44,959
and he didn't what i wanted to know is

5099
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:46,479
what's the look on your face when you're

5100
02:53:44,959 --> 02:53:47,519
sending these tweets

5101
02:53:46,478 --> 02:53:49,199
right because i'm imagining him on the

5102
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:50,960
toilet with this phone yeah right are

5103
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:52,560
you cracking yourself up

5104
02:53:50,959 --> 02:53:54,318
are you just completely stoic are you

5105
02:53:52,559 --> 02:53:57,600
kind of that trump little smirk he does

5106
02:53:54,318 --> 02:53:59,680
yeah so when you get someone to

5107
02:53:57,600 --> 02:54:01,200
open up about their emotion about

5108
02:53:59,680 --> 02:54:03,120
something they're passionate about i

5109
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:04,720
think that breaks down some barriers and

5110
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:07,359
that's a really good question

5111
02:54:04,719 --> 02:54:08,799
bond yeah but uh reuben wouldn't be

5112
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:10,640
that's not a style like that's a great

5113
02:54:08,799 --> 02:54:13,438
question for you to ask well i told him

5114
02:54:10,639 --> 02:54:14,889
to say michael malos

5115
02:54:13,439 --> 02:54:16,000
for biden um

5116
02:54:14,889 --> 02:54:18,478
[Music]

5117
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:19,840
that would be a tough one because biden

5118
02:54:18,478 --> 02:54:21,599
gets doesn't get enough credit for what

5119
02:54:19,840 --> 02:54:23,279
a good politician he is

5120
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:25,279
there was this moment people can see on

5121
02:54:23,279 --> 02:54:27,520
youtube where biden

5122
02:54:25,279 --> 02:54:29,840
is addressing a room full of people and

5123
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:31,200
he had someone there and he goes can you

5124
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:33,920
why don't you stand up so everyone can

5125
02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:36,800
uh um give you a hand and the guy was in

5126
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:38,879
a wheelchair and violence like oh

5127
02:54:36,799 --> 02:54:40,959
and like but instantly he goes you know

5128
02:54:38,879 --> 02:54:42,478
what we're all gonna stand up for you

5129
02:54:40,959 --> 02:54:44,639
and he made everyone get up and applaud

5130
02:54:42,478 --> 02:54:46,398
the guy yeah i'm like that's quick like

5131
02:54:44,639 --> 02:54:48,799
yeah you made a fool of yourself so he

5132
02:54:46,398 --> 02:54:50,959
is a glad hander in many ways he's more

5133
02:54:48,799 --> 02:54:52,239
of a schmoozer than trump was like trump

5134
02:54:50,959 --> 02:54:53,839
made the point that he knows all the

5135
02:54:52,239 --> 02:54:56,159
good people but biden knows how to shake

5136
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:57,760
hands well i think with both and sorry

5137
02:54:56,159 --> 02:54:59,439
to interrupt but both trump and biden

5138
02:54:57,760 --> 02:55:00,478
like you mentioned earlier to me at

5139
02:54:59,439 --> 02:55:02,800
least

5140
02:55:00,478 --> 02:55:05,119
their family is fascinating the dynamic

5141
02:55:02,799 --> 02:55:06,959
this is a family man as a father

5142
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:09,279
i think that biden won't acknowledge his

5143
02:55:06,959 --> 02:55:10,398
illegitimate grandkid is a problem for

5144
02:55:09,279 --> 02:55:12,319
me

5145
02:55:10,398 --> 02:55:13,920
uh but at the same time i can see why he

5146
02:55:12,318 --> 02:55:14,799
think it's off limits to ask so that's

5147
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:17,120
the thing when you're dealing people

5148
02:55:14,799 --> 02:55:19,278
that powerful they're not used to having

5149
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:21,200
to answer questions which might be

5150
02:55:19,279 --> 02:55:22,800
perfectly nice but would cause them to

5151
02:55:21,200 --> 02:55:24,560
freak the hell out that's the tricky

5152
02:55:22,799 --> 02:55:28,000
thing of talking to people as you know

5153
02:55:24,559 --> 02:55:30,159
like some some topics are off limit

5154
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:31,840
not in in that they draw lines but they

5155
02:55:30,159 --> 02:55:34,639
just shut down yeah yeah when you ask

5156
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:36,639
them uh the trust is i think talked to

5157
02:55:34,639 --> 02:55:39,519
elon three times now

5158
02:55:36,639 --> 02:55:41,358
you better believe i brought up love and

5159
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:42,640
how far do you think that got and you

5160
02:55:41,359 --> 02:55:43,520
could just

5161
02:55:42,639 --> 02:55:46,159
one

5162
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:48,399
we did we did uh exactly the kind of

5163
02:55:46,159 --> 02:55:50,559
robot back and forth yeah just like just

5164
02:55:48,398 --> 02:55:52,000
shut down so yeah i i worry about that

5165
02:55:50,559 --> 02:55:55,278
with personal but those that's the thing

5166
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:57,200
that makes it fascinating with those two

5167
02:55:55,279 --> 02:55:59,760
because he had um

5168
02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:01,920
with hunter and losing his like the

5169
02:55:59,760 --> 02:56:03,680
dynamic of the complexities of all that

5170
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:05,840
like just having

5171
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:07,760
uh

5172
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:10,559
you know children [ __ ] up in the way

5173
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:12,559
children do and then with trump

5174
02:56:10,559 --> 02:56:14,719
the interesting dynamic with his very

5175
02:56:12,559 --> 02:56:16,719
different kids and they're all kind of

5176
02:56:14,719 --> 02:56:18,799
interesting in different ways and

5177
02:56:16,719 --> 02:56:20,239
maintaining connection with all of them

5178
02:56:18,799 --> 02:56:21,840
and also letting them flourish

5179
02:56:20,239 --> 02:56:23,279
individually is fascinating to me well

5180
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:24,639
i'd also want to ask trump if he can

5181
02:56:23,279 --> 02:56:27,040
name all the presidents in order which

5182
02:56:24,639 --> 02:56:28,639
there's no way he can yeah but i'd also

5183
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:30,240
want to know all the pres do you think

5184
02:56:28,639 --> 02:56:32,398
he knows who the second president in the

5185
02:56:30,239 --> 02:56:34,318
united states is yes

5186
02:56:32,398 --> 02:56:36,478
okay john adams he knows i think when it

5187
02:56:34,318 --> 02:56:38,959
gets between ulysses s grant and

5188
02:56:36,478 --> 02:56:40,879
mckinley that's when we all screw up

5189
02:56:38,959 --> 02:56:42,719
that window it's tough

5190
02:56:40,879 --> 02:56:44,799
yeah yeah i'm sure that's the one window

5191
02:56:42,719 --> 02:56:47,039
where he i mean he he's not he's going

5192
02:56:44,799 --> 02:56:49,278
to be able to get back to fdr no

5193
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:51,920
question i have to

5194
02:56:49,279 --> 02:56:52,960
my sense was with donald trump and this

5195
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:54,639
is not

5196
02:56:52,959 --> 02:56:56,799
i would say criticism

5197
02:56:54,639 --> 02:56:58,478
is he doesn't have a depth of knowledge

5198
02:56:56,799 --> 02:57:00,799
or more importantly curiosity about

5199
02:56:58,478 --> 02:57:02,159
history yeah but if you're old enough

5200
02:57:00,799 --> 02:57:05,438
you're going to at least remember the

5201
02:57:02,159 --> 02:57:05,439
president's in your lifetime

5202
02:57:05,520 --> 02:57:08,479
in your lifetime yes so that's what i'm

5203
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:11,680
saying you'll get a stunt presentation

5204
02:57:08,478 --> 02:57:13,358
fdr pretty easily yeah yeah okay sure

5205
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:14,800
uh i think i thought you meant fdr from

5206
02:57:13,359 --> 02:57:16,159
the other director no no yeah like

5207
02:57:14,799 --> 02:57:17,119
current yeah yeah

5208
02:57:16,159 --> 02:57:19,760
yeah

5209
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:22,479
um but yeah from a political perspe like

5210
02:57:19,760 --> 02:57:25,520
having a conversation about politics

5211
02:57:22,478 --> 02:57:26,250
with those two

5212
02:57:25,520 --> 02:57:27,359
um

5213
02:57:26,250 --> 02:57:29,439
[Music]

5214
02:57:27,359 --> 02:57:32,159
there is interesting topics interaction

5215
02:57:29,439 --> 02:57:33,920
between donald trump and putin not the

5216
02:57:32,159 --> 02:57:35,359
interaction like not the stupid

5217
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:38,079
journalistic stuff

5218
02:57:35,359 --> 02:57:40,559
but it's clear to me that he is a

5219
02:57:38,079 --> 02:57:43,439
student of power oh for sure

5220
02:57:40,559 --> 02:57:45,199
and like he enjoys the game of power

5221
02:57:43,439 --> 02:57:47,840
yeah and so it's interesting because it

5222
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:50,399
to me the reason he admires putin is

5223
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:53,200
it's another player in the game of power

5224
02:57:50,398 --> 02:57:55,439
and i think why so many people hate him

5225
02:57:53,200 --> 02:57:57,439
trump is that he demonstrated to a lot

5226
02:57:55,439 --> 02:57:58,800
of americans how much of a con job most

5227
02:57:57,439 --> 02:58:00,639
of politics is

5228
02:57:58,799 --> 02:58:02,398
and how people just say what they need

5229
02:58:00,639 --> 02:58:04,318
to do but behind closed doors these

5230
02:58:02,398 --> 02:58:06,318
people are buffoons and he exposed them

5231
02:58:04,318 --> 02:58:09,278
as that i'd also um

5232
02:58:06,318 --> 02:58:11,039
so that the biden i think biden would be

5233
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:12,560
a tougher interview than trump because i

5234
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:14,080
feel like biden's more slippery in many

5235
02:58:12,559 --> 02:58:16,239
ways he's much more of a consummate

5236
02:58:14,079 --> 02:58:19,279
politician he's been in the senate since

5237
02:58:16,239 --> 02:58:22,559
the early 70s since he was like 30 or 35

5238
02:58:19,279 --> 02:58:24,079
whatever it was um so

5239
02:58:22,559 --> 02:58:26,879
you know he'd have his little kind of

5240
02:58:24,079 --> 02:58:28,159
pat answers there was larry king who was

5241
02:58:26,879 --> 02:58:29,679
certainly a

5242
02:58:28,159 --> 02:58:31,119
softball interviewer and i don't

5243
02:58:29,680 --> 02:58:32,720
begrudge him that at all i remember was

5244
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:35,120
very very vividly and it was like i

5245
02:58:32,719 --> 02:58:37,119
think was the 2008 cycle he asked

5246
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:38,640
hillary why do so many people hate why

5247
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:40,800
do you think some people hate you

5248
02:58:38,639 --> 02:58:42,799
and she just goes like oh well i take

5249
02:58:40,799 --> 02:58:44,000
tough stances on the and he cut her off

5250
02:58:42,799 --> 02:58:46,079
he goes other people have taken those

5251
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:47,680
stances why they hate you and she didn't

5252
02:58:46,079 --> 02:58:49,600
really i was really impressed with him

5253
02:58:47,680 --> 02:58:50,479
that he didn't let her off the hook

5254
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:52,720
um

5255
02:58:50,478 --> 02:58:54,639
that to me is great but some people say

5256
02:58:52,719 --> 02:58:56,959
that still is too softball

5257
02:58:54,639 --> 02:58:58,478
because you like they would want him to

5258
02:58:56,959 --> 02:59:01,599
start listing

5259
02:58:58,478 --> 02:59:03,358
i don't know droning like uh all the all

5260
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:05,040
the things that uh hillary clinton has

5261
02:59:03,359 --> 02:59:06,479
criticized yeah but then what she she's

5262
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:08,000
done this many times she's very good at

5263
02:59:06,478 --> 02:59:09,599
this she'll be like look i've addressed

5264
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:11,279
all these in the past if you want to

5265
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:12,720
start rehashing republican talking

5266
02:59:11,279 --> 02:59:13,920
points you can go check out my

5267
02:59:12,719 --> 02:59:16,079
interviews yeah i think it's kind of

5268
02:59:13,920 --> 02:59:18,159
productive yeah so what about

5269
02:59:16,079 --> 02:59:19,600
the more prescient

5270
02:59:18,159 --> 02:59:21,039
for me

5271
02:59:19,600 --> 02:59:22,640
i can't believe i'm walking through this

5272
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:25,040
fire for no good reason whatsoever but

5273
02:59:22,639 --> 02:59:28,318
anthony fauci so yeah let me tell you

5274
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:30,319
why i care about anthony fauci because

5275
02:59:28,318 --> 02:59:32,398
i care a lot about science and the way

5276
02:59:30,318 --> 02:59:33,199
science is viewed in society

5277
02:59:32,398 --> 02:59:35,519
and

5278
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:36,800
not to put it at the at the feet of this

5279
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:37,520
one person

5280
02:59:36,799 --> 02:59:38,799
but

5281
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:39,840
i

5282
02:59:38,799 --> 02:59:42,239
him and

5283
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:44,159
certain members of the scientific

5284
02:59:42,239 --> 02:59:47,199
community that was responsible for

5285
02:59:44,159 --> 02:59:50,879
managing the response to kovid i think

5286
02:59:47,200 --> 02:59:53,279
are somewhat or entirely responsible for

5287
02:59:50,879 --> 02:59:55,358
a significant decrease in trust

5288
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:56,479
in science yes no question in the past

5289
02:59:55,359 --> 02:59:57,840
couple of years there was a poll that

5290
02:59:56,478 --> 03:00:00,799
just came out this week that said the

5291
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:03,200
number is just collapsed and

5292
03:00:00,799 --> 03:00:06,799
if you don't blame him for it

5293
03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:07,920
i personally at least blame him for not

5294
03:00:06,799 --> 03:00:10,879
um

5295
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:13,359
improving the problem so there's

5296
03:00:10,879 --> 03:00:15,519
definitely would be a harsh

5297
03:00:13,359 --> 03:00:16,800
conversation there to be had and i think

5298
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:18,079
i want to

5299
03:00:16,799 --> 03:00:20,239
have it

5300
03:00:18,079 --> 03:00:22,398
but how do you do it it's tough

5301
03:00:20,239 --> 03:00:24,478
yeah because you know again

5302
03:00:22,398 --> 03:00:26,719
politicians this political answers if

5303
03:00:24,478 --> 03:00:28,398
they get too frustrated too quickly

5304
03:00:26,719 --> 03:00:31,920
they will not explore these difficult

5305
03:00:28,398 --> 03:00:34,000
things with you they'll just shut down

5306
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:36,398
but then if you say too many nice things

5307
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:39,040
because i i should also say anthony

5308
03:00:36,398 --> 03:00:41,519
fauci is an incredible career

5309
03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:43,520
like there's several hours worth of

5310
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:45,279
conversation to be had about how amazing

5311
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:46,960
of a person he is well i would also be

5312
03:00:45,279 --> 03:00:48,399
curious about the aid stuff yes because

5313
03:00:46,959 --> 03:00:49,759
that's something it's criticized about

5314
03:00:48,398 --> 03:00:50,879
and i wouldn't come at it aggressively i

5315
03:00:49,760 --> 03:00:52,639
would say let's set the record straight

5316
03:00:50,879 --> 03:00:53,679
this is on the criticism you get blah

5317
03:00:52,639 --> 03:00:55,920
blah

5318
03:00:53,680 --> 03:00:57,600
your role in the aids crisis let's talk

5319
03:00:55,920 --> 03:00:58,960
about this and this is something that is

5320
03:00:57,600 --> 03:01:01,120
important part of american history there

5321
03:00:58,959 --> 03:01:03,119
was a pandemic and but it was localized

5322
03:01:01,120 --> 03:01:04,640
to certain populations and that that

5323
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:06,640
population at the first at least was

5324
03:01:04,639 --> 03:01:08,398
pretty much told goodbye and good luck

5325
03:01:06,639 --> 03:01:09,920
you're gonna have to deal with this so

5326
03:01:08,398 --> 03:01:11,439
how did you deal with that i mean were

5327
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:13,439
you scared of getting aids you know so

5328
03:01:11,439 --> 03:01:14,880
on and so forth but also there was that

5329
03:01:13,439 --> 03:01:16,880
comment when

5330
03:01:14,879 --> 03:01:19,519
i and correct me if i'm wrong i'm not a

5331
03:01:16,879 --> 03:01:21,519
factory expert when he basically they

5332
03:01:19,520 --> 03:01:23,200
told people not to wear masks or they

5333
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:24,640
lied about it to some extent because

5334
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:25,760
they said then people were going to run

5335
03:01:24,639 --> 03:01:28,000
out of them or something like that and

5336
03:01:25,760 --> 03:01:29,920
they admitted they were being inaccurate

5337
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:32,079
i would nail him on that i'm like let's

5338
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:33,359
address this were you being dishonest is

5339
03:01:32,079 --> 03:01:35,680
there sometimes when it's important to

5340
03:01:33,359 --> 03:01:37,920
be dishonest in service of whatever also

5341
03:01:35,680 --> 03:01:40,398
i would ask him how as someone who's not

5342
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:42,719
a politician whether his level of fame

5343
03:01:40,398 --> 03:01:44,478
and adulation has gotten to his head how

5344
03:01:42,719 --> 03:01:46,719
do you have a perspective

5345
03:01:44,478 --> 03:01:48,000
when and how does it feel when a sitting

5346
03:01:46,719 --> 03:01:49,920
senator tells you that you should be

5347
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:51,120
imprisoned do you think ted cruz means

5348
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:52,960
it or do you think ted cruz is just

5349
03:01:51,120 --> 03:01:55,920
playing his base

5350
03:01:52,959 --> 03:01:58,000
yeah i like the fame one

5351
03:01:55,920 --> 03:01:59,840
i would love to sneak up

5352
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:01,760
i mean that question applies to you too

5353
03:01:59,840 --> 03:02:03,439
that question applies to me

5354
03:02:01,760 --> 03:02:05,680
when you start getting more fame or

5355
03:02:03,439 --> 03:02:08,079
money or power

5356
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:10,720
are you aware of how that changed you

5357
03:02:08,079 --> 03:02:13,120
and like explore that like

5358
03:02:10,719 --> 03:02:15,679
how has that changed you like if you

5359
03:02:13,120 --> 03:02:16,960
like in the privacy of your mind michael

5360
03:02:15,680 --> 03:02:18,960
malus

5361
03:02:16,959 --> 03:02:20,559
like how did you change now that you've

5362
03:02:18,959 --> 03:02:22,559
gotten

5363
03:02:20,559 --> 03:02:24,398
more attention let's say you know or

5364
03:02:22,559 --> 03:02:26,398
even the success of the book like is it

5365
03:02:24,398 --> 03:02:29,039
like take take yourself back to the the

5366
03:02:26,398 --> 03:02:30,959
you know you talk about the 20

5367
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:32,800
uh the early twenties the mid-twenties

5368
03:02:30,959 --> 03:02:34,639
person how are you different from that

5369
03:02:32,799 --> 03:02:36,639
person are you the same person are you

5370
03:02:34,639 --> 03:02:39,760
totally different that's an interesting

5371
03:02:36,639 --> 03:02:43,599
thought is putin the same person in 2020

5372
03:02:39,760 --> 03:02:45,279
as he was in 2010 and then in 2000

5373
03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:48,318
it's um

5374
03:02:45,279 --> 03:02:49,920
it's a non-trivial almost like

5375
03:02:48,318 --> 03:02:52,398
um and then the other thing without

5376
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:53,760
actually is this is a dynamic system

5377
03:02:52,398 --> 03:02:56,079
like on the one hand he's going to want

5378
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:57,439
to say we got it right every time right

5379
03:02:56,079 --> 03:02:59,279
but then how is that even possible when

5380
03:02:57,439 --> 03:03:02,159
you're dealing with a evolving

5381
03:02:59,279 --> 03:03:03,760
unknown dynamic situation when did you

5382
03:03:02,159 --> 03:03:06,159
guys get it wrong did that result in

5383
03:03:03,760 --> 03:03:08,398
lives lost do you feel guilty about that

5384
03:03:06,159 --> 03:03:10,398
i mean the big problem with the masks

5385
03:03:08,398 --> 03:03:12,639
the changing mind and the mask is the

5386
03:03:10,398 --> 03:03:15,920
arrogance and how it was communicated to

5387
03:03:12,639 --> 03:03:17,920
me a lot of this boils down to uh

5388
03:03:15,920 --> 03:03:19,359
how things are communicated

5389
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:20,719
it's like it's obvious that you need to

5390
03:03:19,359 --> 03:03:22,318
change your mind when you get new

5391
03:03:20,719 --> 03:03:24,719
information or sometimes yeah you take

5392
03:03:22,318 --> 03:03:26,879
policies that are like

5393
03:03:24,719 --> 03:03:28,559
we know the truth but we're going to lie

5394
03:03:26,879 --> 03:03:30,639
for a particular reason like you have

5395
03:03:28,559 --> 03:03:33,199
good intentions but if you're not able

5396
03:03:30,639 --> 03:03:35,519
to communicate that later like we made a

5397
03:03:33,200 --> 03:03:37,840
mistake or even ask him can you

5398
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:40,640
understand how

5399
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:43,120
a rational person might choose not to

5400
03:03:40,639 --> 03:03:45,119
get vaccinated

5401
03:03:43,120 --> 03:03:46,000
yes yes

5402
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:47,680
yes

5403
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:49,359
and if you can't steal man that then

5404
03:03:47,680 --> 03:03:51,120
that's the situation that's a good test

5405
03:03:49,359 --> 03:03:53,040
and i've tried and some people succeed

5406
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:55,680
and some people fail is the ability to

5407
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:57,120
really steal man the other understand

5408
03:03:55,680 --> 03:03:59,520
that somebody should would be hesitant

5409
03:03:57,120 --> 03:04:00,960
about taking the vaccine

5410
03:03:59,520 --> 03:04:04,079
yeah

5411
03:04:00,959 --> 03:04:06,000
it's a giant mess man uh this podcasting

5412
03:04:04,079 --> 03:04:08,239
is it's just a fun little conversation

5413
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:09,920
but it also has a responsibility

5414
03:04:08,239 --> 03:04:11,920
i don't know i don't know how joe does

5415
03:04:09,920 --> 03:04:13,439
it

5416
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:15,040
i don't think joe cares as much as you

5417
03:04:13,439 --> 03:04:16,559
do

5418
03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:18,080
it's more fun for him in a sense and

5419
03:04:16,559 --> 03:04:19,439
he's less concerned about the i mean

5420
03:04:18,079 --> 03:04:20,719
he's not unconcerned with the cultural

5421
03:04:19,439 --> 03:04:23,200
impact but for him it's just more

5422
03:04:20,719 --> 03:04:24,478
growing out yeah like he doesn't do as

5423
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:27,439
much prep he doesn't come in with three

5424
03:04:24,478 --> 03:04:29,840
pages single spaced you know questions

5425
03:04:27,439 --> 03:04:32,239
yeah and that's why he's talking to

5426
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:34,960
blair white for 10 minutes about whether

5427
03:04:32,239 --> 03:04:37,680
sharks lay eggs without knowing you're

5428
03:04:34,959 --> 03:04:40,239
the one triggered person

5429
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:42,000
uh maybe he he trolled the troll well it

5430
03:04:40,239 --> 03:04:44,239
worked yeah he did

5431
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:47,120
do sharks lay eggs

5432
03:04:44,239 --> 03:04:48,000
i'd like to get an updated 2021 version

5433
03:04:47,120 --> 03:04:49,760
of

5434
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:51,439
michael mal's giving advice to young

5435
03:04:49,760 --> 03:04:52,478
people

5436
03:04:51,439 --> 03:04:54,239
okay

5437
03:04:52,478 --> 03:04:55,679
so there's

5438
03:04:54,239 --> 03:04:57,279
god forbid

5439
03:04:55,680 --> 03:04:59,200
high school students

5440
03:04:57,279 --> 03:05:01,359
college students

5441
03:04:59,200 --> 03:05:03,359
listening to you

5442
03:05:01,359 --> 03:05:06,880
uh and looking to you for advice what

5443
03:05:03,359 --> 03:05:09,359
advice would you give them about career

5444
03:05:06,879 --> 03:05:10,959
and about life how to live a life they

5445
03:05:09,359 --> 03:05:12,680
can be proud of this happens a lot

5446
03:05:10,959 --> 03:05:14,159
because i have my locals community

5447
03:05:12,680 --> 03:05:16,239
malice.locals.com and there's a lot of

5448
03:05:14,159 --> 03:05:17,600
young people in there yeah so that's a

5449
03:05:16,239 --> 03:05:20,478
great place i'll give i'll give them a

5450
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:22,239
meta piece of advice don't ask your

5451
03:05:20,478 --> 03:05:24,478
friends for advice because you're an

5452
03:05:22,239 --> 03:05:25,760
idiot at your age and they're all idiots

5453
03:05:24,478 --> 03:05:26,799
and they don't want to seem like idiots

5454
03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:28,398
so they're just going to give you advice

5455
03:05:26,799 --> 03:05:29,519
they pulled it from the tv and no one

5456
03:05:28,398 --> 03:05:31,519
knows what you're talking about and it's

5457
03:05:29,520 --> 03:05:33,760
just going to be counterintuitive so

5458
03:05:31,520 --> 03:05:35,359
seek out advice from people

5459
03:05:33,760 --> 03:05:38,079
who

5460
03:05:35,359 --> 03:05:39,359
you seek to emulate yeah um and ask them

5461
03:05:38,079 --> 03:05:40,478
for advice if you can't get ahold of

5462
03:05:39,359 --> 03:05:41,279
them figure out a way to get a hold of

5463
03:05:40,478 --> 03:05:43,358
them

5464
03:05:41,279 --> 03:05:44,960
incentivize them in some way

5465
03:05:43,359 --> 03:05:47,359
you'd be surprised how many people are

5466
03:05:44,959 --> 03:05:48,719
responsive on twitter or in social media

5467
03:05:47,359 --> 03:05:50,000
if you just ask them a basic life

5468
03:05:48,719 --> 03:05:52,318
question because then they can quote

5469
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:54,639
tweet an answer to a whole population so

5470
03:05:52,318 --> 03:05:56,639
that would be one mechanism

5471
03:05:54,639 --> 03:05:59,519
it's also very hard at that age to

5472
03:05:56,639 --> 03:06:01,760
realize your parents might not

5473
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:03,200
be all that bright and they might not be

5474
03:06:01,760 --> 03:06:05,600
all that good people

5475
03:06:03,200 --> 03:06:07,359
um so that's a hard one at that age to

5476
03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:08,640
kind of wrap your head around just

5477
03:06:07,359 --> 03:06:10,720
because they love you doesn't mean they

5478
03:06:08,639 --> 03:06:11,920
understand you and that's okay

5479
03:06:10,719 --> 03:06:14,239
that's okay

5480
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:16,318
we think everybody oh [ __ ] you're

5481
03:06:14,239 --> 03:06:17,119
trump's pretty good too i i i i'd like

5482
03:06:16,318 --> 03:06:19,199
your

5483
03:06:17,120 --> 03:06:21,120
trump to talk to elon

5484
03:06:19,200 --> 03:06:24,640
conversation

5485
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:27,200
well mr president you know look uh

5486
03:06:24,639 --> 03:06:29,039
some things you did like some

5487
03:06:27,200 --> 03:06:31,600
not so much but you know for the most

5488
03:06:29,040 --> 03:06:34,240
part i think the kind of good thing what

5489
03:06:31,600 --> 03:06:34,239
are you talking about

5490
03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:40,319
um

5491
03:06:38,719 --> 03:06:42,159
hey guys what are you what are we

5492
03:06:40,318 --> 03:06:44,478
talking about [ __ ] i [ __ ] up the lex

5493
03:06:42,159 --> 03:06:46,959
anyway so that those would be two pieces

5494
03:06:44,478 --> 03:06:48,639
the other piece of advice i would say is

5495
03:06:46,959 --> 03:06:51,679
join a gym

5496
03:06:48,639 --> 03:06:55,039
or have some kind of

5497
03:06:51,680 --> 03:06:57,760
quantifiable daily improvement

5498
03:06:55,040 --> 03:07:01,279
to keep you sane so the reason i always

5499
03:06:57,760 --> 03:07:02,559
say weightlifting and it could be

5500
03:07:01,279 --> 03:07:04,399
running it could be jump rope i don't

5501
03:07:02,559 --> 03:07:06,000
care what it is because if you have

5502
03:07:04,398 --> 03:07:07,760
those numbers moving in the positive

5503
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:10,079
direction psychologically if you're

5504
03:07:07,760 --> 03:07:12,239
dealing with depression or anxiety it's

5505
03:07:10,079 --> 03:07:13,760
concrete proof to shut your brain up

5506
03:07:12,239 --> 03:07:16,318
because your brain

5507
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:18,000
knows how to talk to you your brain is

5508
03:07:16,318 --> 03:07:19,840
off on your enemy and it'll say exactly

5509
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:23,200
the right thing to undermine you so

5510
03:07:19,840 --> 03:07:25,359
that's an issue um b

5511
03:07:23,200 --> 03:07:27,200
i just this works for me maybe it worked

5512
03:07:25,359 --> 03:07:28,720
for most people i'm very high in the

5513
03:07:27,200 --> 03:07:30,880
openness metric

5514
03:07:28,719 --> 03:07:33,358
uh try new experiences new things try

5515
03:07:30,879 --> 03:07:34,559
things you don't like um it's okay to

5516
03:07:33,359 --> 03:07:36,800
have a bad experience you've learned

5517
03:07:34,559 --> 03:07:38,639
something so go to a restaurant of a

5518
03:07:36,799 --> 03:07:41,119
cuisine you wouldn't like or hadn't

5519
03:07:38,639 --> 03:07:42,639
heard of read a book that's popular but

5520
03:07:41,120 --> 03:07:45,040
you have no interest in

5521
03:07:42,639 --> 03:07:46,639
um read a lot for example i didn't know

5522
03:07:45,040 --> 03:07:48,880
anything about the

5523
03:07:46,639 --> 03:07:50,799
election what was it 1892 when there was

5524
03:07:48,879 --> 03:07:52,559
like a split between the electors read a

5525
03:07:50,799 --> 03:07:53,679
book about it oh i don't know anything

5526
03:07:52,559 --> 03:07:55,760
you know i don't think really about

5527
03:07:53,680 --> 03:07:57,520
malcolm x read a book about him uh

5528
03:07:55,760 --> 03:07:59,680
you'll be amazed how much

5529
03:07:57,520 --> 03:08:02,640
more full you become as a person do you

5530
03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:04,639
see value in writing also like writing

5531
03:08:02,639 --> 03:08:06,000
down your ideas no i think there's very

5532
03:08:04,639 --> 03:08:07,599
little value in that i'm not being i'm

5533
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,799
not joking because reading is where the

5534
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:09,840
biggest yeah because you're probably not

5535
03:08:08,799 --> 03:08:10,879
going to revisit what you've written

5536
03:08:09,840 --> 03:08:13,279
down

5537
03:08:10,879 --> 03:08:15,519
um but the act of writing you don't you

5538
03:08:13,279 --> 03:08:17,040
don't see it solidify somehow thoughts

5539
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:18,880
in your mind not for me yes yeah it

5540
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:20,800
doesn't like a tweet will because then

5541
03:08:18,879 --> 03:08:23,519
then i have to have it narrowed down

5542
03:08:20,799 --> 03:08:25,358
into like a phrase or the responsibility

5543
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:27,040
of there being an audience

5544
03:08:25,359 --> 03:08:28,479
no i just meant in terms of i've got 280

5545
03:08:27,040 --> 03:08:30,080
characters if instead of having a

5546
03:08:28,478 --> 03:08:32,000
briendry thought meandering thought i

5547
03:08:30,079 --> 03:08:34,079
have to codify it in something that's

5548
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:36,639
catchy and short that's a good useful

5549
03:08:34,079 --> 03:08:38,478
mental exercise what face do you make

5550
03:08:36,639 --> 03:08:40,559
when you tweet

5551
03:08:38,478 --> 03:08:41,679
i wouldn't know i don't know that's a

5552
03:08:40,559 --> 03:08:43,119
good point

5553
03:08:41,680 --> 03:08:45,200
is it on the toilet how much what

5554
03:08:43,120 --> 03:08:47,040
percentage is on the toilet very little

5555
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:49,600
on the toilets i usually more reading

5556
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:51,600
okay um so even though my tweets are all

5557
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:53,200
literally [ __ ] uh the very few of them

5558
03:08:51,600 --> 03:08:54,720
are on the toilet

5559
03:08:53,200 --> 03:08:57,680
um

5560
03:08:54,719 --> 03:08:57,679
that's some advice

5561
03:08:58,159 --> 03:09:04,239
don't compare yourself to other people

5562
03:09:01,760 --> 03:09:06,559
that's a really dangerous one

5563
03:09:04,239 --> 03:09:08,398
all my friends are married i should have

5564
03:09:06,559 --> 03:09:10,239
i should have a kid by

5565
03:09:08,398 --> 03:09:11,920
should there's an expression in recovery

5566
03:09:10,239 --> 03:09:14,879
stop shooting yourself

5567
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:16,639
but it's but it should should yeah it's

5568
03:09:14,879 --> 03:09:18,879
stupid yeah

5569
03:09:16,639 --> 03:09:19,840
i also and this could be my hoarder

5570
03:09:18,879 --> 03:09:21,599
brain

5571
03:09:19,840 --> 03:09:22,719
i surround my house with talismans of

5572
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:25,120
joy

5573
03:09:22,719 --> 03:09:27,119
so if you have an accomplishment

5574
03:09:25,120 --> 03:09:29,040
like when i did rogan once

5575
03:09:27,120 --> 03:09:30,479
i bought with the sock store and i

5576
03:09:29,040 --> 03:09:32,399
bought these orange socks with black

5577
03:09:30,478 --> 03:09:34,398
cherries on them and now whenever i wore

5578
03:09:32,398 --> 03:09:35,599
that socks those socks i'm like oh this

5579
03:09:34,398 --> 03:09:37,278
is because i was on rogan that was kind

5580
03:09:35,600 --> 03:09:38,960
of a big deal so if you have these

5581
03:09:37,279 --> 03:09:41,840
little things throughout your house

5582
03:09:38,959 --> 03:09:43,438
it gives good mental fuel even like like

5583
03:09:41,840 --> 03:09:44,880
a toy remember when i was a kid oh you

5584
03:09:43,439 --> 03:09:46,639
know what this

5585
03:09:44,879 --> 03:09:48,639
little moments that inspire happiness i

5586
03:09:46,639 --> 03:09:49,519
think are visually very useful

5587
03:09:48,639 --> 03:09:51,439
um

5588
03:09:49,520 --> 03:09:52,880
so that's another one

5589
03:09:51,439 --> 03:09:56,079
um

5590
03:09:52,879 --> 03:09:59,199
and i by the way have the

5591
03:09:56,079 --> 03:10:01,760
that the watch and um

5592
03:09:59,200 --> 03:10:04,960
that because we were talking about 2021

5593
03:10:01,760 --> 03:10:06,478
that was really um

5594
03:10:04,959 --> 03:10:07,679
the guy in the lecture hall giving you a

5595
03:10:06,478 --> 03:10:11,039
pat in the back

5596
03:10:07,680 --> 03:10:13,040
i wrote uh joe giving me the the watch

5597
03:10:11,040 --> 03:10:15,040
was um

5598
03:10:13,040 --> 03:10:17,120
he has life changing for me yeah yeah

5599
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:18,720
yeah it doesn't even it didn't the fact

5600
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:21,359
that it was on a podcast or whatever

5601
03:10:18,719 --> 03:10:23,840
doesn't matter learn how to

5602
03:10:21,359 --> 03:10:25,040
uh um form boundaries that's probably

5603
03:10:23,840 --> 03:10:27,120
the biggest that's gonna be number one

5604
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:28,640
on my list because you know explain

5605
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:30,000
you're gonna have people around you who

5606
03:10:28,639 --> 03:10:31,519
feel the need that they're entitled to

5607
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:32,799
your time who feel they need to

5608
03:10:31,520 --> 03:10:35,120
criticize you and they're not coming

5609
03:10:32,799 --> 03:10:36,159
from a good place yeah uh so it's very

5610
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:37,520
good for you to be like i'm not

5611
03:10:36,159 --> 03:10:39,200
interested in talking about this anymore

5612
03:10:37,520 --> 03:10:40,560
right now yeah uh even if it's your

5613
03:10:39,200 --> 03:10:42,319
parents even if you're especially if

5614
03:10:40,559 --> 03:10:43,840
it's your parents like i need my space

5615
03:10:42,318 --> 03:10:45,600
right now you're entitled to your space

5616
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:47,680
you're entitled to your time no one owes

5617
03:10:45,600 --> 03:10:49,279
you you don't owe anyone response uh if

5618
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:50,639
someone has a question you know them an

5619
03:10:49,279 --> 03:10:51,920
answer especially if they're not coming

5620
03:10:50,639 --> 03:10:53,358
at you in good faith or they're coming

5621
03:10:51,920 --> 03:10:54,799
in hostile way

5622
03:10:53,359 --> 03:10:57,520
that's a big one

5623
03:10:54,799 --> 03:10:59,278
it's hard to learn at that age

5624
03:10:57,520 --> 03:11:00,960
and

5625
03:10:59,279 --> 03:11:02,319
and and

5626
03:11:00,959 --> 03:11:03,599
be valuable

5627
03:11:02,318 --> 03:11:06,238
to

5628
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:09,439
those who are around you

5629
03:11:06,238 --> 03:11:10,318
be someone who people are happy to see

5630
03:11:09,439 --> 03:11:12,079
and

5631
03:11:10,318 --> 03:11:13,840
if things are bad like you're the one

5632
03:11:12,079 --> 03:11:16,159
that they can rely on

5633
03:11:13,840 --> 03:11:17,200
like i was just uh you know a little bit

5634
03:11:16,159 --> 03:11:18,318
under the weather and i thought to

5635
03:11:17,200 --> 03:11:20,000
myself you know what if things got

5636
03:11:18,318 --> 03:11:22,238
really bad i'll call blair

5637
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:25,040
and she would take care of me and and

5638
03:11:22,238 --> 03:11:27,119
that kind of was very reassuring

5639
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:28,800
and you can always call me if you have

5640
03:11:27,120 --> 03:11:30,800
your stuff lifted in

5641
03:11:28,799 --> 03:11:32,959
in uh

5642
03:11:30,799 --> 03:11:35,759
in an urgent matter because of the

5643
03:11:32,959 --> 03:11:37,278
robots no just me it's kind of that

5644
03:11:35,760 --> 03:11:39,120
that's those things that can help with

5645
03:11:37,279 --> 03:11:40,800
or you're actually literally bleeding

5646
03:11:39,120 --> 03:11:42,640
not a good caretaker i can save you

5647
03:11:40,799 --> 03:11:44,799
though i can murder if you need somebody

5648
03:11:42,639 --> 03:11:46,879
murdered yeah i do this yeah yeah

5649
03:11:44,799 --> 03:11:48,398
um

5650
03:11:46,879 --> 03:11:51,559
wait what advice would you have to kids

5651
03:11:48,398 --> 03:11:51,559
that age

5652
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:55,680
and you're all you're a lot younger than

5653
03:11:53,680 --> 03:11:58,000
you think you are that's the other one

5654
03:11:55,680 --> 03:12:00,000
like yeah there's time i know

5655
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:02,238
like it's impossible to understand when

5656
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:03,840
you're 26 that your 40s are better than

5657
03:12:02,238 --> 03:12:05,359
your 30s because it's like okay old man

5658
03:12:03,840 --> 03:12:07,840
you're that's all cope

5659
03:12:05,359 --> 03:12:10,318
i promise you it is

5660
03:12:07,840 --> 03:12:13,920
yeah i think uh he says so many

5661
03:12:10,318 --> 03:12:13,920
beautiful things i i would say

5662
03:12:14,398 --> 03:12:19,599
another version of the openness i'll say

5663
03:12:16,879 --> 03:12:20,719
take big risks when you're young yeah

5664
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:22,238
because if you fail who cares you're

5665
03:12:20,719 --> 03:12:25,840
sleeping in a suit it's not a futon who

5666
03:12:22,238 --> 03:12:28,478
cares yeah and take them often yeah um

5667
03:12:25,840 --> 03:12:30,639
also this is more a little personal to

5668
03:12:28,478 --> 03:12:30,639
me

5669
03:12:30,719 --> 03:12:37,438
i get pushback on this but i think

5670
03:12:34,318 --> 03:12:40,959
take big risks and work really hard

5671
03:12:37,439 --> 03:12:43,359
like at whatever you do like i think you

5672
03:12:40,959 --> 03:12:45,599
just have to give yourself to a thing it

5673
03:12:43,359 --> 03:12:47,680
doesn't have to be in terms of time but

5674
03:12:45,600 --> 03:12:49,920
really give everything so it's not like

5675
03:12:47,680 --> 03:12:52,800
i'm going to try

5676
03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:55,120
doing this i'll try i'll try

5677
03:12:52,799 --> 03:12:57,119
try

5678
03:12:55,120 --> 03:12:59,439
with all of your heart

5679
03:12:57,120 --> 03:13:01,439
like really commit yourself that doesn't

5680
03:12:59,439 --> 03:13:02,398
mean necessarily ours that doesn't mean

5681
03:13:01,439 --> 03:13:04,960
but like

5682
03:13:02,398 --> 03:13:06,238
if you fail at doing a thing that you

5683
03:13:04,959 --> 03:13:07,919
commit to

5684
03:13:06,238 --> 03:13:09,520
it should hurt

5685
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:12,079
it's like uh when i competed in jiu

5686
03:13:09,520 --> 03:13:13,600
jitsu or you do like sports and so on

5687
03:13:12,079 --> 03:13:16,079
don't just say i'm gonna have fun out

5688
03:13:13,600 --> 03:13:18,559
there so on no try to win

5689
03:13:16,079 --> 03:13:20,159
and because then if you don't it hurts

5690
03:13:18,559 --> 03:13:21,920
and you learn from that

5691
03:13:20,159 --> 03:13:24,639
um and then throughout i think that's

5692
03:13:21,920 --> 03:13:27,359
the goodness thing is be kind

5693
03:13:24,639 --> 03:13:29,039
it's like some of it is also skill

5694
03:13:27,359 --> 03:13:32,880
allowing yourself to be kind i found

5695
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:34,800
myself earlier in life i still do this

5696
03:13:32,879 --> 03:13:36,238
i find like when i hang out with people

5697
03:13:34,799 --> 03:13:37,199
people are often like cynical and

5698
03:13:36,238 --> 03:13:39,520
negative

5699
03:13:37,200 --> 03:13:42,000
and yeah i try to avoid those people no

5700
03:13:39,520 --> 03:13:44,960
but like they i think everybody falls

5701
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:46,318
into that and sometimes it's the party

5702
03:13:44,959 --> 03:13:48,079
norm thing

5703
03:13:46,318 --> 03:13:50,159
there's a temptation to me

5704
03:13:48,079 --> 03:13:53,359
to kind of fit in by being more negative

5705
03:13:50,159 --> 03:13:54,559
than i'm comfortable being and so

5706
03:13:53,359 --> 03:13:56,479
um

5707
03:13:54,559 --> 03:13:58,799
resist the pressure i think especially

5708
03:13:56,478 --> 03:13:59,760
when you're younger it's not cool to

5709
03:13:58,799 --> 03:14:02,079
care

5710
03:13:59,760 --> 03:14:05,439
the thing that drives when you're young

5711
03:14:02,079 --> 03:14:07,920
if you are a fan of a band yeah a writer

5712
03:14:05,439 --> 03:14:10,079
a podcast or an actor and people roll

5713
03:14:07,920 --> 03:14:12,799
their eyes at you watch out those people

5714
03:14:10,079 --> 03:14:14,478
are dangerous you should have it's if

5715
03:14:12,799 --> 03:14:16,559
you love avril lavigne

5716
03:14:14,478 --> 03:14:18,719
with her terrible music and she makes

5717
03:14:16,559 --> 03:14:20,398
you gives you joy and people crap on you

5718
03:14:18,719 --> 03:14:22,879
they're wrong and you're right

5719
03:14:20,398 --> 03:14:24,959
so hold on to those things that make you

5720
03:14:22,879 --> 03:14:26,959
happy and if people want to take that

5721
03:14:24,959 --> 03:14:28,639
away from you or they how could you like

5722
03:14:26,959 --> 03:14:30,159
that what those people are not your

5723
03:14:28,639 --> 03:14:32,559
friends

5724
03:14:30,159 --> 03:14:35,279
why do you have to go make life so

5725
03:14:32,559 --> 03:14:35,278
complicated

5726
03:14:35,359 --> 03:14:39,840
my she's my favorite um favorite

5727
03:14:38,238 --> 03:14:43,039
musician of all time

5728
03:14:39,840 --> 03:14:43,920
jimi hendrix second ever living first

5729
03:14:43,040 --> 03:14:45,359
um

5730
03:14:43,920 --> 03:14:48,079
thank you for almost bringing a deer to

5731
03:14:45,359 --> 03:14:50,318
my eye uh you mentioned the shadows in

5732
03:14:48,079 --> 03:14:51,520
terms of love and you should have kids

5733
03:14:50,318 --> 03:14:53,439
by now

5734
03:14:51,520 --> 03:14:56,479
i apologize if it's a personal one but i

5735
03:14:53,439 --> 03:14:58,318
think at least i have this thought and

5736
03:14:56,478 --> 03:15:01,358
not from society but for myself like i

5737
03:14:58,318 --> 03:15:03,278
want to get married i want to have kids

5738
03:15:01,359 --> 03:15:05,600
do you feel the pressure of that

5739
03:15:03,279 --> 03:15:07,840
do you want to have kids i do don't want

5740
03:15:05,600 --> 03:15:10,720
to have kids get married

5741
03:15:07,840 --> 03:15:12,719
i do want to get married um

5742
03:15:10,719 --> 03:15:15,519
this was an issue that i had to kind of

5743
03:15:12,719 --> 03:15:16,478
work out earlier this year um in terms

5744
03:15:15,520 --> 03:15:18,640
of

5745
03:15:16,478 --> 03:15:20,159
the possibility of having kids because i

5746
03:15:18,639 --> 03:15:21,519
was

5747
03:15:20,159 --> 03:15:23,359
in a relationship with someone who would

5748
03:15:21,520 --> 03:15:24,319
have been in many ways literally a

5749
03:15:23,359 --> 03:15:27,200
perfect

5750
03:15:24,318 --> 03:15:28,959
uh mom so i did my due diligence and i

5751
03:15:27,200 --> 03:15:30,079
actually sat down

5752
03:15:28,959 --> 03:15:31,839
with

5753
03:15:30,079 --> 03:15:33,520
friends of mine who had kids and i say

5754
03:15:31,840 --> 03:15:35,439
give me the downside

5755
03:15:33,520 --> 03:15:37,200
um like what if you did the pros and the

5756
03:15:35,439 --> 03:15:40,159
cons well the pros i knew the pros for

5757
03:15:37,200 --> 03:15:41,520
kids are very i love kids i was just

5758
03:15:40,159 --> 03:15:43,840
with frank fleming he writes for the

5759
03:15:41,520 --> 03:15:45,520
babylon b and he had his four kids and

5760
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:47,040
his youngest son has down syndrome was

5761
03:15:45,520 --> 03:15:50,399
just adorable

5762
03:15:47,040 --> 03:15:52,319
uh winchester's so cute um

5763
03:15:50,398 --> 03:15:54,559
and i always get along with kids very

5764
03:15:52,318 --> 03:15:57,199
like the go like i remember

5765
03:15:54,559 --> 03:15:59,600
very vividly what it was like to be a

5766
03:15:57,200 --> 03:16:01,279
kid especially a precocious kid and i

5767
03:15:59,600 --> 03:16:02,800
remember how much it bothered me when my

5768
03:16:01,279 --> 03:16:04,800
parents friends

5769
03:16:02,799 --> 03:16:06,879
wouldn't give me attention so i always

5770
03:16:04,799 --> 03:16:09,039
make it a point to acknowledge kids to

5771
03:16:06,879 --> 03:16:11,438
talk to them and they're very grateful

5772
03:16:09,040 --> 03:16:12,960
and and it's just really fun um

5773
03:16:11,439 --> 03:16:14,318
especially the people who i'm friends

5774
03:16:12,959 --> 03:16:15,278
with their kids are probably gonna be

5775
03:16:14,318 --> 03:16:16,879
pretty cool they're not gonna be

5776
03:16:15,279 --> 03:16:17,840
annoying and you know kind of ugly and

5777
03:16:16,879 --> 03:16:20,000
overweight

5778
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:21,040
um

5779
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:23,359
so

5780
03:16:21,040 --> 03:16:25,840
i uh i love you got that in there okay

5781
03:16:23,359 --> 03:16:26,960
good yeah sorry sorry i'll go but

5782
03:16:25,840 --> 03:16:29,279
um

5783
03:16:26,959 --> 03:16:31,039
but the cons the negatives what was the

5784
03:16:29,279 --> 03:16:32,640
conversation like about that like well

5785
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:34,399
my sis i talked my you know my sister

5786
03:16:32,639 --> 03:16:37,680
has two kids my nephews who i absolutely

5787
03:16:34,398 --> 03:16:38,879
adore whatever their names are and

5788
03:16:37,680 --> 03:16:40,398
she was

5789
03:16:38,879 --> 03:16:42,398
like she was saying certain things it's

5790
03:16:40,398 --> 03:16:44,959
like if i had kids my kids are in my top

5791
03:16:42,398 --> 03:16:47,599
priority yeah like it's not even a

5792
03:16:44,959 --> 03:16:49,759
question and i feel like the work i'm

5793
03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:50,640
doing and this sounds pompous but it's

5794
03:16:49,760 --> 03:16:51,920
true

5795
03:16:50,639 --> 03:16:54,318
is a

5796
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:58,159
valuable and important but i'm also the

5797
03:16:54,318 --> 03:16:59,359
only one doing it so this is a big cost

5798
03:16:58,159 --> 03:17:01,600
and

5799
03:16:59,359 --> 03:17:04,000
so it's like it would be a major

5800
03:17:01,600 --> 03:17:05,760
lifestyle readjustment

5801
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:08,559
and i'm at the point where i'm kind of

5802
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:10,398
like selfish enough that i i wouldn't

5803
03:17:08,559 --> 03:17:12,398
want to do that and also it would have

5804
03:17:10,398 --> 03:17:14,719
to be the right woman like like you're

5805
03:17:12,398 --> 03:17:16,879
making a commitment you know and since

5806
03:17:14,719 --> 03:17:18,719
you know they're all crazy you have to

5807
03:17:16,879 --> 03:17:21,438
find one where you can handle the crazy

5808
03:17:18,719 --> 03:17:23,119
oh all women are crazy yeah

5809
03:17:21,439 --> 03:17:24,479
they're one and a half's in a binary

5810
03:17:23,120 --> 03:17:28,479
world

5811
03:17:24,478 --> 03:17:30,398
oh boy yeah it's not comfortable for me

5812
03:17:28,478 --> 03:17:31,679
um

5813
03:17:30,398 --> 03:17:33,199
but do you feel the pressure and

5814
03:17:31,680 --> 03:17:35,680
thinking of that how much does that

5815
03:17:33,200 --> 03:17:38,399
weigh on your heart like uh so so elon

5816
03:17:35,680 --> 03:17:40,800
has kids like i i feel

5817
03:17:38,398 --> 03:17:44,000
like i'm i love everything and i love

5818
03:17:40,799 --> 03:17:46,639
stuff i do i love the robot over there

5819
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:50,559
just working with robots and

5820
03:17:46,639 --> 03:17:50,559
and but i do feel the pressure of like

5821
03:17:52,840 --> 03:17:57,520
um almost like when there's amazing

5822
03:17:55,760 --> 03:18:00,159
cuisines you never tried or something

5823
03:17:57,520 --> 03:18:02,079
like that like go out there and try it

5824
03:18:00,159 --> 03:18:03,279
like you need to put in the work and i

5825
03:18:02,079 --> 03:18:06,000
don't know

5826
03:18:03,279 --> 03:18:07,520
um like life will run away from you slip

5827
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:09,200
through your fingers before you truly

5828
03:18:07,520 --> 03:18:10,800
get to experience this other kind of

5829
03:18:09,200 --> 03:18:13,200
love which is

5830
03:18:10,799 --> 03:18:15,278
like long-term

5831
03:18:13,200 --> 03:18:17,760
love for another human being which is

5832
03:18:15,279 --> 03:18:19,439
like marriage and then

5833
03:18:17,760 --> 03:18:23,760
love for kids

5834
03:18:19,439 --> 03:18:24,639
yeah and it almost makes me sad like

5835
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:27,439
not

5836
03:18:24,639 --> 03:18:29,680
getting to experience that

5837
03:18:27,439 --> 03:18:30,720
you know because i'm also really scared

5838
03:18:29,680 --> 03:18:33,120
of

5839
03:18:30,719 --> 03:18:34,398
i've seen so many bad stories on the

5840
03:18:33,120 --> 03:18:36,319
partner side

5841
03:18:34,398 --> 03:18:38,318
like being with the wrong person right

5842
03:18:36,318 --> 03:18:40,318
it can that to me is you know i'm not

5843
03:18:38,318 --> 03:18:41,600
worried i have kids all day in fact i

5844
03:18:40,318 --> 03:18:43,439
could probably just have kids without

5845
03:18:41,600 --> 03:18:45,520
the the partner

5846
03:18:43,439 --> 03:18:48,159
um

5847
03:18:45,520 --> 03:18:50,800
kids i think are incredible but the

5848
03:18:48,159 --> 03:18:52,719
like the the partner like a wife

5849
03:18:50,799 --> 03:18:54,639
it seems like she could then have the

5850
03:18:52,719 --> 03:18:56,318
negative consequences for like you as a

5851
03:18:54,639 --> 03:18:58,159
writer on your productivity and your

5852
03:18:56,318 --> 03:19:00,478
mental ability to flourish of being a

5853
03:18:58,159 --> 03:19:02,159
joy to others to those kinds of things

5854
03:19:00,478 --> 03:19:04,238
you know what i that's that couldn't

5855
03:19:02,159 --> 03:19:05,279
happen because every relationship i've

5856
03:19:04,238 --> 03:19:08,719
had

5857
03:19:05,279 --> 03:19:08,720
uh they've been very

5858
03:19:09,760 --> 03:19:14,478
beyond supportive like don't they'd

5859
03:19:12,559 --> 03:19:16,000
rather do the i take an hour and do your

5860
03:19:14,478 --> 03:19:18,159
work than spend time with me like i

5861
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:19,760
believe in what you're doing yeah so i

5862
03:19:18,159 --> 03:19:21,439
couldn't even casually date someone who

5863
03:19:19,760 --> 03:19:23,600
didn't believe that yeah so that's

5864
03:19:21,439 --> 03:19:25,439
energizing yes but over time you never

5865
03:19:23,600 --> 03:19:28,000
know like how that evolves and all those

5866
03:19:25,439 --> 03:19:29,600
kinds of things and for me i think we're

5867
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:31,120
a little bit different i mean that has

5868
03:19:29,600 --> 03:19:33,439
to do with the engineering thing i just

5869
03:19:31,120 --> 03:19:35,359
have to pull insane hours yeah so i

5870
03:19:33,439 --> 03:19:38,159
don't i work like two hours a day but

5871
03:19:35,359 --> 03:19:39,600
that's what like creatives do like

5872
03:19:38,159 --> 03:19:41,200
you can only work a couple hours

5873
03:19:39,600 --> 03:19:43,120
honestly to be

5874
03:19:41,200 --> 03:19:45,279
uh to be productive and most of the time

5875
03:19:43,120 --> 03:19:48,880
not i have to do a lot of menial labor

5876
03:19:45,279 --> 03:19:51,120
like and so there there's legit

5877
03:19:48,879 --> 03:19:53,438
tension on the time and attention all

5878
03:19:51,120 --> 03:19:55,120
those kinds of things i don't know

5879
03:19:53,439 --> 03:19:57,840
do you think about this stuff a lot or

5880
03:19:55,120 --> 03:19:59,600
or do you just love life and and do cool

5881
03:19:57,840 --> 03:20:02,960
stuff and whatever happens happens i

5882
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:04,479
have been so blessed for so long now

5883
03:20:02,959 --> 03:20:06,879
that i'm at the point where i don't

5884
03:20:04,478 --> 03:20:09,519
think about it and i'm like

5885
03:20:06,879 --> 03:20:13,039
uh you know just like miracles happen

5886
03:20:09,520 --> 03:20:16,399
every day so just yeah be open to it

5887
03:20:13,040 --> 03:20:18,000
you uh think about your death mortality

5888
03:20:16,398 --> 03:20:19,840
yes

5889
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:21,600
fear what do you feel about it i'm just

5890
03:20:19,840 --> 03:20:22,880
worried i want to take as many people

5891
03:20:21,600 --> 03:20:25,600
out with me

5892
03:20:22,879 --> 03:20:29,119
as possible so suitcase news that's what

5893
03:20:25,600 --> 03:20:29,120
nuke suitcase i'm thinking

5894
03:20:30,719 --> 03:20:37,358
that would be kind of like ironic as my

5895
03:20:34,238 --> 03:20:39,199
other favorite i think about my legacy

5896
03:20:37,359 --> 03:20:41,439
um and that's why my books are so

5897
03:20:39,200 --> 03:20:43,439
important to me

5898
03:20:41,439 --> 03:20:45,920
so the is it a do you think of it as a

5899
03:20:43,439 --> 03:20:47,840
kind of immortality it is though like

5900
03:20:45,920 --> 03:20:49,680
that's who you are is those books well

5901
03:20:47,840 --> 03:20:51,279
it's not who i am i mean like my legacy

5902
03:20:49,680 --> 03:20:54,000
certainly is

5903
03:20:51,279 --> 03:20:55,520
what do you hope your legacy is

5904
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:57,200
um

5905
03:20:55,520 --> 03:20:59,439
that i

5906
03:20:57,200 --> 03:21:00,239
encouraged people to

5907
03:20:59,439 --> 03:21:02,398
be

5908
03:21:00,238 --> 03:21:04,639
hopeful and that i taught them how to be

5909
03:21:02,398 --> 03:21:04,639
free

5910
03:21:05,359 --> 03:21:08,720
and you know my favorite i think the

5911
03:21:07,200 --> 03:21:11,600
best show of all time

5912
03:21:08,719 --> 03:21:13,278
was dallas which often gets a it was

5913
03:21:11,600 --> 03:21:15,279
like an 80s soap opera and people

5914
03:21:13,279 --> 03:21:16,960
conflate it with dynasty and they think

5915
03:21:15,279 --> 03:21:18,479
it's trashy and it was very

5916
03:21:16,959 --> 03:21:20,799
shakespearean because all the characters

5917
03:21:18,478 --> 03:21:22,639
are motivated by different values and

5918
03:21:20,799 --> 03:21:24,398
the writing is just masterful and the

5919
03:21:22,639 --> 03:21:26,959
acting is masterful

5920
03:21:24,398 --> 03:21:28,799
and i'm not going to spoil anything one

5921
03:21:26,959 --> 03:21:29,599
season ended

5922
03:21:28,799 --> 03:21:31,119
with

5923
03:21:29,600 --> 03:21:33,200
one the characters on their death bed in

5924
03:21:31,120 --> 03:21:34,560
the hospital and the whole cast is there

5925
03:21:33,200 --> 03:21:36,640
and the amount of acting talent in that

5926
03:21:34,559 --> 03:21:39,278
room is just

5927
03:21:36,639 --> 03:21:41,760
just phenomenal um

5928
03:21:39,279 --> 03:21:43,359
and as the character is dying they look

5929
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:45,359
around and they go

5930
03:21:43,359 --> 03:21:47,359
like please be kind to one another be a

5931
03:21:45,359 --> 03:21:48,800
family and they're yelling at this

5932
03:21:47,359 --> 03:21:51,279
character don't you dare die on me you

5933
03:21:48,799 --> 03:21:52,398
know and you can see the actors you know

5934
03:21:51,279 --> 03:21:54,159
because they're losing their cast mate

5935
03:21:52,398 --> 03:21:55,278
who they've had from the beginning and

5936
03:21:54,159 --> 03:21:56,559
it would have been a perfect ending to

5937
03:21:55,279 --> 03:21:59,359
the show but obviously it's a cash cow

5938
03:21:56,559 --> 03:22:00,879
they got to keep milking it and

5939
03:21:59,359 --> 03:22:02,399
i think that like kindness and

5940
03:22:00,879 --> 03:22:03,759
tenderness and this is michael malus

5941
03:22:02,398 --> 03:22:06,398
talking

5942
03:22:03,760 --> 03:22:09,200
it's there's a lot of people

5943
03:22:06,398 --> 03:22:11,119
who want to make it

5944
03:22:09,200 --> 03:22:12,880
that if you are kind or tender you're

5945
03:22:11,120 --> 03:22:14,720
going to have consequences

5946
03:22:12,879 --> 03:22:17,278
bad consequences and i think it's

5947
03:22:14,719 --> 03:22:19,119
important for me at least to create a

5948
03:22:17,279 --> 03:22:22,238
space in my life

5949
03:22:19,120 --> 03:22:24,160
that if someone is going to be nice or

5950
03:22:22,238 --> 03:22:26,559
friendly or kind that they're not going

5951
03:22:24,159 --> 03:22:28,639
to have to feel stupid or

5952
03:22:26,559 --> 03:22:30,079
bad about it it's we have such a it's

5953
03:22:28,639 --> 03:22:31,599
such a disincentive like this set of

5954
03:22:30,079 --> 03:22:34,159
structures so different like if you want

5955
03:22:31,600 --> 03:22:36,159
to be cynical and sneering like round of

5956
03:22:34,159 --> 03:22:38,478
applause but if someone says oh this is

5957
03:22:36,159 --> 03:22:40,719
great like okay simp it's it's really

5958
03:22:38,478 --> 03:22:40,719
bad

5959
03:22:40,879 --> 03:22:45,039
well i think you do just this you do

5960
03:22:42,639 --> 03:22:46,959
this today you do this

5961
03:22:45,040 --> 03:22:48,960
in our friendship and you do it for a

5962
03:22:46,959 --> 03:22:52,238
very large number of people is teach

5963
03:22:48,959 --> 03:22:53,839
them how to be how to have hope yes and

5964
03:22:52,238 --> 03:22:55,199
