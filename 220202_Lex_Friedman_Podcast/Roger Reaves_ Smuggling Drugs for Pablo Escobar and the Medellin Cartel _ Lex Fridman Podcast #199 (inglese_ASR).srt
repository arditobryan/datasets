support this podcast let me say a few

33
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,920
words about roger reeves

34
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,920
pablo escobar and the war on drugs this

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,118
conversation with roger is unlike any

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,680
i've ever done

37
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:17,200
in the eyes of many including the law

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,200
roger is a criminal

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
a bad man who has added to the suffering

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,079
in the world

41
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,239
but he never directly engaged or

42
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,039
participated in the violence

43
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,118
unlike his bosses pablo escobar and

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,079
jorge ochoa

45
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,359
his crime was a transport of drugs i

46
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,919
thought about this

47
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,920
and about pablo escobar who was at once

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,920
both a brutal murderer

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
and a robin hood figure who helped the

50
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,200
poor and was loved by thousands

51
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,000
if not millions we sometimes idolize

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,478
murderers

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,399
and destroy good honest men we give

54
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,159
power and money to corrupt politicians

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,879
and dictators that starve and murder

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,200
their own people given this

57
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,280
i think about what makes for a good man

58
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,159
and what makes for a bad man

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,478
and who decides sitting across from

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,960
roger i saw a complicated man

61
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,080
but one who has kindness in his heart a

62
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,840
love for money

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,599
and adventure and a disdain for violence

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,800
again his crime was the transport of

65
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,000
drugs since 1971 the war on drugs has

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
cost us

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,479
one trillion dollars marijuana

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,560
legalization alone would save and make

69
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:29,039
13.7 billion dollars that could send

70
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,199
more than 650 000 students to public

71
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,840
universities every year

72
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,759
then there's a human stories of the 500

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,280
000 human beings sitting in prison for

74
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,518
drug-related offenses

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
and the 1.1 million on probation and

76
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,120
parole

77
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,000
their life is damaged or ruined beyond

78
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,480
repair

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,680
due to the prohibition of drugs there's

80
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,280
a lot more to be said

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,760
about the damage done by the war on

82
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,519
drugs but when reading about roger's

83
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,439
story and talking to him

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,759
i couldn't escape the thought that while

85
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,919
society wants to label him a criminal

86
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,280
and a bad human being there are much

87
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,559
worse men out there

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,280
who we give a path to even give power to

89
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,878
even men who hold political office or

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
run companies

91
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,039
i also think about my role as an

92
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,919
interviewer sitting across a man like

93
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,039
roger

94
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,878
in these interviews in life in many ways

95
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,878
i continue to be myself

96
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,919
a person who like dostoyevsky is the

97
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:26,719
idiot seeks the good in all people

98
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,000
but is hurt by it on occasion and maybe

99
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,359
is destroyed by it

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,158
in the end i'm not naive but i'm also

101
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,799
optimistic

102
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,439
and have hope for humanity that's who i

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,519
am

104
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,799
and that's what these conversations are

105
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
i hope you join me

106
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,040
and i hope you understand that i come

107
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,199
from a place of love

108
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,560
this is the lex friedman podcast and

109
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,839
here's my conversation

110
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,239
with roger reeves you are

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
one of the most prolific drug smugglers

112
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,640
in history

113
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,360
what would you say motivated you money

114
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,359
power

115
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
the thrill or was it something else

116
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,519
money but

117
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,039
isn't there a point where you've had

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,319
more money than you can possibly know

119
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,239
what to do with

120
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:13,598
was it always more money you know

121
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,399
i had plenty of money several times and

122
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,238
i think it's sort of like if you was in

123
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,959
las vegas and you had the

124
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,638
slot machine handled down and the gold

125
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,839
coins were stumbling around you and you

126
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,199
had sweepers

127
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:29,198
bagging them up when would you let it go

128
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,720
but isn't some part of that the thrill

129
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,240
then oh it was a lot of

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,840
real sometimes way too much you made uh

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,918
certainly tens of millions of dollars

132
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,799
probably much more what memorable

133
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,799
experience

134
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,639
did having that much money make possible

135
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,919
for you so there's one thing is the

136
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,519
money

137
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,120
and the other thing is what that money

138
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,039
can buy

139
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,800
well i bought everything that i could

140
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,040
hide i bought

141
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,879
seven farms i owned uh the uh

142
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,199
the city the land where the city of

143
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,600
moreno valley california is

144
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,680
had an option on that land did the

145
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,000
planning and development of that

146
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,000
uh the most expensive corn in the world

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,759
yachts ships airplanes galore

148
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,720
that bring you happiness no absolutely

149
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,479
not

150
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,800
in fact i think i'm happier now i know

151
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,639
i'm happier now so looking back

152
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,478
would you do it the same way all again

153
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,000
no way really even the thrill of it

154
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,680
not even the thrill of it it wasn't

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,800
worth 33 years in prison

156
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,319
being away from my lovely family

157
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,879
so money what about the power just being

158
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,478
on top of the world where nobody can

159
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:48,800
not the the governments

160
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:50,959
the police all the big bad agencies

161
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,639
chasing you and you could do whatever

162
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,918
the heck you wanted

163
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,680
as far as having to look over your

164
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,159
shoulder everywhere you

165
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,199
went and every phone call you made make

166
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,720
sure that you was

167
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,280
naked with somebody in the ocean before

168
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
you talked

169
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,120
it's rather uncomfortable yeah

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
um i like to make phone calls the same

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,600
way

172
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
what was it like meeting and working

173
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,639
with pablo escobar

174
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,359
the leader of the medellin cartel he was

175
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,038
just uh

176
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
just seemed like a gentleman when i met

177
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,000
him just like you and i sitting here

178
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,280
shook hands and

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,279
i had flown one load for a fella and uh

180
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,879
it didn't work out well the fellow that

181
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,399
i give it to got shot and it took a

182
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,079
while to get my money and they didn't

183
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,439
put as many kilos on the plane as

184
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,719
they're supposed to and

185
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,399
so i wasn't going to work with them

186
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,759
anymore and my contact down there

187
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,279

spoke english

203
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,038
and he said that each one of those

204
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
telephones were represented in another

205
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,879

208
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,839
and so we chatted a while and uh he

209
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,598
asked me what type of airplanes i had

210
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,279
and what experience i had flying across

211
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,959
the u.s border

212
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:37,038
and i told him he seemed pleased with it

213
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,079
and he called the lady in and she went

214
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,918
next door

215
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,839
and came pablo escobar and he introduced

216
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,560
me to pablo escobar and

217
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,679
he asked the same questions again and uh

218
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,680
i answered them and i said

219
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
and i i asked them how much they paid

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,598
and they paid five thousand dollars a

221
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,639
kilo

222
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:57,439
to haul it and uh so that's how much he

223
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,439
put on the plane he's 300 500

224
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,439
that's one and a half two and a half

225
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,038
million dollars for an eight-hour trip

226
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,560
sounded pretty good to me and we're

227
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,318
talking about cocaine

228
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,120
cocaine we're talking about colombia

229
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,919
colombia and cocaine and medellin cartel

230
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,560
and uh jorge ochoa was one of the what

231
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,560
would you say

232
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,079
founding members of the probably the

233
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,478
brains behind the whole thing

234
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:20,000
the brains and spoke good english yes

235
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,800
and they were nice people

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,598
really nice people were you scared not

237
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,879
at all

238
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:27,598
what's wrong with your mind that you

239
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,720
weren't scared here's some of the most

240
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,959
dangerous men

241
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,399
in this world and you weren't scared

242
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,000
well i knew i was going to do exactly

243
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,278
what i said i was going to do

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,559
murray and the children were down there

245
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:37,038
they went down and they stayed in the

246
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,359
hotel

247
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,158
five star and treated royally on my

248
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,918
first load

249
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,720
and they just did ask security to make

250
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:48,319
sure that i wasn't a dea agent

251
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,360
so i uh i did the first load and

252
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,278
they would they can say they were

253
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,839
hostages but they really weren't it was

254
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,958
just

255
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,399
insurance so there was some integrity to

256
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,000
the way they operated

257
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:03,839
completely i mean straight straight up

258
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,080
the money was ironed and bad banded

259
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,519
and just right and the numbers were

260
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,519
never once

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,600
anything wrong with it what would you

262
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,600
attribute that honesty to

263
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,519
within the their own moral system and

264
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,080
their own set of rules

265
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,200
why weren't people crossing the line and

266
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,720
shaving off the top

267
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,720
and and uh injecting chaos into the

268
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,639
system to where

269
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,240
it would be unpredictable and people

270
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,679
would be dishonest and greedy and all

271
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
those kinds of things

272
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,879
that's true most people are but there's

273
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,279
certain people at the top of the food

274
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,480
chain

275
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:40,399
that they don't need that and if they're

276
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,759
completely honest

277
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,839
then they don't have to think of

278
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,439
remember the lie they told

279
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,600
and and plus they just honest to start

280
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,160
with they're they're they making plenty

281
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,440
of money

282
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,159
they was making as much money as i did

283
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,720
i uh i'll tell you how that um that came

284
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,879
about

285
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,440
i understand that 10 000 people were

286
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,200
killed every year in medellin colombia

287
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,680
and what they were doing they didn't

288
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,800
they didn't have any organization

289
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,838
and uh if one fellow had 10 kilos and he

290
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,240
wanted it shipped to

291
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,760
new york he would tell his friend and

292
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,200
his friend said sure i'll ship it i have

293
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,799
a pilot and i'll ship it up

294
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,120
and then he would look in the newspapers

295
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:20,078
oh 40 kilos was busted in new jersey

296
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,560
i'm so sorry yours got busted bang bang

297
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:25,759
he's dead

298
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,838
so here comes jorge ochoa and the

299
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,039
three ochoa brothers and pablo escobar

300
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,279
and gotcho and

301
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,278
they decided that we will make an

302
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,120
insurance company

303
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,559
that we would charge you ten thousand

304
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,839
dollars to take it to your

305
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:42,239
contact in miami

306
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,760
if it gets lost anywhere between the

307
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,519
time i put it on the airplane

308
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,120
or the time you give it to us and the

309
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,240
time we give it to your man

310
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,480
we will replace it in colombia for you

311
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,399
so there was no way anybody could lose

312
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,079
and i understand they got a hundred tons

313
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,320
piled up

314
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,639
under that insurance program and i was

315
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,600
right there the first day

316
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,879
so i had all the work i could do i would

317
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,680
land in this i said when you want me to

318
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:09,039
come back

319
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,319
we waiting on you senor well let me ask

320
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,919
a difficult question uh

321
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,278
some see escobar as a brutal murderer

322
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,838
and some see him as

323
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,360
um maybe a robin hood like figure who

324
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,399
helped the poor

325
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,000
how do you see the man both of them i

326
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,039
think he started out to be honest would

327
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,958
help the poor

328
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,278
and then they had a war down there and

329
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,199
they blew up and killed his people

330
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,799
and uh the country was divided almost

331
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,839
equally three ways

332
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:37,439
they had the uh the military

333
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,120
they were just as much into it as

334
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,279
anybody and then you had the

335
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,639
farc guerrillas they had about a third

336
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,240
of the country

337
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,078
and then you had the contras it was like

338
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,759
the white farmers

339
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,359
and uh they're the ones that i was

340
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,720
dealing with and they were at war with

341
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,120
one another

342
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,680
and so if one of them started killing

343
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,600
their people i'll kill some of yours too

344
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,838
so that that's how it happened and then

345
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,278
when i heard about pablo escobar

346
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,360
blowing up that airliner and killing

347
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,879
those women and children i was sorry i

348
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,519
ever shook his hand

349
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,879
that's that's brutal murder so you would

350
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,440
say

351
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,200
escobar is not a good man not at all

352
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,440
he's terrible

353
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,720
now looking back on it when i met him he

354
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,399
was good

355
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,440
did just exactly what he said he would

356
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,639
do could he be a bad man and a man you

357
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,480
can trust

358
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,879
are those absolutely you could trust him

359
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,879
yes

360
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,360
so from your perspective in terms of

361
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,399
business

362
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,440
he was reliable he was honest had

363
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,159
integrity

364
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,600
you could work with him oh he felt safe

365
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,439
completely

366
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,278
we flew up and uh to his ranch and even

367
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,720
we brought out motorcycles to start with

368
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,078
and can you ride a motorcycle of course

369
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,160
i can ride a motorcycle

370
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,679
so i took off across the grass and there

371
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,120
was a little ditch there

372
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,359
and the front wheel dropped in that

373
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,399
thing and i must have slid across that

374
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
grass 20 feet

375
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,519
before i got stopped he almost fell off

376
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,800
for his

377
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,560
bike waiting because they knew what it

378
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,359
was going to do and then we got on

379
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,278
horses

380
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,560
and went out there and pretended to

381
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,720
round up some cows

382
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,679
and he put a mac 10 machine gun pistol

383
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,200
over my shoulder

384
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,958
you know how to use this well i never

385
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,360
had but it was all right

386
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,759
i think it was like okay you got 10

387
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,278
bodyguards what do you need me for

388
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,439
so that's the kind of time we laughed

389
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,799
and talked and drove some cows over the

390
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,760
stumps

391
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,799
you said jorge ochoa was perhaps the

392
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,159
brains

393
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:33,439
of the medellin cartel

394
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,958
what was he like and why do you say he

395
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,800
was the brains

396
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:40,719
well he was a gentleman and i suppose he

397
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,198
shipped and don't tell me how many more

398
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,800
times of cocaine than pablo did

399
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,639
just in him and his brothers you could

400
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,519
tell by the they had on each

401
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,120
hl load they was in duffel bags and

402
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,198
there's big football shaped

403
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:59,198
uh fluffy stuff made with ether

404
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:01,919
and they would have three horns on it or

405
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,439
a rattlesnake or four x's on each bag

406
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:06,958
you kind of got to knowing which was

407
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,760
which was which and they shipped a lot

408
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,000
so um and he was just a gentleman i took

409
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,278
the family we went one weekend to his

410
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,639
ranch or his uh malaysia place

411
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,559
out near barangay and oh

412
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,759
we he just treated the family and his

413
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,239
family had

414
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,519
his younger brother wrote we made a bull

415
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,639
fight and

416
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,839
we had uh skiing and

417
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,440
little airplanes on floats on the water

418
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,760
it was really nice and he was really

419
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,760
nice

420
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,240
how do you make sense of the tension

421
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,639
that a man could be a gentleman can have

422
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,159
integrity but also be a murderer

423
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,919
well murder is is a is a stronger word

424
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,958
than killing

425
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,799
can you explain the the the line the

426
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,638
gray area we're talking about

427
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,879
i mean i've just talking with jocko

428
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,000
willing and we talked a lot about

429
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:05,360
killing in the context of uh

430
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,919
military conflict and context of war

431
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,839
so there there's a line between murder

432
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,838
and killing that you can draw

433
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,040
what's the line that you're referring to

434
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,120
it's something similar

435
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,399
if you if people shooting at you and you

436
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,039
shoot back and kill him i don't that's

437
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,120
not murder whatsoever it's uh

438
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,159
he's trying to get away or out of the

439
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,679
situation

440
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,039
but if some woman don't pay you and you

441
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,879
send a hit man over

442
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,639
to to kill her and her children that's

443
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,320
that's that's murder that's murder

444
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,720
was jorge involved in those kinds of

445
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,000
things i don't think so at all it just

446
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,480
i mean he was he was just such a

447
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,480
gentleman he had a restaurant before and

448
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,519
and he was just smart i understand that

449
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,600
uh the first

450
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,198
10 kilos he sold he was sitting on them

451
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,959
on a motorcycle in the

452
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,359
in the sidelines in a parking lot when

453
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,278
the dea come in he sped away

454
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
so he didn't come back to america he was

455
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,198
just smart some people just have

456
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,958
are savvy and he was such a gentleman

457
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:57,519
and the whole family the mother and the

458
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,758
father

459
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,278
the two brothers their sister it was i

460
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,039
was there when she was kidnapped

461
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:08,320
and uh finally he kidnapped our

462
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,879
i guess 100 liters of the farc

463
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,000
and uh said all right and she don't come

464
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,198
back none of these are going to come

465
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,839
back

466
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,599
so they made a deal is there something

467
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,720
you can say about the power structure

468
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,839
the hierarchy of the

469
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,720
median cartel that you interacted with

470
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,040
was uh

471
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,839
was it a dictatorship where pablo ran

472
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,639
everything

473
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,759
was there a bunch of power centers was

474
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,799
it like a company

475
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,320
would you have ceo cto kind of thing and

476
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,039
then there's like managers and all those

477
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,240
kinds of things

478
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,240
what's the like how did it run from a

479
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,079
leadership perspective

480
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,360
i understand that about five of them got

481
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:44,879
together

482
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,879
and made this i would call it an

483
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,320
insurance company

484
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:52,000
and uh now known as the medellin cartel

485
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,040
and i didn't see any difference each one

486
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,639
of them had their own business

487
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,319
and their people from the jungle or

488
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,720
wherever made the cocaine gave it to

489
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,278
them

490
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,880
and they shipped it and uh so didn't it

491
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,759
didn't seem to be any

492
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,160
any power play between them at all but

493
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,199
my main contact was jorge ochoa

494
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,160
and pablo escort bar was right there and

495
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,798
i saw plenty of stuff for him too it's

496
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,279
strange

497
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,558
that they didn't betray each other

498
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,918
regularly

499
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,038
you know uh greed makes men betray each

500
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,759
other

501
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:29,200
how do you explain that how much

502
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,640
betrayal did you see

503
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,960
i didn't see any absolutely none

504
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,160
if if they shipped his 100 kilos he got

505
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,720
paid for it

506
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,840
if the other one uh shipped his i'm sure

507
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,480
they got paid for it

508
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,359
how do you explain that well there was

509
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
no need to

510
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:47,759
the money was just unbelievable you

511
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,200
think about 500 kilos in the plane

512
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:53,440
at fifty thousand dollars a kilo at the

513
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
time

514
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,279
and they paid five thousand dollars to

515
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,840
ship it

516
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,038
and they made five thousand without even

517
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,918
touching it they just had

518
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,519
somebody to load it onto the airplane i

519
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,038
gave it to their man in miami

520
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,639
they gave it to whoever it belonged to

521
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:11,200
by the uh

522
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,000
by the marks on the duffel bags so they

523
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,840
was making just

524
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,359
untold millions just uh

525
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:22,399
no reason but greed can blind men i

526
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:25,038
you know it's still

527
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,559
it's still strange to me that there was

528
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,720
not more betrayal

529
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:31,759
it speaks to something else perhaps

530
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,038
that's bigger than money

531
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:37,519
maybe maybe not but it seems like just

532
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,720
like in the casino like you mentioned

533
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:42,240
uh we um get accustomed to the

534
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,558
whatever level of money we have we get

535
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,720
accustomed very quickly yes

536
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:49,119
and then there's a tension that's

537
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,919
natural between human beings

538
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,558
and when that tension combined with

539
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,520
money

540
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,000
combined with power combined with like

541
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,599
you mentioned

542
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,960
beautiful women and a bit of violence

543
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:04,480
it seems that um betrayal should be

544
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,960
commonplace

545
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,079
but it's not it was not at all like

546
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,759
carlos later

547
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,199
i don't know he betrayed anybody but he

548
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,200
started that he was

549
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,240
running cocaine through the bahamas and

550
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
he had the island

551
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,480
i didn't go i was offered to fly with a

552
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,400
dc3 with that but i didn't like it

553
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,919
so i had my route through the old wheels

554
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,480
in louisiana

555
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,280
and uh so i you weren't going to change

556
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,720
but uh he

557
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,440
he talked a lot and i don't know he

558
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,079
betrayed but they didn't like him

559
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,038
yeah so as you expand there could be

560
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,720
tensions that

561
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:40,319
yeah that lead to conflict colombia was

562
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,440
like you said an ultra violent place

563
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,480
how did you survive who protected you i

564
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,160

about 400 pounds in the plane

637
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,159
and uh came on back and i was uh running

638
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,558
the headwinds more than i thought

639
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,320
and i landed on a little strip you're

640
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,839
talking about on the way back

641
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,759
on the way back on the way north after

642
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,480
we loaded up early in the morning

643
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,400
and uh for only time i ever got vertigo

644
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,200
the mountains were coming down at a

645
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,880
30 or 40 degree angle and uh milky was

646
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,080
where he was overhead and somehow i

647
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,880
wanted that airplane to be

648
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,199
level with the stars and it got it got

649
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,960
me

650
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,720
it's just a phenomenal pile of house

651
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,600
vertigo the only time i ever had it was

652
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,440
on that load

653
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,879
so anyway the wind was on the nose of

654
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,279
that cessna i wasn't going to make it to

655
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,799
the dry lake where i had fuel

656
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,798
so i landed on a little bitty strip

657
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:48,158
there was a little house that was caved

658
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,158
in and there was a little boy

659
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,559
named lazarus about six or seven years

660
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,240
old and he was heard and some goats

661
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:55,918
so we put the marijuana in that house

662
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,200
and the man stayed with it so while i

663
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,200
flew into some town

664
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,798
and got fueled and came back we sat down

665
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
with the lunch that i brought back and

666
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,000
little lads were sat there and ate with

667
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,798
us and we had a good time we loaded them

668
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,798
back and came over

669
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,519

696
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,719
that's what i did and when i was coming

697
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,639
back for

698
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,960
several years i would fly uh fly up at

699
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,759
mexicali and cross the border right at

700
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,440
calexico

701
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,759
just i would act like i was landing on

702
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,679
the clexico side just after dark

703
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,359
and then i'd zip across the border and i

704
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,038
go over to the salton sea and

705
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,719
go below sea level 100 and something

706
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,558
feet i believe 170 feet

707
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,079
and come on up and go out there and

708
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,960
above palm springs and

709
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,278
land out 29 palms in the desert and put

710
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,440
my

711
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,038
stuff under joshua tree and fly into

712
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,759
town and get my pickup and go on back

713
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,319
out and get it

714
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,519
and that was fun and then it got really

715
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,599
dangerous they had a

716
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,879
operation starlight i believe was the

717
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,278
name of it and they caught a lot of

718
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,120
pilots coming across the border

719
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:42,798
so i changed it and by that time i was

720
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,639
flying bigger planes i was flying beach

721
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,119

00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,519
halfway down on the

made cheese

729
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,840
and i would go there and unload the load

730
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,798
coming up out of anywhere in southern

731
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,319

up my

738
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,159

740
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,320
and then go back afternoon and fill up

741
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,639
and then i would go northwest

742
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,798
out of there and fly 200 miles off the

743
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,480
coast of the island of guadalupe

santa barbara islands down low and then

749
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,599
i'd come up

750
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,320
and go out in the desert and land and i

751
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,839
did that

752
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,839
for the rest of the marijuana trips

753
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,880
what was the hardest part about flying

754
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,079
those routes

755
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,640
the hardest part was getting good

756
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:52,639
marijuana

757
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,880
so the hardest part isn't the flying

758
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,640
flying just like driving your car down

759
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,240
but then i had people that would bring

760
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,120
me on strips that were just

761
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,640
unworthy of an airplane right when i'd

762
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,678
land on a highway

763
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,159
and uh and this and in the rainy season

764
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,600
i'd come back to land again and the guy

765
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,600
wouldn't think about it have like little

766
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,839
hills on both sides and

767
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,278
the wings right there well the grass and

768
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,879
the weeds would grow up and it sounded

769
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,000
like

770
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,840
i mean it sounded like tearing the

771
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,278
airplane apart when those wings hit

772
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,678
mowing the grass down both

773
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,278
both shoulders of the airplane the weeds

774
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,679
grew up high in the tropics

775
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:31,440
so some of that stuff was bad and oh

776
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,360
getting bad gasoline and

777
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,558
telling me that land here and the light

778
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,959
and and

779
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,000
knock the wheels off when you land oh

780
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,278
you should have landed a little

781
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,440
further up here saying you know they

782
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,200
ditched down yeah you know

783
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,640
that sort of thing what was it like

784
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,240
landing on a highway and

785
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,159
and when did you have to land on the

786
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,000
highway i landed a highway most of my

787
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,400
life most of the times

788
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,400
in mexico first time i went down there

789
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,519
was a place called picchulingi

790
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,919
and they had a 900-foot strip and

791
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,759
i would fly down and i'd carry gasoline

792
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,759
wing with me and

793
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,200
mari and i would go to the grocery store

794
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,240
and buy all kind of little goodies and

795
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,840
candies and toys

796
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,558
to bring to the children and uh

797
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,839
that sand strip in the in the bend of a

798
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:15,359
river

799
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,879
was just too short to take off with a

800
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,798
load so there was a young man there

801
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
named pedro must not weighed much over

802
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,798
100 maybe 120

803
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,440
pounds and he'd get in a plane with me

804
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,639
and

805
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,840
he'd direct me 20 30 40 miles away to a

806
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,480
highway

807
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,879
and the people walking and the people

808
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,399
would

809
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,640
pull out in a two-ton truck with a

810
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:36,158
machine gun on it and a bunch of

811
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,520
guys with their arms were just and

812
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,278
they'd block the road and then another

813
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,200
one block it up about a mile away

814
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:42,720
not land right over that truck and

815
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,399
they'd load me up it looked like a

816
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,079
bucket brigade when the marijuana coming

817
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,079
i'd shake hands with all of them and i'd

818
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,639
take off right over the other trucks

819
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,119
and sometimes maybe 20 30 40 cars lined

820
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,278
up i

821
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,278
one time i remember a patrol car a

822
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,119
highway patrol car

823
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,960
he didn't have his lights on to go right

824
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,038
over him and then

825
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,159
when i started flying to louisiana the

826
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:03,839
bridge over the mississippi

827
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,679
river there were several contractors

828
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,278
that went broke and that thing was out

829
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,120
for years

830
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,480
and about five miles from the river was

831
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,000
flashing red lights

832
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,200
and a detour and then the swamp on both

833
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,079
sides of it in the middle of it we've

834
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,440
grown up with 20

835
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,278
feet trees and that was like

836
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,480
an international runway from anywhere in

837
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,240
the world

838
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,599
so i landed on that and over and over

839
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
those red lights just like the end of a

840
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:28,158
runway

841
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,919
and then the next morning we'd go out

842
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,600
and scrub the marks off the highway

843
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:36,000
where i'd landed

844
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:38,558
before daylight wow let's go to

honduras and we went up uh lake azul

853
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,359

00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,919
halfway place oh it was lovely we stayed

857
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:06,239
up there for some days and our clothes

858
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,919

859
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,759
muddy and we went in the river and all

860
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,799
kind of thing so we got to san pedro

861
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:14,158
sula

00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:16,960
and uh was going back to new orleans so

863
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,399
uh went to to the cleaners to get our

864
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,519
clothes and most all of them was in

865
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,439

00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,119
and they got old senor they'll be ready

867
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,480
tomorrow morning we're not ready now

00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:28,079
well the plane leaves it

869
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,240
nine o'clock or whatever so

870
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,759
i told murray to for her and the

871
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,159
children to go into the airport because

872
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,119
it'd be

873
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,840
easier for one just on a standby flight

874
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,678
so i went to the

875
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,599
laundromat for the clothes and they were

876
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,278
ready and they was a pile up and i put

877
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,719
them on my back and got into taxi and

878
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:45,919
the old taxi would drive him with it and

879
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,679
i'd give him a hundred dollars to go

880
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,320
faster and he just blew his horn

881
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,320
more rapid

882
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,199
finally we got to the airport and i

883
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,440
jumped out and ran around on the tarmac

884
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,519
and

885
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:03,200
here's a brand new 727 taxiing out

886
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,599
oh no so i'm waving to the pilot and

887
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,360
this young fella he waves back

888
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,359
then i see mari's face in the cockpit

889
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,959
and the nose goes down where he puts on

890
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,398
brakes and he laughs and he puts some

891
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,079
stairwell out

892
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:15,839
and i run for the stairwell and he pulls

893
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,879
it back up and goes like a hitchhiker

894
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,240
gonna pick you up and go

895
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,480
go again then he put it out and i got on

896
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,558
an

897
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,599
old crowd clapped and i'm coming home

898
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,599
with that load of clothes

899
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,360
so i go way down in the middle and the

900
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,278
plane's full

901
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,639
and miriam my daughter's about nine

902
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:34,079
years old then

903
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,080
and she was sitting in the middle and by

904
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,639
the window was seal of course i didn't

905
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,599
know it

906
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,399
and i sat in the middle and uh we took

907
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:42,319
off and

908
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:44,239
the wheels come up with clunk and then i

909
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,200
got up about 5000 feet we had a little

910
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,798
click link

911
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,038
and she said what was that daddy i said

912
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,720
he just turned on his autopilot

913
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,679
that fellow reached over and i looked at

914
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,319
him i said he looks like c.i.a or fbi

915
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,440
something he ain't supposed to be here

916
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,558
clear blue eyes

917
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,080
gentlemen looking man and he

918
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,079

919
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,038

922
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,240
over miriam

923
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,440
shook hands and we got to talking and

924
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,038
i thought no choice of seats on this

925
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,399
it's just open seating so

926
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,919
but i don't believe him one bit

927
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,678
and he started talking about he just got

928
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,120
out of jail that morning just got out of

929
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,080
prison

930
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,079
and i said uh-huh

931
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:31,119
and he told me he'd been a pilot with a

932
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:34,000
twa in this another

933
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,798

988
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,240

00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,839
let's go barry let's see what you can do

990
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,558
so i'm sorry i said that

991
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,079
we got about 9 000 feet and he was like

992
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,319
one of them blue angel pilots

993
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,319
he wrung that thing out yeah you know

994
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,480
that's enough and then um

995
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,759
he did the falling leaf that's where you

996
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,240
cut the engines and the plane

997
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,599
falls from side to side i saw bob hoover

998
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,120
do that in the air show once

999
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,959
and that's the only person i ever saw do

1000
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:48,639
it and i was

1001
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,480
my hand was white knuckle hanging onto

1002
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,320
the seat you shut off the engine

1003
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,480
yeah he shut off the engines and landing

1004
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:57,359
flying side by side like this

1005
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,240
how do you explain that was he just uh a

1006
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,240
wild man

1007
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,919
or was he sufficiently skilled to wear

1008
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,038
sufficiently skilled

1009
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,559
absolutely he knew what he was doing i

1010
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,000
can get a plane from one spot to another

1011
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:08,960
and i guess i'm known as a good pilot

1012
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,710
but that guy

1013
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,960
it was aerobatic

1014
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,800
[Laughter]

1015
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,320
so anyway he stayed with us a couple of

1016
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,760
days and then i told him i said this

1017
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,519
plane needs uh

1018
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,960

1019
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,838
done in colombia needs to come back to

1020
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,320

1021
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,078
and i need 2 500 mile range he said i

1022
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,359

and keep the mouse shut

1024
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:32,480
so i gave him 10 000 and he flew away

1025
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,000

00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,719
the instruments and all them converted

1083
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,640

running behind the lines and that's

1089
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,960
where barry had flown those things so he

1090
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,880

barry's assassination

1170
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,799

1171
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,639
did you sense

1172
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,079
what did you think okay when i got out

1173
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,400
of prison i hadn't been out long

1174
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,240
i was uh watching eating breakfast and

1175
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,800
there was ronald reagan's

1176
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,319
face right in the television we have

1177
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,320
absolute proof

1178
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,559
that the communist sandinista government

1179
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,000
is in the cocaine run in business

1180
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,480
and there was that fat lady the c2

1181
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,119
c-2126

1182
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,838
on the runway would build it in and i

1183
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,519
thought oh

1184
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:38,480
god he had done it so i had heard

1185
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,000
that barry might been working with him

1186
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,960
so what mom working with

1187
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,599
with the dea whoever yeah he did he is

1188
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,079
he was no longer on our side you know

1189
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,720
so uh can you clarify how you got that

1190
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,599
from the

1191
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,838
reagan making a statement about we've

1192
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,320
heard okay there was his plane

1193
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:58,159
there was a bearish plane and okay on

1194
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,160
the way north we could stop in in

1195
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,480
nicaragua and land on a military base or

1196
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:03,440
on a a basis they used those crop

1197
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,079
dusters and all

1198
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,800
and refuel yeah and so that shortened

1199
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,318
our trip would go

1200
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,400
further into the jungle and come up and

1201
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,440
that was what pablo escobar and ocho and

1202
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,480
him and they had

1203
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,400
there was associates with the people in

1204
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,880
nicaragua so barry was if that plane

1205
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,639
was there that means barry was feeding

1206
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,400
the dea information

1207
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:26,078
he was working with him at that time but

1208
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,240
let me back up a little bit when

1209
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,000
when i was flying and i told barry we

1210
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,959
would we would refuel

1211
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,960
and trains airplane the loads in police

1212
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,920
where i had a spot up there

1213
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,119
and then that's when the they told me we

1214
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,318
can refuel in

1215
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,318
in uh nicaragua and then you fly all the

1216
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,079
way and barry couldn't believe it

1217
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:47,759
he says all right but i wanted to land i

1218
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,000
had a place in louisiana

1219
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,800
for ten thousand dollars that i could

1220
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,519
unload and

1221
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,240
sheriff and oldham was paid off and uh

1222
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,759
he said no

1223
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,399
no no i can't get caught in me in

1224
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,920
arkansas

1225
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,519
i said what do you mean you can't get

1226
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,960
caught in maniac so you get caught

1227
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,280
anywhere

1228
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,639
he said i can't if it can't but it's

1229
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,680
going to cost you fifty thousand dollars

1230
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:12,000
every time my wheels touch the ground

1231
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,039
why can you explain why he can't get he

1232
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,880
said he was

1233
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,559
he was hooked up with the with him the

1234
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,318
very top and he even said

1235
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,599
i'm gonna have dinner with the governor

1236
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:21,920
tonight

1237
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,359
that's at that time i mean the arkansas

1238
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,920
mr bill clinton

1239
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,679
undoubtedly and it's a little like did

1240
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,680
bill clinton did you give him any money

1241
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:30,239
and i said no i never give the man any

1242
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,519
money

1243
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,118
but it was like the money that i had

1244
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,759
went to grand cayman islands and i told

1245
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,280
my lawyer i never touched that money

1246
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,880
he said you don't have to fondle it to

1247
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,680
be guilty

1248
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,280
so so what i mean there's a lot of

1249
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:45,519
conspiracy theories

1250
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,400
around the relationship between pericle

1251
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,639
and the clintons

1252
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,400
absolutely what evidence do we have

1253
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,199
what would you say from your best

1254
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,200
understanding

1255
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,440
of what was the relationship between

1256
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,000
bill clinton and barry seal

1257
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,400
barry said and he knew that he couldn't

1258
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,679
get caught in me in arkansas

1259
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,920
and when that movie was going to come

1260
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:10,480
out be called mina

1261
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,838
somebody stopped it i mean they stopped

1262
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,920
it dead in the tracks for two or three

1263
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,519
years and the producer even quit

1264
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,119
you mean the american meds with tom

1265
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:18,960
cruise movie it wasn't it was going to

1266
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,599
be called meena it's the name that was

1267
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,000
written and produced in mina

1268
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,039
and wait waiting on hillary to be

1269
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,760
elected

1270
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,199
they they would not let that movie out

1271
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,359
and that movie was changed

1272
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,559
drastically but to push back on that

1273
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,400
that doesn't mean there's

1274
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:35,759
truth there that means they were worried

1275
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,480
about

1276
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,359
the power of the conspiracy theory which

1277
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,719
stuck

1278
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:44,960
exactly i don't know i mean you know

1279
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,239
some conspiracy theories just because

1280
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,199
they're popular doesn't mean they're

1281
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,838
true

1282
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,118
and ones that uh but it also doesn't

1283
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:52,480
mean they're not true

1284
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,200
and there's ones that are not very

1285
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,400
popular that could be true but that one

1286
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,919
that one really stuck did you do i mean

1287
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,200
what's your sense

1288
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,639
well i paid one and a half million

1289
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:03,679
dollars for barry to land at meena

1290
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,078
arkansas

1291
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,639
so i was pretty well assured that he

1292
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,160
couldn't get caught

1293
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:11,519
and i said well i can't get caught in

1294
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:12,078
colombia we can't get caught in

1295
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,039
nicaragua

1296
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,880
i guess we got a license it's that we

1297
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:17,920
went for it so when you say i can't get

1298
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,160
caught just to clarify

1299
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,838
there's a there's a sense where this is

1300
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,318
a safe place to land

1301
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,239
yes like completely safe so you don't

1302
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,440
think he was referring to some kind of

1303
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:32,078
um you know

1304
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,480
like my grandfather who fought in world

1305
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,280
war

1306
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,000
ii would talk about bullets can't hit

1307
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,119
him

1308
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,559
so it's almost like believing back

1309
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,318
he's taking that fifty thousand dollars

1310
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,078
and giving it to somebody to somebody

1311
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:45,838
and barry was honest so he wasn't just

1312
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,119
taking it from me because he was making

1313
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:48,960
a million dollars he didn't care for the

1314
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,119
fifty thousand

1315
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,480
ah man taking the story forward

1316
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,880
uh the months leading up to his

1317
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,358
assassination what what uh

1318
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,039
what do you understand why he was

1319
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:04,400
assassinated

1320
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,400
who were the players involved

1321
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,160
maybe could you have stopped

1322
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,119
well i'll tell you after i saw reagan's

1323
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:12,719

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,880
television saying we have the absolute

1325
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,559
proof the phone rang

1326
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,480
and it would bury i hadn't heard from

1327
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:21,679

1328
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:25,039

he was leaned up he'd gain weight and i

1341
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:50,078

1344
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:57,279
he said every one of them

1345
00:44:52,889 --> 00:45:00,480
[Laughter]

1346
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,000

1350
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,960
and he sat there and he just went to

1351
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,200
talking and he told me about

1352
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,119
he was left holding the bag and that um

1353
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:18,399
what do you mean by that like that

1354
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:21,119
nobody's supported him or another

1355
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,160
he was uh and and i don't know this i

1356
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,559
mean this is just what

1357
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,440
what happened uh putting it all together

1358
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,440
that he had some cia buddies

1359
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,000
that was pretending we're going to

1360
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,400
supply all of our northwood arms

1361
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,559
and with that you can land cocaine back

1362
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,318
here by the ton

1363
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,239
so he's taking his little planes and

1364
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,719
putting some ak-47s and

1365
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,838
maybe ammunition or whatever and takes

1366
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:47,279
it down to

1367
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:49,199
the contras against the communist

1368
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,760
party of nicaragua where we've been

1369
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,159
landing and oliver north was involved in

1370
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,760
this

1371
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:58,239
so uh when the when all that and so his

1372
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,960
cia buddies was certainly

1373
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:02,159
involved and we know they were and barry

1374
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,880
had been in the cia

1375
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,199
earlier when he first got out of school

1376
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,960
so

1377
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:11,279
uh when when uh

1378
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,159
as i say the [ __ ] hit the fan they all

1379
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,240
fled

1380
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:15,279
and left barry hold in the back the cia

1381
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,318
and the dea

1382
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,079
yeah no not the dea the cia the dea

1383
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:22,318
wasn't in on it cia was

1384
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,359
was selling that cocaine bringing it in

1385
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,838
and uh

1386
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:28,318
just to clarify it uh what's iran contra

1387
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:30,559
scandal

1388
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,679
what was the alleged involvement of the

1389
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:35,759
cia

1390
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:38,960
in uh in using drug trade to fund

1391
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,800
things what do you know what do you

1392
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,599
think is true

1393
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,560
what should we know well i know what i

1394
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,960
know is true

1395
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:47,838
that barry was taking a small amount of

1396
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,838
arms

1397
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:52,000
back to central america and giving them

1398
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:55,440
to whoever oliver north

1399
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,480
group group were who oliver north was a

1400
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,679
colonel that got

1401
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,358
implemented and almost brought the

1402
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,759
government down and so they said all

1403
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,920
right

1404
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,920
we're getting the guns from iran and

1405
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,358
we're taking cocaine to pay for them

1406
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,280
yeah and since congress won't give us

1407
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:10,799
money to fight this war we're gonna

1408
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:13,519
we're gonna circumvent it so that was

1409
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,200
that was a whole thing so it was uh

1410
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,599
cia's effort

1411
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,239
to circumvent the funding mechanisms of

1412
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,838
government

1413
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:24,879
by you selling drugs yes but it was a

1414
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,400
handful of renegade cia agents it was

1415
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,920
barry's friends

1416
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,680
that was making a load load of money

1417
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,200
tons of it come up if you would like to

1418
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,519
read the book the

1419
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:37,358
the big white lie the cia and the crack

1420
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,800
cocaine epidemic

1421
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:44,480
the cia put according to this uh

1422
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,960
the book in michael levine i i didn't

1423
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,838
remember his name last time i talked

1424
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,318
uh wrote that book and he was a head ci

1425
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:53,759
agent

1426
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:55,759
he was a dea agent that exposed this

1427
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,280
and the cia tried to kill him and he

1428
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,160
says they put crack cocaine they

1429
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,559
developed their

1430
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,078
their chemists developed crack and they

1431
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,079
put it in every country every city in

1432
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,480
the united states on one weekend

1433
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,519
so they were bringing it up by the tons

1434
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,079
and that's for sure

1435
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,280
and barry was bringing it can i ask you

1436
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,318
a small tangent

1437
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,200
question do you think

1438
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:18,480
the public should trust the cia and the

1439
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:20,639
dea

1440
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,599
do you think they're mostly good people

1441
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,078
that are

1442
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,920
carrying out a good mission yeah because

1443
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,240
this kind of makes it sound like there's

1444
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,639
renegade agents that are just

1445
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,279
doing whatever the hell they want and

1446
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,078
with uh

1447
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,200
sometimes no regard for human life well

1448
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,960
that's certainly true

1449
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,558
but that's not everybody in there that's

1450
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,559
just sometimes you get a few

1451
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,680
policemen in the department that do

1452
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,040
these things i

1453
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:44,879
i don't believe i believe that our

1454
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,480
government is is good

1455
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,760
i think we've got some fools running it

1456
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,440
yeah i don't know how we get them there

1457
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,160
but

1458
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,400
i don't think i know okay so what was

1459
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,558
barry's involvement here

1460
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,000
so barry very lean back in that chair

1461
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:01,040
and he told me

1462
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
that you know he'd uh he got caught with

1463
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,558
one and a half tons

1464
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,920
and he built it in the runway in

1465
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,280
nicaragua

1466
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,000
and uh had cameras

1467
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,200
flashing inside and out and he flew it

1468
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,639
back to homestead with

1469
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:17,199
with an agent there and he brought the

1470
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:19,598
agent over um

1471
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:20,799
jake jacobson really nice fella i think

1472
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,000
he was a crop duster

1473
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,640
and we'd have got along we'd have been

1474
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,159
on the right side and uh so we uh

1475
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:27,920
we sat there and drank chevis regal

1476
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,000
until i got pie-eyed

1477
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,760
and barry told me about it he said that

1478
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,760
he went to see edwin me see flew

1479
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,880
he got out on bail and he flew his

1480
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,720

00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:32,480
cartels or the cia

1508
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:34,480

1509
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,240
and he and he he told me the story

1510
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,679
and the tears came down between his

1511
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:38,558
fingers and he put his hands over his

1512
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,558

and he testified before congress for all

1519
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,000
these things that he'd done

1520
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,040

1533
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,639
that a difficult conversation

1534
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,719
oh looking into my my guts was just like

1535
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:24,159

my friends i just can't do it how am i

1537
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:27,279
going to do it i just

1538
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:28,960

1540
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,280
against them

1541
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,920
i can't spend the rest of my life in a

1545
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,719

1548
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:51,679
mess that he told

1549
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,200
because if the cia and whoever else

1550
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,399
would find him betrayed him

1551
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,399

00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,920
and it was raining and it was a muddy

1662
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,240
strip clay

1663
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,599
and they put the 300 kilos of cocaine

1664
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:32,078
and then the ugliest man you could

1665
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,640
imagine

1666
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,280
named ronaldo got in there with a mac 10

1667
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:36,558
and uh

1668
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,400
he would make sure i took it to

1669
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,280
louisiana

1670
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,920
so this is many years before yeah a

1671
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,440
couple years before so anyway he uh

1672
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,599
uh we took off and the mud

1673
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,519
got up in the wheel well so so thick

1674
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,359
until the wheels wouldn't come up

1675
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:54,880
well i'm going 200 miles an hour instead

1676
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:55,598
of 300 miles wide with wheels coming

1677
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,559
down

1678
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,079
well i can't go back there if i do i'm

1679
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,559
gonna be in the same situation until the

1680
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:05,280
sun dries it out in a few days

1681
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,880
and so but in belize i had a runway that

1682
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,559
we've been used for ten thousand dollars

1683
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,798
used to refuel

1684
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,760
so i told the guy listen we got to land

1685
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:13,920
in police

1686
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,119
to refuel and no no no he put them act

1687
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,880
in and

1688
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,160
i'll shoot you go ahead fool you're

1689
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,880
going to die too so

1690
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,000
yeah who's in the turf so he wasn't just

1691
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,760
ugly he was also

1692
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:29,358
he was a bad bad killer yeah so uh

1693
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,599
he's the one to actually kill barry

1694
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:33,279
the one that went up on the first load

1695
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,079
with me

1696
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,200
and uh ronaldo and he's in doing well

1697
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,920
he's just a killer

1698
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,439
yeah he's doing life in louisiana i

1699
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,480
wonder who uh

1700
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,599
is is it known who made that decision uh

1701
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,719
the younger

1702
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,640
ochoa brother i understand fabio which

1703
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:51,759
one paid for the hit

1704
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:53,838
i don't know that but that's what i've

1705
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:57,280
heard which probably sounds about right

1706
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:58,880
he's he's down in jessup georgia doing

1707
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,720
a long long time i think he's about to

1708
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,119
get out he's been in 30 years or

1709
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:03,118
whatever

1710
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:06,480
the movie american made

1711
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:11,039
what do you think that movie got right

1712
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,160
what did he get wrong

1713
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,159
almost everything wrong

1714
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:22,399
it was disgustingly wrong

1715
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:24,159
okay um which parts can you can you um

1716
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,318
he may be a librarian it's about barry

1717
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:27,039
seal and it just didn't even it was

1718
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,039
nothing and

1719
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,880
whoever wrote it had no idea who barry

1720
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:31,599
seale was they sat in a rocking chair

1721
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,358
and just tried to

1722
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:38,798
think of what was some baby bashing

1723
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:41,119
drug dealer doing yeah and just like god

1724
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:42,480
just you just don't have any idea of the

1725
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,559
spirit of the man

1726
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,318
so they wanted to try to tell a fun

1727
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,240
story without actually uh

1728
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:49,920
studying the story he they didn't know

1729
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:52,078
we made just that new idea

1730
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,039
and barry was such a nice person such a

1731
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,760
really nice

1732
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:57,838
gentleman person they talk to you or no

1733
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,760
no the people that made them

1734
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,519
and uh i see all these people telling me

1735
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,440
about barbarian never met him

1736
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:05,119
they telling all about it i think that's

1737
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,039
just ridiculous yeah

1738
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,720
and uh that for one thing for his

1739
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:09,920
character coming out of [ __ ] houses and

1740
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:13,118
all that that was just like

1741
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,480
ugly and then down in columbia

1742
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,119
putting the gun to his head going to

1743
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,519
take his sunglasses and then he put 25

1744
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,960
000

1745
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,480
million dollar worth of cocaine on his

1746
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,519
plane and then they're gonna bet a

1747
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,400
hundred dollars he don't have enough

1748
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:24,400
room to take off

1749
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:29,759
that's just insane i mean just just

1750
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,520
the whole thing and then he's talking to

1751
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,079
the de agents when he's coming up

1752
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:35,679
you don't know what a frequency they own

1753
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,079
how he's got five planes and they all

1754
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,159
split

1755
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,599
when the dea comes out these are just

1756
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,000
somebody just

1757
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:44,720
fantasy but those are like those are

1758
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,280
details of the man details of the story

1759
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,639
is there some big profound things they

1760
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,798
missed about

1761
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,400
just this whole period but that's

1762
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:55,838
something that's really important

1763
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:59,119
to you that was missed yes

1764
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:59,920
they just tried to uh sensationalize on

1765
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,760
little things that

1766
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,599
people remember and it's just not true

1767
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,000
it's just it was just like a business

1768
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,880
deal

1769
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,159
and and and good people and good

1770
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,440
airplanes and

1771
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:14,159
good flying and um

1772
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,358
it was like a a good watch that was made

1773
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,759
it just clicked and

1774
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:19,039
it just went on and they missed all that

1775
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,920
they tried to make it sound like it's

1776
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:21,679
something

1777
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,119
very ugly do you think it was a story

1778
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:24,399
that could have been told way better

1779
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,400
and it would still be a hell of a good

1780
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,440
thing

1781
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:32,559
well there's a there's a series

1782
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,240
called chernobyl done by hbo and because

1783
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,240
i have sort of family connected to that

1784
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:38,078
period

1785
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,078
you know they did an incredible job of

1786
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,160
being historically accurate

1787
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,440
and only not being historically accurate

1788
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:45,838
when it helped the story

1789
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,798
only in those rare cases when they on

1790
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:49,838
purpose

1791
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:51,759
left the story to uh to make it easier

1792
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:55,039
for people to understand but it was

1793
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,440
it was still somehow accurate and even

1794
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:57,519
though

1795
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,000
all the actors were british actors

1796
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:03,199
speaking english with the british accent

1797
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
it was still somehow accurate like they

1798
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,399
captured the

1799
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,239
spirit yes so it was historically

1800
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,920
accurate and the spirit was captured

1801
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:12,399
that was one of the most incredible

1802
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,798
like series i've ever seen it convinced

1803
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,519
me that

1804
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:18,639
the movie was made by non-russians it

1805
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:21,759
convinced me that

1806
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:23,358
if you really care about a story you

1807
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,400
don't have to have been brought up in it

1808
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:25,199
you don't even need to speak the

1809
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,599
language

1810
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:29,598
if you're truly a scholar of it if you

1811
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,318
talk to a lot of people if you learn

1812
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,760
if you just pour your heart and soul

1813
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:34,400
into it you can create something really

1814
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,000
special

1815
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,920
and so your sense is you could do that

1816
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,199
with you with uh with the story with

1817
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,400
this period of time

1818
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:44,159
oh yes it was it was a a story that

1819
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,599
needs to be told it need to be told in

1820
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:49,358
the correct way not like

1821
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:52,079
we're trying to bash a certain angle

1822
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:53,759
yeah well if if netflix or hbr are

1823
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,200
watching this you need to tell the story

1824
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,000
of rogers

1825
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,960
in my opinion there you go is this young

1826
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,400
picture you

1827
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,720
yeah there you go that's from national

1828
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,838
geographic jorge

1829
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:09,598
pablo escobar it's you roger and barry

1830
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:12,239
yeah smuggler a memoir

1831
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,960
yeah i really do hope that they make a

1832
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,959
movie of this one

1833
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,400
there's a movie called blow that tells

1834
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,920
the story of george young

1835
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,519
boston george did you know george young

1836
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,440
that's one way to ask it the other is

1837
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,679
what do you think of the movie blow

1838
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,318
i didn't know george young but it was a

1839
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,558
wonderful movie

1840
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:34,400
absolutely it captured it it did yes it

1841
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,319
did that's the way it should be

1842
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,599
so he was a little bit before your time

1843
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:39,599
exactly the same time

1844
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,640
exactly the same same he was using

1845
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,359
stewardesses

1846
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:44,719
to fly the marijuana out of manhattan

1847
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:46,239
beach and i was on the

1848
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:48,798
fire department in redondo beach 10

1849
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:50,239
miles away flying it up

1850
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:52,798
sending it back somebody was sending it

1851
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:54,558
back he might have been sending it back

1852
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:56,559
but he didn't have near the excitement

1853
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,960
that i did he i was shot down

1854
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,000
twice i escaped from five different

1855
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,280
prisons

1856
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,719
i was tortured almost to death in a

1857
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,000
mexican prison so he didn't have all

1858
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:07,439
that fun that i had

1859
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,039
funding quotes yeah so yours is a heck

1860
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,920
of a fun adventure

1861
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:13,839
just to linger on a little bit so uh

1862
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,559
johnny depp plays

1863
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:17,599
george and ray liotta plays his father

1864
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:22,400
and there's this

1865
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:22,400
son father kind of seen at the end

1866
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:29,440
i don't know it's heartbreaking

1867
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,559
like that scene paints a picture of a

1868
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,358
life that

1869
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:38,720
could have been had if none of this

1870
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:41,759
wild drug smuggling happened

1871
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:44,959
i don't usually i mean i don't i

1872
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:47,760
almost i really never get like

1873
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,880
teary-eyed in a movie but that that got

1874
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,839
me

1875
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,039
it's almost like confronting at the end

1876
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:54,798
of your life

1877
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:59,280
what your life could have been with your

1878
01:02:54,798 --> 01:03:03,280
father the way he calls him georgie

1879
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:06,960
it um like you [ __ ] up georgie

1880
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,798

1881
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,960
mario waited for me all those years and

1882
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,559
the children raised them without me

1883
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,639
visiting me in prisons all over the

1884
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,200
world it's unbelievable

1885
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:19,519
just nothing's worth that kind of money

1886
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:19,519
yeah

1887
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:26,000
can you tell the story of when you were

1888
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:26,960
tortured nearly to death in a mexican

1889
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,039
prison

1890
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:32,000
i sure can and i'm smiling but it was

1891
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:35,119
nothing to smile about i can tell you

1892
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,400
i was uh i was in a pool and a gentleman

1893
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,680
came over and shook hands with me and

1894
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,440
put handcuffs on me

1895
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:40,960
and i thought what in the world that was

1896
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,480
at one of the nice hotels

1897
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:46,480
and they put me in a in a jail cell and

1898
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,159
i sat there and all the trunks and the

1899
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,639
thieves and stuff kept coming in and

1900
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:52,798
they had a bucket and they're overrun

1901
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:53,759
and i said man like 18 people in a room

1902
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:57,519
about 12

1903
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,440
12 foot square oh it was hot and i

1904
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:59,759
thought somebody's got to come get me

1905
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,318
this

1906
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,520
this ain't real i hadn't done anything

1907
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:05,519
it's like

1908
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:07,119
it was a pilot coming to see me and up

1909
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:08,480
in her mercea and he stopped

1910
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,838
and he made a mistake and went to the

1911
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,039
international runway instead of where he

1912
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:13,920
was supposed to go

1913
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:16,240
and he had my phony name in his pocket

1914
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,119
so they got me

1915
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:20,798
so they said i was a drug smoker so

1916
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,079
after about three days they put me back

1917
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:24,798
into the into the back

1918
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:26,240
and it was a torture place and they put

1919
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:26,880
me in a little cell like i guess it

1920
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:28,479
wasn't hard

1921
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,039
it wasn't six feet must been about about

1922
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:35,358
five feet square and about 12 feet high

1923
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:38,640
and it was june into june and it was hot

1924
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:40,880
i mean hot and uh

1925
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:41,838
they left me in there for i guess a few

1926
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,720
days you didn't know

1927
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:45,759
they uh so every once while they come

1928
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:47,279
dragged me out

1929
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,680
and first off they put my head

1930
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,480
underwater and it had seltzer in it or

1931
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:52,399
some kind

1932
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,240
and i took one whiff of that and three

1933
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,798
or four of them couldn't hold me down

1934
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:57,838
so then i learned it just before you

1935
01:04:56,798 --> 01:05:01,119
have to breathe tear

1936
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:02,880
loose like that and they'll let you up

1937
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,200
and uh that was the first treatment and

1938
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,440
then then they started beating me and uh

1939
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,960
they beat me blackjack rubber hose until

1940
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,798
i was black and blue and yellow from the

1941
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,079
bottom of my feet to my head

1942
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:13,759
what did they want from me they wanted

1943
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,519
to sign me to sign a confession that i

1944
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,200
was a drug smuggler

1945
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,519
and they put the papers under you under

1946
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:20,879
your nose this is all over fuel sign

1947
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:24,239
well i knew if you signed

1948
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,798
you got six years i wasn't gonna sign

1949
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:28,239
i was one on the side so they didn't

1950
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:29,519
want you to snitch on anybody

1951
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:31,598
they don't want to say they just want me

1952
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:37,838
to sign that paper and you still didn't

1953
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:37,838
about to beat nate that bad

1954
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,240
so anyhow he's coming to the good part

1955
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:43,679
so then

1956
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,439
they come and they take me out and i'm

1957
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:47,279
bug naked and they bend me over and they

1958
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,440
have things to pull you like change

1959
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,559
click click click and they bent me over

1960
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,000
and they

1961
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:56,160
put butter on my bum and they commenced

1962
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,280
to put hot chili pepper up there

1963
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,719
and that stuff was bad i mean it was red

1964
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,680
hot

1965
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:08,239
and that was that was awful

1966
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:09,038
and still it was just awful yeah but

1967
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:11,199
still you didn't

1968
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,160
i didn't think about it i ain't going to

1969
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:13,358
i guess

1970
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:14,879
if i'd known he's going to kill me i

1971
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:17,199
wouldn't have done it but i'm but i

1972
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,039
wonder about

1973
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:21,038
you get hurt bad enough you'll pass out

1974
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,359
so i didn't pass out so i was

1975
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,960
all right so then the last thing they

1976
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:27,199
did was

1977
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,559
they brought a a dead man in there and

1978
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,679
he was wrapped he was frozen and he was

1979
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,440
wrapped in newspaper

1980
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:32,798
little strips about a half inch wide

1981
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,798
just like a mummy

1982
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:37,038
and he was frozen and he hung him on the

1983
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:39,599
wall with a meat hook

1984
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,480
and uh god you next son of a [ __ ] you

yeah and so he's sitting there like this

1987
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,440
and

1988
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,079
as he starts to throw out which is

1989
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:50,240
pretty quick it looks like he's crying

1990
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,359
and it looks like he's peeing and the

1991
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,519
papers start

1992
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:54,719
unraveling on him and the formaldehyde

1993
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:58,239
puddles on the floor

1994
01:06:54,719 --> 01:07:00,318

1997
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,358
uh space it wasn't even a half inch high

1998
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:06,400

01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:07,920
floor of my cheek

2000

and put my lips right up under that door

2001
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,000
and was sucking that fresh air and i

2002
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,318

so i spent the night

2056
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:52,640
in the hammock and walked down to the

2057
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:55,119
airplane

2058
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,039
just as it did in daylight and 10 or 12

2059
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:58,479
men walked with me and pedro got

2060
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:00,319
and i brushed my teeth in the little

2061
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:02,639
stream was about foot deep

2062
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,400
little river coming through there got in

2063
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:07,679
the airplane and uh

2064
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:10,399
i fired her up and bam

2065
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:12,640
i thought a tire blew out i looked over

2066
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,639
see

2067
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,399
it still ain't dawned on me and pedro's

2068
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,239
yelling please see ya please see him

2069
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:21,358
roger please see ya

2070
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:24,000
well it dawned on me and i shoved it the

2071
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,759
throttle to the firewall and uh i only

2072
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,439
had so that was a bullet

2073
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:29,279
yeah somebody they there's off to the

2074
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,079
side say it shot they'd shot just a

2075
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,400
warning like

2076
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:33,198
get out stop we're gonna rob you

2077
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,519
whatever it is

2078
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:36,879
that's what they do it's taken the plane

2079
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,679
to me and put me in prison the whole

2080
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,560
thing so

2081
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,759
but i even though i had papers so uh i

2082
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,279
just shoved it to fireball and there

2083
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,838
wasn't enough room to take off on that

2084
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,319
strip

2085
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,679
and there's half of it was behind me or

2086
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:49,679
some of it was behind me

2087
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,279
and so just at the end i'm just like i

2088
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,239
think that thing stalls at about 50

2089
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:54,239
miles an hour just

2090
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:55,678
just turning 50 and i just pulled it

2091
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:58,399
right up

2092
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,600
and put the flaps on and as i pulled off

2093
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,198
the ground

2094
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,640
they opened up on both sides of me with

2095
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:04,559
machine guns and they

2096
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,480
riddle that airplane i mean the

2097
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,520
windshield came out

2098
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:13,279
i got hit three times uh do you

2099
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,880
like your body yeah and uh uh

2100
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:17,198
i didn't know i was hit i mean it was

2101
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,760
just the adrenaline the gasoline just

2102
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:19,359
pouring in

2103
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,960
the world turned yellow i must have went

2104
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:24,079
into shock so

2105
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,399
it just stopped in slow motion and uh

2106
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:28,880
one bullet hit the strut right by my

2107
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:30,639
head and it just

2108
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,079
parts of that bullet just went all over

2109
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:35,199
me i just looked like i'd been

2110
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:37,359
peppered which would uh lead

2111
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:38,479
and uh the gasoline was just pouring in

2112
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:40,079
and i'm just pouring it where they'd

2113
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:42,079
shot the wing up above

2114
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:43,519
and the windshield's gone i didn't i

2115
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:47,119
mean i i couldn't

2116
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:50,400
him it's just like like a hail storm

2117
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:52,479
so i uh i was airplanes the staller now

2118
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:53,920
it i was in a stall anyway and i didn't

2119
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:55,119
realize it and i guess you wouldn't

2120
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,079
unless you trained for it

2121
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:59,760
but when you install the elevator is

2122
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:01,279
kind of flappy

2123
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,960
and i didn't realize at the time i

2124
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:03,920
thought they had shot the elevator cable

2125
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,760
in too

2126
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,920
so i thought oh god so i just reached

2127
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,560
over and switched it off switched to

2128
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,960
pull the mixture pulled everything and

2129
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,880
uh

2130
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,880
in the river there was rocks about as

2131
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,640
big as this table and they were

2132
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,000
like the turtle back all the way up

2133
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,520
until there was a waterfall there was

2134
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,198
quite a pretty place

2135
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,800
and i crashed straight on to it i

2136
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:24,799
thought if i get those rocks

2137
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,400
and when i did the first time i hit the

2138
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,239
wings came off and then it bounced

2139
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:29,519
and the next time the nose came out and

2140
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:30,639
came under the plane

2141
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,239
and i'm sitting there i must have been

2142
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,560
knocked unconscious called pedro's

2143
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:37,519
shaking me come on roger come on roger

2144
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,120
so i stepped out into the water and here

2145
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,080
comes these four federalists still

2146
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,719
shooting at us

2147
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:43,119
and i'm bullied the two hit the airplane

2148
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,119
and

2149
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:48,399
i kept a nine millimeter browning high

2150
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:51,679
power taped to the top of the radio

2151
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:53,279
in case i ever needed it so because

2152
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:54,800
one of those times didn't want it in the

2153
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:56,000
airplane so i just it was just handy

2154
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,960
just laying there so i took and popped a

2155
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,359
few caps out of them

2156
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:03,359
and they ran into the rocks so uh

2157
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:05,198
we took off up off running and then i

2158
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:06,238
looked and pedro's foot nearly shot off

2159
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:08,000
had shot him on

2160
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,839
one side the ankle and it gets blown out

2161
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,560
the other side and it wasn't even hardly

2162
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,880
bleeding it

2163
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,000
the shock of it so i took my t-shirt off

2164
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,520
and gripped it and

2165
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,679
tied it best i could but yeah it's still

2166
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,080
bullets in you so like you could still

2167
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:22,480
i shot the top of my toenail off yeah i

2168
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:25,600
shot a job across my head in my kneecap

2169
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:27,439
so i was just nicked okay it was very

2170
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,000
painful later on but right that time i

2171
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:30,000
didn't

2172
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,600
it was it was just hot there's a bullet

2173
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,238
stealing my foot from it a piece of a

2174
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,679
bullet

2175
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:36,000
good sized slug so we went on up the

2176
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:38,480
mountain

2177
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,158
through the cactus and it's running just

2178
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,678
going i want to go down no no avail

2179
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:44,079
federalists are going in this

2180
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,600
the easy way let's go this young fellow

2181
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:47,760
and we came to an old donkey

2182
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,719
she must have been 30 years old long and

2183
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,600
way back

2184
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:53,840
long hair on her charlotte charlotte and

2185
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,760
he pitted the donkey and we jumped on

2186
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,199
and we rode for some actual donkey

2187
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,719
donkey they were donkeys all over the

2188
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:59,519
place anyhow he knew that was from the

2189
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:01,679
village

2190
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,199
and so we rode seven miles two of us on

2191
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,000
a donkey with no bridle no saddle

2192
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:07,359
nothing

2193
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,920
and uh we came to a little man plowing a

2194
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:09,759
little

2195
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,600
horse in a little ox there's both of

2196
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,280
them spotted and there's the ox was

2197
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,480
the yolk was across her back this way

2198
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:15,519
and he's plowing with a little plow

2199
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:17,039
amongst stumps

2200
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,400
it was like one of these people clearing

2201
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:20,000
a little piece of land and he had a

2202
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:21,519
little little house there

2203
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,158
and so we went into his house and his

2204
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,719
wife and his daughter they put like uh

2205
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:28,719
cloth over my wounds and on pedro's it

2206
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:30,960
was terrible was terrible

2207
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,719
and they poured diesel oil on it to keep

2208
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,319
the flies off

2209
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:38,560
so i'm covered in diesel so the man left

2210
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:39,439
and he was going all day and then about

2211
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,080
dark he showed up

2212
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:42,879
about 15 or 20 horses and mules showed

2213
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,119
up in the yard

2214
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,039
walking fast and the doctor got out he

2215
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:48,000
said i'm dr benjamin so-so with red

2216
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:49,600
cross

2217
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,520
and he worked on my foot and he worked

2218
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,920
on pedro he gave us a shot of morphine

2219
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,480
and

2220
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,199
tetanus shots and he said you got to get

2221
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:56,799
to hospital

2222
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,198
he said pedro will die if he don't get

2223
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,279
to hospital he said they're looking for

2224
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:02,639
american pilots been shot down they

2225
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:04,079
think he's dead there was a lot of blood

2226
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,520
in that airplane

2227
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:09,279
and so they rode i don't know how far we

2228
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,800
rode but we rode miles and we'd come to

2229
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:12,800
a road and there was a big truck

2230
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,320
and it was loaded with corn in the ear

2231
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,440
and they dug holes in that corn

2232
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:19,439
put us in it and covered us up and the

2233
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:21,599
road was rough and every time we'd hit a

2234
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:24,158
dirt road that corn would cover me up

2235
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,880
and they'd scratch my face out again

2236
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:28,158
and when it came to the highway we went

2237
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,159
into a house and they got me some

2238
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:32,719
clothes and mine was messed up

2239
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:33,439
and uh uh white basin and they must have

2240
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,359
brought 20

2241
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:36,879
jugs of water different times i kept

2242
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:38,960
washing them washing my foot till

2243
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,800
all the blood and the crud got off of me

2244
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,880
and put on those clothes

2245
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,400
and somebody went to uh they said you

2246
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,600
can't go north the roads block they're

2247
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:48,399
looking for the pilot

2248
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,280
so you got to go south so they found a a

2249
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:52,319
taxi in

2250
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:53,920
mazatlan and it was a rather new taxi

2251
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:55,119
and the fellow would would take me to

2252
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,319
guadalajara which was

2253
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:59,760
i don't know seven eight hours south

2254
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:01,599
so we got in that taxi and they propped

2255
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,840
me up with sheets and blankets and

2256
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,520
pillows in the back seat and gave me

2257
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,640
these great big white

2258
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:10,880
pain pills and i was quite content

2259
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,280
then i was shot down and uh shot down in

2260
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,279

2261
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:16,960

2262
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:18,960

2263
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,399
all right i was i went down for load um

2264
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,719
a little marijuana

2265
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:25,679
and we got to the place and we got there

2266
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:27,198
too early and the gorillas

2267
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,960
scream you got to get out of here got to

2268
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:31,039
get out of here and so we went back to

2269
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,319
the place where we staged from

2270
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:38,158
and refueled had a beautiful dc-3

2271
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:41,920

2272
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:41,920
while i was waiting i uh

2273
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:46,158
i ate something for lunch and i went

2274
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,600
around behind the house we refueled the

2275
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:49,519
plane up i had to wait till late now

2276
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,440
they wanted me to come just at dark so

2277
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,840
the military planes couldn't see me on

2278
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:53,839
their strip

2279
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:00,159
so i'm laying in the hammock of sleep

2280
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:01,920
and i hear this terrible roar

2281
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:03,359
and i looked right up through the trees

2282
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,560
and the ascent of two

2283
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:08,399
military jets going straight up

2284
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,600
and they do a dive over and they came

2285
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:10,158
back down the strip in front of that

2286
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,840
airplane

2287
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:14,319
and they just tear it up with 50 caliber

2288
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,719
machine guns they just showing out

2289
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:17,679
yeah so i run for the airplane i just

2290
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:19,600
give that guy 80

2291
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:21,039
000 and he ran for the truck and all the

2292
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,760
rest of them ran for the truck

2293
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:25,198
i should have ran with my money but i

2294
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,440
didn't i ran for the airplane

2295
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:28,479
yeah and uh the co-pilot got in the name

2296
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:30,158
was al

2297
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:31,759
he got in with me and two fellows got in

2298
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:33,519
the back we had drums of fuel in there

2299
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:38,239
to refuel when we got down

2300
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:39,840
to the gorillas so we took off

2301
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:41,599
and i couldn't get the gear up because

2302
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,079
i'd taken off in such a hurry these

2303
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,760
these pins in the struts of a dc3 and

2304
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:47,119
with big flags on them and you have to

2305
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,199
take them up so that

2306
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:50,800
the plant plane won't come up so these

2307
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:51,439
jets swarmed on me and they tried to get

2308
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,199
me to go

2309
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:55,119
they kept telling me which way to go and

2310
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:56,479
the pilot would be just as close as just

2311
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:58,479
right over there i could see him

2312
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:00,158
i just held up the old hippie piece i

2313
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:02,718
didn't think they would shoot

2314
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:04,319
i really didn't it nobody had shot

2315
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:06,960
before

2316
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,479
so i kept flying out and i kept getting

2317
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,920
slower and slower and they kept slowing

2318
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,238
down down down and

2319
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,840
the black smoke rolling and then they

2320
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:15,678
they started shooting up under me

2321
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:17,119
boom boom boom boom with them 20

2322
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,640
millimeter counters and then

2323
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:20,559
and the tracer just going up they look

2324
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,239
like they're curving up from you know

2325
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,679
whoa and i pushed the nose over

2326
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:25,519
so they couldn't get under me and later

2327
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,440
on i heard they thought i tried to ram

2328
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,760
them

2329
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:30,799
so one of them went for fuel and i kept

2330
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,440
on going and

2331
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,320
the one just toward the left wing wing

2332
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:36,079
tip up

2333
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:38,399
with the 50 caliber and then they come

2334
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:40,479
back again and shot the tail up

2335
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:41,519
he's warning me and i tell that feller

2336
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,279
in there says you know

2337
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,360
if you bring me enough water i believe i

2338
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:47,679
can fly this thing my mouth got quite

2339
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:51,599
dry

2340
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:54,079
so i went on and i landed on a big

2341
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,079
pasture

2342
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,159
and it was huge pasture and it was

2343
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,760
rougher than it looked and the wings

2344
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:00,479
just flapped and i come to stop and

2345
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,079
jumped out

2346
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:03,678
and pull those tabs out and threw them

2347
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:06,158
on the ground so i could get my

2348
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:08,480
gear up and i understand that during the

2349
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:11,039
1980 world series baseball game

2350
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:12,799
that it says american dc3 has just been

2351
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:14,079
shot down by american jets about

2352
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,760
columbian jets

2353
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:17,920
you know it's the first plane shot down

2354
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,440
on reagan's new war on drugs but he's up

2355
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,359
he's up and away ladies and gentlemen

2356
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:22,079
we'll keep you posted so i took off

2357
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:24,238
again

2358
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:26,238
and i went into a thunderstorm and they

2359
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:27,279
climbed close to the mountains so i

2360
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:28,959
spiraled up

2361
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:30,880
and every time i'd come out that jet was

2362
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:33,840
there boom boom boom

2363
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,440
and uh i'd go back into that that storm

2364
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,840
and boom boom boom in there

2365
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:39,279
and at 20 000 feet i started icing up so

2366
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,000
i went out one last time and he was

2367
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:42,158
right there waiting

2368
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,158
he had me on radar so i went back in and

2369
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:46,238
i kicked it over and put it into a spin

2370
01:18:44,158 --> 01:18:49,039
and went straight down to 2000 feet

2371
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:50,000
and come out under it and i was flying

2372
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:53,198
along the

2373
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,679
guava river and there was a

2374
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:57,439
20 feet above the water it looked like a

2375
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:00,000
pasture it was just grass

2376
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:01,198
and i made several runs to tear the

2377
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,560
grass down and it looked like

2378
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:05,119
it felt hard no dc3 weighs 30 000 pounds

2379
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,719
and

2380
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:07,920
i put it down on the fifth run and i

2381
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,800
said all right yeah we're going to land

2382
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,960
now

2383
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,719
and that's why he flew like close oh

2384
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,239
several times i put the wheels down oh

2385
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,960
you put the wheels down without landing

2386
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:18,559
miles

2387
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:21,039
and just so i'm making it weird so

2388
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,679
so you okay so you're you're you're

2389
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:24,960
being

2390
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:26,960
tracked by a jet he's trying to sh well

2391
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,560
before that i'm just like retelling the

2392
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,279
story how insane it is

2393
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,920
uh so he is he's trying to shoot you

2394
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:34,399
down

2395
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,880
and there's a thunderstorm that you're

2396
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:39,920
escaping into and then you do

2397
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,440
a spin down to what 2000 feet whatever

2398
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,279
you said

2399
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:45,198
like somehow escaping all of this and

2400
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:48,238
then you try to land on a

2401
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:51,678
pasture on a giant heavy plane

2402
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:55,039
that carries three tons uh

2403
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:58,158
by uh touching down five or six times

2404
01:19:55,039 --> 01:19:58,640
to make a to make a landing strip for

2405
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:00,719
yourself

2406
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:03,199
yeah the the grass is three or four feet

2407
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,239
okay so i it was really good after about

2408
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,759
after a few times

2409
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:07,359
so then just before it stopped i said

2410
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,639
i'll take your feet off the brakes

2411
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:10,319
he said i don't have my feet on the

2412
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:11,679
brakes well i knew i had broken through

2413
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:13,679
the crust

2414
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:15,520
and i put full power on but it didn't

2415
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:17,440
that old big plane just come on down and

2416
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,800
it just did a head

2417
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:22,559
as it came to stop it did a headstand 90

2418
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,880
degrees to the ground oh wow

2419
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,560
and the engines helped held it up and

2420
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,039
the nose and all just crushed in right

2421
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,560
on it

2422
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:30,479
we fell between the two seats to keep

2423
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:31,199
from getting killed and when it come to

2424
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:33,119
a stop

2425
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:34,879

2426
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,599
hot engines and there was an escape

2427
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,600

or miraculous escape in the bunch

2469
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:02,158
the most black miraculous was when i was

2470
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:04,319
in the courtroom in spain i think i was

2471
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:06,719
i was on the third floor of real high

2472
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,000
and i ran across a courtroom handcuffed

2473
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,439
kicked the window out

2474
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,198
and i looked down and it was above the

2475
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:12,719
palm trees i thought there might be a

2476
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:13,678
power line or something i could grab on

2477
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:15,679
as i went down

2478
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:18,639
there was nothing and there was a car

2479
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:21,039
parked a station wagon on the uh

2480
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,560
jumped out i jumped out from 31 feet and

2481
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:24,560
on top of that car

2482
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,400
and it exploded in the street the

2483
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,159
windshield went over three or four cars

2484
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,799
it looked like snow going up and i

2485
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:32,879
looked like donald duck with the thing

2486
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,400
in handcuffs and i got out and just kept

2487
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,800
running yeah i kept trying they ran me

2488
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:36,238
down

2489
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,840
and hit me in the back i still got a

2490
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:39,759
dead spot in my back where the policeman

2491
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,079
hit me with a shotgun

2492
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,199
and they brought me back mari was there

2493
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:44,960
they were saying

2495
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,719
spectacular but i escaped from lubeck

2496
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:50,638
maximum security prison

2497
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:52,239
and i cut out of there and got out that

2498
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:55,119
was a miraculous nose

2499
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:56,319
in lubeck germany what was what was that

2500
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:58,238
escape like

2501
01:22:56,319 --> 01:22:59,840
i was airing out whether it was going to

2502
01:22:58,238 --> 01:23:01,119
uh extradite me back to the united

2503
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,239
states where i still had all these

2504
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:08,238
charges in 25 years special parole

2505
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:12,638
and uh i was cleaning the uh

2506
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:15,359
lawyer's visiting room and on it was uh

2507
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:15,920
bars that looked like a piano notes or

2508
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:17,599
this way

2509
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:20,719
to make it pretty but there was a little

2510
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:23,760
bit so i got a rope from a guy

2511
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:25,679
where they made boats in there and i uh

2512
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,039
i had 20 minutes

2513
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,560
so i went in there and i wrapped it

2514
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:30,399
around and i put a broom handle in it

2515
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,000
that was cut off and wrapped it around

2516
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:33,519
until it pulled the bars together on

2517
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,639
that side and then i pulled them

2518
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,600
together on the other side but that only

2519
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,800
put me in

2520
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:42,480
inside the prison yard where the uh

2521
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:44,000
soccer equipment was kept but they were

2522
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:45,439
putting new windows on one side of the

2523
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,279
prison and they had it scaffold up to

2524
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:48,719
the fourth floor

2525
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:50,559
so there was a little recess there and

2526
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,719
there was guard towers every

2527
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,760
100 feet or so i mean they would shoot

2528
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,960
and kill you

2529
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,400
so i got behind that uh and climbed up

2530
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,600
holding to the bricks on one hand and

2531
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:01,279
the scaffolding on the other

2532
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,480
and went to the roof i lost my shirt and

2533
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:02,960
most of my clothes going through the

2534
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:04,718
window

2535
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,560
i got all the skin off of me i thought i

2536
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:08,158
was gonna die and i was trying to go

2537
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,800
sideways like this and finally i got a

2538
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:10,799
grip

2539
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,239
and the bars let me through and took all

2540
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,239
the skin off of me

2541
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:15,599
so i got up on that roof and i have

2542
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:16,479
asthma and i just lay there trying to

2543
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,760
catch my breath

2544
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:22,238
didn't bring my inhaler so

2545
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:24,320
with blood everywhere oh i was bloody

2546
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:26,238
yes and so i got down to the end

2547
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:27,920
and on the end the reason i did it they

2548
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:28,718
would put it they was putting a new wall

2549
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,359
again

2550
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,800
again around the prison to make it

2551
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:35,679
larger

2552
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:37,279
and they had taken all the wire off

2553
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:38,960
above the sally port where they could

2554
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:41,039
join the two walls together and i saw

2555
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:44,158
that when i came up

2556
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:46,000
and there was a guard a half of a

2557
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:47,198
like a dome sticking out of that brick

2558
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,719
building where there's a guard there

2559
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:50,158
with a gun and he'd kill you

2560
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,158
i mean he was made they were surely

2561
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:53,920
trained to kill you and we had some bad

2562
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:56,559
people in that place

2563
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:58,239
so i lay up a one one flew above it and

2564

2565
01:24:58,238 --> 01:25:00,559
double umbrella it was just pouring down

2566
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,000

2572
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:16,239
i hit the top of that guard tower bam

2573
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,119
with both feet and i jumped i guess it's

2574
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:19,599
three more floors

2575
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:21,198
i jumped there was a pile of sand like a

2576
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,840
cone where they were digging it there

2577
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:26,559
and i hit that and my feet buried up to

2578
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,840
the knees but i didn't fall and i ran

2579
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,679
straight towards her so he couldn't

2580
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,800
shoot me and then i went around some

2581
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,800
bushes and went downhill

2582
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,039
and then i heard bam bam bam blam behind

01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,239
me and i looked and that food woman was

2584
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:39,600
in a big old car

2585
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:41,839
and she was knocking down the parking

2586
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,480
meters behind me she was trying to run

2587
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,880

2588
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:47,119
and i ran behind the car oh wow and she

2589
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,119
tore the fender off of her car

2590
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:50,639
trying and yelling yeah yeah yapping a

2591
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:51,519
terrible evil looking face at me

2592
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,719
screaming at me

2593
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:57,360
and the sirens going off into prison

2594
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:59,359
and there was a fence there a wall and i

2595
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:01,279
jumped up on it to jump over and it was

2596
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:03,279
had glass in bed and i cut my hands and

2597
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:04,800
my arms all up getting over that

2598
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:06,880
and i hit the ground on the other side

2599
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,520
and it was like it was that

2600
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,880
much milk where some farmer had dug it i

2601
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,600

into prison and i had that in my shoe

2604
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,639
and i lost my shoes and that mush

2605
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:18,880
anyway i got out of there and got to

2606
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:22,159
holland really heck of a story hug

2607
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,520

2608
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:25,519
like whether it's germany or

2609
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,120
whether it's australia what were the

2610
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,440
some of the darker moments

2611
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:30,238
in prison the united states prisons are

2612
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:32,879
awful

2613
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:34,559
awful evil places now and just really

2614
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:38,079
there's nothing nice about them

2615
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,760
there's the guards in l.a

2616
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:41,519
which they never went out everyone i

2617
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,119
went to it seemed like the further east

2618
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,600
i went to oklahoma and it was nicer

2619
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:47,039
but all of them on the west coast there

2620
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,520
was hatred there

2621
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:50,880
and they got really stupid people hired

2622
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,920
just incredibly

2623
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:56,880
hatred by the guards and and the inmates

2624
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,760
like i speak spanish and i walked in to

2625
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,319
the spanish

2626
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:01,840
tv room and it was saying no you can't

2627
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:04,079

2641
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:32,399
saying like the basic humanity is gone

2642
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,199
completely completely into guards it was

2643
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:35,519

not a bit

2654
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,560
how did you persevere did you know i

2655
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,399
didn't even think i persevered but i

2656
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,159
i tried to enjoy my life wherever i am

2657
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:04,879
every day i do

2658
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:06,479
i uh i ran every day and like i told you

2659
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,960
why do you run so roger i said

2660
01:28:06,479 --> 01:28:10,559
to help me suffer these fools and uh i

2661
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,560
played a game of chess every day

2662
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,320
almost of my life in there and i read

2663
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,400
two books a week

2664
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:17,840
and i talked with people storytellers

2665
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:18,638
guys would come in and tell us another

2666
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,319
story roger

2667
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:22,319
give us a point tell us one they never

2668
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:23,759
told us before and so it was just nice a

2669
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:26,719
lot of them have original boys

2670
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,800
they they picked their country music and

2671
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:31,840
it was all right

2672
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:33,679
red morgan freeman's character in the

2673
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:36,639
shawshank redemption

2674
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:37,920
says the following these walls are funny

2675
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:40,079
first you hate them

2676
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,359
then you get used to them enough time

2677
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:43,559
passes you get

2678
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:45,599
so you depend on them that's

2679
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:48,080
institutionalized

2680
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,440
is there truth to that 100 i couldn't

2681
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:50,559
even see the walls

2682
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:53,359
except whenever i was planning on

2683
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:56,800
escaping in shawshank redemption

2684
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:58,079
he spent so many years in prison that

2685
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,960
he almost didn't know what to do with

2686
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:04,880
himself with himself once he left

2687
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:08,239
once once he was a free man that's the

2688
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:11,359
you get so used to the the system

2689
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:14,399
the the rituals having

2690
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:14,399
to follow orders

2691
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:18,158
even being treated poorly all those

2692
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:20,079
kinds of things that you become

2693
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:23,198
dependent on

2694
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:24,880
well uh down in australia i spent the

2695
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:28,079
first a little over a year

2696
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:30,000
in in the shoe it was like um did you

2697
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:32,559
see the movie the um

2698
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,760
silence of the lambs thank you and he's

2699
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,280
there i had five

2700
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,880
five or six guards looking at me with

2701
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:38,158
one-way mirror yeah

2702
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,000
and that's whenever i thought i might

2703
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:41,599
never get out i got a life sentence i

2704
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:46,000
had all this time waiting

2705
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:48,400
here in germany and so that's they had a

2706
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,840
uh they had a computer in there but it

2707
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:51,439
didn't have a program on it

2708
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,800
and i wrote so i just started writing

2709
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:53,519
these little stories of stuff that i did

2710
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,600
in my life

2711
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,040
and i wrote one line and i wrote a

2712
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,400
million words

2713
01:29:57,039 --> 01:30:00,479
with them looking at me so it's after a

2714
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:01,839
year they let me out it wasn't long

2715
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:04,879
before they put me in a place called

2716
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:06,560
self-care and

2717
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:09,199
particularly i was in what they call the

2718
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:10,560
lifers pod there was 268 men in

2719
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:15,439
self-care there

2720
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:18,159
and uh it was it was unbelievably good

2721
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:18,799
that we were left alone basically they

2722
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:20,719
was there

2723
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,079
the guards were certainly there but they

2724
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,560
had their their shack

2725
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:26,639
and we had apartments for four

2726
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:29,199
apartments to the building

2727
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:30,480
and uh six men to the unit with your own

2728
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:32,879
door and a key to it

2729
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:34,959
in a kitchen dining room freezer

2730
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:38,239
refrigerator and they gave you

2731
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:41,359
allowed just 360 a week to buy groceries

2732
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:43,919
and i cooked for about 16 years and uh

2733
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:44,719
you learn to cook good and the people

2734
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,079
and other people

2735
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:51,679
make have their specialties and uh

2736
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:53,920
so that was that was quite uh it wasn't

2737
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,440
so like being in prison it was somewhat

2738
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,000
living with me and it was difficult man

2739
01:30:55,439 --> 01:30:58,638
i had some good good fights and carry on

2740
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,719
but

2741
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,760
you don't get along with everybody but

2742
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:03,198
uh

2743
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,280
then whenever i came back to the united

2744
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:07,919

01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,880
myself with it with some smoke

2849
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:30,238

2851
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:32,799

2852
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,079
so that was your time during the

2853
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,159
coronavirus pandemic

2854
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:38,079
i got out last april right in the middle

2855
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:41,439
every night and they were dying

2856
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:43,198
bad in there so i was treated worse for

2857
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:44,799
that last year in america than i was for

2858
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:48,000
the whole 20 years in australia

2859
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:50,800
18 years in australia and then you were

2860
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,319
a free man at the end of that year they

2861
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,159
put me out and sent me home and

2862
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,679
and the parole officers couldn't even

2863
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:58,719
come they weren't working they were just

2864
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,239
doing everything by video

2865
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,000
better not have a drink the only

2866
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:03,519
condition the thing was i couldn't even

2867
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,639
have a drink of wine

2868
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:08,560
so uh after a year they uh i had i had

2869
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:10,000
to take psychiatric treatment

2870
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,320
every week i had to go talk to the

2871
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,479
psychiatrist psychologist

2872
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:16,158
and me and her got along great she was a

2873
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:16,718
good christian woman we just chatted and

2874
01:35:16,158 --> 01:35:18,079
talked

2875
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,319
and i think they said so i had to pee in

2876
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:22,238
the bottle every week i said i've been

2877
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:24,319
in 33 years how many pissed

2878
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:25,439
you think i've had never been dirty the

2879
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:26,960
only thing if you don't want to clean

2880
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:29,519
when you come get me

2881
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,880
before i talk to you about love let me

2882
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:34,000
ask you

2883
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,719
a difficult question you write in your

2884
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,319
book

2885
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,158
i don't consider myself much of a

2886
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:41,279
criminal i don't lie

2887
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:42,960
cheat or steal and i always take up for

2888
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:46,880
the underdog

2889
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:47,600
violence makes me sick yet i know i'm an

2890
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,440
outlaw

2891
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,119
and those that break the law must be

2892
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:53,599
punished

2893
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:55,519
i think many people listening to this or

2894
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,560
some people listening to this

2895
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:00,080
will see you as a criminal as a bad man

2896
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,560
who increased the amount of suffering in

2897
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:02,559
this world

2898
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:05,760
what do you have to say to them

2899
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:10,639
i would like to tell them that they have

2900
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:13,039
been indoctrinated by the spin

2901
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:15,279
of news and politicians and they don't

2902
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:16,639
know the truth of the situation

2903
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:18,479
he lay the truth out there in an

2904
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:20,719
envelope let me open it

2905
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:21,919
besides something else that is false and

2906
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:26,399
it's staggering

2907
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:30,158
the truth is that i was a tobacco farmer

2908
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:30,960
and tobacco kills 500 000 people a year

2909
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:33,198
in america

2910
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:36,560
and 6 million have a debilitating

2911
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:36,559
diseases because of it

2912
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:40,960
drugs all drugs combined kill between 10

2913
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:44,079
and 15

2914
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:46,719
000 people a year by overdose and 60

2915
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:48,158

01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:13,840
that's the truth of it and so

2927
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:16,399
in your career you were you walked

2928
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:17,920
amidst violence but you never

2929
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:21,679
participated in the violence

2930
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,359
i didn't even see it

2931
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:25,199
just didn't happen around me in prison

2932
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:25,839
it did i sewed people up they called me

2933
01:37:25,198 --> 01:37:29,359
doc i

2934
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:31,199
had dental floss and uh

2935
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:33,279
one one time i had to get a blade and

2936
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:37,359
try to help keep them from my

2937
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:40,319
patient from getting again but i don't

2938
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:40,799
was just like if i shot at those people

2939
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:42,639
i shot

2940
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,360
them to keep them from killing me i did

2941
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:47,118
i certainly didn't mean to kill them

2942
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,799
so that's that's just some people are

2943
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:49,599
evil and they will kill you and hurt you

2944
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,840
and lie to you

2945
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,800
i just don't do any of that it's just it

2946
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,480
makes you sick

2947
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,560
i've seen it i was when i was in the

2948
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:58,319
shoe three guys tried to kill a guy and

2949
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:00,560
they stabbed him so many times but

2950
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:01,599
their stab went blinking the blood

2951
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,119
getting out of the room and actually

2952
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,639
gonna kill him you're gonna kill him

2953
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:06,559
and save his life drug him up there

2954
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:08,079
where the guards could see him

2955
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,239
there's stuff like that i'm just not of

2956
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:10,800
that nature of those people they're just

2957
01:38:10,238 --> 01:38:15,039
evil

2958
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:17,279
there's people born evil i believe yeah

2959
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:19,279
it is heartbreaking to hear that the

2960
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:21,439
basic humanities gone in prison

2961
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:22,800
in the united states that's

2962
01:38:21,439 --> 01:38:23,519
heartbreaking because that basic

2963
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,039
humanity

2964
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,560
is actually the light at the end of the

2965
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:28,960
tunnel it's the thing that saves us

2966
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:30,000
as opposed to uh when it's absent it's

2967
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:33,039
the thing that destroys

2968
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,279
us the prisoners are filled absolutely

2969
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:37,198
filled with people that have some mental

2970
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:40,319
problems

2971
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:41,678
now you see tent city all the way up and

2972
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:42,559
down here i guarantee you every one of

2973
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:45,600
those people

2974
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,119
have mental problems some degree

2975
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:49,600
however little it is but they're a

2976
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:50,559
little bit off now then you get a dea

2977
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,560
agent

2978
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,840
that wants to make a name for himself he

2979
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,440
goes down there and gets two of them

2980
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:57,360
one of them to sell a little two grams

2981
01:38:55,439 --> 01:39:00,158
of methamphetamine to the other one

2982
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:02,079
and he gets a conviction and a young

2983
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:03,279
prosecutor he gets a conviction he wants

2984
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:05,760
to make a judge

2985
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:06,960
and we got to judge and where was it i'm

2986
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,560
going to give him a million

2987
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,840
what's his name gilbert i'm going to

2988
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:11,360
make i'm going to give him in a million

2989
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:15,600
years before i get off the judge

2990
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:18,639
you get fools like that in charge

2991
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:22,079
you're going to fill prisons up with

2992
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,880
pitiful humanity and those are the ones

2993
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:26,479
and then the other

2994
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:31,359
is people over drugs

2995
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:34,559
and drugs should be a uh a health issue

2996
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:37,439
you can't you cannot

2997
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,119
police it enough it's just they know

2998
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:41,678
like the only thing that overdoses

2999
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:43,279
is opioids the heroin and if they can

3000
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:45,920
give it to them it costs about a dollar

3001
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:47,679
a day to give the worst attic is

3002
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,520
his fix but they'll give it methadone

3003
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:51,359
which is from a pharmaceutical company

3004
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:53,440
which is just as bad

3005
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:54,479
why in the world we tried it all over

3006
01:39:53,439 --> 01:39:57,839
the world

3007
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:58,479
in uh portugal and england and when they

3008
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:03,119
give the

3009
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:06,399
the girls cleanup no more stolen cars

3010
01:40:03,118 --> 01:40:07,039
why who who wants to keep this forest

3011
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:09,839
going

3012
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:10,639
they just perpetuating it like oh every

3013
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:13,520
little

3014
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:15,359
police place is getting all these suits

3015
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:18,080
and armor and machine guns

3016
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:18,559
it's just like oh it's it's such a spin

3017
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:20,880
it's

3018
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,360
sad do you think all drugs should be

3019
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,639
legalized

3020
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:26,880
i don't know about that but they

3021
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:29,118
certainly should be controlled if a

3022
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:31,118
person is an addict

3023
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:33,439
he should be able to go down and get his

3024
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:34,399
fix with somebody there to help him with

3025
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:36,719
a clean needle

3026
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:37,519
and a glass of orange juice it's so much

3027
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,439
cheaper

3028
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,639
than prison so much cheaper than him

3029
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:42,719
stealing cars

3030
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:44,480
or prostitute having to go to work

3031
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:47,760
that's sad

3032
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:51,359
you've lived one heck of a life

3033
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:53,679
looking back there's a there's a lot of

3034
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:56,319
young people that listen to this

3035
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:57,520
high school college students what advice

3036
01:40:56,319 --> 01:41:00,639
would you give them

3037
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:01,840
how to live how to have a successful

3038
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:04,719
career

3039
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:05,119
how to have a good life how to be a good

3040
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:10,960
man

3041
01:41:05,118 --> 01:41:12,799
a woman to be a good man or woman

3042
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,000
if i had to do over with i'll just tell

3043
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,520
you what i'd have done

3044
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,960
i would have paid attention and studied

3045
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:21,679
my lesson and did the best i could

3046
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,800
um in school in school yes and went as

3047
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:24,399
far as i could have

3048
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,840
i would have liked to been a doctor i

3049
01:41:24,399 --> 01:41:27,039
just didn't have the stick ability or

3050
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:30,239
anybody to tell me

3051
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:33,118
hey go there and do that and if you

3052
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:34,638
can do that at a very young age start in

3053
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:36,719
a trade

3054
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:38,079
learn to do something doesn't matter

3055
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:40,480
what it is

3056
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:43,519
if you learn to do something good there

3057
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:46,158
is a great demand for you

3058
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:48,080
and i would say that in prison the

3059
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:51,118
prison system should come in and

3060
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:54,399
you get a thief a young fan is a thief a

3061
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:56,639
robber and you say all right

3062
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:58,158
we need um we need carpenters we need

3063
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:59,840
plumbers we need electricians we need

3064
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:02,238
sheep

3065
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:03,520
sentence them to that trade and when you

3066
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:04,879
get an a plus in that

3067
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,639
where you can go out and make you thirty

3068
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,760
dollars and fifty dollars an hour you go

3069
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:09,920
home

3070
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:11,760
now you can you mess around ten years if

3071
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:14,000
you want to or you can do this in two

3072
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,600
i think that would uh that's just for

3073
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,439
the prism but anyway

3074
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:18,880
i would say that they find somebody and

3075
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:21,678
be true to them

3076
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,679
that we have um

3077
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:26,839
just be honest and true in your life

3078
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:28,560
you mean like relationships

3079
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:32,079
relationships yes i mean

3080
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:34,719
so many so many people particularly

3081
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:36,079
our children are from relationships

3082
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:38,079
where

3083
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:39,359
they not wanted their divorce their

3084
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:40,238
fathers left they don't know who their

3085
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:43,118
daddy is

3086
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:44,718
they dis in foster homes 500 000

3087
01:42:43,118 --> 01:42:45,599
children in foster homes in america

3088
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,399
today

3089
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:50,400
and and we have in our government

3090
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:51,279
inadvertently as in encouraging those

3091
01:42:50,399 --> 01:42:53,439
people

3092
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:54,880
my daughter is a doctor and she

3093
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:58,158
delivered a couple years ago

3094
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:59,679
a baby from a 10 year old child

3095
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:01,599
that child and she said in the

3096
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:03,039
individual room is four generations all

3097
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:05,199
of them on welfare

3098
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:06,560
now we got one more and it reminds me of

3099
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:11,839
elvis presley's song

3100
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:11,840
in the ghetto so for an individual

3101
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:16,719
learn a trade become a craftsman of

3102
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:18,960
sorts yes

3103
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,639
and uh find somebody to love and who

3104
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:24,079
loves you that's right have

3105
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:24,960
have a family in in and uh and stick

3106
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:26,639

3107
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:28,079
they just be surely you're gonna get

3108

letter

3154
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:07,679
and it's a letter from roger and then we

3155
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,199

3156
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:09,760

3157
01:45:09,198 --> 01:45:12,799
days

3159
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,000
and then the next summer he was coming

3160
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:19,118
up again

3161
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:21,840
he was on his way to alaska and

3162
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:23,359
um he says i would like to come by and

3163
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,079

3164
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:29,599
same place that i met you last year

3165
01:45:26,079 --> 01:45:32,238
and so when we when he came up this time

3166
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:33,760
for some reason roger reached for my

3167
01:45:32,238 --> 01:45:37,039
hand and i reached for his

3168
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:40,159
and man that was it it was like

3169
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:43,519
love and for first touch that was love

3170
01:45:40,158 --> 01:45:46,879
it was just like a silence you know and

3171
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:48,480
oh my gosh and we didn't even look at

3172
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:50,000
each other it was just oh my goodness

3173
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:51,839
what happened here

3174
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,118
and i was the type of person i never

3175
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:55,600
wanted to get married not

3176
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:56,399
way way way down the road never have any

3177
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,560
children

3178
01:45:56,399 --> 01:46:01,279
and i wanted to see the world first and

3179
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:03,679
then do all that you know

3180
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:05,198
and um but that was it that was love and

3181
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:08,639
you've been together ever since

3182
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:11,919
yeah well

3183
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:13,039
the thing is about the love the the two

3184
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,520
you have for each other

3185
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:17,840
is they had to persevere through quite a

3186
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:21,840
heck of a journey

3187
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:25,039
so how did uh rogers

3188
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:25,760
drug smuggling change the nature of your

3189
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:28,880
love

3190
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:33,840
and your relationship well lex that

3191
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:36,319
remained steadfast it uh it endured

3192
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:38,000
and since roger's been home i think

3193
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:40,719
we've rekindled

3194
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,679
the love that we had when we first met

3195
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:45,679
yeah what

3196
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:49,039
but but i think my faith um

3197
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:51,039
you know my faith my steadf fast faith

3198
01:46:49,039 --> 01:46:53,198
and also the fact that roger and i

3199
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:53,679

01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,319
you afraid that

3295
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:29,360

01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:32,639
it's illegal

3297
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:36,238

bulletproof i mean they didn't catch you

3301
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:43,599

01:50:41,118 --> 01:50:45,439
was all right it was hard to get y'all

3303
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:46,639
hard to catch you in in the air yeah so

3304
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:49,519
you never thought

3305
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:49,520
to catch you in there

3306
01:50:50,079 --> 01:50:53,599
i didn't know that if your friend told

3307
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,840
on you five years later you'd still go

3308
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:56,319

relationship

3376
01:53:07,039 --> 01:53:15,198
oh well you know i think the initial

3377
01:53:11,279 --> 01:53:18,719
igniting meeting someone you know that

3378
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:21,279
that's the love that's it and that

3379
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:22,319
that that little fire just that fire

3380
01:53:21,279 --> 01:53:24,479
just keeps burning

3381
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:26,319
and burning and burning you can't put it

3382
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:29,678
out no matter what

3383
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:32,479
it's the the love fire

3384
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:34,239

3424
01:55:00,399 --> 01:55:03,679
throughout my life i'm working on

3425
01:55:02,319 --> 01:55:05,519
getting there

3426
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:07,920

3427
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:11,040
oh yes oh yeah there are times

3428
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,840
yeah but you know i had some i had faith

01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:14,319
in him he was an

3430
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:16,719
excellent pilot for example i always

3431
01:55:14,319 --> 01:55:18,559
said roger if the ship's going down

3432
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:20,158
i'm jumping in the lifeboat with you

3433
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:21,280

3436
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:27,279
in him

3437
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:28,639
you know i mean he's he's a man but yet

3438
01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:29,679

3439
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:32,880
lifeboat with

i couldn't you know he has to fly but he

3477
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:02,560

[Laughter]

3479
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,719

about that

3488
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:27,759

about 10 days ago

so unexpectedly and that really

3492
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:35,678
put you know makes you think of your

3493
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,679
mortality

3494
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:42,880
are you afraid um somewhat and some

3495
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:42,880
and and yet not

3496
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,198
yeah the party i want to live lex i want

3497
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:50,400
to live

3498
01:57:47,198 --> 01:57:52,559
you know this life is fun yes

3499
01:57:50,399 --> 01:57:54,158
do you think about your death roger i

3500
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,000
have visions

3501
01:57:54,158 --> 01:57:57,920
i have visions and they often happen

3502
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,319
very very clear

3503
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:02,639
like what i have seen in the future

3504
01:58:00,319 --> 01:58:04,639
scientists might call it wormholes or

3505
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:06,000
and the old testament they call it

3506
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:07,679
prophets but i i see

3507
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,439
sometimes in the future around the

3508
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:10,000
corner it's clear as we're sitting right

3509
01:58:09,439 --> 01:58:12,399
here

3510
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,920
what's that look like i was on a porch

3511
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:14,799
and i believe i was in like central

3512
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,800
america place

3513
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,159
i was an old man with khaki pants and a

3514
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,960
white shirt

3515
01:58:18,158 --> 01:58:22,000
and this it was a chair with a wide uh

3516
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,239
arms and it was straight

3517
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,079
and there's like the the beams coming

3518
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:29,598
out above my head and i'm on the porch

3519
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:31,760
spoken video and and i uh

3520
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:33,199
i come i i have out of the body

3521
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:35,760
experiences also

3522
01:58:33,198 --> 01:58:37,198
and i came out of my body just i just

3523
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:39,920
floated out of my body

3524
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:40,879
and went into a veil and like into a

3525
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:42,319
mist

3526
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:44,719
and i believe that's probably why it

3527
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:46,960
happened you talk about

3528
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:50,158
you talk about like it's in your past

3529
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:52,239
this is you know this isn't my future

3530
01:58:50,158 --> 01:58:53,198
but this is something he has seen you

3531
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:55,598
know in the passion

3532
01:58:53,198 --> 01:58:57,519
yeah no i know but it's funny just yeah

3533
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:59,840
the tents you use

3534
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:00,560
it happened and yet it's something that

3535
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:03,360
will happen

3536
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:04,800
yeah both are true it's just

3537
01:59:03,359 --> 01:59:06,719
unbelievable that and i

3538
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:08,800
i i don't know how many people have it

3539
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:10,399
but i have it i've walked out of my body

3540
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:12,079
just like just where i could come up to

3541
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:12,479
you and look and set up on the radio i

3542
01:59:12,079 --> 01:59:14,238
used to

3543
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:17,118
be at work on the railroad and i had

3544
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:18,638
them there how do you explain that

3545
01:59:17,118 --> 01:59:20,399
what the heck is going on in this

3546
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:23,118
universe that's that's possible

3547
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:25,118
oh i don't know but uh certainly it's

3548
01:59:23,118 --> 01:59:28,559
certainly a phenomenal which it happened

3549
01:59:25,118 --> 01:59:30,079
and uh there's a guy bill monroe that

3550
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:31,039
wrote the book on it out of the body he

3551
01:59:30,079 --> 01:59:34,079
tells about it

3552
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:37,359
and who is the guy that writes uh

3553
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:40,158
the alchemist those things

3554
01:59:37,359 --> 01:59:41,679
he has them also just like that and and

3555
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:43,439
he tells about how it happens on him

3556
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:46,399
might happen differently

3557
01:59:43,439 --> 01:59:48,000
and but you certainly can come out of

3558
01:59:46,399 --> 01:59:49,839
your body

3559
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,359
what do you think the meaning of this

3560
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:55,679
life is

3561
01:59:51,359 --> 01:59:59,039
maybe from from from your faith

3562
01:59:55,679 --> 02:00:00,639
but also from just the amazing adventure

3563
01:59:59,039 --> 02:00:02,719
that you lived through

3564
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:05,199
how do you make sense of why the heck

3565
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:05,198
we're here

3566
02:00:05,279 --> 02:00:10,000
i don't know i just it's just kind of

3567
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,800
like who you are even when i was a child

3568
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,319
i was like

3569
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:14,320
i'm different from other people

3570
02:00:14,399 --> 02:00:21,039
you know and just as a boy i was like i

3571
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:22,400
uh i don't know could you put into words

3572
02:00:21,039 --> 02:00:24,560
how you were different or was just the

3573
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:26,479
few yeah like my brother i mean

3574
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:28,639
he kept his hands clean and his shoes

3575
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:29,678
shining here i was barefooted catching a

3576
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:32,400
wild hog or

3577
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:33,920
a wrestling a a horse trying to get it

3578
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:35,279
down you know i saw pictures of you

3579
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:37,760
climbing a tree

3580
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:40,559
recently when i first got out of prison

3581
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:43,599
always something like that yeah i just

3582
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:46,800
so i don't know it's just that uh

3583
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:48,159
and i noticed that something about me is

3584
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:50,239
sometimes in prison there'd be a knife

3585
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:53,279
fight and people just

3586
02:00:50,238 --> 02:00:54,319
you see them rough guys that turn white

3587
02:00:53,279 --> 02:00:56,880
from it

3588
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:57,599
it i just kind of almost like smile i

3589
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:00,480
mean unless

3590
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:01,039
if they come at me i'll turn white and

3591
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:03,118
get away

3592
02:01:01,039 --> 02:01:04,238
but it doesn't those things like sudden

3593
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:06,799
bother me i just

3594
02:01:04,238 --> 02:01:08,238
prison didn't bother me so you don't

3595
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:09,599
know what the heck the meaning is you

3596
02:01:08,238 --> 02:01:13,039
just know you're a bit different

3597
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:16,079
than the others and then maybe

3598
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:17,920
well um maybe the

3599
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:19,760
the whole point is you want to realize

3600
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:22,319
you want to let that

3601
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:23,119
madness flourish that uniqueness

3602
02:01:22,319 --> 02:01:24,479
flourish

3603
02:01:23,118 --> 02:01:26,158
that's the whole point of life we're all

3604
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:28,158
different in our in like

3605
02:01:26,158 --> 02:01:29,439
very interesting little ways yes and the

3606
02:01:28,158 --> 02:01:30,479
more different you are you want to let

3607
02:01:29,439 --> 02:01:32,000
that

3608
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:33,598
you want to let that become you want to

3609
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,520
let it be it's full

3610
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:37,440
it's like a garden you know all the

3611
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:39,599
different flowers yeah

3612
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:41,919
you did mention um you weren't sure if

3613
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:44,400
there's a free will or not

3614
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:45,359
um do you think it's all predetermined

3615
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:47,439
or do you think would make

3616
02:01:45,359 --> 02:01:49,359
no choice to make our decisions i just

3617
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:51,678
said if it is i hope that

3618
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:52,479
but i know that we make our decisions

3619
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:55,199
and i agree

3620
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:56,000
and i i know that we are spirits that

3621
02:01:55,198 --> 02:01:58,399
are living in this

3622
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,679
in this flesh that's beyond a shadow of

3623
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:01,039
a doubt with me

3624
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:03,118
if you walk out of your body and have

3625
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:05,118
out of body experience you will know it

3626
02:02:03,118 --> 02:02:06,238
so the body is just the temperature the

3627
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:08,880
spirit lives on

3628
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:09,279
eternally with no beginning and no end

3629
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:12,000
it just

3630
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:14,399
and that's hard to fathom yeah this is

3631
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,238
just a little [ __ ] this is a shell

3632
02:02:14,399 --> 02:02:18,479
to contain that spirit you know this is

3633
02:02:16,238 --> 02:02:21,678
the way we work on earth you know

3634
02:02:18,479 --> 02:02:25,279
but yeah i know i'm an eternal being

3635
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:26,000
so are you do you think there's a why to

3636
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:27,759
it

3637
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,238
you know do you think there's a meaning

3638
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:31,039
to this life well i think the why is

3639
02:02:30,238 --> 02:02:33,678
beyond

3640
02:02:31,039 --> 02:02:35,279
my capability of understanding it's

3641
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:39,039
someone greater

3642
02:02:35,279 --> 02:02:41,359
than me i don't understand it but

3643
02:02:39,039 --> 02:02:42,158
it's awesome i just know that it's

3644
02:02:41,359 --> 02:02:44,079
awesome

3645
02:02:42,158 --> 02:02:46,879
and one day we will know the answers

3646
02:02:44,079 --> 02:02:48,559
once we get to that cross over the other

3647
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:49,760
to the other side i think we will

3648
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:51,679
understand

3649
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:53,599
clearly it says you know now we see

3650
02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:55,599
through a glass darkly

3651
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:58,319
but then when we are face to face with

3652
02:02:55,599 --> 02:03:01,360
god we will understand

3653
02:02:58,319 --> 02:03:03,679
and until we know let's just

3654
02:03:01,359 --> 02:03:04,639
enjoy this beautiful life yes well we

3655
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:07,359
got it

3656
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:09,520
and we're meant that was my guilt i love

3657
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:12,158
everybody and everything

3658
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:14,320
i do and it's just and i'm sorry if i

3659
02:03:12,158 --> 02:03:17,439
put a stumbling block in anybody's way

3660
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:19,439
i wouldn't want to but these are these

3661
02:03:17,439 --> 02:03:22,960
things and i just think about oh

3662
02:03:19,439 --> 02:03:24,638
what a hypocritical world we live in

3663
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:27,359
though

3664
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:28,639
like almost anybody out there listen

3665
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:29,759
okay he's a drug dealer

3666
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:32,079
and i would say most of them are

3667
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:33,039
committed to adultery that's a cardinal

3668
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:35,760
sin

3669
02:03:33,039 --> 02:03:37,039
and yet they move through throw rocks at

3670
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:39,840
me for moving uh

3671
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:40,560
uh marijuana cocaine across the road

3672
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:42,000
yeah

3673
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:43,920
it's just if you saw the two different

3674
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:46,560
things you'd say what a

3675
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:47,520
terrible difference it is but we become

3676
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:51,119
conditioned with

3677
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:54,719
this mad society that we have

3678
02:03:51,118 --> 02:03:57,198
you mentioned that your daughter miriam

3679
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:58,158
wrote you a poem you mind reading it i'd

3680
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:00,960
be glad to

3681
02:03:58,158 --> 02:04:01,920
i was uh doing 11 years up in lombok

3682
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:04,078
penitentiary

3683
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,279
maximum security prison for parole

3684
02:04:04,078 --> 02:04:08,719
violation

3685
02:04:05,279 --> 02:04:10,158
for possession of marijuana in 1977.

3686
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:11,599
they should have given me six months but

3687
02:04:10,158 --> 02:04:12,399
they gave me 11 years because they

3688
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:15,039
wanted me for

3689
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:16,479
what they call silent beef anyhow while

3690
02:04:15,039 --> 02:04:19,118
i was in that dungeon

3691
02:04:16,479 --> 02:04:20,959
i received a letter from my daughter

3692
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:24,078
miriam

3693
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:25,118
it's called daddy's poem a year ago i

3694
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:27,519
became a poet

3695
02:04:25,118 --> 02:04:29,519
when i wrote your birthday prose and

3696
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:30,560
here i am today ready to give it another

3697
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:32,960
go

3698
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:34,880
first i would like to wish you a very

3699
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:37,039
happy birthday to be

3700
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:39,679
and to thank you so very much for

3701
02:04:37,039 --> 02:04:41,920
without you i would not be me

3702
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:43,440
secondly i want to say that your support

3703
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:46,158
has been immense

3704
02:04:43,439 --> 02:04:48,319
it has been true honest loving and free

3705
02:04:46,158 --> 02:04:51,039
of all pretense

3706
02:04:48,319 --> 02:04:51,679
thirdly it goes without saying your love

3707
02:04:51,039 --> 02:04:54,238
has

3708
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:55,279
surpassed all my wrongs and you always

3709
02:04:54,238 --> 02:04:58,799
made me smile

3710
02:04:55,279 --> 02:05:01,118
with one of your country songs

3711
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:02,639
i can remember on cuervo daddy with you

3712
02:05:01,118 --> 02:05:04,880
holding me in your arms

3713
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:06,400
as you sang jim reeve songs and talked

3714
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,159
about the farm

3715
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:10,479
i can see you walking through the door

3716
02:05:08,158 --> 02:05:12,479
from one of your travels far and wide

3717
02:05:10,479 --> 02:05:14,879
and the thought of you coming home daddy

3718
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:16,799
kept a twinkle in our eyes

3719
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,719
i can smell you as i did when i used to

3720
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:20,480
climb into your bed

3721
02:05:18,719 --> 02:05:22,560
and you would talk to me again about one

3722
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:24,879
of the adventures that you led

3723
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:27,280
i can see me and mario asleep in one of

3724
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:29,760
your airplanes extraordinaire

3725
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:32,238
and remembering wondering to myself why

3726
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:34,079
there wasn't an available chair

3727
02:05:32,238 --> 02:05:36,000
i remember having to meet you and

3728
02:05:34,078 --> 02:05:37,920
worrying that you wouldn't be there

3729
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,599
but you would pop up from behind some

3730
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:44,239
counter and give us all a happy scare

3731
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:46,159
you gave us presents in kievis king and

3732
02:05:44,238 --> 02:05:48,078
hotels pleasure galore

3733
02:05:46,158 --> 02:05:50,000
and three dozen roses so we came through

3734
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:51,840
the airport door

3735
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,520
i can see your face in amsterdam with

3736
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,119
the luggage carousel

3737
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:57,679
and you look like a boy with a secret

3738
02:05:55,118 --> 02:05:59,598
that you were just dying to tell

3739
02:05:57,679 --> 02:06:01,279
you taught me mathematics in the sands

3740
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:03,039
of far away places

3741
02:06:01,279 --> 02:06:04,800
and taught me to sail and we left

3742
02:06:03,039 --> 02:06:07,279
without any traces

3743
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:09,279
we climbed glaciers in argentina and saw

3744
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:11,759
the blue of the beautiful caves

3745
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:12,960
and witnessed the majestic beauty of

3746
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:15,440
such a jaggling

3747
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:17,359
maze i learned how to change gears on

3748
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:20,238
the dirt roads of brazil

3749
02:06:17,359 --> 02:06:21,759
we ate hot dogs in paraguay a memory we

3750
02:06:20,238 --> 02:06:23,598
smile over still

3751
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:25,599
we talked about lions elephants and

3752
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:28,078
bears on a hacienda and

3753
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:30,960
uruguay but decided it was better if the

3754
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:32,158
europe we did fly over the old world and

3755
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:35,039
all its luxury

3756
02:06:32,158 --> 02:06:36,960
what a good time it was from south

3757
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:39,679
america to the krasmapalski

3758
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:41,359
i think we fell in love the european

3759
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:44,319
jaunt well

3760
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:46,238
it is considered a book in itself but

3761
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:47,039
it's a story about beauty and knowledge

3762
02:06:46,238 --> 02:06:49,279
suspense

3763
02:06:47,039 --> 02:06:52,000
and worldly wealth we went from holland

3764
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:54,639
to sweden a woman from france to spain

3765
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,920
and i promise you i have no regrets i

3766
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:58,319
would definitely do it all

3767
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:59,520
again i would see the world with you

3768
02:06:58,319 --> 02:07:01,840
anytime sir

3769
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:03,679
there's no doubt in my mind because

3770
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:06,719
being by your side daddy

3771
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:08,719
always ensures a wild good time

3772
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:10,000
so our past took a turn and we're back

3773
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:12,078
in the us of a

3774
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:14,238
but life here isn't so bad and i'm

3775
02:07:12,078 --> 02:07:16,399
content to stay

3776
02:07:14,238 --> 02:07:18,638
i'm happy to be near you although i'm

3777
02:07:16,399 --> 02:07:19,920
not as close as i was before

3778
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:21,920
but because of your love and

3779
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:23,440
encouragement i've been able to open

3780
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,840
your doors

3781
02:07:23,439 --> 02:07:28,158
i'm grateful to be in school and i'm

3782
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:29,840
generally happy where i am

3783
02:07:28,158 --> 02:07:32,638
and i even like when you call and tell

3784
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:34,960
me to study for the next exam

3785
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:37,520
what a life you've given me daddy it's a

3786
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:39,840
tremendous and a magical gift

3787
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:42,079
we already have so many stories to tell

3788
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:44,319
there are far too many to list

3789
02:07:42,078 --> 02:07:46,880
but i want to thank you again this day

3790
02:07:44,319 --> 02:07:49,118
with a very big happy birthday to you

3791
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:51,440
and to tell you just a few more things

3792
02:07:49,118 --> 02:07:53,920
that i knew in my heart to be true

3793
02:07:51,439 --> 02:07:55,118
i love you daddy with all of your wrongs

3794
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:56,639
and your rights

3795
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:59,039
that you're ahead of our family and

3796
02:07:56,639 --> 02:08:00,880
you've kept us all bound tight

3797
02:07:59,039 --> 02:08:03,439
that you have a honest love in your

3798
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:05,440
heart for god and all mankind

3799
02:08:03,439 --> 02:08:08,158
and you truly do believe in yourself

3800
02:08:05,439 --> 02:08:10,479
when you say it will all be fine

3801
02:08:08,158 --> 02:08:12,399
i know you will be there to catch me if

3802
02:08:10,479 --> 02:08:14,718
ever i waver a slip

3803
02:08:12,399 --> 02:08:16,238
and i know i'd want you as captain on

3804
02:08:14,719 --> 02:08:18,880
any sinking ship

3805
02:08:16,238 --> 02:08:21,439
i also know a new chapter is written

3806
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:23,279
it's almost time to move on

3807
02:08:21,439 --> 02:08:25,359
it's time to sail another sea and to

3808
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:26,880
witness a brand new dawn

3809
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:29,759
it'll be good to see you at the helm

3810
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:31,920
again as you point out our destination

3811
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:34,560
to laugh and dance on the upper deck is

3812
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:36,560
while the boat glides through

3813
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:38,880
it'll be good to see you on the go

3814
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:40,880
because i know you like to be

3815
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:43,199
and to know you can open any door

3816
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:45,599
without any key

3817
02:08:43,198 --> 02:08:47,839
but while we revel in our days together

3818
02:08:45,599 --> 02:08:51,279
we will know better than to hurry

3819
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:54,800
because as you told me many times life

3820
02:08:51,279 --> 02:08:58,238
