00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,039
barry barish a theoretical physicist at

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,759
caltech and the winner of the nobel

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,719
prize in physics for his contributions

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:14,798
to the ligo detector and the observation

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:17,039
of gravitational waves

7
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,278
ligo or the laser interferometer

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,600
gravitational wave observatory is

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,679
probably the most precise measurement

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,118
device ever built

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,439
by humans

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:30,640
it consists of two detectors with four

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,200
kilometer long vacuum chambers situated

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,159
three thousand kilometers apart

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,879
operating in unison to measure a motion

16
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,119
that is ten thousand times smaller than

17
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,039
the width of a proton

18
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,679
it is the smallest measurement ever

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,839
attempted by science a measurement of

20
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,479
gravitational waves caused by the most

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,520
violent and cataclysmic events in the

22
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:54,159
universe

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,920
occurring over tens of millions of light

24
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,159
years away

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719

our sponsors in the description

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,400
this is the lex friedman podcast and

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,079
here is my conversation with barry

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
barish

30
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,438
you've mentioned that you were always

31
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,599
curious about the physical world and

32
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,158
that an early question you remember

33
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,559
stood out where you asked your dad

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,240
why does ice float on water and he

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
couldn't answer and this was very

36
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,438
surprising to you

37
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,959
so you went on to learn why

38
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,758
maybe you can speak to what are some

39
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,559
early questions in math and physics that

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,438
really sparked your curiosity yeah

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,439
that memory is

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,519
kind of something i used to illustrate

43
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,679
something i think that's common in

44
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,879
science that people that do science

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
somehow have maintained

46
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,599
maintain something that kids always have

47
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:54,799
a small kid

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,798
eight years old or so

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,399
asks you so many questions usually

50
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,158
typically that you

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,960
consider them pests you tell them to

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,000
stop asking so many questions

53
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,039
and

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,840
somehow our system manages to kill that

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,520
in most people

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,759
so in school we make people do study and

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
do their things but not to pester them

58
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,239
by asking too many questions

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,239
and

60
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,679
i think

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,520
not just myself but i think it's typical

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,280
of scientists like myself that uh

63
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
have somehow escaped that maybe we're

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,000
still children or maybe we

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,719
somehow didn't get it beaten out of us

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,439
but

67
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,199
i think it's i teach in a college level

68
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,120
and it's to me

69
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,598
one of the biggest deficits is the lack

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,519
of curiosity if you want that we've

71
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,919
beaten out of them because i think it's

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,920
an innate human quality is there some

73
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,439
advice or insights you can give to how

74
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,919
to keep that flame of character i think

75
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,719
it's a problem of both parents and

76
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,639
and

77
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,120
the parents should be should realize

78
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,958
that's a great quality we have

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,200
that you're curious and that's good

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,239
instead we have we have expressions like

81
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,039
curiosity killed the cat

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,878
and

83
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,359
and uh

84
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,120
and more but i mean that basically it's

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,120
not not thought to be a good thing you

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,959
get curiosity killed the cat means if

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,439
you're too curious you get in trouble

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,080
and i don't like catholics anyway so

89
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,840
maybe it's a good thing yeah yeah

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,159
that to me needs to be solved really in

91
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,920
education and in homes it's a

92
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:33,120
realization that there's certain human

93
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,679
qualities that we should try to build on

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,959
and not destroy one of them is curiosity

95
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,799
anyway back to me in curiosity i was

96
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,199
passed and asked a lot of questions my

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,959
father generally could answer them

98
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,878
and at that age

99
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,719
and the first one i remember that he

100
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,719
couldn't answer

101
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,799
was

102
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,560
not a very original question but

103
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,120
basically that

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,840
ice is made out of water and so why does

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,000
it float on water

106
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,158
and

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,680
he couldn't answer it

108
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:06,798
and it may not have been the first

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,519
question it's the first one that i

110
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,560
remember and and that was the first time

111
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,200
that i realized that

112
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,759
to learn and answer your own curiosity

113
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,759
or questions there's various mechanisms

114
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,560
in this case it was going to the library

115
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
and

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,680
or asking people who know more and so

117
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,439
forth but

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,560
eventually you do it by what we call

119
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,000
research

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,199
but but it's um

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
driven by

122
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,919
if you're

123
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,520
hopefully you ask good questions if you

124
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,839
ask good questions and you have the

125
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,918
mechanism to solve them then you do what

126
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,638
i do in life basically not necessarily

127
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,639
physics but

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,478
and it's a great quality in humans and

129
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,199
we should nurture it

130
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,519
do you remember any other kind of in

131
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,319
high school maybe early college

132
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,839
more basic physics ideas

133
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,439
that sparked your curiosity or

134
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,000
mathematics or science engineering i

135
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,079
wasn't really into science

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
until i got to college to be honest with

137
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,399
you

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,720
but

139
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,079
just staying with water for a minute i

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,680
remember

141
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,120
that i

142
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,560
was curious

143
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
uh

144
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,038
why uh what happens to water you know it

145
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,960
rains and there's water in a wet

146
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,478
pavement and then the pavement dries out

147
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,159
what happened to this

148
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,839
water that came down

149
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,759
and i you know i didn't know that much

150
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,599
and then eventually i learned in

151
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,000
chemistry or something water is made out

152
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,240
of hydrogen and oxygen those are both

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,519
gases so how the heck does it make this

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,519
substance this liquid

155
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:39,120
[Laughter]

156
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,478
yeah so but so that has to do with

157
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,319
states of matter

158
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,478
you've uh i know

159
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,839
perhaps ligo and

160
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,240
the the thing for which you've gotten

161
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,560
the nobel prize and the things much of

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,478
your life work

163
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,280
perhaps was a happy accident in some

164
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,560
sense in the early days but is is there

165
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,478
a moment where you looked up to the

166
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,720
stars and also the same way you wondered

167
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,000
about water wandered about some of the

168
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,280
things that are out there in the

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,439
universe

170
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,399
oh yeah i think everybody's

171
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,079
looks and

172
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:12,000
is in awe and is curious about

173
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,599
what what it is out there and you know

174
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,959
and as i learned

175
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,840
more i learned

176
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,839
of course that we don't know very much

177
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,758
about what's there and the more we learn

178
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,478
the more we know we don't know i mean we

179
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,240
don't know what the majority of anything

180
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,478
is out there it's all

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
what we call dark matter a dark energy

182
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,478
and that's one of the big questions 20

183
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,639
year when i was a student those weren't

184
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,318
questions so we even know less in a

185
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,639
sense the more we

186
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,319
uh the more we look so

187
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,519
of course i think that's

188
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
one of the areas that

189
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,400
almost it's universal people see the sky

190
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,199
they see the stars and they're beautiful

191
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,279
and

192
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,080
and see it looks different on different

193
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,679
nights and it's a curiosity that we all

194
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,758
have

195
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,519
what are some questions about the

196
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,919
universe

197
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,120
that in the same way that you felt about

198
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:04,399
the ice

199
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,759
that today

200
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,159
you mentioned to me offline you're

201
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,400
teaching um a course on the frontiers of

202
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,000
science frontiers of physics yeah what

203
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,519
are some questions

204
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,959
outside the ones we'll probably talk

205
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:19,918
about that kind of

206
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,879
yeah fill you with uh

207
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,478
get your flame of curiosity up and uh

208
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,560
firing up

209
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,639
yeah you know fill you with all

210
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,800
well first i'm a physicist not an

211
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,120
astronomer so i'm interested in physical

212
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,918
the physical phenomenon really so

213
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,240
the question of of uh

214
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,478
dark matter and dark energy which we

215
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,519
probably won't talk about are rece or

216
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,279
recent their last 20 30 years or

217
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,079
certainly dark energy

218
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,000
dark energy is a complete puzzle

219
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,560
it goes against what i'll

220
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,720
will what you will ask me about which is

221
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,800
general relativity and einstein's

222
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
general relativity it basically takes

223
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,000
something that he thought was

224
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,198
what he what he called a constant which

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,959
isn't and

226
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,038
and uh

227
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,279
in the if that's even the right theory

228
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,719
and it represents most of

229
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,159
the universe

230
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,840
and then we have something called dark

231
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,599
matter and there's good reason to

232
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:20,560
believe it might be an exotic form of

233
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,439
particles um and that is something i've

234
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
always

235
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,519
worked on on particle accelerators and

236
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,000
so forth and it's a big puzzle what it

237
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,038
is it's a bit of a cottage industry and

238
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,120
that there's

239
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,838
lots and lots of searches

240
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,759
um but it may be a little bit like you

241
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,479
know looking for a treasure under rocks

242
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,158
or something you know it's hard to

243
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,360
we don't have really good guidance

244
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,599
except that

245
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,080
we have very very good

246
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,399
information that

247
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,759
it's pervasive and it's there

248
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,039
and that it's probably particles small

249
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,639
that the evidence is all of those things

250
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,360
but then the most

251
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,838
uh logical solution doesn't seem to work

252
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,440
something called supersymmetry

253
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,519
and

254
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,640
do you think the answer could be

255
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,440
something very complicated

256
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,039
you know i like to hope that think that

257
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,880
most things

258
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,439
that appear complicated are actually

259
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,639
simple if you really understand them

260
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,240
i think we just don't know at the

261
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,720
present time and it isn't something that

262
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,799
affects us it does affect it affects how

263
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,240
the stars go around each other and so

264
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,079
forth because we detect that there's

265
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,000
missing gravity but

266
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,320
uh but it doesn't affect

267
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,320
everyday life at all i tend to

268
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,959
think and

269
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,519
expect maybe and that the answers will

270
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,958
be simple we just haven't found it yet

271
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,560
do you think those answers might change

272
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,119
the way we see

273
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,479
other sources of gravity black holes

274
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,799
the way we see

275
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,959
the parts

276
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,240
of the universe that we do study it's

277
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,479
conceivable

278
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,600
the black holes that we've found in our

279
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,000
experiment and now we're trying now to

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,120
understand the origin of those

281
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,879
it's

282
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,720
conceivable but not

283
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,879
doesn't seem the most likely that they

284
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,200
were pre-primordial that is they were

285
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,958
made at the beginning and they in that

286
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,720
sense they could represent at least part

287
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,119
of the dark matter

288
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,879
so there can be connections dark

289
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,639
black holes or

290
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,360
how many there are how much of the mass

291
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,600
they encompass is still pretty primitive

292
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,800
we don't know so before i talk to you

293
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,360
more about black holes let me take a

294
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,240
step back to yeah i was actually went to

295
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,440
high school in chicago and would go to

296
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,799
uh take classes at fermi lab

297
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,480
uh watch the buffalo and so on yeah

298
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,559
so let me ask about you mentioned that

299
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,240
enrico for me was somebody who was

300
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,799
inspiring to you

301
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,759
in a certain kind of way um

302
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,479
why is that can you speak to that sure

303
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,639
he was amazing actually uh

304
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,000
he's the last

305
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,480
this is not the re i'll come to the

306
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,320
reason in a minute but the

307
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,360
he had a big influence on me at a young

308
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,760
age

309
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,879
he uh but he was the only the last

310
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,078
physicist

311
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,240
of note

312
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,639
that was both an experimental physicist

313
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,519
and a theorist at the same time

314
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,720
and he did two amazing things within

315
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,200
months

316
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,160
in 1933.

317
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,800
he

318
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:29,278
it was we didn't really know what the

319
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:32,000
nucleus was what uh

320
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:35,039
radioactive decay was what beta decay

321
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,399
was when electrons come out of

322
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,919
a nucleus

323
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,879
and in

324
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,439
nearly near the end of 1933

325
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,519
um he

326
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,040
the neutron had just been discovered and

327
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,278
that meant that we knew a little bit

328
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,439
more about what the nucleus is that it's

329
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:54,958
made out of neutrons and protons the

330
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,279
neutron wasn't discovered till 1932

331
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,759
and then once we discovered that there

332
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,600
was a neutron and proton and they made

333
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,838
the nucleus and then their electrons

334
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,959
would go around the basic ingredients

335
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,880
were there

336
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:11,278
and he uh wrote down not only just the

337
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,559
theory a theory but a theory that lasted

338
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,159
decades

339
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,838
and has only been

340
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,559
improved on

341
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,959
of beta decay that is the radio

342
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,719
radiation he did this

343
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,919
came out of nowhere and it was a

344
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,800
fantastic theory he submitted it to

345
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,838
nature

346
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,799
magazine which was the primary

347
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,000
play best place to publish even then

348
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,599
and it got rejected as being too

349
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,200
speculative

350
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,800
and so he went

351
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,839
back to his

352
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,799
drawing board in rome where he was

353
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,560
added some to it made it even longer

354
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,799
because it's really a classic article

355
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,278
and then published it in

356
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:56,639
the local italian

357
00:12:53,278 --> 00:13:01,200
journal for physics and the german one

358
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,360
at the same time in 19 january of 1932

359
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,440
giulio and curie for the first time

360
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,519
steve saw artificial radioactivity

361
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,760
this was an important discovery because

362
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,240
radioactivity had been discovered much

363
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,159
earlier and you know we'd they had

364
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,680
x-rays and you shouldn't be

365
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,078
using them but they there was

366
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,479
radioactivity people knew it was useful

367
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,799
for medicine

368
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,120
but radioactive materials are hard to

369
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,559
find and so it wasn't prevalent but if

370
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,720
you could make them

371
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,000
then they had great use and julio and

372
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,959
curie

373
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,039
were able to bombard

374
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,879
aluminum or something with alpha

375
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,679
particles and

376
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,600
find that they excited something that

377
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,679
decayed and gave

378
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,759
decayed and gate had some half-life and

379
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,879
so forth meaning it was artificial

380
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,120
version

381
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,039
or let's call it a not not a natural

382
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,919
version an induced version of

383
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,278
radioactive uh

384
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,198
materials

385
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,320
and uh

386
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,519
fermi

387
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,519
somehow

388
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,959
had the insight

389
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,839
and i still can't see where he got it

390
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,518
that the right way to follow that up was

391
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,519
not using

392
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,039
charged particles like alphas and so

393
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,320
forth but use use these newly discovered

394
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,319
neutrons as the bombarding particle

395
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,839
seemed impossible they barely had been

396
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,320
seen

397
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,639
it was hard to get very many of them

398
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,600
but it had the advantage that they don't

399
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,879
um they're not charged so they go right

400
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,560
into the

401
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,720
to the nucleus

402
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,039
and that turned out to be the

403
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,560
experimental work that he did that won

404
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,919
him the nobel prize

405
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,518
and it was the first step in fission

406
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:47,679
discovery of fission

407
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,480
and that's he did this two completely

408
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,159
different things an experiment that was

409
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,519
a great idea

410
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,679
and a

411
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,679
tremendous implementation because how do

412
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,120
you get enough neutrons

413
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,879
and then he learned

414
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,399
quickly that not only do you want

415
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,320
neutrons but you want really slow ones

416
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,320
he learned that experimentally and he

417
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,639
learned how to make slow ones and then

418
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,720
they were able to make go through the

419
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,159
periodic table and make

420
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,480
lots of

421
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,799
particles he missed on fission at the

422
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,278
moment but he had the basic information

423
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,519
and and then fission followed soon after

424
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,360
that forgive me for not knowing but is

425
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,720
the birth of the idea of bombarding with

426
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,199
new uh

427
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,680
neutrons

428
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,758
is that uh

429
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,359
is that an experimental idea was it born

430
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,759
out of an experiment you just observe

431
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,320
something or is this an einstein style

432
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,320
idea where you

433
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,720
took a combination because he realized

434
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,399
that neutrons had a characteristic that

435
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,879
would allow them to go all the way into

436
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,639
the nucleus when we didn't really

437
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,720
understand what the

438
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,959
you know what how what the structure was

439
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,000
of all this so that took

440
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,159
uh

441
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
an understanding or recognition of the

442
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,240
physics itself of how a neutron

443
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,360
interacts compared to say an alpha

444
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,159
particle that giulio and curie had used

445
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,199
and then he had to invent

446
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,519
a way to have enough neutrons and uh you

447
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,159
know what he had a team of

448
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,839
associates and he pulled it off

449
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,600
quite quickly so you know it's pretty

450
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,880
astounding and probably maybe you can

451
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,199
speak to it

452
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,039
his ability to put together

453
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,319
the engineering aspects of great

454
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,919
experiments

455
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,560
and doing the theory they probably fed

456
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,719
each other i wonder can you speak to why

457
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,479
we don't see more of that is that just

458
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,600
really difficult to do

459
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,800
it's difficult to do yeah i think in

460
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,839
in both theory and experiment in physics

461
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,000
anyway

462
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,079
was um

463
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,078
it was conceivable if you had an the

464
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,679
right person to do it and no one's been

465
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,638
able to do it since so i had the dream

466
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,479
that that

467
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,240
was what i was going to be like fermi

468
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,039
but so you love both sides of it the

469
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,799
theory yeah yeah i never liked the idea

470
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,959
that you did experiments without really

471
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,558
understanding the theory or the theory

472
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,759
should be related very closely to

473
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,439
experiments

474
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,038
and so i've always done

475
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,360
experimental work that was closely

476
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:16,879
related to the theoretical ideas

477
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,240
i think i told you i'm russian so i'm

478
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,319
going to ask some romantic questions but

479
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,240
is it tragic to you that

480
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,720
he's seen as the architect of the

481
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,558
nuclear age that some of his creations

482
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,000
led to potentially

483
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,399
some of his work

484
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,558
has has led to

485
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
potentially still the destruction of the

486
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,079
human species some of the most

487
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,840
destructive

488
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,199
weapons yeah

489
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,678
uh

490
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,000
but i think even more general than him i

491
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,559
i i gave you all the virtues of

492
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,160
curiosity a few minutes ago there's an

493
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,079
interesting book called the ratchet of

494
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,240
curiosity you know a ratchet is

495
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,199
something that goes in one direction

496
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,880
and that that it's written by a guy

497
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,640
who's probably a sociologist or

498
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,280
philosopher or something

499
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,360
and he he picks on this particular

500
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,519
problem but other ones and that is the

501
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,038
the danger of knowledge basically you

502
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,798
know you're curious

503
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,640
you learn something so it's a little bit

504
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,240
like curiosity killed the cat you have

505
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,280
to be worried about whether you can

506
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,279
handle

507
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,759
new information that you get so in this

508
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:22,960
case the new information had to do with

509
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:25,919
really understanding nuclear physics

510
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,600
and that information maybe we didn't

511
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,280
have the sophistication to know how to

512
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,959
keep it under control

513
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:38,079
yeah and fermi himself was

514
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,120
a very a political person so he wasn't

515
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:43,439
very driven by or or at least

516
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,199
he appears in all of his writing the

517
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,279
writing of his wife the interactions

518
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,279
that others had with him as either he

519
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,759
avoided it all or he was pretty

520
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:55,119
apolitical i mean he just saw the world

521
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:59,359
through kind of the lens of a scientist

522
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:01,839
but you asked if it's tragic uh

523
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:04,240
the bomb was tragic certainly on japan

524
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:07,439
and he had a role in that so i wouldn't

525
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,440
want it as my legacy for example

526
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,840
i mean that but broader to the human

527
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,759
species that

528
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,759
it's the ratchet of curiosity that we

529
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,038
uh

530
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,600
we do stuff just to see what happens

531
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,119
that that curiosity that uh in sort of

532
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,359
my area of artificial intelligence

533
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,519
that's been a concern

534
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,599
they're on a small scale on a silly

535
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:33,200
scale perhaps currently there's

536
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,599
constantly

537
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,880
unintended consequences you create a

538
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,879
system

539
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,120
and you put out there and you have

540
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,799
intuitions about how it will work you

541
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,399
have hopes how it will work but you put

542
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,798
it out there just to see what happens

543
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,480
yeah and uh in most cases because

544
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,200
artificial intelligence is currently not

545
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,798
super powerful it doesn't

546
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,000
create uh large-scale negative effects

547
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,918
but that same curiosity as it progresses

548
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,640
might lead to something that

549
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,960
destroys the human species and the same

550
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,038
may be true for bioengineering there's

551
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,640
people

552
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,599
that

553
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,038
you know engineer viruses to protect us

554
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,439
from viruses

555
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,879
to see you know how do uh how close is

556
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,798
this to mutating so it can jump to

557
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,919
humans or going you know or engineering

558
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,759
uh defenses against those

559
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,360
and it seems exciting and the

560
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,679
application the positive applications

561
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,119
are really exciting at this time but

562
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,480
we don't think about

563
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:36,558
how that runs away in decades to come

564
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,880
yeah and i think it's the same idea as

565
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,279
this little book the ratchet of

566
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,799
science the the

567
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:48,319
uh ratchet of curiosity i mean

568
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,200
whether you pursue take curiosity and

569
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,879
let

570
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,640
artificial intelligence or machine

571
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,080
learning run away with

572
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,919
having its

573
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,639
solutions to whatever you want or we do

574
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,679
it

575
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,720
it's i think a similar consequence

576
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,640
i think uh from what i've read about uh

577
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,279
enrico for me he

578
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,038
he became a little bit cynical about the

579
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,839
human species towards the end of his

580
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,119
life

581
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,720
both having observed what he observed

582
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,319
we didn't write much

583
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,240
i mean he died young he died soon after

584
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,480
the world war uh

585
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,359
there was already you know

586
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,000
the

587
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,839
work by teller to develop the hydrogen

588
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
bomb and i think he was a little cynical

589
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,798
of that you know pushing it even further

590
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,880
and

591
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,960
uh rising tensions between the soviet

592
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,360
union and the u.s and looked like an

593
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,919
endless thing so but he didn't say very

594
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:42,719
much but a little bit as you said yeah

595
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,600
there's a few clips to sort of uh maybe

596
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,519
picked on a bad mood but in in the sense

597
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,480
that uh almost like a sadness a

598
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,918
melancholy sadness to

599
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,919
um

600
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,400
a hope that waned a little bit about

601
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,520
that uh yeah perhaps we can do

602
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,679
like

603
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,119
the science this curious species can

604
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,640
find the way out

605
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,879
well especially i think people who

606
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,038
worked like he did at los alamos and

607
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,039
spent years of their life

608
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,359
somehow had to convince themselves that

609
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:13,919
dropping these bombs would bring

610
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,639
lasting peace and it didn't and that it

611
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,640
didn't yeah

612
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,000
as a small interesting aside it'd be

613
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,240
interesting to hear if you have opinions

614
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,880
on this his name is also attached to the

615
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,000
fermi paradox which asks if there's uh

616
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,200
you know with

617
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
it's a very interesting question which

618
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,880
is

619
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,120
if it does seem if you sort of reason

620
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,919
basically that there should be a lot of

621
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,599
alien civilizations out there if the

622
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,840
human species

623
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,558
if earth is not that unique

624
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,519
by

625
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,639
basic

626
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,400
no matter the values you pick

627
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,240
it's likely that there's a lot of alien

628
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,519
civilizations out there and if that's

629
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,798
the case

630
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,279
why have they

631
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,839
not at least obviously visited us or

632
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,720
sent us loud signals that everybody can

633
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,519
hear

634
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,240
fermi's quoted as saying sitting down at

635
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,519
lunch i think it was with

636
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,558
teller

637
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:13,519
and uh herb york who was kind of the one

638
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,200
of the fathers of the atomic bomb

639
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,798
and he sat down and he says something

640
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,600
like where are they

641
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:19,519
yeah

642
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,879
which meant where are these

643
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:21,918
other and

644
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,840
um

645
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,080
and then he did some

646
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,399
numerology where he

647
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,918
calculated you know how many what they

648
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,038
knew about how many

649
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,038
uh

650
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,038
galaxies there are and how many stars

651
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,119
and how many planets in are like the

652
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,400
earth and blah blah blah that's been

653
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,399
done much better by somebody named drake

654
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,519
and so people usually refer to the i

655
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,278
don't know whether it's called the drake

656
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,558
formula or something but it has the same

657
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,200
conclusion

658
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,558
the conclusion is it would be a miracle

659
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,038
if there weren't other

660
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:55,278
you know uh there's the statistics are

661
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,679
so high that how can we be singular and

662
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,679
separate

663
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:02,480
that so probably there is

664
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,480
but there's

665
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,480
almost certainly life somewhere

666
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,000
maybe there was even life on mars a

667
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,038
while back but

668
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,440
uh

669
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,240
intelligent life

670
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,159
probably why were we so so you know the

671
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,960
statistics say that communicating with

672
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,919
us

673
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,240
i think that it's harder than people

674
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,240
think

675
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,440
we might

676
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:30,839
not know the right way to

677
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,759
expect the communication

678
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:36,879
but all the communication that we know

679
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,119
about travels at the speed of light

680
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,799
and we do we don't we don't think

681
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,000
anything can go faster in the speed of

682
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,319
light that

683
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,599
limits the problem quite quite a bit and

684
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,319
it uh

685
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,639
makes it difficult to have any back and

686
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,480
forth communication you can send signals

687
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,640
like we try to or

688
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,798
look for but to have any communication

689
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,759
it's pretty hard when you it has to be

690
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,599
close enough that the speed of light

691
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,278
would mean we could communicate with

692
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,678
each other and i think

693
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,919
and we didn't even understand that i

694
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,480
mean it's an advanced civilization but

695
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,880
we didn't even understand that

696
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,960
a little more than 100 years ago

697
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,880
so uh

698
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,840
are we

699
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,840
just not advanced enough maybe

700
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,439
uh to know something about that's the

701
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,720
speed of light maybe there's some other

702
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,640
way to communicate that isn't based on

703
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:31,038
electromagnetism i don't i don't know

704
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,200
gravity seems to be also this have the

705
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,960
same speed that was a principle that

706
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,720
einstein had and something we've

707
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,200
measured actually

708
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,440
so is is it possible i mean so we'll

709
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,880
talk about gravitational waves and

710
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,120
it in some sense there's a

711
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,400
there's a brainstorming going on which

712
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,558
is like

713
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,159
how do we detect the signal like what

714
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:53,440
would a signal look like and how would

715
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,200
we detect and that's true for

716
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,519
gravitational waves that's true for

717
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,880
basically any physics phenomena

718
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,319
you have to predict that that signal

719
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,080
should exist you have to have some kind

720
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,720
of theory and model why that signal

721
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,639
should exist i mean is it possible that

722
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,720
aliens are communicating with us via

723
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,240
gravity

724
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,880
like why not well it it

725
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,440
yeah it's true why not uh

726
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,600
for us it's very hard to detect these

727
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,120
gravitational effects they have to come

728
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,719
from something

729
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,319
pretty that has a lot of gravity like

730
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,038
black holes but we're pretty primitive

731
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,038
at this stage

732
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,400
there's uh

733
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,558
very reputable physicists that look for

734
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,640
a fifth force

735
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,720
one that we haven't found yet maybe it's

736
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,640
the key so you know

737
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,558
it's what would that look like what

738
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,320
would a fifth force of physics look like

739
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,798
exactly well usually they think it's

740
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,720
probably a long range for longer range

741
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,679
force than we have now

742
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
um

743
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,360
but uh

744
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,360
they're reputable for colleagues of mine

745
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:00,158
that spend their life looking for a

746
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,038
fifth force so longer range than gravity

747
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,200
yeah

748
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,440
super it doesn't fall off like one over

749
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,480
r squared but maybe

750
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,759
separately

751
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,640
gravity

752
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,400
uh newton taught us goes like inversely

753
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,240
one over the square of the distance

754
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,679
apart you are so it falls pretty fast

755
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,278
that's okay so now we have a theory of

756
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,120
what consciousness is it's just the

757
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,440
fifth force of

758
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,119
physics yeah there we go that's a good

759
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,360
hypothesis

760
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,359
uh

761
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:32,000
speaking of gravity uh of gravity uh

762
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,240
what are gravitational waves let's maybe

763
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,119
start from the basics

764
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,759
we learned gravity from newton

765
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,599
right you you and you were young you

766
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,759
were told that if you jumped up the

767
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:47,038
earth pulled you down

768
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:49,679
and when the apple falls out of the tree

769
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,839
the earth pulls it down

770
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,278
and maybe you even asked your teacher

771
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,558
why but

772
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,200
most of us

773
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,879
accepted that that was newton's

774
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,120
picture the apple falling out of the

775
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,159
tree but newton's theory never told you

776
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:08,158
why the apple was attracted to the earth

777
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,080
that was a missing in newton's theory

778
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,159
newton's theory also

779
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,000
newton recognized at least one of the

780
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,520
two problems i'll tell you one of them

781
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,359
is there's more than those but one is

782
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,639
why does the earth what's the mechanism

783
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,119
by which

784
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,679
the earth pulls the apple or holds the

785
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,918
moon when it goes around whatever it is

786
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,919
uh that's not explained by newton even

787
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,159
though he has the most successful theory

788
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,000
of physics ever went 200 and some years

789
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,640
with nobody ever seeing

790
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,480
a violation but he accurately describes

791
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,960
the movement of an object falling down

792
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,038
to earth but he's not answering why that

793
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,519
what's yeah yeah because it's a distance

794
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:48,558
he gives a formula right which which

795
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,079
it's the product of the earth's mass the

796
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,918
apple's mass

797
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,319
inversely proportional to the square the

798
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,960
distance between and then the strength

799
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:59,200
he called capital g the strength he

800
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,880
couldn't determine but it was determined

801
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,038
100 years later

802
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,840
but no one ever saw a violation of this

803
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:08,158
until a possible violation which

804
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,079
einstein fixed which was very small that

805
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,360
has to do with mercury going around the

806
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,678
sun

807
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,918
the orbit being slightly

808
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,679
wrong if you calculated by

809
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,679
newton's theory

810
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,038
but so

811
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,399
um like most theories then in in physics

812
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,519
you can have a wonderful one like

813
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:29,439
newton's theory it isn't wrong

814
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,918
but you have to have a

815
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,960
an improvement on it to answer things

816
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,679
that it can't answer and in this case

817
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,440
einstein's theory is the next step we

818
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,240
don't know if it's

819
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,159
anything like a final theory or even the

820
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,359
only way to formulate it

821
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,760
either

822
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,879
but he formulated this theory

823
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,000
which

824
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,520
which he

825
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,359
released in 1915

826
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,319
he took 10 years to develop but even

827
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,759
though in 1905 he solved three or four

828
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,519
of the most important problems in

829
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,679
physics in a matter of months and then

830
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,480
he spent 10 years on this problem before

831
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,399
he

832
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,440
uh let it out and it's called general

833
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:12,319
relativity it's a new theory of gravity

834
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,399
1915 in 1916

835
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,639
einstein

836
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:18,879
wrote a little paper

837
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,080
where he

838
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,720
did not do some fancy derivation instead

839
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,720
he did

840
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
what i would call it used his intuition

841
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:35,119
which he was very good at too

842
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,519
and that is he noticed that if he formed

843
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,000
if he wrote the formulas for general

844
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,240
relativity in a particular way

845
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,599
they looked a lot like the formulas for

846
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,599
electricity and magnetism

847
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:51,038
being einstein he then took the leap

848
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:53,200
that electricity and magnetism we

849
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,119
discovered only 20 years before that in

850
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,759
the 1880s

851
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,918
have waves of course that's

852
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:02,240
light and electromagnetic rays radio

853
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,720
waves everything else so he said if the

854
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,319
formulas look similar

855
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,240
then gravity probably has ways too

856
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,839
that's such a big leap by the way i mean

857
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,359
maybe you can correct me but that just

858
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,439
seems

859
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,759
so that seems like a heck of a look yeah

860
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,399
and so that and it was considered to be

861
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,919
a heck of a leap so first that paper was

862
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,759
except for this

863
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,799
intuition was

864
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,919
uh

865
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:30,158
poorly written had had a serious mistake

866
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,159
it had the a factor of two wrong and the

867
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,320
strength of gravity which meant if we

868
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,240
use those formulas we would

869
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,918
and

870
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,079
two years later

871
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,399
he wrote a second paper

872
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,720
and in that paper it turns out to be

873
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,719
important for us because in that paper

874
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,200
he not only

875
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,759
fixed his factor of two mistake which he

876
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,759
never admitted he just wrote it fixed it

877
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,519
like he always did and

878
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:56,640
and then he

879
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,720
told us

880
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,960
how you make gravitational waves what

881
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,759
what makes gravitational waves

882
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,558
and

883
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,480
you might recall in electromagnetism we

884
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,319
make electromagnetic waves in a simple

885
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,480
way you take a plus charge and minus

886
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,639
charge you oscillate like this and that

887
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,798
makes electromagnetic waves

888
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,559
and a physicist named hertz

889
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,879
made a receiver that could detect the

890
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,480
waves and put in the next room

891
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,120
he saw them and moved forward and

892
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,720
backward and saw that it was wave-like

893
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,518
so

894
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,600
einstein said it won't be a dipole like

895
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,720
that it'll be a four-pole thing and

896
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,639
that's what

897
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,519
it's called a quadrupole moment that

898
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,200
gives the gravitational wave so he saw

899
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,120
that again by insight not by derivation

900
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,600
that's at the table for what you needed

901
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,959
to do to do it at the same time in the

902
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,639
same year schwartz child not einstein

903
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,798
said there were things like called black

904
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,440
holes so it's interesting that that came

905
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,599
the same so what year was that

906
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,519
2015.

907
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:58,879
it was in parallel

908
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,480
with i did

909
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,919
i should probably know this but did i

910
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,159
say not have any intuition that there

911
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,919
should be such things as black holes

912
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,200
that came from schwarzschild oh

913
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,000
interesting

914
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,720
yeah

915
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,519
so schwartz child who was a

916
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,679
a german theoretical physicist he got

917
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,480
killed in the war i think in the first

918
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,519
world war a year two years later

919
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,519
or so

920
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,880
he's the one that proposed black holes

921
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,200
that there were black holes it feels

922
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,960
like a natural conclusion of uh general

923
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,130
relativity you know

924
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,360
or is that uh

925
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,960
[Music]

926
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,959
well it may seem like it but i don't

927
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,640
know about a natural conclusion it is a

928
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,120
it's a result

929
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,960
of curved space time though right and

930
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,518
it's but it's such a weird result that

931
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,679
you might have to uh yeah it's a special

932
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,679
yeah it's a special case yeah

933
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,919
so um

934
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,919
i i don't know anyway

935
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,399
einstein then the interesting part of

936
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,559
the story is that einstein then left the

937
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,839
problem most physicists because it

938
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,720
really wasn't uh derived he just made

939
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,480
this

940
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,079
didn't pick up on it or general

941
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,599
relativity much because quantum

942
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,720
mechanics became the thing in physics

943
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,159
and

944
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,199
einstein

945
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,119
uh

946
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,118
only picked up this problem again after

947
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,358
he immigrated to the u.s so he came to

948
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,119
the u.s in 1932

949
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:21,119
and i think in 1934-5

950
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,039
he was working with another physicist

951
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,358
called rosen who he did several

952
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,800
important works with and they revisited

953
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,799
the question

954
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,760
and they

955
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,760
had a problem that most of us as

956
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,839
students always had that study general

957
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,679
relativity general relativity is really

958
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,918
hard because it's four-dimensional

959
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,800
instead of three-dimensional and if you

960
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,960
don't set it up right you get infinities

961
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,280
which don't belong there the we call

962
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,480
them coordinates singularities

963
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,159
as a name

964
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,760
but it but if you get these infinities

965
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,159
you don't get the answers you want and

966
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,440
he was trying to derive now general

967
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,920
relativity out from general relativity

968
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,240
gravitational waves and in doing it he

969
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,599
kept getting these infinities

970
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:09,519
and so he wrote a paper with rosen that

971
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,359
he submitted to

972
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,039
our most important journal physical

973
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,880
review letters

974
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,960
and

975
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,599
that when it was submitted to physical

976
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,838
review letters it was entitled do

977
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,000
gravitational waves exist

978
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,400
a very funny title to write 20 years

979
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,719
after he proposed they exist

980
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,760
but it's because he had found these

981
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:34,239
singularities these infinities

982
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,240
and so

983
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,480
the

984
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,399
editor at that time and the part of it

985
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,679
that i don't know

986
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,920
is peer review we live and die by peer

987
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:47,759
review as scientists send our stuff out

988
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,599
and it's we don't know when peer review

989
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,400
actually started

990
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,559
or what what peer review einstein ever

991
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,639
experienced before this time but the

992
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,799
editor of physical review sent this out

993
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,400
for review

994
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,440
he had a choice he could take any

995
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,519
article and just accept it he could

996
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,599
reject it or he could send it for review

997
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,920
right i believe the editors used to have

998
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,720
much more power yeah yeah and he was a

999
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,358
young man his name was tate and he ended

1000
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:18,078
up being an editor for years but

1001
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,920
so he sent this for review

1002
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,000
to

1003
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,079
a theoretical physicist named robertson

1004
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,400
who was also in this field of general

1005
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,960
relativity who happened to be on

1006
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,960
sabbatical at that moment at caltech

1007
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,920
otherwise his institution was princeton

1008
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,679
where

1009
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,280
einstein was

1010
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:38,159
and he

1011
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,040
saw that the way they set up the problem

1012
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,799
the infinities were like i might get as

1013
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,320
a student because if you don't set it up

1014
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,200
right in general relativity you get

1015
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,400
these

1016
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,679
infinities

1017
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,680
and so he reviewed the article and told

1018
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:53,199
he gave an illustration that they set it

1019
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,799
up in what are called cylindrical

1020
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:58,319
coordinates these infinities went away

1021
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,680
he's the

1022
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,680
editor of

1023
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,919
uh physical review was obviously

1024
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,759
intimidated by einstein he wrote this

1025
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,000
really not not a letter back like i

1026
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,000
would get saying you know you're screwed

1027
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,480
up in your paper instead

1028
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,300
it was kind of uh

1029
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,440
what do you think of the comments of our

1030
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,039
[Laughter]

1031
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,039
referee einstein wrote back and it's a

1032
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,920
well documented letter wrote back a

1033
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:26,159
letter to physical review saying

1034
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,760
i didn't send you the paper

1035
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,239
to send it to one of your so-called

1036
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,000
experts i sent it to you to publish

1037
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:36,239
i now i withdraw the paper

1038
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and he never published again in the in

1039
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:41,358
that journal that was 1936 instead

1040
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,280
he

1041
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,358
rewrote it

1042
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,560
with the fixes that were made changed

1043
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:48,960
the title

1044
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,679
and published it in what was called the

1045
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,039
franklin review which is the

1046
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:57,440
uh franklin institute in philadelphia uh

1047
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,599
which is benjamin franklin institute

1048
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,440
which doesn't have a journal now but

1049
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,280
did at that time so the article is

1050
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,559
published it's the last time he ever

1051
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,720
wrote about it

1052
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,440
it remained controversial

1053
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:12,959
so it wasn't until

1054
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,920
close to 1960 1958 where there was a

1055
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,119
conference in which brought that brought

1056
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,400
together

1057
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,838
the

1058
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,320
experts in general relativity to try to

1059
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,000
sort out whether there was uh

1060
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,960
um

1061
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,079
whether

1062
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,079
it was true that there were

1063
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,280
gravitational waves or not

1064
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:36,480
and there was a very nice

1065
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,599
derivation by a british

1066
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,719
theorist

1067
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,880
from

1068
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,799
the heart of the theory that gets

1069
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,039
gravitational waves

1070
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,720
uh and that was number one the second

1071
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,960
thing that happened at that meeting is

1072
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,480
richard feynman was there

1073
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,199
and feynman

1074
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,199
said well if there's a typical feynman

1075
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,358
if there's gravitational waves they need

1076
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,279
to be able to do something otherwise

1077
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:02,159
they don't exist so they have to be able

1078
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,480
to transfer energy so he made a

1079
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,399
idea of a gadonkan experiment that is

1080
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,400
just a bar

1081
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,480
with a couple rings on it

1082
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,838
and then if a gravitational wave goes

1083
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,920
through it distorts the bar

1084
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:17,119
that creates friction on these little

1085
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,440
rings

1086
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,680
and that's heat and that's energy so

1087
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,599
that that meant is that a good idea that

1088
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:26,078
sounds like a good idea yeah it means

1089
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,240
that he showed that

1090
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,400
with the distortion of space-time you

1091
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,799
could transfer energy just by this

1092
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,200
little idea and it was shown

1093
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,599
theoretically so at that point

1094
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,598
it was

1095
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,000
believed theoretically then by

1096
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,519
people that gravitational waves should

1097
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,519
exist

1098
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,599
no and we should be able to detect them

1099
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,000
we should be able to detect them except

1100
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,480
except that they're very very small

1101
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,760
just so what kind of uh there's a bunch

1102
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,280
of questions there but what kind of

1103
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,880
events

1104
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,800
would generate

1105
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,519
gravitational waves you have to have

1106
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,720
this what i call quadrupole moment that

1107
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:07,119
comes about if i have uh

1108
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,838
for for example two objects that go

1109
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,920
around each other like this like the

1110
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,000
earth or the earth around the sun or the

1111
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,838
moon around the earth or in our case it

1112
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
turns out to be two black holes going

1113
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:19,679
around each other like this so how's

1114
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,599
that different than basic oscillation

1115
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:23,919
back and forth this is just more common

1116
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,119
in nature oscillation is a dipole moment

1117
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,880
so it has to be in three-dimensional

1118
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,000
space yeah kind of oscillations so you

1119
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,079
have to have something that's

1120
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,599
three-dimensional that'll give what's

1121
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,519
what i call the quadrupole moment that's

1122
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,280
just built into this and luckily in

1123
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,358
nature you have stuff

1124
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,519
and luckily things exist

1125
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:42,078
and it is luckily because the effect is

1126
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:44,318
so small that you could say look i can

1127
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,359
take a barbell

1128
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:48,159
and

1129
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,400
and spin it right and detect the

1130
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,799
gravitational waves but unfortunately no

1131
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,119
matter how much i spin it how fast i

1132
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,599
spin it it's so i know how to make

1133
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,280
gravitational waves but they're so weak

1134
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,440
i can't detect them so we have to take

1135
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,519
something that's stronger than i can

1136
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,599
make otherwise we would do what hertz

1137
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,480
did for electromagnetic waves go in our

1138
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,720
lab

1139
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,159
take a barbell put it on something spin

1140
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:14,318
it ask a dumb question so a uh a single

1141
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,480
object that's weirdly shaped does that

1142
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,800
generate gravitational waves so if it's

1143
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,599
if it's rotating

1144
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,160
sure

1145
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,079
it it was just much weaker

1146
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,318
it's weaker well we didn't know what the

1147
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,359
strongest signal would be that we would

1148
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:29,358
see

1149
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:31,279
uh we targeted seeing something called

1150
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,039
neutron stars actually because black

1151
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,640
holes we don't know very much about it

1152
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,800
turned out we were a little bit lucky

1153
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,358
there was a stronger source which was

1154
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,440
the black holes well another ridiculous

1155
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,920
question so

1156
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,318
you say waves what is what does a wave

1157
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,159
mean like

1158
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:51,039
the most ridiculous version of that

1159
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:54,000
question is what does it feel like

1160
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:56,400
to uh ride a wave as you get closer to

1161
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,039
the source

1162
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,519
or experience it well if you experience

1163
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,039
a wave imagine that this is what happens

1164
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,480
to you

1165
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,960
i don't know what you mean about getting

1166
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,599
close it comes to you so it's like it's

1167
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,960
like uh this light wave or something

1168
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,160
that comes through you so when the light

1169
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,720
hits you it

1170
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:17,838
makes your eyes detected

1171
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:20,799
i flashed it what does this do is

1172
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:22,719
it's like going to the amusement park

1173
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,640
and they have these mirrors you look in

1174
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,318
this mirror and you look short and fat

1175
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,279
and the one next to you makes you tall

1176
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:28,079
and thin

1177
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,640
okay

1178
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,440
imagine that you went back and forth

1179
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,199
between those two mirrors once a second

1180
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,119
that would be a gravitational wave with

1181
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,519
a period of once a second

1182
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,039
uh if you did it 60 times a second go

1183
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:42,639
back and forth and

1184
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,880
and then that's all that happens it

1185
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:47,679
makes you taller and shorter and fatter

1186
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,440
back and forth as it goes through you

1187
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,960
at the frequency of the gravitational

1188
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,039
wave so

1189
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,519
the frequencies that we detect are

1190
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:59,358
higher than one a second but that's the

1191
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:01,759
idea so but uh and the amount is small

1192
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:04,318
amount is small but when if you're

1193
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,880
closer to the

1194
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,239
to the source of the wave is it the same

1195
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,960
amount

1196
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:13,358
yeah it's it doesn't dissipate it

1197
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,880
doesn't dissipate

1198
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,920
okay so it's not that fun of an

1199
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,640
amusement ride well it it does dissipate

1200
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,639
but it doesn't it doesn't it's it's just

1201
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,279
it's proportional to the distance right

1202
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,838
it's not uh it's not a big power right

1203
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,519
gotcha so but so

1204
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,838
it would be a fun ride if you get a

1205
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,079
little bit closer or a lot closer

1206
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,000
i mean like i i wonder what the

1207
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,079
this is a ridiculous question but i have

1208
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,760
you here

1209
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,839
like the getting fatter and taller

1210
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,680
i mean that experience

1211
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,559
for some reason that's mind-blowing to

1212
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,159
me

1213
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,799
it brings

1214
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:54,879
the distortion of space-time to you

1215
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,200
i mean space-time is being morphed

1216
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,480
right like this is a way right

1217
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:03,199
that how that's so weird and we're in

1218
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,719
space so yeah we're in space and it's

1219
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,159
moving

1220
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,480
i don't know what to do with it i mean

1221
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,639
does it okay um

1222
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,440
how much do you think about the

1223
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:15,598
philosophical implications of

1224
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,119
general relativity like that we're in

1225
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,200
space time

1226
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,200
and it can be bent by gravity

1227
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,720
like

1228
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,318
is that just what it is are we are we

1229
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:27,919
supposed to be okay with this

1230
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:29,599
because like newton

1231
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,440
even newton is a little weird right but

1232
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,039
that at least like makes sense that's

1233
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,200
our physical world

1234
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,400
you know when an apple falls it makes

1235
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:39,358
sense

1236
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,280
but like the fact that entirety of

1237
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:44,880
the space time we're in can bend

1238
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,839
well that's uh

1239
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,838
that's i that's really mind-blowing

1240
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:51,279
let me make another analogy this is a

1241
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:54,000
therapy session for me at this point

1242
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,880
right another analogy thank you so so

1243
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,400
imagine you have a trampoline yes

1244
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,000
okay

1245
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,039
what happens if you put a marble on a

1246
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,679
trampoline it doesn't do anything right

1247
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,679
no just saves a little bit but not much

1248
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:09,199
yeah i mean just if i drop it it's not

1249
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,960
going to go anywhere

1250
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,598
now imagine i put a bowling ball at the

1251
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,400
center of the trampoline

1252
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,318
now

1253
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,960
i come up to the trampoline and put a

1254
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:21,440
marble on what happens

1255
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,760
they'll roll towards the bowling ball

1256
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,679
all right so what's happened is the

1257
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,880
presence of this

1258
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:30,639
massive object distorted the space

1259
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,358
that the trampoline did

1260
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:36,159
this is the same thing that happens to

1261
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:38,000
the presence of the earth

1262
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:40,159
the earth and the apple the presence of

1263
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,599
the earth affects the space around it

1264
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:44,239
just like the

1265
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,680
uh bowling ball on the trampoline yeah

1266
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,279
this doesn't make me feel better i'm

1267
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,159
referring from the perspective of an

1268
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,440
aunt

1269
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,239
walking around on that trampoline

1270
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,280
then

1271
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,879
some guy just dropped the ball and not

1272
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,440
only dropped the ball right it's not

1273
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,079
just dropping a bowling ball it's making

1274
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,400
the the ball go up and down

1275
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,400
or doing some kind of oscillation thing

1276
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,318
where it's like waves

1277
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,240
and that's so fundamentally different

1278
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:12,318
from the experience on being on flat

1279
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,719
land and walking around and just finding

1280
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:16,559
delicious sweet things as ant does and

1281
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:19,039
just it just feels like to me from a

1282
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,279
human experience perspective

1283
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:22,800
completely it's humbling it's truly

1284
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,400
humbling

1285
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,800
it's something but we see that kind of

1286
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,440
phenomenon all the time

1287
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,119
let me give you another example imagine

1288
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,880
that you walk up to a

1289
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,400
a still pond

1290
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,519
yes okay

1291
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,358
now i throw

1292
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,199
it you like to throw you throw a rock in

1293
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,358
it what happens

1294
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,759
the rock goes in sinks to the bottom

1295
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:46,159
fine and these little ripples go out

1296
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,400
yeah and they travel

1297
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,159
out that's exactly what happens i mean

1298
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,838
there's a disturbance

1299
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,559
which is the safe

1300
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:57,199
the bowling ball or our black holes and

1301
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,759
then the ripples that go out in the

1302
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,919
water they're not they don't have any

1303
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,319
they don't have the rock any part pieces

1304
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,960
of the rock i see the thing is i guess

1305
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:10,000
what's not disturbing about that

1306
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,440
is it's a i mean it's a i guess a flat

1307
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,719
two-dimensional surface that's being

1308
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,400
disturbed

1309
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:18,959
like for a three-dimensional surface a

1310
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,960
three-dimensional space to be disturbed

1311
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,800
feels weird it's even worse it's

1312
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,800
four-dimensional because it's space and

1313
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,880
time yeah

1314
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,318
so that's why you need einstein is to

1315
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,559
make it uh

1316
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,558
four-dimensional no

1317
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,400
to make it four-dimensional yeah yeah

1318
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:35,200
it's gonna take the same phenomenon and

1319
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,318
and

1320
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:40,799
look at it in all of space and time

1321
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:43,358
anyway luckily

1322
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,519
for you and i and all of us

1323
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:47,598
the amount of distortion is incredibly

1324
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,039
small

1325
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,680
so it turns out

1326
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,759
that if you think of space

1327
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:55,598
itself now this is going to blow your

1328
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,640
mind too if you think of space as being

1329
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,240
like a material like this table

1330
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,920
it's very stiff you know we have

1331
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:03,679
materials that are very pliable

1332
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,480
materials that are very stiff

1333
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,480
so

1334
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,318
space itself is very stiff

1335
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,480
so when gravitational waves come through

1336
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:13,679
it luckily for us it doesn't distort it

1337
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,159
so much that it affects our ordinary

1338
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,838
life very much

1339
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,118
no i mean that's great

1340
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:20,719
that's great i thought there was

1341
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,720
something bad coming no this is great

1342
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:26,558
that's great news so i mean that i mean

1343
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,439
perhaps we evolved as the life on earth

1344
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,280
do we

1345
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,760
so to be such that for us this

1346
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,359
particular set of uh effects of

1347
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,559
gravitational waves

1348
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:38,880
uh is not that significant maybe maybe

1349
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,839
that's why you probably used

1350
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,680
this effect today

1351
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:46,318
or yesterday

1352
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:49,440
so it's it's pervasive well you mean

1353
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,440
gravity or the way the external

1354
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,480
because i only curvature of space

1355
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,159
curvature of space how i only care

1356
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,000
personally as a human right the gravity

1357
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:03,039
of earth but you use it every day almost

1358
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,239
oh it's curving uh-huh no no no it's in

1359
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,800
this thing

1360
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:07,598
every time it tells you where you are

1361
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,760
yeah

1362
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,200
it how does it tell you where you are

1363
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,520
it tells you where you are because we

1364
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:16,639
have 24 satellites or some number that

1365
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:19,280
are going around in space and it

1366
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,239
asks how long it takes the

1367
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,480
being

1368
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,719
to go to the satellite and come back the

1369
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,280
signal to different ones and then it

1370
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,639
triangulates and tells you where you are

1371
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,880
and then if you go down the road it

1372
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:32,719
tells you where you are do you know that

1373
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,119
if you did that with the satellites and

1374
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,919
you didn't use einstein's equations oh

1375
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,440
no

1376
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,920
you want it you won't get the right

1377
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,639
answer that's right and

1378
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,720
in fact if you take a road let's say 10

1379
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:46,558
meters wide i've done these numbers and

1380
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,879
you ask how long you'd stay on the road

1381
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,920
if you didn't make the correction

1382
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,760
for

1383
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,240
general relativity this thing you're poo

1384
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,599
pooing because you're using every day

1385
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:57,118
uh you'd go off the road and you'd go

1386
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,480
the middle road well actually that might

1387
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,240
be so you use it so so well

1388
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,920
well i think i'm using an android so

1389
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,000
maybe and the gps doesn't work that well

1390
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,358
so maybe i'm using newton's physics uh

1391
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,318
so i need to upgrade to general

1392
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:12,960
relativity um so

1393
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:15,920
gravitational waves and einstein

1394
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,079
had uh wait fireman really does have a

1395
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,400
part in the story was that one of the

1396
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,720
first kind of experimental pro

1397
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,400
proposed detect gravitation well he did

1398
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,399
what we call a gadonkan experiment

1399
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,838
that's a thought experience okay not a

1400
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,760
real experiment but then after that

1401
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:34,000
then people believe gravitational waves

1402
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,839
must exist you can kind of calculate how

1403
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,960
big they are there's tiny

1404
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:38,880
and so

1405
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,599
people started searching the first idea

1406
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,800
that was used was feynman's idea

1407
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,079
and the

1408
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,318
very end of it

1409
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,880
and it was to take a great big

1410
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:51,358
huge bar of aluminum

1411
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,800
and then put around and it's a it's made

1412
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,880
like a cylinder

1413
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,359
and then put around it some very very

1414
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,880
sensitive detectors so that if a

1415
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,519
gravitational wave happened to go

1416
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,920
through it it would go

1417
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,800
and you detect this extra strain that

1418
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,838
was there and that was this method that

1419
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,160
was used until we came along it wasn't a

1420
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:14,480
very good method to use

1421
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:16,078
and what was the

1422
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,480
so we're talking about a pretty weak

1423
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,800
signal here yeah that's why that method

1424
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,440
didn't work so what can you tell the

1425
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,480
story of figuring out what kind of

1426
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,400
method would be able to detect

1427
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,079
this very weak signal of gravitational

1428
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,280
waves

1429
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,800
so

1430
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,200
remembering the

1431
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,440
remembering what happens if you when you

1432
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:39,598
go to the amusement park yeah that it's

1433
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,599
going to do something like

1434
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,160
stretch this way and squash that way

1435
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,440
squash this way and stretch this way we

1436
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,279
do have an

1437
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,240
instrument that can detect that kind of

1438
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,960
thing

1439
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,639
it's called an interferometer

1440
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:57,039
and what it does

1441
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:58,879
is it just basically takes usually light

1442
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,199
and the two directions that we're

1443
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,200
talking about you send light down one

1444
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,838
direction and the perpendicular

1445
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:08,318
direction and if

1446
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:10,719
nothing changes it takes the same and

1447
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,960
the arms are the same length it just

1448
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:14,879
goes down bounces back

1449
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,639
and if you invert one compared to the

1450
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,680
other they cancel so there's nothing

1451
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:18,558
happens

1452
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:20,558
but

1453
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,040
if it's like the amusement park and one

1454
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,119
of the arms got you know got shorter and

1455
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,558
fatter so it took longer to go

1456
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,960
horizontally than it did to go

1457
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,920
vertically then when they come back when

1458
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,760
when the

1459
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,880
light comes back that comes back

1460
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,319
somewhat

1461
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,880
out of time

1462
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:40,079
and that basically is the scheme

1463
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,480
the only problem is that that's not

1464
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,880
a very done very accurately

1465
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,199
in general and we had to do it extremely

1466
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,760
accurately so what uh

1467
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:50,558
what what's the what's the difficulty of

1468
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,119
uh

1469
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,760
doing so accurately okay

1470
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,720
so the the measurement that we have to

1471
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,880
do

1472
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:01,679
is the distortion in time

1473
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,318
how big is it one it's a distortion

1474
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:07,519
that's one part and 10 to the 21 that's

1475
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:09,679
21 zeros and a one

1476
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:12,800
okay wow and this so this is like a

1477
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:15,039
delay in the thing coming back

1478
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,119
uh it's a one of them coming back after

1479
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:20,318
the other one but the difference is just

1480
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:23,200
one part and 10 to the 21.

1481
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:25,519
so for that reason we make it big

1482
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:28,719
let it let the arms be long

1483
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:31,440
okay so one part and 10 to the 21.

1484
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:33,118
in our case it's kilometers long so we

1485
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,200
have an instrument that kilometers in

1486
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,559
one direction kilometers in the other

1487
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,480
kilometers we're talking about four

1488
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,079
kilometers four kilometers in each

1489
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,199
direction

1490
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,440
uh

1491
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,919
if you take then one part and 10 to the

1492
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,720
21 we're talking about measuring

1493
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:53,039
something to

1494
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,039
10 to the minus 18 meters

1495
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:58,000
okay

1496
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,880
now to tell you how small that is yeah

1497
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,119
the proton yeah the thing we're made of

1498
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,440
that you can't go and grab so easily is

1499
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,559
10 to the minus 15 meters

1500
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:12,079
so this is 1 1000 the size of a proton

1501
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:14,079
that's the effect size of the effect

1502
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,400
einstein himself didn't think this could

1503
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,559
be measured have we ever seen

1504
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,559
actually he said that

1505
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,519
but that's because he didn't

1506
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:27,200
you know anticipate modern lasers and

1507
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:28,079
and techniques that we developed

1508
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:29,199
okay

1509
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,960
so

1510
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,480
maybe can you tell me

1511
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,119
a little bit what you're referring to is

1512
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,599
ligo the laser uh interferometer

1513
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,358
gravitational wave observatory

1514
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,039
what is ligo

1515
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:42,558
can you just elaborate kind of the big

1516
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,440
picture of you here before i ask you

1517
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,760
specific questions about it yeah so

1518
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,960
in the same idea that i just said we

1519
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,359
have

1520
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,400
two long vacuum

1521
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:53,598
pipes

1522
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,880
10 to

1523
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:59,280
4 kilometers long okay

1524
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,480
we start with a laser beam and we divide

1525
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,798
the beam

1526
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,719
going down the two arms

1527
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:06,400
and we have a mirror at the other end

1528
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:09,519
reflects it back

1529
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,798
it's more subtle but we bring it back

1530
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,639
if there's

1531
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,318
no distortion in space-time and the

1532
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,000
lengths are exactly the same which we

1533
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,960
calibrate them to be

1534
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,719
then when it comes back if we just

1535
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,159
invert one signal compared to the other

1536
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:23,919
they'll just cancel

1537
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:24,798
so we see nothing

1538
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,639
okay

1539
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:28,079
but if one arm got a little bit longer

1540
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:29,759
than the other

1541
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,760
then they don't come back at exactly the

1542
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,839
same time they don't exactly cancel

1543
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,559
that's what we

1544
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:35,440
measure

1545
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,280
so

1546
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,798
to give a number to it

1547
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,920
we have to do that

1548
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:40,880
to

1549
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,880
we have

1550
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:46,240
the change of length to be able to do

1551
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,640
this 10 to the minus 18 meters to one

1552
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:52,399
part in 10 to the 12th and that was the

1553
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,400
big experimental challenge that

1554
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:57,358
required a lot of innovation to be able

1555
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,440
to do

1556
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:01,119
what you gave a lot of credit to i think

1557
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,119
caltech and mit for some of the

1558
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,240
technical developments like within this

1559
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,079
project

1560
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:07,358
is there some interesting things you can

1561
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,640
speak to

1562
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,119
like

1563
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:13,920
at the low level of some cool stuff that

1564
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,400
had to be solved like what are we yeah

1565
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,159
i'm a software engineer so okay all of

1566
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,760
this i have so much more respect for

1567
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,558
everything done here than anything i've

1568
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,720
ever done so it's just code so

1569
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:28,559
so i'll give you

1570
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:28,558
an example of doing uh

1571
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,519
mechanical engineering

1572
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:35,920
and a better look at at a basically

1573
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,199
mechanical engineering and geology and

1574
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,240
maybe at a

1575
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:40,399
level which

1576
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:42,159
okay uh so what do we what's the problem

1577
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,079
the problem is the following that i've

1578
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:46,879
given you this picture of an instrument

1579
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,640
that i by some magic i can make good

1580
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,680
enough to measure this very short

1581
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,759
distance

1582
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,199
but then i put it down here

1583
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,520
it won't work

1584
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:57,759
and the reason it doesn't work is that

1585
00:56:55,519 --> 00:57:00,079
the earth itself is moving all over the

1586
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,400
place all the time you don't realize it

1587
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:05,359
it seems pretty good to you i get it but

1588
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,680
it's moving all the time so somehow

1589
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:09,440
it's moving so much that you we can't

1590
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,598
deal with it we happen to be trying to

1591
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,599
do the experiment here on earth

1592
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,440
but we can't deal with it so we have to

1593
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:17,519
make the instrument

1594
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,720
isolated from the earth

1595
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:20,400
oh no

1596
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,480
at the frequencies we're at we've got to

1597
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,318
float it that's a mechanical that's an

1598
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,639
engineering problem not a physics

1599
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:28,400
problem so when you actually like uh

1600
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,879
we're doing we're having a conversation

1601
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,720
on a podcast right now there's uh and

1602
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:36,318
people who record music work with this

1603
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:37,759
you know how to create an isolated room

1604
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:39,039
and they usually build a room within a

1605
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,119
room

1606
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,480
but that's still not isolated in fact

1607
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,798
they say it's impossible to truly

1608
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,760
isolate from sound from noise and stuff

1609
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:47,519
like that

1610
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,200
but that that

1611
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,480
that's like one step

1612
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,719
of

1613
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,880
millions that you took

1614
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,039
is building a room inside a room because

1615
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,039
you basically have to isolate all now

1616
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,599
this is actually an easier problem you

1617
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,358
just have to do it really well so the

1618
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,880
making a clean room is really a tough

1619
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:06,880
problem because you have to put a room

1620
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,680
inside a room yeah

1621
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:12,318
so this is this is really simple

1622
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,679
engineering or physics uh-huh okay so

1623
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:15,519
what do you have to do how do you

1624
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:16,480
isolate yourself from the from the earth

1625
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:19,039
yes

1626
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,358
first we work at

1627
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,119
uh we're not looking at all frequencies

1628
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:25,199
for gravitational waves we're looking at

1629
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,519
particular frequencies

1630
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:30,078
that you can deal with here on earth

1631
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:33,440
so what frequencies would those be

1632
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,920
you were just talking about frequencies

1633
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,720
i mean we know by evolution our bodies

1634
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:41,358
know it's the audio band

1635
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,959
okay the reason our ears work where they

1636
00:58:41,358 --> 00:58:46,000
work is that's where the earth isn't

1637
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,440
going making too much noise okay so the

1638
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,519
reason our ears work the way they work

1639
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,880
is because this is where it's quiet

1640
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:54,000
that's right

1641
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,920
so if you go to if you go to one hertz

1642
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,838
instead of 10 hertz

1643
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,318
it's the earth is

1644
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,960
it's really moving around so

1645
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:05,358
so somehow we live in a what we call the

1646
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,599
audio band it's tens of hertz to

1647
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:10,639
thousands of hertz that's where we

1648
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:12,000
live that's where we live okay

1649
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:13,920
if we're going to do an experiment on

1650
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,280
the earth i might as well do this it's

1651
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,200
the same frequency that's where the

1652
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,720
earth is the quietest so we have to work

1653
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,199
in that frequency so we're not looking

1654
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:24,558
at all frequencies okay

1655
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:26,960
so the solution for the for the shaking

1656
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:29,599
of the earth to get rid of it

1657
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,639
is pretty mundane if we do the same

1658
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,920
thing

1659
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:36,318
that you do uh to make your car drive

1660
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,720
smoothly down the road so what happens

1661
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:41,279
when your car goes over a bump

1662
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:44,639
early cars did that they bounced right

1663
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,400
okay but you don't feel that in your car

1664
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:48,798
so what happened to that energy you

1665
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,480
can't just disappear energy so we have

1666
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:51,519
these things called shock absorbers in

1667
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,719
the car

1668
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,358
what they do

1669
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:57,519
is they absorb they take the the thing

1670
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,960
that went like that and they basically

1671
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:01,920
can't get rid of the energy but they

1672
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,480
move it to very very low frequency

1673
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,559
so what you feel isn't

1674
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,400
you feel like go shh

1675
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,839
smoothly okay

1676
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:14,318
all right so uh

1677
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:16,639
we also work at this frequency so if we

1678
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,318
so we basically why

1679
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:20,318
why do we have to do anything other than

1680
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:23,279
shock absorbers so we made

1681
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:25,199
the world's fanciest shock absorbers

1682
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,200
okay

1683
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:29,118
not just like in your car where there's

1684
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:30,719
one layer of them they're just the right

1685
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,400
squishiness and so forth they're better

1686
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:34,078
than what's in the cars

1687
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,920
and we have four layers of it so

1688
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,920
whatever shakes and gets through the

1689
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,720
first layer we treat it in a second

1690
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,880
third

1691
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,959
level so it's a mechanical engineering

1692
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,200
problem yeah that's what i said so

1693
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,440
it's not there's no weird tricks to it

1694
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:49,759
like uh like a chemistry type thing or

1695
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,079
no no just well the right squishiness

1696
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,400
right need the right material inside and

1697
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,359
ours look like little springs but

1698
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,519
they're

1699
01:00:55,358 --> 01:01:01,440
springs they're springs so like

1700
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:02,480
legitimately like shock absorbers yeah

1701
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,920
what

1702
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,400
okay okay

1703
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,720
and this is now experimental physics at

1704
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,559
the at its limit okay so you do this and

1705
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:13,279
we make the world's fanciest shock

1706
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,920
absorbers just mechanical engineering

1707
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,240
just mechanical genius is hilarious but

1708
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:21,760
we didn't yes we weren't good enough to

1709
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,759
discover gravitational waves

1710
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,359
so

1711
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,119
uh so we did another we added another

1712
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:29,759
feature and it's something else that

1713
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:32,400
you're uh

1714
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,880
aware of probably have one

1715
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:38,318
and that is to get rid of noise you've

1716
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,160
probably noise which is you don't like

1717
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:42,318
and that's the same principle that's in

1718
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:44,318
these little bose uh

1719
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:46,239
uh earphones noise canceling

1720
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:48,798
noise cancelling so

1721
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:51,598
uh so how do they work they basically

1722
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:54,159
you go on an airplane and they uh sense

1723
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,480
the ambient noise from the engines

1724
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:59,118
and cancel it because it's just the same

1725
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,719
over and over again they cancel it and

1726
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,798
when the stewardess comes and asks you

1727
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:04,318
whether you want coffee or a tea or a

1728
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:07,119
drink or something you hear her fine

1729
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:09,358
because she's not ambient she's a signal

1730
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:11,838
so are we talking about active canceling

1731
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:14,558
like where the action is canceling

1732
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:17,279
so this is you okay so another don't

1733
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:20,000
tell me you have active canceling uh on

1734
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,599
this yeah besides the show absolutely

1735
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,559
so inside this

1736
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:26,559
array of shock absorbers yeah we you

1737
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,839
asked for some interesting this is

1738
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,798
awesome

1739
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:32,480
so inside this it's harder than the

1740
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:35,358
earphone problem but it's just

1741
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,358
engineering we have to see measure not

1742
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:40,000
just that the

1743
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:41,838
engine still made noise

1744
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,199
but the earth is shaking it's moving in

1745
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,838
some direction

1746
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,439
so we have to actually tell not only

1747
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:49,759
that there's noise and cancel it but

1748
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:53,200
what direction it's from so we put this

1749
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:55,839
array of seismometers inside

1750
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:57,118
this array of shock absorbers and

1751
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,480
measure the

1752
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:59,519
residual

1753
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,838
motion

1754
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:04,239
and its

1755
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:08,239
direction and we put little actuators

1756
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:10,078
that push back against it and cancel it

1757
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:11,759
this is awesome

1758
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,200
so you have the actuators and you have

1759
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,960
the thing that is sensing the the

1760
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:17,118
vibrations and then you have the actual

1761
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,358
actuators that adjust for that and do so

1762
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,680
in perfect synchrony yeah

1763
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:23,519
what if it all works right and so how

1764
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:25,118
much do we reduce the shaking of the

1765
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:26,559
earth

1766
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,838
i mean

1767
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,798
one part in 10 to the 12th

1768
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:32,798
part

1769
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:35,759
inside what gets through us is one part

1770
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:35,759
and 10 to the 12th

1771
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:40,798
that's pretty big reduction you don't

1772
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,480
need that in your car but that's what we

1773
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,480
do and so that's how isolated we are

1774
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,679
from the earth and that was the biggest

1775
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,079
uh

1776
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:50,159
i'd say technical problem outside of the

1777
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,880
physics instrument the interferometer

1778
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:54,719
can ask you a a weird question here you

1779
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,640
you make it very poetically and

1780
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:58,798
humorously it's saying it's just a

1781
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:01,358
mechanical engineering problem

1782
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:03,119
but is this one of the

1783
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:04,719
biggest

1784
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,440
precision

1785
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:09,279
mechanical engineering efforts ever

1786
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,599
i mean this seems exceptionally

1787
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:14,480
difficult it is and so it took a long

1788
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:16,798
time and uh i think

1789
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:19,039
nobody seems to challenge the statement

1790
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:22,318
that this is the most precision precise

1791
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:24,079
instrument that's ever been built ligo

1792
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:25,679
i just i wonder what like listening to

1793
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,920
led zeppelin sounds on this thing

1794
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:29,519
because it's so isolated i mean this is

1795
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,599
like uh

1796
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,920
i don't know no background noise nope no

1797
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,359
back it's wow

1798
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,960
wow

1799
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:41,279
wow that so when you were first

1800
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,199
conceiving this um

1801
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,519
i would probably uh if i was

1802
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:47,199
knowledgeable enough kind of uh laugh

1803
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:49,838
off the possibility this is even

1804
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:51,519
possible i'm sure

1805
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,358
like how many people

1806
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:57,038
believe that this is possible did you

1807
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:58,719
believe oh oh uh i did

1808
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,400
i didn't know that we needed for sure

1809
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:04,078
that we needed active when we started we

1810
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:06,880
did just passive but we were doing the

1811
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:08,960
tests to develop the active

1812
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,160
to add as a second stage which we ended

1813
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,639
up needing

1814
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,558
um but there was a lot of

1815
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:17,038
you know now now there was a lot of

1816
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,400
skepticism a lot of us especially

1817
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:20,640
astronomers

1818
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,480
felt that money was being wasted because

1819
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:25,118
we were all so expensive

1820
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,920
doing what i told you is not cheap so it

1821
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,440
was

1822
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,880
kind of controversial i was funded by

1823
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,880
the national science foundation

1824
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,640
can you just linger on this just for a

1825
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:38,480
little longer with the actuator thing

1826
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,480
the act of canceling it um

1827
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,480
do you remember

1828
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:45,199
like little experiments that were done

1829
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,679
along the way to prove to the team to

1830
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:49,118
themselves that this is even possible

1831
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:50,318
so from our

1832
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,440
because i work with quite a bit of

1833
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:53,119
robots

1834
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,200
and to me the idea that you could do it

1835
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:58,960
this precisely

1836
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:01,598
is uh humbling and embarrassing frankly

1837
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:04,480
because like this is another level of

1838
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:07,440
precision that i can't even

1839
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,440
um because robots are a mess

1840
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,559
and this is basically

1841
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,838
one of the most

1842
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:16,240
precise robots ever

1843
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:17,920
right so like uh can you is there uh

1844
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:19,279
yeah do you have any like small scale

1845
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,318
experiments that were done that's just

1846
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:26,240
believe this is possible yeah and larger

1847
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:28,159
scale we made we made uh test uh

1848
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:30,318
chan that also has to be in vacuum too

1849
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:31,358
but we made test chambers that had this

1850
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:33,920
system

1851
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:36,239
in it our first mock of the system so we

1852
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,838
could test it

1853
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:40,318
and

1854
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:42,078
optimize it and make it work but it's

1855
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:42,579
just a mechanical engineering problem

1856
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,039
okay

1857
01:06:42,579 --> 01:06:48,000
[Laughter]

1858
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:51,520
humans are just ape descendants i gotcha

1859
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,719
i gotcha uh is there any video of this

1860
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,199
like um

1861
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:58,798
some kind of educational purpose

1862
01:06:55,199 --> 01:07:01,838
visualizations of this act of canceling

1863
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:01,838
uh i don't think so

1864
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:07,280
i mean is this does this live on

1865
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,079
well we work for parts of it for the

1866
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:12,240
active canceling we worked with for the

1867
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:15,119
instruments for the sensor and

1868
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:17,118
instruments we worked with uh

1869
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,599
a small company and met near where you

1870
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,079
are because it was our mit people that

1871
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:23,680
got them that were you know interested

1872
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,160
in the problem because they thought they

1873
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:28,199
might be able to commercialize it for

1874
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,480
making stable tables to make

1875
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:33,038
microelectronics for example which are

1876
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,119
limited by the how stable the table is

1877
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,880
i mean at this point it's a little

1878
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:38,480
expensive

1879
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,599
so you never know you never know where

1880
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,798
this leads

1881
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,838
okay so

1882
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:43,838
maybe on the

1883
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,160
let me ask you just

1884
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:51,039
sticking it a little longer this silly

1885
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:52,318
old mechanical engineering problem uh

1886
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:55,520
what was uh

1887
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:57,838
to you kind of the darkest moment

1888
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:00,079
of what was the hardest

1889
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:01,920
stumbling block to get over on the

1890
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,359
engineer side like was there any time

1891
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,599
where there's a doubt where it's like

1892
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:08,239
i'm not sure we'll be able to do this

1893
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:10,000
a kind of uh engineering challenge that

1894
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:14,000
was hit do you remember anything like

1895
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
that i think the one that that

1896
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,440
my colleague at mit ray weiss worked on

1897
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,400
so hard and uh

1898
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,079
was

1899
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,798
much more of a worry than this this is

1900
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:27,039
only a question if you're not do it well

1901
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:28,000
enough you have to keep making it better

1902
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:28,880
somehow

1903
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,920
but

1904
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,039
this whole

1905
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,399
huge instrument has to be in vacuum

1906
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:36,960
and

1907
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:39,439
the vacuum tanks are you know this big

1908
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:42,880
around and uh so it's the world's

1909
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:45,519
biggest high vacuum system and the cons

1910
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,640
so how do you make it first of all

1911
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:50,719
uh how do you make this four meter long

1912
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,640
sealed vacuum system it has to be made

1913
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,719
out of four kilometers four kilometers

1914
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,239
long would i say something else meters

1915
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,679
four or four kilometers long big

1916
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:01,838
difference yeah and uh so but to make it

1917
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:06,079
yeah we started with uh

1918
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:09,198
uh a roll of stainless steel and then we

1919
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:11,278
spi roll it out like a spiral so there's

1920
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,719
a spiral weld on it

1921
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,719
okay so

1922
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,920
the engineering was fine we did that we

1923
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,759
worked through

1924
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,600
very good companies and so forth to

1925
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:22,158
build it

1926
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,199
uh the big worry

1927
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,318
it was

1928
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:28,559
what if you develop a leak

1929
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,759
this is a high vacuum not just vacuum

1930
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,679
system

1931
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,279
typically in your in a laboratory if

1932
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,119
there's a leak you put

1933
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:36,640
helium around

1934
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:39,039
the

1935
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:41,199
the thing you have and then you detect

1936
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:43,198
where the helium is coming in but if you

1937
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:45,039
have something as big as this you can't

1938
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,719
surround it with helium so you might not

1939
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:49,519
actually even know that there's a leak

1940
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,798
and it will be affecting well we we have

1941
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,159
we can measure

1942
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:54,079
the

1943
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:57,039
how good the vacuum is so we can know

1944
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:59,039
that but there a leak can develop and

1945
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:00,719
and then we don't how do we fix it or

1946
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:03,198
how do we find it

1947
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:05,760
and uh so that was you asked about a

1948
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:07,519
worry that was always a really big worry

1949
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,480
uh what's the difference between a high

1950
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,719
vacuum and uh and a vacuum what what is

1951
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:15,839
high vacuum that's like some

1952
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:18,560
a delta close to vacuum is there some

1953
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,800
threshold well there's a unit

1954
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,640
high vacuum is uh

1955
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,480
when the vacuum and the units that are

1956
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,119
used which are tors there's 10 to the

1957
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:30,319
minus 9.

1958
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:34,158
there's high vacuum is usually used in

1959
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:37,519
small places the biggest vacuum system

1960
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:39,439
period is that cern in this big particle

1961
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,880
accelerator but the high vacuum where

1962
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:42,879
they need really good vacuum so

1963
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,600
particles don't scatter and it is

1964
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,719
smaller than r so ours is a really large

1965
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,440
uh

1966
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:52,158
uh high vacuum system i don't know this

1967
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:53,279
is so cool i mean this is basically

1968
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:55,839
by far

1969
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:58,079
the greatest listening device

1970
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:00,800
ever built by human the fact that like

1971
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:02,559
descendants of apes could do this

1972
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,079
that evolution started with single cell

1973
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,520
organisms

1974
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:09,519
i mean is there any more i'm a huge uh

1975
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,760
theory it's like yeah yeah but like

1976
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,199
bridges when i look at bridges

1977
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,640
from a civil engineering perspective

1978
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:16,879
it's one of the most beautiful creations

1979
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,560
by human beings it's physics

1980
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,800
you're using physics to construct

1981
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,760
objects that can support huge amount of

1982
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,520
mass

1983
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,719
and it's like structural but it's also

1984
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,719
beautiful and that humans can

1985
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,640
collaborate to create that throughout

1986
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,480
history and then you take this on

1987
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:33,039
another level

1988
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:34,238
this is this is like

1989
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,479
this is like

1990
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:39,678
exciting to me beyond measure that

1991
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:42,079
humans can create something so precise

1992
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:43,840
but but another concept lost in this you

1993
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:46,158
just said you started talking about

1994
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,840
single cell yeah okay

1995
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:50,079
you have to realize this discovery that

1996
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,360
we made that everybody spot off on

1997
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:54,479
happened

1998
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:56,719
1.3 billion years ago

1999
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:58,718
somewhere and then the signal came to us

2000
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:01,600
1.3 billion years ago we were just

2001
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,439
converting on the earth from single cell

2002
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,679
to multi-cell life

2003
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:08,238
so when this actually happened this

2004
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:10,079
collision of two black holes yeah we

2005
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:12,559
weren't here we weren't even close to

2006
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:14,880
we're both developing a single

2007
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,800
yeah we were at we're going from single

2008
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,800
cell to multi-cell life at that point

2009
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,640
all to meet up with this at this point

2010
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,560
yeah

2011
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,039
wow that's like uh that's almost

2012
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,960
romantic how though

2013
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,640
it is

2014
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:33,039
uh okay so

2015
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:34,960
on the human side of things it's kind of

2016
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:37,920
fascinating because you're talking about

2017
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,399
over a thousand people team for ligo

2018
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,399
yeah uh that started out with uh you

2019
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:44,559
know around a hundred

2020
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:46,559
and you've uh

2021
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,800
for parts of the time at least led this

2022
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,400
team

2023
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,679
what does it take to lead a team like

2024
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:56,799
this of incredibly brilliant

2025
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:58,319
theoreticians and engineers

2026
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,039
and just a lot of different parties

2027
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:03,599
involved a lot of egos

2028
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:06,800
a lot of ideas you you had this fun

2029
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,960
funny example i forget where

2030
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:11,440
where in publishing a paper you have to

2031
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,880
all agree on like uh

2032
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:14,479
you know the phrasing of a certain

2033
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,880
sentence or the title of the paper and

2034
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:18,158
so on that's a very interesting simple

2035
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,400
example i'd love you to speak to that

2036
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,158
but just in general how

2037
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:23,039
what does it take to lead this kind of

2038
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:27,039
team

2039
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:28,319
okay uh i think the the general

2040
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,640
idea

2041
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:32,719
is one we all know you wanna you wanna

2042
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,239
you wanna to get

2043
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,119
where the

2044
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:37,119
the

2045
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:39,198
sum of something is more than the

2046
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:40,399
individual parts is what we say right

2047
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:41,919
yeah

2048
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:44,719
so that's what you're trying to achieve

2049
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,719
yes okay how do you do that actually

2050
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:47,760
mostly if we take

2051
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:49,520
multiple

2052
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,440
objects or people and when you put them

2053
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,320
together the sum is less

2054
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:55,198
yes

2055
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:57,439
why because they overlap

2056
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,960
so you don't have individual things that

2057
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:00,719
you know this

2058
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,679
person does that this person does that

2059
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:06,319
then you get exactly the sum but what

2060
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:08,399
you want is to develop where you get

2061
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:10,000
more than what the individual

2062
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:11,599
contributions are we know that's very

2063
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,600
common people use that

2064
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,239
expression everywhere and it's the

2065
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,960
expression that has to be

2066
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:20,718
kind of built into how people feel it's

2067
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,640
working because if you're

2068
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:25,198
part of a team

2069
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:27,440
and you realize that somehow the team is

2070
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:29,919
able to do more than the individuals

2071
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:32,000
could do themselves then they buy on

2072
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,000
kind of in terms of the

2073
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,960
process so that's the

2074
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,920
that's the goal that you have to

2075
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,198
have is to to achieve that and that

2076
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,480
means

2077
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:44,238
that you

2078
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:45,839
have to

2079
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:48,079
realize

2080
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,079
parts of what you're trying to do

2081
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:51,840
that require

2082
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:54,880
not that one person couldn't do it it

2083
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,719
requires the combined talents to be able

2084
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,039
to do something that neither of them

2085
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:01,039
could do themselves and we have a lot of

2086
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:02,399
that kind of thing and i think

2087
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:04,238
um i mean

2088
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:05,359
build into the some of the examples that

2089
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:06,559
i gave you

2090
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:10,719
and so

2091
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:12,880
uh how do you then so so the key almost

2092
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,640
in anything you do is the people

2093
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,239
themselves right so

2094
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,199
in our case

2095
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:20,559
the first and most important was to

2096
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:24,238
attract

2097
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:26,320
to spend years of their life on this and

2098
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:28,000
the best possible people in the world to

2099
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:30,158
do it so

2100
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,719
the only way to convince them is that

2101
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:34,639
somehow it's

2102
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:36,880
better and more interesting for them

2103
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:39,199
than what they could do themselves

2104
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:42,079
and so that's part of this

2105
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:44,399
uh idea that's it yeah that's powerful

2106
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:46,319
but nevertheless there's best people in

2107
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:49,759
the world there's egos is there

2108
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:51,759
something to be said about managing egos

2109
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,079
the human problem is always the hardest

2110
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,000
and so there's that's an art not

2111
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:59,039
a science i think

2112
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,319
i think the fact here that

2113
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:03,119
combined

2114
01:16:00,319 --> 01:16:05,359
there's a was a romantic goal

2115
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:09,039
that we had to you know do something

2116
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:11,279
that people hadn't done before which was

2117
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:14,640
um

2118
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:15,840
important scientifically and and a huge

2119
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,400
challenge

2120
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,800
uh enabled us to say take

2121
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:23,039
and get uh i mean what we did just to

2122
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:26,000
take an example we use the light to go

2123
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:28,319
in this thing comes from lasers

2124
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,800
we need a certain kind of laser so

2125
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:32,840
uh the kind of laser that we use there

2126
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,840
were three

2127
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:38,079
different institutions in the world that

2128
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,000
had the experts that do this maybe in

2129
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:42,479
competition with each other

2130
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,600
so we got all three to join together and

2131
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:50,158
work with us uh to work on this as an

2132
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:51,760
example so that you had and they had the

2133
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:53,920
thing that they were working together on

2134
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,119
a kind of object that they wouldn't have

2135
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,920
otherwise

2136
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:57,760
and

2137
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,920
were part of a bigger team where they

2138
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,840
could discover something that

2139
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,719
isn't even engineers these are engineers

2140
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,960
that do lasers so and they're part of

2141
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:09,279
our laser physicists and

2142
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,319
so could you describe

2143
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:12,399
the

2144
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:14,479
moment

2145
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:16,960
or the period of time

2146
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:18,319
when finally this incredible creation of

2147
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,239
human beings

2148
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:21,359
led to a detection of gravitational

2149
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:23,359
waves

2150
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:24,880
it's a long story unfortunately this is

2151
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,198
a part that

2152
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:29,600
uh we started failures along the way

2153
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:31,359
kind of thing or all failures that's all

2154
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,280
that's built into it

2155
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:35,839
okay if you're not a uh if you're not

2156
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:37,599
mechanical engineering

2157
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,600
you build on your failures that's

2158
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,920
expected so we're trying things that no

2159
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,560
one's done before so it's technically

2160
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,158
not just gravitational waves and so it's

2161
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,560
built on failures

2162
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:50,799
but anyway we we did

2163
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,320
before me even the the

2164
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,560
people did

2165
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:58,319
r d on the concepts

2166
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:00,239
but starting in 1994 we got money from

2167
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:02,639
the national science foundation to build

2168
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:05,119
this thing

2169
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:08,079
it took about five years to build it so

2170
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:09,679
by 1999 we had

2171
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:10,640
built the basic

2172
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:12,399
unit

2173
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:15,039
it did not have

2174
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:16,879
active seismic isolation at that stage

2175
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,238
didn't have some other things that we

2176
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,960
have now

2177
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:22,319
what we did at that at at the beginning

2178
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,560
was

2179
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:26,719
uh

2180
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,039
stick to

2181
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:31,439
technologies that we had

2182
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,279
at least enough knowledge that we could

2183
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:34,879
make work or had tested in our own

2184
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:36,319
laboratories

2185
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,760
and so then we put together the

2186
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:39,599
instrument

2187
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,600
we made it work

2188
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,640
it didn't work very well but it worked

2189
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,480
and

2190
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,640
we didn't see any gravitational waves

2191
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:50,079
then we figured out what limited us and

2192
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:51,679
we went through this every year for

2193
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:55,840
almost 10 years

2194
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:56,880
never seen gravitational waves we would

2195
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,400
run it

2196
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,400
looking for gravitational waves for

2197
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:03,519
months

2198
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:05,198
learn what limited us fix it for months

2199
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,280
and then run it again

2200
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:09,678
eventually we

2201
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:12,158
knew we had to take another big step and

2202
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:14,880
that's when we made several changes

2203
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:17,198
including going adding these active

2204
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,119
seismic isolation which turned out to be

2205
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:21,519
a key

2206
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:23,279
and we

2207
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,280
fortunately got the national science

2208
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:26,479
foundation to give us another

2209
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:30,479
couple hundred

2210
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:32,799
million dollars 100 million more and

2211
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:34,559
we rebuilt it our fixed

2212
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,560
or improved it

2213
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:39,760
and uh

2214
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:43,679
then in ninth uh in

2215
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:45,360
2015 uh we turned it on

2216
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:47,039
and uh

2217
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:50,158
we um

2218
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:53,600
almost instantly saw uh this first

2219
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:53,599
collision of two black holes

2220
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,920
um

2221
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,560
and

2222
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,319
then then we went through a process of

2223
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,840
do we believe what we've seen yeah i

2224
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:03,198
think i think you're one of the people

2225
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,119
that went through that process it sounds

2226
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:07,599
like some people immediately believed it

2227
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:09,119
yeah and and then you were like so as

2228
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,920
human beings we all have different

2229
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:13,439
reactions to almost anything and so

2230
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:16,719
quite a few of my colleagues had a

2231
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:18,399
eureka moment immediately i mean it's

2232
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:20,960
that's amazing

2233
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:23,679
the the the figure that we

2234
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:26,319
that we put in our paper

2235
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:28,800
first is just data we didn't have to go

2236
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:30,000
through you know fancy computer programs

2237
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,800
to do anything

2238
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,079
and

2239
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:36,400
and we showed next to it uh the

2240
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:39,198
calculations of einstein's equations it

2241
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:41,198
looks just like the what we detected wow

2242
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:43,759
and we did it in two different detectors

2243
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:46,559
halfway across the us so it was pretty

2244
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,239
convincing but

2245
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,400
but you don't want to

2246
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:51,359
you don't want to fool yourself so we

2247
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,198
had a

2248
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:54,319
being a scientist

2249
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:56,559
we had a

2250
01:20:54,319 --> 01:20:58,238
for me we had to go through and try to

2251
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,560
understand that the instrument itself

2252
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:02,559
which was new i said we had rebuild it

2253
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,480
couldn't somehow generate

2254
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,440
things that look like this

2255
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:09,839
that took some tests and then

2256
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:12,399
the second you'll appreciate more

2257
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,719
we had to somehow convince ourselves we

2258
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:16,960
weren't hacked in some clever way cyber

2259
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:20,399
security question yeah even though we're

2260
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:22,480
not on the internet the the but yeah

2261
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:24,399
no it can be physical access too yeah

2262
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:26,079
that's that's fascinating it's

2263
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:26,839
fascinating you would think about that i

2264
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:30,880
mean

2265
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,880
not not enough

2266
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,360
i mean because it's it's uh it matches

2267
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:36,799
prediction

2268
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:38,719
so the chances of it actually being

2269
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,239
manipulated is very very low

2270
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:42,000
but nevertheless

2271
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:43,678
we still could have disgruntled old

2272
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,279
graduate students who had worked with us

2273
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:47,119
earlier that who

2274
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:49,519
want you to i don't know how that's

2275
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:52,399
supposed to embarrass you i suppose yeah

2276
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:54,880
i suppose i see but

2277
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:56,638
but about what i think you said within a

2278
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,159
month you kind of convinced yourself

2279
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:01,039
something within a month we convinced

2280
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:03,039
ourselves uh we kept a thousand

2281
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:05,519
collaborators quiet during that time

2282
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:07,359
then we spent another that's funny month

2283
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,320
or so uh

2284
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:12,559
trying to understand what we'd seen

2285
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:14,079
so that we could do the science with it

2286
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,679
instead of just putting it out to the

2287
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:18,079
world and let somebody else understand

2288
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:19,760
that it was two black holes and what it

2289
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:22,000
was the fact that a thousand

2290
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,000
collaborators were quiet

2291
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,399
is a really strong indication that this

2292
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,880
is a really close-knit team yeah over

2293
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,399
and they're around the world

2294
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,600
or either strong

2295
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:36,399
uh either strong knit or tight-knit or

2296
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,320
had a strong dictatorship or something

2297
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:39,920
yeah either fear or love you can rule by

2298
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:41,599
fear of love yeah you can go back to

2299
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,639
mecca valley yeah

2300
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,639
all right well this i mean

2301
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:51,520
this is really exciting that that was

2302
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,840
that that's a success story because it

2303
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,639
didn't have to be a success story

2304
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,400
right

2305
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,840
i mean eventually perhaps you could say

2306
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:00,559
it'd be an effect but it could have

2307
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:04,239
taken it over a century to get oh yeah

2308
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,239
yeah it's uh and

2309
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:09,840
and it's only downhill now kind of

2310
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:11,520
[Laughter]

2311
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,600
what do you mean it's only uh you mean

2312
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,320
with gravitational waves well we're yeah

2313
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,239
we've it's we've now we now

2314
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:20,639
uh well now we're off because of the

2315
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:22,158
pandemic but when we turned off we were

2316
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:24,480
seeing

2317
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:26,399
some sort of gravitational wave event

2318
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:28,879
each week

2319
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:31,039
and now we're fixing we're fixing we're

2320
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,800
adding features where it'll probably be

2321
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:35,760
when we turn back on next year it'll

2322
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:38,159
probably every one every couple days

2323
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,079
and they're not all the same so it's

2324
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:43,519
learning about what's out there in

2325
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:45,039
gravity instead of just optics and

2326
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:49,040
so it's all

2327
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:51,519
uh great we're only limited by

2328
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:52,800
the fantastic thing other than that this

2329
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,880
is uh

2330
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,440
a great field and you know it's all new

2331
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,840
and so forth is that experimentally the

2332
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:02,879
the great thing is that uh

2333
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:05,600
we're limited by

2334
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:08,000
technology and technical limitations not

2335
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,039
by science

2336
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,880
so

2337
01:24:09,039 --> 01:24:11,840
the the the

2338
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,520
uh

2339
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,520
another

2340
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:17,520
a really important discovery that was

2341
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,360
made before ours

2342
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:22,000
was what's called the higgs boson made

2343
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:24,238
on the big accelerator at cern you know

2344
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,399
this huge accelerator they discovered a

2345
01:24:24,238 --> 01:24:28,238
really important thing it's

2346
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:31,599
you know we have einstein's equation e

2347
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:33,759
equals m c squared so energy makes mass

2348
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,280
or mass can make energy and that's the

2349
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:38,239
bomb

2350
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:41,359
but the mechanism by which that happens

2351
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:44,479
not fission but but how do you create

2352
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:46,000
mass from energy

2353
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,359
was never

2354
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,679
understood

2355
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:52,000
until there was a

2356
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:54,000
a theory of it about

2357
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,359
70 years ago now

2358
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,439
and

2359
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:59,198
so they discovered it's named after a

2360
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:00,399
man named higgs it's called the higgs

2361
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:02,719
boson

2362
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:05,198
and so it was discovered

2363
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,158
but since that time and i i worked on

2364
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:07,839
those

2365
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:09,920
experiments since that time they haven't

2366
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,239
been able to progress very much further

2367
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,840
a little bit but not a lot further and

2368
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:16,000
the difference is that we're really

2369
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,239
lucky we're in

2370
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,279
in what we're doing in that

2371
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:21,678
there

2372
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:23,279
uh you're you see this higgs boson but

2373
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,719
there's tremendous amount of other

2374
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:26,639
physics that goes on and you have to

2375
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:29,198
pick out the needle in the haystack kind

2376
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,800
of of physics you can't make the physics

2377
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:33,919
go away it's there

2378
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:36,639
in our case we have a very weak signal

2379
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,399
but once we get good enough to see it

2380
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:40,159
it's weak compared to where we've

2381
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,960
reduced the background but the

2382
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:45,759
background is not physics it's just

2383
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:48,000
technology you know it's getting

2384
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,560
ourselves better isolated from the earth

2385
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:54,800
or getting a more powerful laser

2386
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:57,199
and so each time each since 2015 when we

2387
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:00,079
saw the first one we continually can

2388
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:01,839
make improvements that are enabling us

2389
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:04,399
to turn this into a

2390
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:07,039
a real science to do astronomy a new

2391
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:09,599
kind of astronomy it's a little like

2392
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:11,119
astronomy i mean

2393
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,360
galileo

2394
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:17,599
started the field i mean he basically

2395
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:20,079
took lenses that were made for classes

2396
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,840
and he didn't invent the first telescope

2397
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:24,319
but made a

2398
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,319
looked at

2399
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:27,679
neptune

2400
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,520
and saw that it had four moons

2401
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:32,319
that was the birth of

2402
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,679
not just using your eyes to understand

2403
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:35,279
what's out there

2404
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:37,840
and since that time we've made better

2405
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:39,679
and better telescopes obviously and

2406
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:42,560
astronomy thrives

2407
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:44,399
and in a similar way we're starting to

2408
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,639
be able to

2409
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,879
for you know crawl but we're starting to

2410
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:51,760
be able to do that with gravitational

2411
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,199
waves it's and it's going to be more and

2412
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,800
more that we can

2413
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:57,119
do is we can make better and better

2414
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,719
instruments because as i say it's not

2415
01:26:57,119 --> 01:26:59,679
limited by

2416
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:01,359
um

2417
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,119
picking it out of other yeah it's not

2418
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:05,839
limited by the physics so you have an

2419
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:07,840
optimism about engineering that event

2420
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:11,039
you know as we

2421
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:14,719
as human progress marches on

2422
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:15,600
engineering will always uh find a way to

2423
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:17,679
uh

2424
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,840
to build a large enough device accurate

2425
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:21,679
enough device to detect the size as long

2426
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:24,480
as it's not limited by physics yeah

2427
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,480
they'll do it

2428
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:27,599
so

2429
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:31,119
you

2430
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:33,199
two other folks and the entire team

2431
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:36,960
won the nobel prize

2432
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:39,039
for this yeah big effort

2433
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,639
there's a million questions i can ask

2434
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:44,039
for but

2435
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,039
looking back

2436
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:52,239
where does the nobel prize fit into all

2437
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:53,839
of this

2438
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:56,319
you know if you think hundreds years

2439
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,319
from now

2440
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:01,279
i venture to say that people will not

2441
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:02,959
remember the winners of a prize

2442
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:04,639
but they'll remember creations like

2443
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,960
these maybe i'm romanticizing

2444
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:09,920
engineering

2445
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:13,359
but i guess i want to ask how important

2446
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,359
is the nobel prize in all this

2447
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,960
well that's a it's a complicated

2448
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,960
question it's uh

2449
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:23,279
as a physicist it's something if you're

2450
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:25,759
if you're trying to win a nobel prize

2451
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:27,119
forget it because they give you know

2452
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,920
one a year

2453
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:31,840
so there's like there's been

2454
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:34,079
200 physicists who've won the nobel

2455
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,679
prize since 1900 and

2456
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:37,279
and so that's

2457
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:39,440
you know

2458
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:42,079
and so things just have to fall right so

2459
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:43,839
your goal cannot be to win a nobel prize

2460
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:44,719
it wasn't my dream

2461
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,239
uh

2462
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,119
it's a

2463
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:50,158
it's

2464
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:52,960
uh tremendous for science i mean why the

2465
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:55,359
nobel prize for a guy that made dynamite

2466
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,880
and stuff is you know what it is it's a

2467
01:28:55,359 --> 01:28:59,279
long story but

2468
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:02,239
it's the one day a year where actually

2469
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:04,158
the science that people have done is all

2470
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:06,319
over the world and so forth

2471
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:08,719
forget about the people again you know

2472
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:10,639
it is really good for for science

2473
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:11,679
celebrating science it celebrates

2474
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,560
science

2475
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:14,480
for

2476
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:16,320
you know several days different fields

2477
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:18,158
uh you know chemistry

2478
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:19,519
medicine and so forth

2479
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:21,039
and uh

2480
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,400
everybody doesn't understand everything

2481
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:24,399
about these they're

2482
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:25,920
generally a fairly abstract but then

2483
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:27,679
it's you know it's

2484
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:29,039
on the front page of newspapers around

2485
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:31,279
the world so it's really good for

2486
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:32,960
science it's not easy to get science on

2487
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:34,559
the front page of the new york times

2488
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:37,600
it's not there

2489
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,520
uh should be but it's not

2490
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,760
and uh

2491
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,679
so the nobel prize is important in that

2492
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:46,480
way uh

2493
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:48,399
it's otherwise you know

2494
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:50,839
i have a certain celebrity that i didn't

2495
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:54,079
have before and

2496
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:56,159
um and now you get to be a celebrity

2497
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:56,880
that advertises science it's a mechanism

2498
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:00,559
to

2499
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:02,239
uh to remind us how incredible well

2500
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,800
how much credit science deserves and

2501
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:07,678
everything well it has a little bit more

2502
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:09,679
one thing i didn't expect which is good

2503
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:13,679
is that you know

2504
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:13,679
we have a a government

2505
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,840
i'm not picking on ours necessarily but

2506
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:21,839
it's true of all governments are not run

2507
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:24,480
by scientists in our case it's run by uh

2508
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:27,440
lawyers and businessmen yep okay

2509
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:30,879
uh and at best they may have an aide or

2510
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:33,119
something that knows a little science so

2511
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:36,880
so our country is

2512
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:38,880
and all countries are hardly

2513
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,480
hardly take into account

2514
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,359
science

2515
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:44,000
in

2516
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:46,079
making decisions yes okay

2517
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,319
and

2518
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:52,479
having a nobel prize the uh

2519
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:53,599
people in those positions actually

2520
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:54,559
listen

2521
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,079
so

2522
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,679
you have more influence i don't care

2523
01:30:56,079 --> 01:31:00,158
whether it's about global warming or

2524
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:02,639
what the issue is there's some

2525
01:31:00,158 --> 01:31:04,638
influence which is lacking otherwise

2526
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:06,560
and uh i

2527
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:08,159
people pay attention to what i say if i

2528
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,039
talk about global warming they wouldn't

2529
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:11,920
have

2530
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:14,079
uh before i had the nobel prize

2531
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:16,960
uh yeah this is very true you're like

2532
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:19,760
the celebrities who talk uh

2533
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:21,439
celebrity has power uh celebrity has

2534
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,199
power and that's that's and that's a

2535
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:25,519
good thing that's a good thing yeah uh

2536
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:27,759
singling out people i mean on the other

2537
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,000
side of it singling out people

2538
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:32,719
has all kinds of you know whether it's

2539
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,760
for academy awards or for this

2540
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:37,439
have unfairness and arbitrariness and so

2541
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,880
forth and so on so

2542
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:40,719
uh

2543
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,319
you know that's the other side of the

2544
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,960
coin jessica said especially with the

2545
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:46,799
huge experimental projects like this

2546
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,719
you know it's a large team

2547
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,960
and it does the nature of the nobel

2548
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:53,119
prizes singles out a few individuals to

2549
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:55,520
represent the team yeah

2550
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:59,039
nevertheless is a beautiful thing uh

2551
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,280
what are ways to improve ligo in the

2552
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:03,039
future increase the sensitivity

2553
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:04,479
i've seen a few ideas that are kind of

2554
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:06,560
fascinating

2555
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:08,479
is are you interested in them

2556
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,239
sort of looking i'm not speaking about

2557
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:12,238
five years perhaps you could speak to

2558
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:13,678
the next five years but also the next

2559
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:16,319
hundred years

2560
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:18,880
yeah so let me let me talk to both the

2561
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:21,039
instrument and the science okay

2562
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,719
so that's they go hand in hand i mean

2563
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:23,760
the thing that i said is if we make it

2564
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:26,880
better

2565
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:29,840
we see more kinds of weaker objects and

2566
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:32,000
we do astronomy okay

2567
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:33,600
we're very motivated to make a new

2568
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,238
instrument

2569
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,159
which will be a big step the next step

2570
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:39,198
like making a new kind of telescope or

2571
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:41,039
something

2572
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:42,960
and

2573
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:44,399
the ideas of what that instrument should

2574
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,239
be uh

2575
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:48,158
haven't converged yet there's different

2576
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:51,039
ideas in europe they've done more work

2577
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:51,039
to kind of

2578
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:55,279
develop the ideas

2579
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:56,559
but they're different from ours and we

2580
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:57,359
have ideas

2581
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,880
so

2582
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:00,960
but i think over the next few years

2583
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,639
we'll develop those

2584
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:04,639
the idea is to make an instrument that's

2585
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:05,840
at least 10 times better than what we

2586
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:07,760
have

2587
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,360
what we can do with this instrument 10

2588
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:11,840
times better than that

2589
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:14,079
10 times better means you can look 10

2590
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:16,719
times further out

2591
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:18,079
10 times further out is a thousand times

2592
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:20,880
more volume

2593
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:23,760
so you're seeing much much more of the

2594
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:24,560
universe the big change

2595
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,800
is

2596
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,960
that if you can see far out you far you

2597
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,560
see further back in history yeah you're

2598
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,399
traveling back in time

2599
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:34,480
yeah and so

2600
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:37,599
we can start to do what we call

2601
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:39,198
cosmology instead of a astronomy or

2602
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,520
astrophysics

2603
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:43,359
cosmology is really the study of the

2604
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:46,800
evolution of the

2605
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:50,559
oh interesting yeah yeah and uh so then

2606
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:53,920
you can start to hope to get to the

2607
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,719
important problems having to do with uh

2608
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,679
how

2609
01:33:54,719 --> 01:34:00,158
the universe began how it evolved and so

2610
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:02,158
forth which we really

2611
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:03,679
only study now with

2612
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:06,319
optical

2613
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:08,239
instruments or

2614
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:11,359
electromagnetic waves

2615
01:34:08,238 --> 01:34:13,039
and early in the universe those were

2616
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:15,759
blocked because

2617
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:17,679
basically it wasn't transparent so the

2618
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,000
photons couldn't get out

2619
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:21,920
when everything was too dense what do

2620
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,600
you think sorry on this tangent what do

2621
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,359
you think an understanding of

2622
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,199
gravitational waves from earlier in the

2623
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:29,039
universe can help us understand about

2624
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:32,638
the big bang and all that stuff yeah

2625
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:34,000
that's that's so but it's a non

2626
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:36,079
it's a it's a

2627
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,679
it's another perspective on the thing is

2628
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:39,679
is there some insights you think could

2629
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:42,239
be revealed just to

2630
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:43,760
help a layman understand sure first we

2631
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:45,919
don't understand we use the word big

2632
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,719
bang we don't understand the physics of

2633
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:50,239
what the big bang itself was

2634
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,079
uh

2635
01:34:50,238 --> 01:34:53,439
so i think

2636
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:55,679
my my

2637
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:57,678
and in the early stage there were

2638
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:01,440
particles and there was a huge amount of

2639
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:03,039
gravity and mass being made and so

2640
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:04,638
uh

2641
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:07,600
the big

2642
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:10,000
the so i'll say two things one is

2643
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,000
how did it all start how did it happen

2644
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,560
and i'll give you at least one example

2645
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,679
that we don't understand what we should

2646
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,600
understand

2647
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,480
we don't know why we're here

2648
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,400
yes

2649
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:22,879
no we do not

2650
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:25,920
i don't mean it philosophically

2651
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,760
i mean in terms of physics okay

2652
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,719
now what do i mean by that if i go into

2653
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,880
my laboratory at cern or somewhere and i

2654
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:35,520
collide particles together put energy

2655
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:37,760
together i make as much antimatter as

2656
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:40,560
matter right

2657
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:42,480
antimatter then annihilates matter and

2658
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,800
makes energy so

2659
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:47,039
in the early universe there

2660
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,560
you made somehow

2661
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:51,039
somehow

2662
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:53,520
a lot of matter and anti-matter but

2663
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:55,519
there was an asymmetry somehow there was

2664
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,679
more matter and anti-matter

2665
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:59,520
that matter and anti-minor annihilated

2666
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,679
each other at least that's what we think

2667
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:04,080
and there was matt only matter left over

2668
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:05,840
and we live in a universe that we see

2669
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:08,158
that's all matter

2670
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:09,760
we don't have any idea we have an ideas

2671
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:12,158
but we don't have any

2672
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:14,000
we don't have any way to understand that

2673
01:36:12,158 --> 01:36:15,198
at the present time with the physics

2674
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,359
that we know

2675
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:19,198
can ask a dumb question does

2676
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:21,839
anti-matter

2677
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:24,879
have anything like a gravitational field

2678
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:26,079
to uh send signals

2679
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:29,039
so

2680
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:30,319
how how does this asymmetry of matter

2681
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:32,880
anti-matter

2682
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:34,960
could be investigated or further

2683
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,800
understood by observing gravitational

2684
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:40,000
fields or weirdnesses in gravitational

2685
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:43,920
fields i i think that

2686
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:46,000
in principle if there were you know

2687
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,480
anti-neutron stars instead of just

2688
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,639
neutron stars we would see

2689
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:52,718
different kinds of signals but

2690
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:55,039
it didn't get to that it's we live in a

2691
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:56,960
universe that we've done enough looking

2692
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:59,039
because we don't see anti-pro matter

2693
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:02,000
anti-protons anywhere no matter what we

2694
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:04,000
look at that it's all made out of matter

2695
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,399
there is no antimatter except we go in

2696
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,600
our laboratories

2697
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:09,279
so

2698
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,520
but when we go in our laboratories we

2699
01:37:09,279 --> 01:37:12,719
make as much antimatter as matter so

2700
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,480
there's something about the early

2701
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:16,880
universe that made this

2702
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:19,519
asymmetry so we can't even explain why

2703
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:22,400
we're here that's what i meant yeah

2704
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:24,480
physic physics-wise not you know

2705
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:26,158
uh not in terms of

2706
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:29,039
how we evolved and all that kind of

2707
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:32,319
stuff so uh so there might be

2708
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:32,319
inklings of uh

2709
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:36,639
of some of the physics

2710
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:39,039
that uh gravitational so so

2711
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:41,440
gravitational waves don't get obstructed

2712
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:43,679
like light so i said light only goes to

2713
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:45,678
300 000 years so it goes back to the

2714
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:47,520
beginning so if you could study the

2715
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:49,359
early universe with gravitational waves

2716
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,800
we can't do that yet

2717
01:37:49,359 --> 01:37:52,639
then

2718
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,360
it took 400 years to be able to do that

2719
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:55,199
with

2720
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:57,359
optical but

2721
01:37:55,198 --> 01:38:00,399
then you can really understand the very

2722
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:03,279
maybe understand the very early universe

2723
01:38:00,399 --> 01:38:05,118
so in terms of uh

2724
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:07,759
questions like

2725
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:11,039
why we're here or what the big bang was

2726
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:12,960
um we should be we can in principle

2727
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:14,158
study that with gravitational waves so

2728
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,480
to keep

2729
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:18,638
moving in this direction it's a unique

2730
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:20,799
kind of uh way

2731
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:23,199
to understand our universe do you think

2732
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,199
there's more nobel prize level ideas to

2733
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:27,118
be discovered in relation to

2734
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:29,599
i'd be shocked if their gravitational

2735
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:31,279
waves if there isn't uh not even going

2736
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,400
to that which is a very long range

2737
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:34,238
problem but

2738
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:35,359
i think that

2739
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:36,238
we only

2740
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:38,479
see

2741
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:41,359
with electromagnetic waves four percent

2742
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:41,359
of what's out there

2743
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:47,039
there must be we looked for things that

2744
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:49,760
we knew should be there

2745
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:49,760
there should be

2746
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:57,440
i would be shocked if there wasn't

2747
01:38:54,560 --> 01:39:00,159
physics objects science

2748
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:02,719
and with gravity that doesn't show up in

2749
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:04,638
everything we do with telescopes so

2750
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:07,679
i think we're just

2751
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:10,400
limited by not having powerful enough

2752
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:12,319
instruments yet to do this

2753
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:15,039
do you have a preference i keep seeing

2754
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:17,118
this uh

2755
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:18,238
e-lisa idea

2756
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,920
yeah

2757
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:21,919
is it

2758
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:25,520
do you have a preference for

2759
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:28,079
earthbound or space-faring

2760
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:30,800
mechanisms for they're complementary

2761
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:32,639
it's a little bit more signal it's a

2762
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:35,119
it's completely analogous to what's been

2763
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:37,279
done in astronomy right so astronomy

2764
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:41,519
from the time of galileo

2765
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:43,759
was done with uh visible light yeah

2766
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,760
a strong the big advances in astronomy

2767
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,920
in the last 50 years are because we have

2768
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:49,840
instruments that look at the infrared

2769
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:52,399
microwave

2770
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,400
ultraviolet and so forth so

2771
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:56,638
looking at different wavelengths has

2772
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:57,920
been important basically going into

2773
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:59,760
space

2774
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:02,319
means that we'll look at instead of the

2775
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:04,239
audio band which we look at as we said

2776
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:06,479
on the ear surface we'll look at lower

2777
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:08,879
frequencies it's so it's completely

2778
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:10,959
complementary and it starts to be

2779
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:14,319
looking at different frequencies just

2780
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:16,079
like we do with astronomy isn't it

2781
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:18,399
it seems almost incredible to me

2782
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:21,760
engineering-wise just like on earth to

2783
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:24,719
send something that's kilometers across

2784
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:26,000
into uh into space is that is it harder

2785
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:28,399
to engineer

2786
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,118
then it actually is a little different

2787
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:33,039
it's three satellites

2788
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:34,960
separated by hundreds of thousands of

2789
01:40:33,039 --> 01:40:37,279
kilometers

2790
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,239
and they send a laser beam from one to

2791
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:39,519
the other

2792
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:40,799
and uh

2793
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,960
if they

2794
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,960
the distance if the triangle changes

2795
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,480
shape a little bit they detect that from

2796
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:49,359
the gravity the passage did you say

2797
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:51,769
hundreds of thousands of kilometers yeah

2798
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:55,170
sending lasers to each other

2799
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:55,170
[Laughter]

2800
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:59,360
okay it's just engineering

2801
01:40:57,149 --> 01:41:02,158
[Laughter]

2802
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:03,519
uh is is possible though

2803
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:05,839
yes

2804
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,840
okay

2805
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:10,400
uh that's that's just incredible because

2806
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,560
they have to maintain i mean the

2807
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:14,559
precision here is probably there there

2808
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:16,719
might be some more what is it maybe

2809
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,880
noise is a smaller problem

2810
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:21,760
i guess there's no vibration to do

2811
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:23,279
to worry about like seismic stuff

2812
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:25,039
so getting away from earth maybe you get

2813
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:26,559
away from yeah those parts are easier

2814
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:28,800
they don't have to measure it as

2815
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:32,159
accurately at low frequencies

2816
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:34,560
uh but they have um a lot of tough

2817
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:35,759
engineering problems the

2818
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,960
the

2819
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:41,679
in order to detect that the

2820
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,560
the uh gravitational waves affect things

2821
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,800
the

2822
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:47,280
sensors have to be what we call free

2823
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:49,119
masses just like ours are isolated from

2824
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:51,039
the earth they have to isolate it from

2825
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:53,439
the satellite

2826
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:55,118
and that's a hard problem they have to

2827
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:56,158
do that pretty not as well as we have to

2828
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:58,079
do it but

2829
01:41:56,158 --> 01:42:00,319
very well and

2830
01:41:58,079 --> 01:42:02,479
they've done a test mission and the

2831
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:05,279
engineering seems to be

2832
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:07,118
at least in principle in hand

2833
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:09,599
this will be in the twenty thirties

2834
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:11,839
twenty thirties yeah

2835
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:14,400
this is incredible this is uh

2836
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:18,000
this is this is incredible uh

2837
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:21,118
let me ask about black holes um yeah so

2838
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,960
what we're talking about is observing

2839
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:24,719
uh

2840
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:27,279
orbiting black holes

2841
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:29,760
uh that i get i saw the terminology of

2842
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:31,359
like binary black hole systems

2843
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:32,800
is that's that's when the the one that's

2844
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:34,799
when they're dancing

2845
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,800
okay going around each other just like

2846
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,719
the earth around the sun okay is that

2847
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,079
weird that there's black holes going

2848
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,960
around each other

2849
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:45,279
so the finding binary systems of stars

2850
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:48,239
is similar to finding binary systems of

2851
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:48,960
uh black holes well they were once stars

2852
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:51,198
so

2853
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:52,158
um

2854
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:53,439
so

2855
01:42:52,158 --> 01:42:55,039
we haven't

2856
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:56,638
said what what a black hole is

2857
01:42:55,039 --> 01:42:57,679
physically yet yeah so what's a black

2858
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:59,840
hole so

2859
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:02,000
black hole is a is first it's a

2860
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,840
mathematical concept or a physical

2861
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,520
concept and that is

2862
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,480
a region of space

2863
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:11,040
so it's simply a region of space where

2864
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:14,399
the curvature of space-time meaning the

2865
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:16,880
gravitational field is so strong

2866
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:18,960
that nothing can get out yeah

2867
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:21,279
including light

2868
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:24,079
and there's light gets bent

2869
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:26,639
in gravitational if the gravitations if

2870
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:28,960
the space time is warped enough and so

2871
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:31,520
even light gets bent around and stays in

2872
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:33,118
it so that's concept of a black hole so

2873
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:35,840
it's not a f

2874
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:37,679
and maybe you can make maybe it's a

2875
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:40,400
that's a concept

2876
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:42,480
that didn't say how they come about

2877
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:47,519
and there could be different ways they

2878
01:43:42,479 --> 01:43:50,158
come about the ones that we are seeing

2879
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,760
there's a we're not sure

2880
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:54,079
it's what we're trying to learn now is

2881
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:55,679
what they but the general

2882
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:57,439
expectation

2883
01:43:55,679 --> 01:44:00,079
is that they come

2884
01:43:57,439 --> 01:44:02,000
at the bl these black holes happen when

2885
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:03,679
a star dies

2886
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,118
so what does that mean that a star dies

2887
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:08,399
what happens

2888
01:44:05,118 --> 01:44:08,399
a star like our sun

2889
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:13,920
basically makes heat and light by fusion

2890
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:17,600
it's made of

2891
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:19,679
and as it burns it burns up the hydrogen

2892
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:22,079
and then the helium and then

2893
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:24,399
and slowly works its way up to the

2894
01:44:22,079 --> 01:44:25,760
heavier and heavier elements that are in

2895
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:28,319
the star

2896
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,560
and when it gets up to iron the fusion

2897
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:32,719
process doesn't work anymore

2898
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,400
and so the stars die

2899
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:35,520
and that happens to stars and then they

2900
01:44:34,399 --> 01:44:37,839
do

2901
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,639
what's called a supernova what happens

2902
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:40,880
then

2903
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:43,679
is that a star is a delicate balance

2904
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,719
between an outward pressure from fusion

2905
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:46,239
and

2906
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:49,198
light and burning

2907
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:51,039
and an inward pressure of gravity trying

2908
01:44:49,198 --> 01:44:53,839
to pull the

2909
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:54,960
masses together once it burns itself out

2910
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,679
it goes

2911
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:00,319
and it collapses and that's a supernova

2912
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:02,639
when it collapses all the mass that was

2913
01:45:00,319 --> 01:45:03,840
there is in a very much smaller

2914
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:07,359
space

2915
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:09,440
and if a star if you do the calculations

2916
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:11,679
if a star is big enough

2917
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:15,198
that can create a strong enough

2918
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:17,118
gravitational field to make a black hole

2919
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:19,118
our sun won't

2920
01:45:17,118 --> 01:45:21,599
it's too small too small

2921
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:24,719
and we don't know exactly

2922
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:27,679
what it but it's usually thought that a

2923
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:29,600
star has to be at least three times

2924
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:30,960
as big as our sun

2925
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,960
to make a black hole but that's the

2926
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,840
physical way there you can make black

2927
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:37,600
holes

2928
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:37,600
that's the first um

2929
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,840
explanation that one would give for the

2930
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:44,559
for what we see

2931
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:47,119
but it's not necessarily true we're not

2932
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:49,199
sure yet what we see in terms of for the

2933
01:45:47,118 --> 01:45:50,960
origins of black holes no the black

2934
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:53,118
holes that we see

2935
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:55,520
in gravitational waves so the but you're

2936
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:57,920
also looking for the ones who are binary

2937
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:59,760
solar systems like so they're binary

2938
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:01,760
systems but they could have been made

2939
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,600
from binary stars so there's binary

2940
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,440
stars around so that's

2941
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,520
that's so so that's so this first

2942
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:09,759
explanation is that that's what they are

2943
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,360
gotcha um

2944
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:13,840
other

2945
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:15,920
explanati but but what we see

2946
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:19,279
has some puzzles this is kind of the way

2947
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:20,480
science works i guess yeah um

2948
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:22,559
we see

2949
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:23,759
heavier ones

2950
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,119
than

2951
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:28,719
up to

2952
01:46:25,118 --> 01:46:31,839
we've seen one system that was 140 times

2953
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:34,960
the mass of our own sun

2954
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:36,719
that's not believed to be possible

2955
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:39,760
with the

2956
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:42,319
parent being a big star because big

2957
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:47,119
stars can only be so big

2958
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:48,559
uh or they uh are unstable it's just the

2959
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:51,198
the fact that they live in an

2960
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:52,159
environment that makes them unstable

2961
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:53,839
so

2962
01:46:52,158 --> 01:46:54,799
uh the fact that we see bigger ones they

2963
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,440
maybe

2964
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:59,600
come from something else it's possible

2965
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:02,638
that they were

2966
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:04,480
uh made in a different way by

2967
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:06,239
little ones eating each other up or

2968
01:47:04,479 --> 01:47:09,439
maybe they were made

2969
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:11,599
or maybe they came with the big bang the

2970
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:13,279
prime what we call primordial which

2971
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:15,760
means they're really different they came

2972
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:17,599
from that we don't know at this point if

2973
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:19,039
they came with a big bang then maybe

2974
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:21,600
they account for

2975
01:47:19,039 --> 01:47:23,198
what we call dark matter or some of it

2976
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:25,039
like there was a lot of them if they

2977
01:47:23,198 --> 01:47:27,359
came with them and yeah because there's

2978
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:29,840
a lot of dark matter yeah

2979
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:32,880
but uh will gravitational waves give you

2980
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:34,719
any kind of an um intuition about the

2981
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,760
origin of these oscillators we think

2982
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:39,359
that if we see um the distributions

2983
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,320
enough of them the distributions of

2984
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:42,479
their

2985
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:44,399
masses the distributions of their how

2986
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:46,319
they're spinning so we can actually

2987
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:47,198
measure when they're going around each

2988
01:47:46,319 --> 01:47:48,719
other

2989
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:50,960
whether they're spinning

2990
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:52,880
you know like this direction of the spin

2991
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:54,639
or no the orientation whether the whole

2992
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,679
system has any

2993
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:57,118
wobbles

2994
01:47:55,679 --> 01:48:00,399
what

2995
01:47:57,118 --> 01:48:01,839
so this is this is now okay

2996
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:03,839
we're doing that and then you're

2997
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:05,600
constantly kind of crawling back and

2998
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:07,840
back into and we're crawling back in

2999
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:10,639
time and seeing how many there are as we

3000
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:12,639
go back and so do they point back so

3001
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:14,159
you're like uh what is that discipline

3002
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:15,840
called cartography or something you're

3003
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:18,799
like mapping

3004
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:21,440
this the early universe

3005
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:23,360
via the lens of gravitational

3006
01:48:21,439 --> 01:48:25,599
waves not yet the early universe but at

3007
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:26,559
least back and forth earlier yeah right

3008
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,159
so

3009
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,239
um

3010
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:32,238
so black holes are this

3011
01:48:30,238 --> 01:48:34,158
mathematical phenomenon but they come

3012
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:35,279
about in different ways we have a huge

3013
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:37,439
black hole

3014
01:48:35,279 --> 01:48:38,880
at the center of our galaxy and other

3015
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:40,719
galaxies

3016
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:42,319
those probably were made some other way

3017
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:43,439
we don't know when the galaxies

3018
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:45,439
themselves

3019
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:48,319
had to do with the formation of galaxies

3020
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:50,238
we we don't really know so the fact that

3021
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:52,238
we use the word black hole

3022
01:48:50,238 --> 01:48:54,399
the origin of black holes might be quite

3023
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:55,919
different depending on

3024
01:48:54,399 --> 01:48:57,359
how they happen

3025
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,520
they just have to in the end have a

3026
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:01,198
gravitational field that will bend

3027
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:03,119
everything in

3028
01:49:01,198 --> 01:49:05,279
how do you feel about black holes as a

3029
01:49:03,118 --> 01:49:06,158
human being there's a there's this thing

3030
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:08,800
that's

3031
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:12,079
nearly infinitely dense can

3032
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:13,679
doesn't let like light escape

3033
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:16,000
isn't that kind of terrifying feels like

3034
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:18,639
the stuff in nightmares i think i think

3035
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,359
it's it's an opportunity

3036
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:22,880
to to do what exactly

3037
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:24,319
so uh

3038
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:26,079
like the early universe is an

3039
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:28,079
opportunity if i we can study the early

3040
01:49:26,079 --> 01:49:30,238
universe we can learn things like i told

3041
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:32,238
you and here again

3042
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:34,000
we have an embarrassing situation in

3043
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:36,238
physics yes

3044
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,840
we have two wonderful theories of

3045
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:40,158
physics

3046
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:42,480
one based on quantum mechanics

3047
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:44,879
quantum field theory and

3048
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:47,598
we can go to a big accelerator like at

3049
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:50,319
cern and smash particles together and

3050
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:52,719
almost explain anything that happens

3051
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:54,639
beautifully using quantum field theory

3052
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:56,719
and quantum mechanics

3053
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:58,480
then we have another theory of physics

3054
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:59,840
called general relativity which is what

3055
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:03,678
we've been talking about most of the

3056
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:05,840
time which is fantastic at describing

3057
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:07,118
uh things at high velocities long

3058
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:12,480
distances

3059
01:50:07,118 --> 01:50:12,479
you know uh and so forth so

3060
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:17,118
that's not the way it's supposed to be

3061
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:20,079
uh we're trying to create a theory of

3062
01:50:17,118 --> 01:50:22,000
physics not two theories of physics

3063
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:24,399
so we have an embarrassment that we have

3064
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,319
two different theories of physics

3065
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:28,319
people have tried to

3066
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:30,079
make a unified theory what they call a

3067
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:32,238
unified there you've heard those words

3068
01:50:30,079 --> 01:50:35,760
for decades

3069
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:38,799
they still haven't that's been primarily

3070
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:40,880
done theoretically or try they people

3071
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:44,159
actively do that

3072
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,960
my personal belief is that the

3073
01:50:44,158 --> 01:50:47,679
like

3074
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:49,760
much of physics we need some clues

3075
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:52,960
so we need some experimental evidence so

3076
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:55,039
where is there a place if we go to cern

3077
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:57,118
and do those experiments gravitational

3078
01:50:55,039 --> 01:51:00,000
waves or general relativity don't matter

3079
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:00,960
yes if we go to study you know our black

3080
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,639
holes

3081
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:05,359
elementary particle physics doesn't

3082
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:08,159
matter we're studying these huge objects

3083
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:11,039
so where might we have a place where

3084
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:13,439
both phenomena have to be satisfied an

3085
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:14,960
example is black holes inside black

3086
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:16,960
holes yeah

3087
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:19,118
so we can't do that today

3088
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,880
but when i think of black hole it's a

3089
01:51:19,118 --> 01:51:22,399
potential

3090
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:23,199
treasure chest

3091
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:25,839
of

3092
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:26,638
understanding the fundamental problems

3093
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,679
of

3094
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:29,039
physics

3095
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:31,199
and maybe

3096
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:34,399
can give us clues

3097
01:51:31,198 --> 01:51:37,519
to how we bring to the embarrassment of

3098
01:51:34,399 --> 01:51:39,198
having two theories of physics together

3099
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,880
that's my own

3100
01:51:39,198 --> 01:51:42,960
romantic what's the worst that could

3101
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:43,920
happen it's so enticing just go in and

3102
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:45,599
look

3103
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:47,520
do you think um

3104
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:49,279
how far are we away from figuring out

3105
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,639
the unified uh

3106
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:52,800
theory of physics the theory of

3107
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:53,679
everything i think what's your sense who

3108
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,679
will

3109
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:58,880
solve it like what discipline will solve

3110
01:51:55,679 --> 01:52:00,840
it yeah uh

3111
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:03,599
i i think

3112
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:07,599
uh so little

3113
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:07,599
progress has been made uh

3114
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,118
without

3115
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:13,440
more experimental clues as i said that

3116
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:17,679
we're not uh

3117
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:20,559
we're just not able to

3118
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:22,800
say that we're close without some clues

3119
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:23,840
the best the closest

3120
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:26,079
the most

3121
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:28,639
popular theory these days that might

3122
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:29,840
lead to that is called string theory

3123
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:31,520
yeah

3124
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:32,560
the problem with string theory is it

3125
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:34,560
works

3126
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,440
uh it solves a lot of beautiful

3127
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:39,360
mathematical problems we have in physics

3128
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:41,359
and uh

3129
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:42,399
and uh

3130
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:43,679
it's

3131
01:52:42,399 --> 01:52:46,319
it's uh

3132
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:49,039
very satisfying theoretically

3133
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:52,079
but it has almost no predictive

3134
01:52:49,039 --> 01:52:54,960
maybe no predictive ability because

3135
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:56,559
it is a theory that works in 11

3136
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,800
dimensions

3137
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:01,920
we live in a physical world of

3138
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:04,400
three space and one time dimension

3139
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:07,679
in order to make predictions

3140
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:09,839
in our world with string theory you have

3141
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:10,840
to somehow get rid of these other

3142
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:14,000
seven

3143
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:16,239
dimensions that's done mathematically by

3144
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,319
saying they curl up on each other on

3145
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:19,678
scales that are too small to affect

3146
01:53:18,319 --> 01:53:21,920
anything here

3147
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:24,000
but how you do that and that's okay

3148
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,800
that's an okay argument but how you do

3149
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,439
that

3150
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:28,960
is not unique

3151
01:53:27,439 --> 01:53:31,439
so that means if i start with that

3152
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:33,920
theory and i go to our world here i

3153
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:35,118
can't uniquely go to it

3154
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,279
and if i can't

3155
01:53:35,118 --> 01:53:39,039
it's not predictive and that's that's

3156
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:41,439
actually and that's a killer that's a

3157
01:53:39,039 --> 01:53:43,198
killer and string theory is it seems

3158
01:53:41,439 --> 01:53:45,359
like from my outsider's perspective has

3159
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:47,198
lost favor over the years perhaps

3160
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:50,158
because of this very it's a lack of

3161
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:52,238
predictive power i mean that science

3162
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:54,399
has to connect to something where you

3163
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:56,879
make predictions as beautiful

3164
01:53:54,399 --> 01:53:59,679
as it as it might be so i don't think

3165
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:00,639
we're close i think we need

3166
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:03,279
some

3167
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:05,679
experimental clues it may be

3168
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:07,519
that information on

3169
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:09,920
something we don't understand presently

3170
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:12,000
at all like dark energy or

3171
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:14,399
probably not dark matter but dark energy

3172
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,198
or something might give us some ideas

3173
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:17,039
but

3174
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:20,079
i i don't think we're

3175
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:25,039
i can't envision right now

3176
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:27,439
um in the short term meaning you know

3177
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:29,439
the horizon that we can see

3178
01:54:27,439 --> 01:54:31,598
how we're gonna uh bring these two

3179
01:54:29,439 --> 01:54:33,919
theories together

3180
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:36,159
a kind of um

3181
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:38,000
two-part question maybe just asking the

3182
01:54:36,158 --> 01:54:40,079
same thing in two different ways

3183
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,158
one one question is

3184
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:44,800
do you have hope that humans

3185
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:47,759
will colonize

3186
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:50,239
the uh the galaxy so expand out become a

3187
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:52,480
multi-planetary species another way of

3188
01:54:50,238 --> 01:54:54,399
asking that from a gravitational and a

3189
01:54:52,479 --> 01:54:56,158
propulsion perspective do you think

3190
01:54:54,399 --> 01:54:57,839
we'll come up with ways to travel close

3191
01:54:56,158 --> 01:54:59,679
to the speed of light or maybe faster

3192
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:01,679
than the speed of light

3193
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:04,480
which would make it a whole heck of a

3194
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:06,000
lot easier to to expand out into the

3195
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:06,959
into the universe

3196
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,198
yeah

3197
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,198
uh

3198
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:13,520
well i think

3199
01:55:12,079 --> 01:55:15,920
you know we're not

3200
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:18,960
that's a very futuristic i think we're

3201
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:22,399
not that far from being able to

3202
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:24,560
make a one-way trip to mars

3203
01:55:22,399 --> 01:55:27,759
that's a that's then a

3204
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,760
question of uh

3205
01:55:28,158 --> 01:55:31,920
whether people are willing to send

3206
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,679
somebody on a one-way trip but oh i

3207
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:36,079
think they are i think there's a lot of

3208
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:37,920
exp the explorers burn bright and with

3209
01:55:36,079 --> 01:55:39,279
their hearts yeah exactly people wanting

3210
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:41,440
to die so

3211
01:55:39,279 --> 01:55:44,238
the opportunity to to explore new

3212
01:55:41,439 --> 01:55:47,519
territory yeah so uh

3213
01:55:44,238 --> 01:55:49,759
you know with this this recent

3214
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:51,199
landing on mars is pretty impressive

3215
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:53,840
they have a little helicopter that can

3216
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:56,079
fly around you can imagine

3217
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:58,880
you can imagine in the not too distant

3218
01:55:56,079 --> 01:56:02,079
future that you could have i don't think

3219
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:04,800
civilizations colonizing i can envision

3220
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:06,238
but i i can envision something more like

3221
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,159
the south pole

3222
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:10,559
we haven't colonized

3223
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:13,118
antarctica because it's

3224
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:14,639
all ice and cold and so forth but we

3225
01:56:13,118 --> 01:56:17,598
have

3226
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:19,679
uh stations so we have a station that's

3227
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:20,960
self-sustaining at the south pole that

3228
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:23,679
i've been there

3229
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:24,960
it has oh really yeah

3230
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:26,399
what's that like

3231
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,719
uh and

3232
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:31,759
because that there's parallels there

3233
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:33,279
to go to mars it's fantastic it is

3234
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:36,480
what's the journey like

3235
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:38,800
the journey involves going uh the south

3236
01:56:36,479 --> 01:56:40,559
pole station is uh run

3237
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:42,880
in the u.s by

3238
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:45,599
by the national science foundation

3239
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:47,840
i went because i was on the national

3240
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:49,360
science board that runs the national

3241
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:51,520
science foundation

3242
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:54,319
and so you get a vip trip if you're

3243
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:55,360
healthy enough to the south pole to

3244
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:57,920
see it

3245
01:56:55,359 --> 01:57:03,118
uh which i took uh

3246
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:03,118
you fly from the u.s to australia to to

3247
01:57:03,279 --> 01:57:06,960
christchurch in australia southern

3248
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:08,560
australia

3249
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:11,039
and

3250
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:12,960
from there you fly to mcmurdo station

3251
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:15,519
which is on the coast and it's the

3252
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:17,760
station with about a thousand people

3253
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:19,920
right on the coast of antarctica

3254
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:21,760
uh it's about a

3255
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:24,719
seven or eight hour flight and they

3256
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,920
can't predict the weather so when when i

3257
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:28,639
flew from

3258
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:30,239
christchurch to mcmurdo station they

3259
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:31,760
tell you in advance you do it in a

3260
01:57:30,238 --> 01:57:34,238
military

3261
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:36,079
aircraft they tell you in advance that

3262
01:57:34,238 --> 01:57:38,079
they can't predict whether they can land

3263
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:39,359
because they have to land on uh

3264
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:41,679
reassuring

3265
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:44,880
yeah and so about

3266
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:46,719
halfway the pilot got on and said uh

3267
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:49,199
sorry this is uh they call it a

3268
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:50,800
boomerang flight you know boomerang goes

3269
01:57:49,198 --> 01:57:52,879
out and goes back

3270
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:54,960
so we had to stay a little while in

3271
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:55,679
christchurch but then we eventually went

3272
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:58,399
to

3273
01:57:55,679 --> 01:58:00,800
mcmurdo station and then

3274
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:02,719
flew to the south pole the south pole

3275
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:03,920
itself

3276
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:07,599
is

3277
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:09,599
when i was there was minus 51 degrees

3278
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:11,279
that was summer

3279
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:13,199
uh

3280
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:15,759
it uh

3281
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:18,479
zero humidity

3282
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,480
and uh

3283
01:58:19,439 --> 01:58:24,479
and it's about

3284
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:26,159
11 000 feet altitude

3285
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:28,000
because it's

3286
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:29,839
never warm enough for anything to melt

3287
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,920
so it doesn't snow very much but it's

3288
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:34,639
about 11 000 feet

3289
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:36,560
of snowpack so you land in a place

3290
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:37,440
that's high altitude

3291
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:39,039
um

3292
01:58:37,439 --> 01:58:42,719
cold as could be

3293
01:58:39,039 --> 01:58:44,319
and dry and incredibly dry

3294
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:46,399
which means you have a physical

3295
01:58:44,319 --> 01:58:48,319
adjustment

3296
01:58:46,399 --> 01:58:50,719
the

3297
01:58:48,319 --> 01:58:53,519
place itself is uh

3298
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:55,599
it's fantastic they have this great

3299
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:57,440
station there they they do astronomy at

3300
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:58,560
the south pole nature wise is it

3301
01:58:57,439 --> 01:59:01,198
beautiful

3302
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:03,840
what's the is what's the experience like

3303
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:06,719
or is it like visiting any town

3304
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:08,639
no it's very small there's only um

3305
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:09,679
less than 100 people there even when i

3306
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:10,639
was there

3307
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:12,000
you know

3308
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:14,560
there were about

3309
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:18,238
50 or 60 there and in the winter there's

3310
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:21,360
less half of that their winter when yeah

3311
01:59:18,238 --> 01:59:23,359
it's real cold it gets really cold yeah

3312
01:59:21,359 --> 01:59:26,559
and but it's but it's

3313
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:28,158
it's a station i i think

3314
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:30,719
and that's

3315
01:59:28,158 --> 01:59:32,799
i mean we haven't gone beyond that uh

3316
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:35,279
on the coast of antarctica they have

3317
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:38,079
greenhouses and they're self-sustaining

3318
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:40,319
in mcmurdo station but we haven't really

3319
01:59:38,079 --> 01:59:42,399
settled more than

3320
01:59:40,319 --> 01:59:44,238
that kind of thing in antarctica which

3321
01:59:42,399 --> 01:59:46,559
is a big

3322
01:59:44,238 --> 01:59:46,559
uh

3323
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:50,239
a country or you know

3324
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:52,158
a

3325
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:53,919
big plot a big

3326
01:59:52,158 --> 01:59:55,359
piece of land so

3327
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:57,520
i don't

3328
01:59:55,359 --> 02:00:00,238
i can't envision kind of

3329
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:03,360
colonizing at people living so much as

3330
02:00:00,238 --> 02:00:03,359
much as i can see

3331
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:08,239
the equivalent of the south pole station

3332
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,520
well in the computing world there's a

3333
02:00:08,238 --> 02:00:11,118
idea of

3334
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,599
you know backing up your data and then

3335
02:00:11,118 --> 02:00:15,519
you want to do off-site backup

3336
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:17,199
uh you know to make sure that if the

3337
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:19,520
whole thing burn if your whole house

3338
02:00:17,198 --> 02:00:21,519
burns down then you can have a backup

3339
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:24,480
offsite of the data i think the

3340
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:27,520
difference between antarctica and

3341
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:29,439
and mars is mars is a off-site backup

3342
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:31,679
that if we have nuclear war whatever the

3343
02:00:29,439 --> 02:00:34,000
heck might happen here on earth it'd be

3344
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:35,599
nice to have a backup elsewhere and uh

3345
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:38,399
be nice to have a large enough colony

3346
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:39,440
where we sent a variety of people except

3347
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:43,198
like

3348
02:00:39,439 --> 02:00:45,598
uh a few silly astronauts and suits you

3349
02:00:43,198 --> 02:00:48,158
know have an actual vibrant

3350
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:50,560
um get a few get a few musicians and

3351
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:51,839
artists up there get a few uh

3352
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:53,840
maybe like one or two computer

3353
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,360
scientists those are essential maybe

3354
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:57,360
even a physicist so

3355
02:00:55,359 --> 02:00:59,519
i'm not sure yeah maybe not

3356
02:00:57,359 --> 02:01:01,439
so that comes back to something you

3357
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:04,000
talked about earlier which is fermi the

3358
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:06,719
paradox family's paradox because you

3359
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,520
talked about having to escape yeah

3360
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:10,079
but

3361
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:12,320
and so the missing one one number you

3362
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:14,319
don't know how to use in fermi's

3363
02:01:12,319 --> 02:01:17,198
calculation or drake who's done it

3364
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:18,319
better is how long do civilizations last

3365
02:01:17,198 --> 02:01:19,439
yeah

3366
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:21,439
before they

3367
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:23,598
are we you know we've barely gotten to

3368
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:25,919
where we can communicate with

3369
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:28,159
electricity and magnetism and maybe

3370
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:29,840
we'll wipe ourselves out pretty soon so

3371
02:01:28,158 --> 02:01:31,198
are you hopeful in general like you

3372
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:32,880
think we've got another couple hundred

3373
02:01:31,198 --> 02:01:35,359
years at least

3374
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:39,440
or are you worried

3375
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:40,960
well i and no i'm i'm i'm hopeful but i

3376
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:42,000
don't know if i'm hopeful in the long

3377
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,679
term

3378
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,880
you know if you say

3379
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:47,118
you know

3380
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:49,199
uh

3381
02:01:47,118 --> 02:01:51,598
are we able to

3382
02:01:49,198 --> 02:01:54,479
to go for another couple thousand years

3383
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:56,560
i'm not sure i you know i think

3384
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:58,479
we have where we where we started the

3385
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:59,760
fact that we can do things that don't

3386
02:01:58,479 --> 02:02:01,759
allow us to

3387
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:03,440
kind of keep going or there can be

3388
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:05,520
whether it you know ends up being a

3389
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:07,439
virus that we create or

3390
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:09,520
ends up being the equivalent of nuclear

3391
02:02:07,439 --> 02:02:11,118
war or something else

3392
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:12,880
it's not clear that we can control

3393
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:15,439
things well enough

3394
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:19,279
so speaking of really cold conditions

3395
02:02:15,439 --> 02:02:21,439
and uh not being hopeful and eventual

3396
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:22,960
suffering and destruction of the human

3397
02:02:21,439 --> 02:02:24,479
species let's let me ask you about

3398
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:26,480
russian literature

3399
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:29,598
you mentioned uh how's that for

3400
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:30,959
transition i'm doing my best here you uh

3401
02:02:29,599 --> 02:02:32,560
you mentioned that you used to love

3402
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:33,840
literature when you were younger and you

3403
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:35,520
were even

3404
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:36,880
or hoping to be

3405
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:38,159
a writer yourself that was the

3406
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:40,079
motivation

3407
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:41,359
and some of the books i've seen that you

3408
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:42,559
listed

3409
02:02:41,359 --> 02:02:45,759
that were

3410
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:48,400
inspiring to you was was from russian

3411
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:50,719
literature like uh i think tolstoy

3412
02:02:48,399 --> 02:02:53,519
dostoyevsky solzhenitsyn

3413
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:55,439
yeah right um maybe in general you can

3414
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:57,360
speak to your fascination with russian

3415
02:02:55,439 --> 02:02:59,839
literature or yeah in general will you

3416
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:01,279
pick up from those all

3417
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:02,960
not surprised you picked up on the

3418
02:03:01,279 --> 02:03:05,759
russian literature i'm sorry your

3419
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,960
background but

3420
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:08,560
uh

3421
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:10,000
when i when when i you should be

3422
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:11,840
surprised i didn't make the entire

3423
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:15,840
conversation about this that's that's

3424
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,840
the real surprise when when

3425
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,920
i didn't really

3426
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:21,439
become a

3427
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:23,359
physicist or

3428
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:26,000
want to go in science until i started

3429
02:03:23,359 --> 02:03:28,399
college so when i was younger i

3430
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:30,238
i was good at math and that kind of

3431
02:03:28,399 --> 02:03:32,399
stuff but i didn't really i came from a

3432
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:35,198
family nobody went to college and i

3433
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:37,198
didn't have any mentors

3434
02:03:35,198 --> 02:03:39,839
so but i'd like to read when i was

3435
02:03:37,198 --> 02:03:42,479
really young and so when i was very

3436
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:44,719
young i i read i always carried around a

3437
02:03:42,479 --> 02:03:46,079
pocketbook and read it

3438
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:48,158
and uh

3439
02:03:46,079 --> 02:03:49,920
my mother read these mystery stories and

3440
02:03:48,158 --> 02:03:51,759
i got bored by those eventually and then

3441
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:55,199
i discovered real literature i don't

3442
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:57,360
know what age but about 12 or 13.

3443
02:03:55,198 --> 02:03:59,279
and so then i started reading

3444
02:03:57,359 --> 02:04:01,598
uh good literature and there's nothing

3445
02:03:59,279 --> 02:04:03,359
better than russian literature of course

3446
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:04,480
and like reading

3447
02:04:03,359 --> 02:04:07,439
reading

3448
02:04:04,479 --> 02:04:09,359
good literature so i

3449
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:10,479
i

3450
02:04:09,359 --> 02:04:13,759
read

3451
02:04:10,479 --> 02:04:15,439
quite a bit of russian literature

3452
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:19,280
at that time

3453
02:04:15,439 --> 02:04:21,039
and so you asked me about the well

3454
02:04:19,279 --> 02:04:23,759
i don't know i say a few words said

3455
02:04:21,039 --> 02:04:24,960
dostoevsky so what what about dostoevsky

3456
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:27,360
for me

3457
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,359
um

3458
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:32,719
dostoevsky was important

3459
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:34,158
into i mean i've read a lot of

3460
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:36,639
literature because it's kind of the

3461
02:04:34,158 --> 02:04:39,598
other thing i do with my life and

3462
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:41,359
he made two incredible in addition to

3463
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:44,480
his own literature

3464
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:45,519
he influenced literature tremendously by

3465
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:46,479
having

3466
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:49,119
uh

3467
02:04:46,479 --> 02:04:52,000
i don't know how to pronounce polyphony

3468
02:04:49,118 --> 02:04:53,118
so he's the first real serious author

3469
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,319
that had

3470
02:04:53,118 --> 02:04:56,319
multiple narrators

3471
02:04:56,719 --> 02:05:00,239
and that's a that he absolutely is the

3472
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:03,759
first

3473
02:05:00,238 --> 02:05:03,759
and he also was the first

3474
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:08,800
he began existential literature

3475
02:05:07,279 --> 02:05:11,039
so

3476
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:12,719
the most important book that i've read

3477
02:05:11,039 --> 02:05:14,399
in the last year when i've been forced

3478
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:17,118
to be isolated

3479
02:05:14,399 --> 02:05:19,439
was existential literature it was i

3480
02:05:17,118 --> 02:05:21,439
decided to reread

3481
02:05:19,439 --> 02:05:24,158
camous the plague

3482
02:05:21,439 --> 02:05:26,158
oh yeah that's a great book it's a great

3483
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:27,920
book and it's right now to read it it's

3484
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:29,118
fine i think that book is about love

3485
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:31,679
actually

3486
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:33,519
a love for his humanity it is but it has

3487
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:35,199
all the men it has all the

3488
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:37,040
you should if you haven't read it in

3489
02:05:35,198 --> 02:05:38,399
recent years i had read it before of

3490
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:40,399
course but

3491
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:42,960
to read it during this because it's

3492
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:45,519
about a plague so it's really fantastic

3493
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:47,198
to be done but that reminds me of

3494
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:49,280
you know he was a great existentialist

3495
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:51,279
but the beginning of existential

3496
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:53,599
literature was dostoevsky

3497
02:05:51,279 --> 02:05:56,158
yeah so in addition to his own you know

3498
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:58,960
great novels he had a tremendous impact

3499
02:05:56,158 --> 02:06:01,039
on on uh

3500
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:02,800
on literature and there's also for

3501
02:06:01,039 --> 02:06:04,479
dostoevsky unlike most of their

3502
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,760
existentialists

3503
02:06:04,479 --> 02:06:07,678
he was

3504
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:10,719
at least in part religious i mean their

3505
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:12,399
uh religiousity would permeated his

3506
02:06:10,719 --> 02:06:14,078
idea i mean one of my favorite books of

3507
02:06:12,399 --> 02:06:16,078
his is the idiot and

3508
02:06:14,078 --> 02:06:18,880
his which is a christ-like figure in

3509
02:06:16,078 --> 02:06:20,880
there well there's prince miskin is that

3510
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:23,359
michigan yeah yeah michigan yeah in

3511
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:25,279
michigan yeah that's that's one uh thing

3512
02:06:23,359 --> 02:06:27,519
about there you write it in english i

3513
02:06:25,279 --> 02:06:29,039
presume yeah yeah yeah so that's the

3514
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:30,560
names that's what gets a lot of people

3515
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:32,078
is there's so many names so hard to

3516
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:32,880
pronounce they have to remember all of

3517
02:06:32,078 --> 02:06:35,439
them

3518
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:37,920
it's like uh you have the same problem

3519
02:06:35,439 --> 02:06:40,638
but he was a great character so that

3520
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:41,840
yeah i kind of uh

3521
02:06:40,639 --> 02:06:43,840
i have a

3522
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:46,639
connection with him because i often

3523
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:48,078
then the title of the book

3524
02:06:46,639 --> 02:06:50,560
the idiot is

3525
02:06:48,078 --> 02:06:52,158
i kind of i often call myself an idiot

3526
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:54,480
because that's how i feel i feel so

3527
02:06:52,158 --> 02:06:56,238
naive about this world and i

3528
02:06:54,479 --> 02:06:58,078
i'm not sure

3529
02:06:56,238 --> 02:07:00,799
i'm not sure why that is maybe it's

3530
02:06:58,078 --> 02:07:01,920
genetic or so on but i

3531
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:03,840
um

3532
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:05,679
i have a of a connection the spiritual

3533
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:08,319
connection to that character to michigan

3534
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:10,158
to michigan yeah that you're just in but

3535
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:14,399
he was far from energy yet

3536
02:07:10,158 --> 02:07:16,078
no in some sense in some sense

3537
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:18,158
but in another sense

3538
02:07:16,078 --> 02:07:20,880
maybe not of this in another sense he

3539
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:22,719
was yeah i mean he was a bumbler bunker

3540
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:25,359
yeah

3541
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:27,920
but uh you also mentioned soulja nitsan

3542
02:07:25,359 --> 02:07:29,839
yeah very interesting yes he did uh and

3543
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:32,399
and he always confused me of course he

3544
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:36,000
was really uh

3545
02:07:32,399 --> 02:07:39,039
really important in uh

3546
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:41,118
writing about the

3547
02:07:39,039 --> 02:07:43,920
stalin and

3548
02:07:41,118 --> 02:07:45,679
first getting in trouble and then he

3549
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:48,560
later he is

3550
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:51,279
he he wrote about stalin in a way i

3551
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:53,119
forget what it was what the book was in

3552
02:07:51,279 --> 02:07:55,840
a way that was very

3553
02:07:53,118 --> 02:07:55,839
critical of london

3554
02:07:56,238 --> 02:07:59,359
yeah he uh he's evolved through the

3555
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:00,880
years he actually showed support for

3556
02:07:59,359 --> 02:08:02,960
putin eventually it was a very

3557
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:05,840
interesting

3558
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:08,399
uh transition he took no

3559
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:11,199
journey he took through thinking about

3560
02:08:08,399 --> 02:08:12,238
russia and the soviet union

3561
02:08:11,198 --> 02:08:16,158
but

3562
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:18,559
i think what i get from him is basic um

3563
02:08:16,158 --> 02:08:20,078
it's like uh victor franco has a man

3564
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:20,840
search for meaning i have a similar kind

3565
02:08:20,078 --> 02:08:24,639
of

3566
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:27,199
sense of um

3567
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:29,118
of the cruelty of human nature yeah

3568
02:08:27,198 --> 02:08:31,279
cruelty of indifference

3569
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:33,759
but also the ability to find happiness

3570
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:36,078
in the small joys of life

3571
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:37,679
that that's something there's nothing

3572
02:08:36,078 --> 02:08:38,960
like a prison camp that makes you

3573
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:40,960
realize

3574
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:43,520
you could still be happy with a very

3575
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:46,960
very little well yeah he was he his

3576
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:48,560
description of kind of how to make uh

3577
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:50,639
how to go through a day and actually

3578
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:51,840
enjoy it in a prison camp it's pretty

3579
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:54,239
amazing

3580
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:56,719
yeah oh and some prison camp i mean it's

3581
02:08:54,238 --> 02:08:59,118
the worst of the worst of the worst and

3582
02:08:56,719 --> 02:09:00,800
also just uh i i you know you do think

3583
02:08:59,118 --> 02:09:05,679
about

3584
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:08,560
the role of authoritarian states and um

3585
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:10,800
in you know like hopeful idealistic

3586
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:14,480
systems somehow leading to the suffering

3587
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:16,639
of millions and i you know

3588
02:09:14,479 --> 02:09:18,319
it might be arguable but i think a lot

3589
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:20,319
of people

3590
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:22,000
believe that stalin

3591
02:09:20,319 --> 02:09:23,840
i think genuinely believed that he's

3592
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,760
doing good for the world

3593
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:28,960
and uh he wasn't

3594
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:31,280
it's a very valuable lesson that

3595
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:33,679
even evil people

3596
02:09:31,279 --> 02:09:35,198
think they're doing good

3597
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:36,239
otherwise it's too difficult to do the

3598
02:09:35,198 --> 02:09:38,319
evil

3599
02:09:36,238 --> 02:09:40,638
the best way to do evil is to believe

3600
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:43,519
framing in a way like you're doing good

3601
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:47,840
and then this is this is a very clear

3602
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:47,840
picture of that which is the the gulags

3603
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:53,118
and soulja is one of the best people to

3604
02:09:50,158 --> 02:09:53,118
reveal that yeah

3605
02:09:53,198 --> 02:09:57,598
the most recent thing i read it isn't

3606
02:09:55,118 --> 02:09:59,439
actually fiction uh was the

3607
02:09:57,599 --> 02:10:01,440
the woman i can't remember her name who

3608
02:09:59,439 --> 02:10:03,598
got the nobel prize about

3609
02:10:01,439 --> 02:10:05,198
within the last five years

3610
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:07,679
i don't know whether she's ukrainian or

3611
02:10:05,198 --> 02:10:10,158
russian but there are

3612
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:12,800
interviews have you read that interview

3613
02:10:10,158 --> 02:10:14,319
of ukrainian survivors of

3614
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:17,279
well i think she may be originally

3615
02:10:14,319 --> 02:10:19,840
ukrainian so i'm the book's written in

3616
02:10:17,279 --> 02:10:21,759
russian then translated into english and

3617
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:22,800
many of the interviews are in moscow and

3618
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:24,639
places

3619
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:26,560
but she won the nobel prize within the

3620
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:29,599
last five years or so

3621
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:32,639
but what's interesting is that uh

3622
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:34,880
these are people of all different ages

3623
02:10:32,639 --> 02:10:37,199
all different uh uh

3624
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:38,800
occupations and so forth and they're

3625
02:10:37,198 --> 02:10:40,799
reflecting on the

3626
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:44,000
their reaction to

3627
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:45,679
basically the present soviet system the

3628
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,639
system they lived with before there's a

3629
02:10:45,679 --> 02:10:47,520
lot of

3630
02:10:46,639 --> 02:10:50,960
uh

3631
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:52,159
looking back by a lot of them with uh

3632
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:54,239
uh

3633
02:10:52,158 --> 02:10:57,839
well uh

3634
02:10:54,238 --> 02:10:57,839
it being much better before

3635
02:10:59,039 --> 02:11:02,479
yeah

3636
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:04,719
i don't know what i

3637
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:07,359
in america we think we know the right

3638
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:10,239
answer what it means to be um to build a

3639
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:12,399
better world i'm not so sure i think

3640
02:11:10,238 --> 02:11:14,559
we're all just trying to figure it out

3641
02:11:12,399 --> 02:11:17,198
yeah they're just doing our best i i

3642
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,199
think you're right

3643
02:11:17,359 --> 02:11:21,679
is there advice you can give to young

3644
02:11:19,439 --> 02:11:23,839
people today

3645
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:25,279
besides reading russian literature at a

3646
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:27,520
young age

3647
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:29,840
um about how to find their way in life

3648
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:31,760
how to find success in career or just

3649
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:34,000
life in general

3650
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:34,000
uh

3651
02:11:34,238 --> 02:11:38,559
i i just

3652
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:40,800
my own

3653
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:42,560
belief it may not be very

3654
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,639
deep but i believe it i think you should

3655
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:46,159
follow your dreams

3656
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:48,400
and you should have dreams and follow

3657
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:49,839
your dreams if you can to the extent

3658
02:11:48,399 --> 02:11:51,118
that you can

3659
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:53,119
and

3660
02:11:51,118 --> 02:11:55,118
we spend a lot of our time doing

3661
02:11:53,118 --> 02:11:57,039
something with ourselves in my case

3662
02:11:55,118 --> 02:11:58,319
physics in your case i don't know

3663
02:11:57,039 --> 02:12:00,158
whatever it is

3664
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:02,399
machine learning and this

3665
02:12:00,158 --> 02:12:02,399
uh

3666
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:08,079
we should yeah i should have fun

3667
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:10,319
what was wait wait wait drink follow

3668
02:12:08,078 --> 02:12:12,078
your dreams what uh what dream did you

3669
02:12:10,319 --> 02:12:14,479
have because

3670
02:12:12,078 --> 02:12:16,158
well well originally i was

3671
02:12:14,479 --> 02:12:17,919
because you didn't follow your dream

3672
02:12:16,158 --> 02:12:20,319
well that's the change along the way i

3673
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:22,800
was gonna be okay but i changed what

3674
02:12:20,319 --> 02:12:27,279
happened that was what happened

3675
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:29,360
oh i read i decided to take the most

3676
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:31,679
serious literature course in my high

3677
02:12:29,359 --> 02:12:35,439
school which was a mistake i'd probably

3678
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:38,078
be a second-rate writer now and uh could

3679
02:12:35,439 --> 02:12:39,519
be a nobel prize winning writer and uh

3680
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:41,759
uh

3681
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:41,760
the

3682
02:12:42,399 --> 02:12:47,279
the book that we read

3683
02:12:44,238 --> 02:12:50,879
even though i had read russian novels

3684
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:53,198
i was 15 i think uh cured me

3685
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:56,239
from being a novelist destroyed your

3686
02:12:53,198 --> 02:12:59,118
dream yes cured you okay what was the

3687
02:12:56,238 --> 02:13:02,238
book moby dick okay

3688
02:12:59,118 --> 02:13:03,439
so why moby dick yeah why so i i've read

3689
02:13:02,238 --> 02:13:06,479
it since

3690
02:13:03,439 --> 02:13:08,000
and it's a it's a great novel maybe it's

3691
02:13:06,479 --> 02:13:09,678
as good as the russian novel i've never

3692
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,078
made it through i i thought it was too

3693
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:12,880
boring it's too long okay your words are

3694
02:13:12,078 --> 02:13:14,960
gonna

3695
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:17,679
mesh with what i say excellent and you

3696
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:19,279
may have the same problem at uh older

3697
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:20,399
that's why i'm not a writer

3698
02:13:19,279 --> 02:13:22,479
it may be

3699
02:13:20,399 --> 02:13:23,920
so the problem is

3700
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:26,879
moby dick is

3701
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:29,440
what i remember was there was a chapter

3702
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:32,639
that was maybe 100 pages long

3703
02:13:29,439 --> 02:13:34,319
all describing this why there was ahab

3704
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:37,359
and the white whale and it was the

3705
02:13:34,319 --> 02:13:39,198
battle between ahab with his wooden peg

3706
02:13:37,359 --> 02:13:40,880
leg and the white whale

3707
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:43,118
and there was a chapter that was 100

3708
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:45,279
pages long in my memory i don't know how

3709
02:13:43,118 --> 02:13:48,399
long it really was

3710
02:13:45,279 --> 02:13:50,238
that described in detail the great white

3711
02:13:48,399 --> 02:13:52,399
whale and what he was doing and what his

3712
02:13:50,238 --> 02:13:55,279
fins were like and this and that and it

3713
02:13:52,399 --> 02:13:56,399
was so incredibly boring the word you

3714
02:13:55,279 --> 02:13:58,078
used

3715
02:13:56,399 --> 02:13:59,279
that i thought if this is great

3716
02:13:58,078 --> 02:14:01,198
literature

3717
02:13:59,279 --> 02:14:02,319
screw it

3718
02:14:01,198 --> 02:14:04,879
okay

3719
02:14:02,319 --> 02:14:06,880
now why did i have a problem i know now

3720
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:09,760
in reflection because i i still read a

3721
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:10,719
lot and i i read that uh

3722
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:13,440
novel

3723
02:14:10,719 --> 02:14:14,800
um you know after

3724
02:14:13,439 --> 02:14:16,879
i was

3725
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:19,360
30 or 40 years old

3726
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:22,159
and the problem was simple i i diagnosed

3727
02:14:19,359 --> 02:14:24,238
what the problem was i that

3728
02:14:22,158 --> 02:14:25,839
novel in contrast to

3729
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:27,359
the russian novels which are very

3730
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:29,039
realistic and

3731
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:31,439
you know point of view

3732
02:14:29,039 --> 02:14:32,800
is one huge metaphor

3733
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:35,198
oh yeah

3734
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:36,880
at 15 years old i probably didn't know

3735
02:14:35,198 --> 02:14:38,719
the word and i certainly didn't know the

3736
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:40,719
meaning of a metaphor yeah like why do i

3737
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:43,279
care about a fish why are you telling me

3738
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:45,520
all about this exactly is one big

3739
02:14:43,279 --> 02:14:48,238
metaphor so reading it later as a

3740
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:49,840
metaphor i could really enjoy it

3741
02:14:48,238 --> 02:14:51,198
but the teacher gave me the wrong book

3742
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:53,279
or maybe it was the right book because i

3743
02:14:51,198 --> 02:14:54,638
went into physics and so

3744
02:14:53,279 --> 02:14:57,439
uh

3745
02:14:54,639 --> 02:14:59,199
but it was it was truly i think i may

3746
02:14:57,439 --> 02:15:01,039
oversimplify but it was really that i

3747
02:14:59,198 --> 02:15:03,519
was too young to read that book because

3748
02:15:01,039 --> 02:15:06,000
not too young to read the russian novels

3749
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:07,520
interestingly but too young to read that

3750
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,279
because i i probably didn't even know

3751
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:11,199
the word and i certainly didn't

3752
02:15:09,279 --> 02:15:12,960
understand it as a metaphor

3753
02:15:11,198 --> 02:15:15,118
well in terms of fish i recommend people

3754
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:16,800
read old man in the sea much shorter

3755
02:15:15,118 --> 02:15:19,679
much better it's still a metaphor though

3756
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:22,960
so but you can read it just as a story

3757
02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:25,840
about a guy catching a fish and it's

3758
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:25,840
still fun to read

3759
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,800
i had the same experience

3760
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:32,800
as you not with moby dick but later in

3761
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:34,400
college i took a course on james joyce i

3762
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:36,000
don't understand why

3763
02:15:34,399 --> 02:15:37,839
i was majoring in computer science i

3764
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,198
took a course on james joyce

3765
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:43,440
and i was kept being told that he is

3766
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:44,960
widely considered by many considered to

3767
02:15:43,439 --> 02:15:46,319
be the greatest

3768
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:48,639
literary

3769
02:15:46,319 --> 02:15:50,960
writer of the 20th century

3770
02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:52,560
and i kept reading like i think so his

3771
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:53,920
short stories the dead i think it's

3772
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:56,480
called was very good

3773
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:58,480
well not very good but pretty good

3774
02:15:56,479 --> 02:16:00,479
and then you listen he's very good it is

3775
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:02,718
very good only the dead the final story

3776
02:16:00,479 --> 02:16:06,078
is still rings with me today but then

3777
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:07,520
ulysses was i i i got through ulysses

3778
02:16:06,078 --> 02:16:08,559
with the help of some cliff notes and so

3779
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:10,400
on but

3780
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:12,239
uh and so i did ulysses and then

3781
02:16:10,399 --> 02:16:13,598
finnegan's wake the moment i started

3782
02:16:12,238 --> 02:16:16,479
finning his wake

3783
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:18,880
i said this this is stupid

3784
02:16:16,479 --> 02:16:20,000
this is that's when i went full into

3785
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:22,480
like

3786
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:23,679
um i don't know that's why i went full

3787
02:16:22,479 --> 02:16:26,559
kafka

3788
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:28,560
bukowski like people who just talk about

3789
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:30,560
the darkness of the human condition in

3790
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:33,200
the fewest wars possible

3791
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:35,200
and without any of the

3792
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:37,359
music of language

3793
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:40,079
um so it was a turning point

3794
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:42,159
uh as well i i wonder i wonder when is

3795
02:16:40,079 --> 02:16:44,879
the right time to do the

3796
02:16:42,159 --> 02:16:46,718
to appreciate the beauty of language

3797
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:48,558
like even shakespeare i was very much

3798
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:50,959
off put by shakespeare in high school

3799
02:16:48,558 --> 02:16:53,759
and only later i started to appreciate

3800
02:16:50,959 --> 02:16:57,438
it's its value in the same way

3801
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:57,439
let me ask you a ridiculous question

3802
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:02,318
okay um

3803
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:04,960
i mean because you've read russian

3804
02:17:02,318 --> 02:17:06,558
literature let me ask this one last

3805
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:07,598
question

3806
02:17:06,558 --> 02:17:09,119
uh

3807
02:17:07,599 --> 02:17:10,478
i might be lying there might be a couple

3808
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:13,519
more but what do you think is the

3809
02:17:10,478 --> 02:17:15,920
meaning of this whole thing

3810
02:17:13,519 --> 02:17:18,159
you're uh you got a nobel prize for uh

3811
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:20,558
looking out into the trying to reach

3812
02:17:18,159 --> 02:17:23,439
back into the beginning of the universe

3813
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:24,318
listening to the gravitational waves

3814
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:27,359
uh

3815
02:17:24,318 --> 02:17:29,199
but that still doesn't answer the why

3816
02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:31,519
why are we here

3817
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:33,599
beyond just the yeah the matter and

3818
02:17:31,519 --> 02:17:35,920
antimatter

3819
02:17:33,599 --> 02:17:38,719
the philosophical question i felt a

3820
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:42,799
philosophical question about the meaning

3821
02:17:38,718 --> 02:17:43,759
of life i'm probably not really good at

3822
02:17:42,799 --> 02:17:46,000
i think

3823
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:46,000
that

3824
02:17:48,318 --> 02:17:52,398
the individual meaning

3825
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:55,840
uh

3826
02:17:52,398 --> 02:17:57,920
i i would say rather simplistically is

3827
02:17:55,840 --> 02:18:00,478
whether you've made

3828
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:04,398
a difference a positive difference i'd

3829
02:18:00,478 --> 02:18:04,398
say for anything besides yourself

3830
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:09,039
meaning you could

3831
02:18:06,159 --> 02:18:10,638
have been important to other people

3832
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:12,319
or you could have discovered

3833
02:18:10,638 --> 02:18:14,000
gravitational waves that matters to

3834
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:17,199
other people or something but something

3835
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,439
beyond just existing on the earth

3836
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:22,159
as an individual so

3837
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:23,439
your life has meaning if you have

3838
02:18:22,159 --> 02:18:25,599
affected

3839
02:18:23,439 --> 02:18:26,479
um

3840
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:28,960
either

3841
02:18:26,478 --> 02:18:31,119
knowledge or people or something beyond

3842
02:18:28,959 --> 02:18:33,119
yourself

3843
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:35,200
do you it's a simplistic

3844
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:38,639
statement but it's about as good as i

3845
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:42,319
and i have that's that may in all of its

3846
02:18:38,638 --> 02:18:44,478
simplicity it may be very true

3847
02:18:42,318 --> 02:18:47,679
do you think about uh

3848
02:18:44,478 --> 02:18:50,718
does it make you sad that this ride ends

3849
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:52,638
do you think about your mortality

3850
02:18:50,718 --> 02:18:54,879
yeah uh

3851
02:18:52,638 --> 02:18:57,119
are you afraid of it

3852
02:18:54,879 --> 02:19:00,959
i'm not exactly afraid of it but

3853
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:02,319
saddened by it and uh

3854
02:19:00,959 --> 02:19:04,638
uh

3855
02:19:02,318 --> 02:19:06,159
you know i'm old enough to know that

3856
02:19:04,638 --> 02:19:08,079
i've

3857
02:19:06,159 --> 02:19:10,318
lived most of my life

3858
02:19:08,079 --> 02:19:10,318
and

3859
02:19:10,638 --> 02:19:14,799
i enjoy being alive

3860
02:19:12,959 --> 02:19:17,358
i can imagine being sick and not wanting

3861
02:19:14,799 --> 02:19:18,840
to be alive but i'm not and

3862
02:19:17,359 --> 02:19:21,439
so

3863
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:22,799
um i'm

3864
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:25,359
not getting a good ride

3865
02:19:22,799 --> 02:19:26,799
yeah i'm not and i'm not happy to see it

3866
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:27,920
come to an end i'd like to see it

3867
02:19:26,799 --> 02:19:29,840
prolonged

3868
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:33,040
but uh

3869
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:35,040
i i don't uh

3870
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:37,920
i i i don't

3871
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:40,240
fear the dying itself or that kind of

3872
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:42,000
thing it's more i'd like to prolong

3873
02:19:40,239 --> 02:19:43,920
uh what

3874
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,920
is i think

3875
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:50,639
a good life that i'm

3876
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:50,639
living and still living it's kind of

3877
02:19:50,959 --> 02:19:55,438
it's sad to think that the finiteness of

3878
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,439
it

3879
02:19:55,920 --> 02:20:01,040
is the thing that makes it special

3880
02:19:58,719 --> 02:20:03,679
and it

3881
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:06,319
and also sad to um

3882
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:07,840
you know to me at least it's kind of

3883
02:20:06,318 --> 02:20:09,600
i don't think i'm using too strong of a

3884
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:12,398
ward but it's kind of terrifying the

3885
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:12,399
uncertainty of it

3886
02:20:12,719 --> 02:20:18,000
the mystery of it you know the mystery

3887
02:20:14,959 --> 02:20:19,279
of death the mystery of it yeah of death

3888
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,879
when we're talking about the mystery of

3889
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:22,960
black holes that's somehow distant

3890
02:20:20,879 --> 02:20:25,839
that's somehow out there and the mystery

3891
02:20:22,959 --> 02:20:28,799
of our own but but but even life the

3892
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:30,799
mystery of consciousness i find uh

3893
02:20:28,799 --> 02:20:33,119
so hard to deal with too

3894
02:20:30,799 --> 02:20:36,559
i mean it's not as painful i mean we're

3895
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:38,560
conscious but the whole magic of life if

3896
02:20:36,559 --> 02:20:41,199
we can understand but consciousness

3897
02:20:38,559 --> 02:20:43,760
where we can actually think and

3898
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:45,280
so forth it's pretty it's such it seems

3899
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:48,159
like such a beautiful gift that it

3900
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:50,000
really sucks that uh we get to let go of

3901
02:20:48,159 --> 02:20:51,840
it we'll have to let go of it yeah what

3902
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:54,159
do you hope your legacy is

3903
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:55,920
as i'm sure they will uh aliens when

3904
02:20:54,159 --> 02:20:58,959
they visit and humans have destroyed all

3905
02:20:55,920 --> 02:21:00,719
of uh human civilization aliens read

3906
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:03,679
about you and encyclopedia they will

3907
02:21:00,719 --> 02:21:07,279
leave behind what do you hope it says

3908
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:10,239
well i would i would hope they

3909
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:12,880
if to the extent that they evaluated me

3910
02:21:10,239 --> 02:21:15,680
uh felt that i helped move science

3911
02:21:12,879 --> 02:21:18,959
forward as a

3912
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:22,318
tangible contribution and that

3913
02:21:18,959 --> 02:21:25,358
i served as a good role model for

3914
02:21:22,318 --> 02:21:27,840
how humans should live their lives

3915
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:29,840
and we're part of creating one of the

3916
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:32,159
most incredible things

3917
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:34,159
humans have ever created

3918
02:21:32,159 --> 02:21:37,600
so yes there's the science that's the

3919
02:21:34,159 --> 02:21:39,680
fermi thing right yeah uh the instrument

3920
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:42,000
i guess and the instrument the

3921
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:44,000
instrument is a magical creation not

3922
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:47,120
just by a human by a collection of

3923
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,959
humans the collaboration

3924
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:51,200
is um

3925
02:21:48,959 --> 02:21:54,639
that's

3926
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:56,479
that's humanity at his best

3927
02:21:54,639 --> 02:21:59,199
i i do hope

3928
02:21:56,478 --> 02:22:01,760
i do hope will last quite a bit longer

3929
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:03,840
but if we don't

3930
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:04,639
this is a good thing to remember humans

3931
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:07,120
by

3932
02:22:04,639 --> 02:22:08,398
at least they built that thing

3933
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:09,920
that's pretty impressive

3934
