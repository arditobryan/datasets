00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,639
niels jorgensen

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,638
a new york firefighter for over 21 years

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:11,359
who was there at ground zero on

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,599
september 11 2001.

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,079
he was forced to retire because of the

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,600
leukemia he contracted from cleaning up

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,559
ground zero

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,240
this podcast tells his story

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,479
and the story of other great men and

11
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,159
women who were there that day

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,399
some of the stories we talk about are

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,320
part of a new limited podcast series

14
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:36,719

as a side note please allow me to say a

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,200
few words about the terrorist attacks on

20
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,679
september 11 2001.

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,000
i was in downtown chicago on that day

22
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,519
lost in the mundane busyness of an early

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,079
tuesday morning

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,359
at that time i was already fascinated by

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,000
human nature

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,520
the best and the worst of it

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
exploring it through the study of

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
history and literature

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,240
in the years before as a young boy

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,320
growing up in russia i saw chaos

31
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,798
uncertainty and desperation in the

32
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,959
soviet union of the 1990s

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,240
wrapping up a century of war and

34
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,478
suffering

35
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,399
but after coming to america for me

36
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,478
there was a sense of hope

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,600
like all of it was behind us

38
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,840
a bad dream to be forgotten as we enter

39
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,239
into the new century

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,960
on 9 11 when i saw the news of the

41
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,118
second plane hitting the towers my sense

42
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:40,158
of hope had changed

43
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,879
i understood that the 21st century like

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,320
the century before would too have its

45
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,239
tragedies its evildoers its wars

46
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,319
and its suffering

47
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,199
and unlike the history books these

48
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,199
stories will involve all of us

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
they will involve me

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,320
in however small and insignificant a

51
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,478
role

52
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,599
but one that nevertheless carries the

53
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:06,000
responsibility to help

54
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,038
i became an american that day

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,719
a citizen of the world i felt the common

56
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,639
humanity in all of us

57
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,639
i felt the unity and the love and the

58
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,878
days that followed and i think most of

59
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,878
the world shared in this feeling that we

60
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,159
are all in this together

61
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:24,639
evil cannot defeat the human spirit

62
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,759
there were many heroes sung and unsung

63
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:30,079
on that day and in the years after

64
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,239
often politicians failed to rightfully

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,519
honor the service and sacrifice of these

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,159
heroes

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,080
there is much i could say about that but

68
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,318
i don't want to waste my words on the

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,800
failures of weak leaders

70
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,799
instead i want to say thank you to the

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,760
men and women who rushed to ground zero

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,160
to help who put on a uniform to serve

73
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,799
who make me proud to be an american and

74
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:56,000
a human being and give me hope about the

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,760
future of our civilization here on a

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,759
small spinning rock

77
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,759
that despite the long odds

78
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,759
keeps kindling the fire of human

79
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,359
consciousness and

80
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,679
love

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,239
this is the lex friedman podcast and

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,000
here is my conversation with niels

83
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,759
jorgensen

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,280
take me through the day of september

85
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,840
11th 2001 as you experienced it as you

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
lived it

87
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:26,000
september 11 2001 uh was a bright

88
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,518
beautiful sunny tuesday morning uh as a

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,479
late summer

90
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,680
uh

91
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,518
there's a lot of folks who go to the

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,959
beaches in new jersey call it the short

93
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,560
summer it's uh everybody's left there

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,598
for labor day but it's still beautiful

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,519
enough to

96
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,000
enjoy the weather

97
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,280
um i left my house about 6 30 in the

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,598
morning

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,120
and uh my four and a half year old

100
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,798
daughter

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
said to me daddy

102
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,280
which truck are you driving today um the

103
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,159
fire truck the oil truck or the boar's

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,759
head truck because i had three jobs at

105
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,519
the time um

106
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,479
most new york city firefighters and

107
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,920
police officers ems we

108
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,359
don't make the most amount of money so

109
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,919
in order to live in that city you have

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,720
to uh you have to hustle and my wife

111
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,598
stayed at home raising the children

112
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,039
so

113
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,959
my daughter said oh she you should be

114
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,199
safe because you're on the oil truck i

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,040
said i told her i was going on an oil

116
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,918
truck that day so she should be safe

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,199
today daddy so i left and um

118
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,599
worked for this great company on the

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,400
north shore staten island quinlan fuel

120
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,400
very nice people treated me very well

121
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,319
and was my first day back actually for

122
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,239
the winter season um

123
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,519
i usually get laid off a couple months

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,079
in the summer because things you know

125
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,159
too hot to need oil

126
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,079
so i took the truck started my route on

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,439
that day and uh

128
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,680
plane hit the tower so initially i'm

129
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,600
like oh it's probably some silly learjet

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
pilot and he veered off track to get a

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,560
better picture for a client and uh he

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,319
hit the building

133
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,199
probably hit a

134
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,719
you know bad turbulence uh gust of wind

135
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,560
it's very windy down in that area in

136
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,560
manhattan so that was my first thought

137
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,839
can we pause there for a second

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,839
so 6 30 a.m you wake up you leave and

139
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,519
then the plane hits at

140
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:12,079
8 8 45 85 45 am yeah it's just

141
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,959
interesting how you phrase it so how did

142
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,639
you hear that a plane hit something

143
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,758
i um

144
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,519
i'm a big news radio guy uh news guy bit

145
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,038
of a buff i've been that way since i was

146
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,279
a kid and i had the news radio on

147
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,639
the local new york radio station and as

148
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:34,399
i was driving the truck i heard

149
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,079
you know a emergency report this just in

150
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,198
aircraft has just struck the world trade

151
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,439
center

152
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,439
and uh where quinlan's is located it's

153
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,639
on the north rim of staten island uh

154
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:47,199
which is right on new york harbor and uh

155
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,960
you could see statue of liberty you know

156
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,879
a mile or two away in your distance and

157
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,758
then past that as

158
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,159
towers so i just literally stopped the

159
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,240
truck and looked out and i saw the smoke

160
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,560
so there was smoke oh it was dark black

161
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,360
smoke it was just yeah i mean it was

162
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,000
burning fully at that point and uh did

163
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,960
you have fear of what the hell happened

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,600
or i was i was initially scared for

165
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,120
anybody involved uh i realized i said

166
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
there's there's gonna be lots of

167
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,519
fatalities obviously depending on the

168
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,680
size of the aircraft and uh

169
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,159
you know uh the the business day there

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,600
had started probably at 8 8 30 so those

171
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,000
buildings should have been packed at

172
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,759
that moment so that was a thought across

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,478
my mind um

174
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,038
but from our our uh being responder

175
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,918
perspective if you're off duty normally

176
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,360
you you do not go to a scene

177
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,599
they don't want you to because of

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,240
accountability and safety

179
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,919
uh the on-duty platoon will handle it

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,360
and if it's something

181
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,519
very horrific then they will have

182
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,000
something called a recall which is

183
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,639
any police firefighter or ems personnel

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,079
is obligated to go to their command

185
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,240
immediately

186
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,159
uh check in with

187
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,840
you know their command to get their gear

188
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,919
and stand by and await orders for

189
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,519
deployment uh or to remain in that

190
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,680
command for

191
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,079
routine duties how often throughout

192
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,079
history have there been recalls i

193
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,038
believe the one prior to that was like

194
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,279
in the 1968 riots

195
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,360
possibly and then maybe in the 70s there

196
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,598
was uh another blackout in riots and i

197
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,199
remember my dad talking about it and he

198
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,120
actually always said

199
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,079
just remember if something bad's going

200
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
down

201
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,198
don't just rush in you you you await the

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,399
recall or at the very least if there

203
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,680
isn't a recall you get to your firehouse

204
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,279
and because if you show up somewhere

205
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,280
there's a good chance that no one knows

206
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,839
you're there and now you

207
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,758
in your

208
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,239
well-intended uh movements you you get

209
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
lost or trapped or no one's looking for

210
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,240
you so that's the whole thing with you

211
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,639
know checking in and now

212
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,840

00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,479
but a tormented man he

373
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:29,838
he was sent away from home at 12 years

374
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,079
old um

375
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,560
um he was in from denmark and i'm named

376
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:37,439
after him grandpa nils

377
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,518
and uh i think his demons

378
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,480
took up a large part of his life his his

379
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,159
anger his whatever it was his fear i i

380
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,560
we got the sense that maybe when he was

381
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:49,600
a child he was an apprentice baker you

382
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,679
know living with strangers working for

383
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,759
them and we we think maybe he was abused

384
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:57,759
and that's why he took it out of my my

385
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,759
dad and my grandma my aunts but um

386
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,920
they uh they made it up to each other at

387
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,278
the end of my granddad's life my

388
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,679
granddad turned out to be the best

389
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,159
grandfather ever he i think he tried to

390
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,838
heal and heal everyone by his change of

391
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,360
behavior so

392
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,600
he's proof that

393
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,680
you can't change you can improve if you

394
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,360
work on it but i know i'm going off

395
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,039
track here but uh but you were man

396
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
enough and you're you said in your 20s

397
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,799
to tell you my dad yeah

398
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,040
i got on the job uh he said i had to go

399
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,719
kid that was the tour we called tour of

400
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,399
duty so i thought it was great it was

401
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
great i love it

402
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,799
and he goes we just remember you keep

403
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,519
low you always keep low and keep low

404
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,679
means you stay down below the flames you

405
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,519
know for room flashes over and it's it's

406
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,039
burning you if you stay up high you're

407
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,120
gonna get burned badly but if you get

408
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,759
down on your belly and you crawl

409
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,759
you'll get out

410
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,360

411
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,000
the phone and i said well i love you pop

412
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,120

i said well you can say it too and uh

414
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,120
oh nice he pressured him and he did and

415
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,439
he said it and now every time we talk he

416
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
says it so you know um

417
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,199
you know they they talk about

418
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,440
masculinity and whatnot and uh my dad is

419
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,439
one of those tough tough guys with a

420
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,519
soft edge and that's that's how he

421
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,000
brought me up um

422
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,240
you know to be a protector i hate

423
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
bullies i was bullied really badly as a

424
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,639
kid and uh

425
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,519
i really hated it and and now i i find

426
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,799
myself

427
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,120
sometimes throwing myself into

428
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,958
situations to protect

429
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,278
people that are being you know

430
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,879

490
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,720
drive you and he took us and we stopped

491
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,519
at engine 201 which is just about a

492
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,839
quarter mile down the road from us uh

493
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,359
that's our affiliated engine company and

494
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,519
my uh

495
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,399
my my childhood best friend uh here

496
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,400
johnny uh shard was

497
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,080
he was a sign there and he was on shift

498
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,038
and uh

499
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,038
and they went through the tunnel

500
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,319
and uh

501
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,320
we picked up those guys the off-duty

502
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,558
guys from 201 and then we kept going

503
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,359
down fourth devin and we picked up 239's

504
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,879
crew and then we hightailed it down the

505
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,159
bridge and um

506
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
there's a lot of traffic there's a lot

507
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,600
of people

508
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,359
fleeing coming over the bridge and waves

509
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,119
so it affected uh

510
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,839
the inbound

511
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,079
what was the mood like

512
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:18,480
uh it was somber because just prior to

513
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:21,119
getting on the bus the uh

514
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,400
first tower went down so we we we

515
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,798
figured that

516
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,840
i heard 114 my lieutenant dennis oberg

517
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,879
i heard him on the radio and he uh

518
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,720
he said 114 uh manhattan we're on your

519
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,880
frequency what's you know what do you

520
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,798
need us and they said uh

521
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,559
tallyho which is our nickname tallyho

522
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:44,079
responding to bessie and wes to the

523
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:47,359
command post and receive your orders

524
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,359
and i heard dennis the tally ho 10-4

525
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,879
and

526
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,879
dennis

527
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,520
a little while after that they were

528
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,919
proceeding to go into

529
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,599
i believe it was i get this mixed up and

530
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,120
i'm sorry i should know this by the back

531
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,839
of my hand but sometimes it's just such

532
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,239
a

533
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,839
haze but

534
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,160
the second tower hit was the first one

535
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,000
to go down and um they were heading over

536
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,600
to go in it and all of a sudden he

537
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,440
looked up and he saw like what he

538
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,199
thought to be disintegration and he

539
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,000
turned the guys around he said run just

540
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,240
run don't look back don't look up go

541
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,440
they sprinted as fast as they could

542
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,279
and uh they dove under a fire truck

543
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,759
and the guys that were sprinting behind

544
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,440
him 40 feet away were

545
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,759
underneath the pile that was 10 stories

546
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,798
deep they they were killed

547
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,879
and just

548
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,079
further into that pile was his rookie

549
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,600
son

550
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,319

556
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,599
best friend john shard and his

557
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,599
uh his crew from 201 and uh

558
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,960
they they were all killed

559
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,279
and the strange irony to um to that is

560
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,839
that

561
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,879
dennis dennis's son dennis jr was

562
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,879
working underneath the uh

563
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,320
under the wing of a senior man as we say

564
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,799
senior man is a guy with a lot of

565
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,879
experience and he'll uh

566
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,038
to watch over you make sure you don't

567
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,200
you know veer off like i veer off a lot

568
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,839
and talking and uh you don't veer off

569
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,720
and you get yourself hurt

570
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:31,000
in the morning in 1993 bombing

571
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,000
henry miller was my senior man

572
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:41,038
and i was the young guy under his wing

573
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,880
and he protected me

574
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,158
until the end of the day looked around

575
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,080
he said kid

576
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,280
it's a bad day

577
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,359
he said

578
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,960
they didn't do it right they blew it up

579
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,279
in the middle

580
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,880
if they did it in a corner

581
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,359
they would have dropped this building

582
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,960
half mile down to canal street

583
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,079
but don't kid yourself they'll be back

584
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,159
and they'll do it and they'll do it

585
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,918
right next time

586
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,679
and it's so strange and so prophetic

587
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,200
because

588
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,360
he was there with him he died with

589
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,759
dennis he knew it

590
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,599
and like 1994 we had a training manual

591
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,798
with a picture of the towers with a

592
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,439
target

593
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:19,359
and this is not

594
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,000
not a matter of if but a matter of when

595
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,918
be prepared

596
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,960
it's one thing it was like people knew

597
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,440
right

598
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,840
and we didn't stop it

599
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,000
and

600
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:33,519
uh so we got off the bus

601
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,558
but just prior to that coming over the

602
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,000
bridges the second tower was gone now

603
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,519
and we're just destroyed because we're

604
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,440
like our guys are there they're all in

605
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,679
there now we're feeling like cowards

606
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,880
because we got there late

607
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,400
and

608
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
initially we're thinking there's 500

609
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,640
guys that are gone because it was a 10th

610
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,640
alarm assignment which means

611
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,000
50 60 fire trucks

612
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,918
uh five to six guys per you know you're

613
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
looking at

614
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,720
at least you know it was even more 10th

615
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,319
alarm plus multiple alarms on top of it

616
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,159
there was a dispatch basically

617
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:11,759
equivalent of five to 600 firefighters

618
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,280
you figured oh they're all they're all

619
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,919
in there all gone all the police

620
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,119
officers port authority police nypd

621
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,880
police

622
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,119
court officers just up the street from

623
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,039
the courts

624
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,798
transit cops from

625
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,119
the train tunnels like just you know we

626
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,480
knew everybody was going and uh now

627
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,959
they're gone

628
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,360
so you what you saw what were we looking

629
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,440
at what did it look like so you saw

630
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,479
rubble and then you knew

631
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,200
that many that 105 and 201 many of those

632
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,798
guys are in the they're dead

633
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,319
yeah what and we thought

634
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,679
was in there too we didn't realize at

635
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,599
that point we didn't even realize that

636
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,038
they had gotten under that truck we

637
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,599
thought they were all gone but yeah it

638
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,240
looked like like it looked like

639
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,639
it looked like a movie scene with just

640
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,279
end of the earth destruction these just

641
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,919
massive piles of

642
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,558
intertwined steel what was left of the

643
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,840
steel and and you know there was no

644
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,399
cement it was all just dust

645
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,519
and

646
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,080
it was just a burning pile of dust and

647
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,759
concrete and plastic and it was just

648
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,119
everything was just pulverized and it

649
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:21,440
was it was truly hard to

650
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,279
mentally compute that like it was like

651
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,600
what and then

652
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,759
there was just fighter jets couple fire

653
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,119
just just circling and and you just

654
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,038
heard that

655
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,479
flying by over your head

656
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:33,919
i mean you'd literally see the guy

657
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,679
banking the turn around the brooklyn

658
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,559
bridge and just coming back and i'm like

659
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,679
holy shoot we're under attack

660
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,000
and we

661
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,159
couldn't really get concrete intel as to

662
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,919
what exactly we knew planes but then we

663
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,640
kept hearing there was

664
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,480
multiple devices there was devices in a

665
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,320
battery tunnel and there was devices on

666
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,079
the george washington bridge and in the

667
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,319
subways and it was just it was just

668
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,240
chaos it was i mean we kept it together

669
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,599
obviously because that's kind of we try

670
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
that's what we do

671
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,199
but the

672
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,840
the just constant barrage of different

673
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,080
reports it was like holy shoot

674
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,519
and then as we were being deployed it

675
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,278
was a little frustrating but they were

676
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,599
trying to take command and send us in

677
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,759
groups now because they realize we have

678
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,798
to start searching this there's

679
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,519
you could hear

680
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:21,119
the alarms on the on the scott air mask

681
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,000
the packs we wear to go into the

682
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,839
building

683
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,679
it has a motion alarm and if you stop

684
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,918
moving for 30 seconds it just sounds

685
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,400
like this whining you know

686
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,640
this screaming bell like it just keeps

687
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,480
going and going

688
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,880
and you could hear multiple units of

689
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,640
those going off and you're like

690
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,159
wait a minute there's guys with those

691
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,840
like where are they

692
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,200
and it's emanating from underneath the

693
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,439
pile and

694
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,278
wow you know it was it was just surreal

695
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,440
and um

696
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:52,159
truly like

697
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,080
like like a war zone you know i mean i

698
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,919
was a soldier in reserves and i never

699
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,119
saw combat and i would never claim that

700
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,038
i did but

701
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,359
you know we trained we trained for a lot

702
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,599
of situations and we trained in you know

703
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,918
real life atmospheres and whatnot and

704
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,079
this was just beyond that by leaps and

705
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,320
bounds it was it was bizarre

706
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,079
did you see the towers collapse as we

707
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,200
were coming over the bridge the first

708
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,720
one

709
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,960
we were as we were deploying from the

710
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,558
firehouse we had a television and i saw

711
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,919
it go down

712
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,440
and it just

713
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,360
it was just like

714
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,360
and and you know we were so involved in

715
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,959
getting gear together and getting okay

716
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,240
you know team set up and okay you're

717
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,840
going to be with these two guys and he's

718
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,519
gonna

719
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,199
and i just yell there's the guys and

720
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,639
they're looking at me i dropped to my

721
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,960
knees and i started praying they're like

722
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,200
what what the hell is wrong i said i

723
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,120
couldn't even say it's like i said i'm

724
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,440
14 they're in there and and they're like

725
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,278
what i said the tower's gone

726
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,519
and all you saw on the tv was just this

727
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,119
pile of dust and

728
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,720
i guess because they didn't see it going

729
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,558
down i probably thought i

730
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,600
truly lost it and and

731
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,839
then

732
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,558
then the realization came was like oh

733
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:01,199
wow the tower's down so now it was like

734
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:04,798
wow this is really on so we we just took

735
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,159
off and got that boss and uh

736
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,839
so if you thought

737
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,799
many of the guys on 114 were

738
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,720
dead

739
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,679
if you thought that did you think you're

740
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,720
going to die i mean if you're rushing

741
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,240
into the

742
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,960
towards the rubble

743
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,038
i

744
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,440
as crazy as it sounds i never thought

745
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,519
that the other tower would go down i

746
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,120
said okay maybe some freak chance that

747
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,879
one went down

748
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,959
but no the other one's not gonna go like

749
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,720
they're built so strong you know i was

750
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,240
in those towers so many times and i mean

751
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,919
i ate dinner up in the top four

752
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,120
restaurant windows on the world and i'm

753
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,278
saying

754
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,119
nah there's no way like like how the

755
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:44,400
hell did this one happen

756
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:46,639
but i i was having a hard time mentally

757
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,519
processing that the building was gone

758
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,840
and

759
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:52,000
and and believe me if if you don't have

760
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,399
fear in this industry and you know

761
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,759
police fire military then you're you're

762
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,919
kidding yourself

763
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,839
or you're a danger to everyone i don't

764
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,679
care who it is as tough as they are this

765
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,000
and that everybody has a certain level

766
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,880
of fear with doing this and i don't care

767
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,519
how long you do it there's always that

768
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,360
chance of something going bad and and

769
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,720
everyone who does it has that certain

770
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,558
amount of fear

771
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,240
but at that point it was such a feeling

772
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,398
of disbelief

773
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,720
that fear wasn't even kicking in it was

774
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:21,599
just like what the hell just happened

775
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,519
and

776
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,719
i honestly think it was almost like a

777
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,720
shock and it just stayed that whole day

778
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,880
um so the building is

779
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,720
before collapses is burning it's just

780
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,919
burning i mean upper floors is you know

781
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,919
up in the 78th up to the 80s and then

782
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,679
it's you know there's the way that the

783
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,200
cut was from the plane it wasn't just

784
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,038
straight across it was you know from the

785
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,798
78th then you know on up to maybe the

786
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,640
86th and

787
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,639
you know um then

788
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,038
the jet fuel had come down and was

789
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,880
burning down and there was people on the

790
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,720
on the ground who were

791
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,480
doused with

792
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,278
jet fuel that was already burning and

793
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,640
they were lit on fire on the ground it

794
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:06,000
was it was just insane how vast the

795
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,159
destruction path was a firefighter

796
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,720
what are you supposed to do with that

797
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,600
scale of fire

798
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,640
i i think the first bosses in the first

799
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,319
chiefs

800
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:21,759
were going to do their best to get

801
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:24,480
as we we get hose lines what our whole

802
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,200
theory is or our tactics is to get water

803
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,038
at the fire at the base of the fire

804
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,720
and get the truck company which is the

805
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,720
ladder company they're the guys who

806
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,278
break the doors down put ladders up this

807
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,600
and that to get them to where the life

808
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,079
is most expected and get them out of

809
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:41,599
there so i think the chiefs tactics at

810
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,759
that point was let me get multiple

811
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:46,398
engine companies let me get four five

812
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:49,679
six hose lines fighting this fire this

813
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:52,239
massive fire and let me get 15 20 truck

814
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,919
companies up there just yolking people

815
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,159
out of there yeah but you got to go up

816
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,360
the stairs everything's not working yeah

817
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,480
guys had to walk up 80 80 90 100 flights

818
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:04,319
of stairs and there's audio of

819
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,519
of

820
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,119
officers

821
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,798
and firefighters speaking to each other

822
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,479
on the radio channels and unfortunately

823
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,480
at that point in time we had very very

824
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,159
bad communication system

825
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,640
we've been fighting for years to get

826
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,320
radios that work properly we couldn't

827
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,159
because it was a lot of money

828
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,000
we fought for years to get the full

829
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,600
bunker firefighting suits which is the

830
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
pants and the coat

831
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,119
we used to have just coats and these

832
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,600
roll up rubber boots and guys were

833
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,839
burning to death and we had to fight

834
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:35,519
and unfortunately we lost three guys in

835
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:37,599
one vicious vicious fire in 1994

836
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,398
and then they finally said enough's

837
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,678
enough give these guys the gear

838
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,319
so

839
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,000
it's a strange phenomenon in the

840
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,678
first responder world and in the

841
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,359
military world

842
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,759
it's really one of the most important

843
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,599
things that takes place in society the

844
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,599
most pertinent

845
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,918
organizations and we can't get the

846
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,798
funding we need it's crazy they'll throw

847
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,320
money at every nonsensical thing but

848
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,879
when it comes to

849
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:06,480
gear equipment protective equipment

850
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,200
trucks this

851
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,120
couldn't get it just all the ways you

852
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,840
could take care of people i saw

853
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:16,079
in since 9 11 the wars in the middle

854
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,359
east have cost america over six trillion

855
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,319
dollars

856
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,558
and

857
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,519
the amount of that money that was spent

858
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:22,960
on

859
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,038
the soldiers

860
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,960
in this case the first responders is

861
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:30,720
minimal compared to it yeah almost

862
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,278
nothing they they like stay closed down

863
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,399
i believe it's either seven or eight

864
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,839
in

865
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:40,479
may of 2002

866
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:42,639
they closed down nine fire houses in new

867
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,319
york city for budget reasons

868
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,799
we hadn't even finished cleaning up the

869
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,158
world trade center site and they slashed

870
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:48,879
the budget

871
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,720
and

872
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,480
still to this day

873
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,319
have not reopened those fire houses

874
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,278
there's a million more people now living

875
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:59,918
in new york city than there were in 2001

876
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:02,480
and the fire protection is is way less

877
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,799
than it was and it's it's a sin

878
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,120
it's really a sin can i ask you a a

879
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,079
difficult question

880
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,119
so

881
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,359
there's this famous um

882
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:16,398
photograph of a falling man

883
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:18,079
so many people had to decide when

884
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:19,918
they're above the fire in the fire

885
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,759
whether to jump out of the building or

886
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,759
to burn to death

887
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,000
what do you make of that decision what

888
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,319
do you make of that situation

889
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,278
those people who jumped

890
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,839
those were acts of sheer desperation

891
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,640
i've i've been in fires

892
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,639
and and just minor burns but minor you

893
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,640
know in situations but i've been trapped

894
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,960
caught somewhat ended up in the burn

895
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,799
center for some nothing nothing serious

896
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,919
at all but like but i i for those brief

897
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,519
seconds half a minute was thank god if i

898
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,600
didn't have my fire gear on i would have

899
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,558
been burned to a very very horrible

900
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,158
level

901
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,720
those people

902
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,880
were burning alive

903
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,798
and they had the choice of either to

904
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,000
stay there and burn alive

905
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,759
or to

906
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,398
launch themselves

907
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,640
and some of them

908
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,398
i don't fault them but they they had a

909
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,759
few folks they won't show it anymore

910
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:15,518
because they say

911
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,480
i don't know why i defend some people

912
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,079
but

913
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,640
they had a couple folks that took

914
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,079
umbrellas and they took garbage bags

915
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,840
because they thought that it would slow

916
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,678
down their except their acceleration

917
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,759
rate to the ground and maybe just maybe

918
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,679
they wouldn't be killed

919
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:32,158
and that's to me

920
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,278
a true sense of desperation for humanity

921
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,200
to say

922
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,798
i'm going to die either way but let me

923
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,200
take my chance

924
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,759
and i don't know the exact number of

925
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,000
those folks who did that but our first

926
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,960
member of the fire department killed

927
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,278
firefighter daniel surf from edge 216

928
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,600
was struck by a jumper

929
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:52,480
and one of my dear friends was ordered

930
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,839
to

931
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,880
help

932
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,879
take him

933
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,200
and they knew he was passed away because

934
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,278
he was hit by a

935
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,200
flying missile i mean you know 120 miles

936
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:06,159
an hour body lands on you

937
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,519
those those two bodies are now crushed

938
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,519
and they were ordered to take that

939
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,839
firefighter and bring him across the

940
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,319
street to engine 10 ladder 10. it was

941
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,319
literally a firehouse

942
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,319
less than 100 yards

943
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,639
from the facade of the trade center from

944
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,240
the trade center complex they literally

945
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
right there

946
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,159
and there was plane parts that went into

947
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,079
that firehouse landed into the front

948
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,080
doors onto the roof but the building

949
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,720
itself was not destroyed

950
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:34,879
so it was used as as a mini command

951
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,399
center for quite a while

952
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,679
so my friend was ordered to take

953
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:42,158
daniel's body in respect

954
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,519
and bring it over to

955
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,278
this firehouse

956
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,440
and give it some semblance of dignity

957
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:50,319
and lay it out on one of the bunk room

958
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,240
the bunks we have in the bunk house

959
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,519
and just cover it with a sheet and put a

960
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,000
sign

961
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,679
please firefighter kill do not disturb

962
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,200
and then we'll get to him later because

963
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,960
obviously this operation is going to go

964
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,558
on for days

965
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,240
and my friend who's such a great great

966
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:08,079
wonderful guy is so still to this day

967
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,559
filled with guilt because if they

968
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,079
weren't taking his body out

969
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,078
with the respect and dignity that they

970
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,200
did it took a while because

971
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,599
you know just it's a tough situation

972
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,878
his ladder company

973
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,480
it's coming over the bridge there's a

974
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,719
famous picture

975
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,320
of ladder 118 you see this

976
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,358
tractor trailer fire truck it's the one

977
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,359
where the guy in the back also drives

978
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,279
and it's a zoomed out shot and you see

979
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,598
the brooklyn bridge and you see only the

980
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,079
fire truck in the middle and you see the

981
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,760
two burning towers in the distance

982
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,720
well his engine company

983
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,399
was just ahead of them on the bridge

984
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,398
and the only reason that engine company

985
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,719
lived is their initial duty assignment

986
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:50,480
was to take that firefighter and bring

987
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,239
his body over it's like the military we

988
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,119
don't leave anyone behind these are our

989
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,118
guys

990
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,879
as we some guys say it's all about the

991
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,079
guy right next to you and nothing else

992
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,679
really matters

993
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,880
when that guy right next to you goes

994
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:05,519
down it stops you get that guy to safety

995
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,240
or if he's dead you get him out

996
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,920
so in that time frame

997
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,598
that saved his life

998
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,200
but that's a heavy burden to carry now

999
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,200
for the rest of your life because you

1000
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,559
say if i wasn't helping my dead friend

1001
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,679
i'm dead yeah

1002
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,920
what did it

1003
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:25,759
look like at ground zero what did it

1004
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,519
feel like what did it smell like what

1005
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,160
you said it there's a sense that it was

1006
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,599
almost like a war zone but can you paint

1007
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,759
the picture of

1008
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,200
how much dust is in the air

1009
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,760
how hot is it

1010
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:40,399
how many people are there

1011
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,720
and and again how did it feel like

1012
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,119
it was just

1013
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,039
it was scene of control chaos

1014
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,280
control because there was a semblance of

1015
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,039
command and we were just trying to do

1016
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,599
our jobs

1017
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,759
but it was such a frantic pace because

1018
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,240
we're now digging frantically knowing

1019
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,160
that there's life underneath this pile

1020
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,519
and this is throughout the afternoon

1021
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,920
this is this is

1022
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:07,759
yeah i mean this was non-stop you know

1023
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,240
uh just non-stop really for for days but

1024
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,440
for my particular crew we literally kept

1025
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,199
going we

1026
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,599
initially were dispatched over towards

1027
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,358
number seven had just gone down

1028
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,640
and we were searching the post office

1029
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,319
that was there there was reports of

1030
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,239
people trapped

1031
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,599
and we painstakingly searched every

1032
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,439
single inch of that building to make

1033
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,160
sure no one was left in there

1034
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,159
and then we were deployed to the pile

1035
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,239
and the pile was sort of ambiguous

1036
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,440
because it was just such a vast vast

1037
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:38,000
pile i mean it went for city blocks

1038
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,800
and we were we were assisting in the

1039
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,079
retrieval of two port authority police

1040
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,240
officers

1041
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,240
were lucky enough to survive but they

1042
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,479
were trapped they were deep down into a

1043
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,399
crevasse and they had to be physically

1044
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,240
dug out and extricated

1045
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,559
so there was a couple hundred few

1046
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:57,039
hundred guys involved in that process of

1047
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:59,358
bringing in equipment jaws of life

1048
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,279
airbags to lift steel you just you know

1049
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:03,199
to cut pieces of steel it was just a

1050
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,359
huge operation

1051
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,838
and we were back toward the logistics

1052
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,598
end of it shuttling in gear and and

1053
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,358
bring it bringing in stretchers bringing

1054
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,280
in oxygen you know whatever whatever was

1055
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:16,159
needed and you were trying to

1056
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,760
climb over this this jagged pile of

1057
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:20,239
debris it wasn't like you just walked

1058
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,720
100 feet on a street with something you

1059
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:24,239
were trying to climb over this i-beam

1060
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:26,078
and then down into this hole and then

1061
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,919
i'll back up that hole i mean just to

1062
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,839
run one piece of equipment took a half

1063
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,079
an hour to get

1064
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,440
100 feet 200 feet

1065
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,359
you know mind you some of these pieces

1066
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,960
of equipment are 100 pounds you know

1067
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,920
generator for rehearse tools this

1068
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,559
massive motor on a frame

1069
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,480
unstable ground unstable ground

1070
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:47,119
just just horrible conditions fires are

1071
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,880
still burning aside you beneath you

1072
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,119
and at one point

1073
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,800
i kind of veered off to the side and i

1074
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,200
was with this other fireman from my

1075
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,359
father's old ladder company 172 and

1076
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,759
it was strange because we were down

1077
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:04,400
quite a bit down like 70 feet down into

1078
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,720
this ravine of debris

1079
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,559
and he says brother what do you hear

1080
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,759
and at the time it was like dust it was

1081
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:13,599
like sand just falling down a pile

1082
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,040
and it was hissing from gas pipes and

1083
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,440
water pipes

1084
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,800
and and i said i hear i hear the gas

1085
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,200
lines i hear the

1086
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,440
sand i hear the concrete he goes no no

1087
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:25,279
what else do you hear

1088
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,400
and just the side of us was a lady's

1089
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,240
pocketbook

1090
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,800
and a high-heeled shoe

1091
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:33,679
and someone's sneaker

1092
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,599
with nobody with it

1093
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,879
and i said i don't know i don't hear

1094
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,039
anything

1095
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,960
he says me neither he goes

1096
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,960
no one's coming out of here

1097
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,159
and i said no no no this there's got to

1098
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,760
be someone coming out of here i mean

1099
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,358
there's thousands of people in here and

1100
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,599
they're coming out

1101
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,960
he says brother

1102
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,720
we would hear him calling for help

1103
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,599
they're gone

1104
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:55,199
and

1105
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,079
i still at that point thought there was

1106
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,679
a chance and and

1107
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,400
after about the fourth day they just

1108
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:02,399
said

1109
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,000
this is a recovery now there's there's

1110
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,119
no more there's no more life there's no

1111
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,880

1133
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,679
had a report of a bomb

1134
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,760

00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,519
two and a half miles

1140
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,118

in in a what's become unfortunately is

1184
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,039
somewhat ungrateful society but they

1185
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,119
will not forget

1186
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:40,318
these great guys

1187
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,720
so you uh tell steven's story he's one

1188
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,759
of the 20 people that you talk about in

1189
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,879
the new

1190
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,359
ireland labs 2420 podcast series

1191
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,838
if you can just linger on his story a

1192
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:53,440
little longer

1193
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,880
what does that tell you about the human

1194
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,559
spirit that this guy

1195
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,400
you know the tunnel couldn't couldn't

1196
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,039
drive through so he just puts on that

1197
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,920
heavy pack and runs

1198
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:08,559
what do you make of that

1199
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,559
that shows the depth of a man's soul

1200
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,159
he didn't have to do that he could have

1201
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,358
turned around and went home to his

1202
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:17,279
family

1203
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:18,559
and nobody would have shamed him but

1204
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,280
he's

1205
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,880
one of those beautiful brave people that

1206
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,519
take a job

1207
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,800
and really doesn't pay a lot of money

1208
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,838
and

1209
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,680
you become a cop or a

1210
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:35,440
firefighter or nurse or an emt or a

1211
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:36,559
medic or soldier a marine an airman

1212
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,400
sailor

1213
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,880
when you take these jobs

1214
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,960
you don't do it for

1215
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,599
fanfare you definitely don't do it for

1216
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,519
money i mean those those 13 brave souls

1217
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,039
we lost you know week or two ago in

1218
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,119

they make 22 000 an hour

1221
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,480
but they don't work 40 hours a week they

1222
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:01,119
work 80 they work 90 hours a week so

1223
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,519
they're making about six bucks an hour

1224
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,160
and you know what they sign off

1225
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,759
and firefighters and cops and medics and

1226
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,039

emergency room doctors

1229
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:14,000
they don't really make a lot of money i

1230
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,759
mean they're starting salary right now

1231
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,358
for a new york cop i was in new york cop

1232
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,000
for two years first

1233
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:22,960
i made 12 25 an hour

1234
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,880
back in 1989 to get shot at

1235
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,358
during the crack wars

1236
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,119
if you made uh

1237
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,719
11 an hour

1238
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,039
with a family of four you were entitled

1239
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:36,559
to welfare back then

1240
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:38,318
so i was just above the welfare level

1241
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,679
risk of my life

1242
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:41,440
and these are the guys that are getting

1243
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:44,078
ripped up now

1244
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,400
right and and look i won't get into any

1245
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,480
politics but like

1246
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,240
that says something about someone's soul

1247
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,519
that they're willing to take a job like

1248
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,318
that and get

1249
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,480
now get zero respect so a guy like

1250
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,400
stephen what that shows is the depth of

1251
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,800
that man's soul and courage and

1252
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,960
determination

1253
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,160
it's hard to be selfless in this world

1254
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,838
anymore

1255
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:07,920
but i still know a lot of selfless

1256
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:10,559
people that just just put on equipment

1257
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,440
every day bulletproof vests fire bunker

1258
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:13,759
gear

1259
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,358
stethoscopes

1260
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,760
you know flak jackets military helmets

1261
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:21,279
and they go in and they do it smiling

1262
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,040
that young marine

1263
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,200
that passed

1264
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:28,079
last week she was photographed and

1265
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:30,879
quoted as saying i have my dream job but

1266
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,280
she was holding on the left got any baby

1267
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,280
and she was dead a few days later

1268
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,880
she was so thrilled to be making seven

1269
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,599
dollars an hour helping people right

1270
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,680
isn't that huge like that to me says

1271
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,838
that's a true sign of character right

1272
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:47,118
there and it's important for our society

1273
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:50,480
to elevate those people as heroes

1274
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,079
let me ask you about firefighting

1275
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,679
what do you think it means to be a great

1276
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,119
firefighter

1277
00:44:53,679 --> 00:45:01,838
and a great man a great human being

1278
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,838
in a situation like you were in in 9 11.

1279
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,358
you know that's that's kind of a broad

1280
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,358
term like some you know you can go to

1281
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:10,799
different firehouses and they might have

1282
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,239
a different definition of what they

1283
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,240
consider a great firefighter

1284
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,358
but i think in the industry as a whole

1285
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,599
if you're willing to put

1286
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,440
everyone else before you

1287
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,519
especially your team

1288
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,920
you know it was we said ain't no i in

1289
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,239
team right it's t-e-a-m and there's no i

1290
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,559
in there it's all about those guys and

1291
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,799
girls next to you

1292
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,559
if you can do that

1293
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,880
that makes you pretty great

1294
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,799
you you put everything else second and

1295
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,800
you just run in and you run in with that

1296
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,960
team for strangers

1297
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,920
you know i i've had

1298
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,920
the honor of i spent almost 25 years of

1299
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,318
my adult life serving

1300
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,960
humanity my country

1301
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:57,920
my former city

1302
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,599
and the people i worked with were giants

1303
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,400
and i don't mean that in height i mean

1304
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:05,119
but i mean that in spirit and in soul

1305
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,039
i saw some of the most heroic selfless

1306
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,640
acts

1307
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,318
and then i saw some of the behind the

1308
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,879
scenes that were so impressive you know

1309
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,920
we'd go to a fire around christmas

1310
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,680
and a family would lose everything

1311
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,519
and even when i was a cop same thing you

1312
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:22,960
come back either to the police precinct

1313
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:24,239
or the firehouse or the ems station

1314
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,480
and someone would put together a

1315
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:29,199
collection and say hey guys hey lex 50

1316
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,719
bucks a man you know the smiths down the

1317
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,239
street just lost everything we're gonna

1318
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,598
go get some presents for the kids and

1319
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,000
some turkeys

1320
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,720
and not one of those guys questioned

1321
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,119
that

1322
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,879
and they were making 12.25 an hour and

1323
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,280
they still came up with 50 bucks for

1324
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,440
that family but see that's the stuff the

1325
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,079
press won't show you right they don't

1326
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,039
want to show that humanity that soft

1327
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,640
edge

1328
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,880
see when you're a warrior you need to

1329
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,239
have this rough shield this rough

1330
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,720
exterior

1331
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,559
because if you don't you die

1332
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,159
but

1333
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,799
a true great

1334
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,960
firefighter or responder or a cop or

1335
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,960
military personnel

1336
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,119
they have that rough exterior with that

1337
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,440
soft on their belly that that you know

1338
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,760
like this is that heart right it's there

1339
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,480
and and that's to me the true great ones

1340
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,480
yeah

1341
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,039
some of them they just have a hard time

1342
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,280
doing that you know there's no shame in

1343
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,519
showing your soft side you know well you

1344
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,440

have to leave

1410
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,639
the story behind tally ho is um

1411
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,800
back in world war ii there was this

1412
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:51,679
gentleman named bad jack carroll and

1413
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,519
jack was an airborne ranger and uh my

1414
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:55,440
father-in-law was also on a department

1415
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:57,440
and he knew jack

1416
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,159
and jack came home

1417
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,440
jack jumped normandy and uh stormed up

1418
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:04,000
through the battle of the bulge in

1419
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,079
bostonia and uh

1420
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,920
he came back

1421
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,839
greatest generation as they all did and

1422
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,358
they they got jobs they went right to

1423
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:15,519
work and uh they were treated better

1424
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,199
back then vets right and uh he got on

1425
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,679
the new york city fire department and he

1426
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:21,519
got assigned a lot of 114

1427
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:23,358
and they first got um

1428
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,079
radios back then

1429
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,679
and when jack he would drive the truck

1430
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,400
you're up there with the officer either

1431
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,639
lieutenant or captain so if the boss is

1432
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,318
off the truck you you operate the radio

1433
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:35,679
for them as the driver so when they call

1434
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,079
them and they'd say

1435
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:40,318
you know a lot of 114 responding to 52nd

1436
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,680
street third avenue structure fire

1437
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,480
you're supposed to get back and say

1438
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:47,199
aladdin 114 10-4 but he refused to do

1439
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,400
that he'd say lana 114 tally ho

1440
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:50,239
because that's what they yell when they

1441
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,200
jump out the plane

1442
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,799
so all these years later it's stuck and

1443
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:57,679
it's a little bit of a bragging right

1444
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,960
but uh out of 350 engine and truck

1445
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,159
companies in the whole new york city

1446
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,920
fire department

1447
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:03,440
we're pretty much the only one that's uh

1448
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,960
called by their nickname on the radio

1449
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,119
not their number so

1450
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,280
it tweaks some guys off in other places

1451
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,680
you know they may f you italia you know

1452
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,640
but it's it's just uh yes it's a great

1453
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,039
great

1454
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:17,118

1455
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,880

were irish immigrants from the area from

1459
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:26,639
the neighborhood and they would actually

1460
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,880
take the the fire truck to church on

1461
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,960
sunday and park out front and and one

1462
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,119
guy would stay in it to hear the radio

1463
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,000
in case they got a call so uh yeah

1464
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,000

00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:50,400
we like to kid each other back and forth

1473
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,920

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,838

1480
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:08,480
good stuff you know um let me ask a

1481
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,440
i guess a difficult question if we just

1482
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,280
step back in the events of 911

1483
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,159
on the side of the people

1484
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,960
that flew into the towers

1485
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,598
what

1486
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,480
do you take away from that day about the

1487
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,000
nature about human nature about good and

1488
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,599
evil

1489
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,920
how did that change your view of the

1490
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:27,920
world

1491
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,079
i

1492
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,920
i witnessed evil firsthand um i remember

1493
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,079
later on well into that night when we

1494
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,680
were uh trying to help get those police

1495
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:43,119
officers out i remember looking up at

1496
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:45,598
the building century 21 the store

1497
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,280
runs along the east side of the towers

1498
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,440
and it was still there and you know the

1499
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,240
debris had come down right almost to the

1500
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,480
edge century 21 is this old story

1501
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,639
department store in new york city

1502
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,039
and the sign was was there and it was

1503
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,879
still lit up like some of the neon was

1504
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,960
broken and but i think some of it was

1505
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,039
actually still lit up and i just looked

1506
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,280
around and i was like

1507
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:09,358
this is this is a war zone like we're at

1508
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,400
war and and you know we knew we were

1509
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:14,239
attacked we heard the fighter planes and

1510
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,160
you know back then it wasn't uh the

1511
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,838
extensive communication network and we

1512
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,000
had cell phones but they were the old

1513
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,759
school flip phones and there was no news

1514
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,760
on them and so

1515
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,760
plus we we didn't have a signal down

1516
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,400
there anyway i couldn't reach my family

1517
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,559
for like 12 13 hours and

1518
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,240
my dad had deployed down to the ferry

1519
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:36,559
terminal to retrieve bodies uh he was

1520
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:39,039
retired but he still went

1521
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:42,000
and they deployed him to go be

1522
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:43,759
basically the morgue transport guys they

1523
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,679
expected to be sending

1524
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,960
hundreds and thousands of bodies across

1525
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,719
on the ferry

1526
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,039
and they set up these tractor trailers

1527
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,639
as a mobile morgue and uh that never

1528
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,639
happened because

1529
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:58,400
there were no bodies to take they were

1530
00:53:54,639 --> 00:54:00,960
all buried um

1531
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,559
so i saw evil first hand i i don't know

1532
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,559
how someone can inflict such

1533
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,920
vent revenge or or eventual act for in

1534
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,240
the name of anything in the name of a

1535
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,039
religion and a name of a cause and a

1536
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:15,039
name

1537
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:16,880
like what the hell you know were you

1538
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,039
ever able to make sense of that why men

1539
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,240
are able to commit such acts of terror

1540
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:25,838
in the days and the years after

1541
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,838
no lex i haven't i you know

1542
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,720
my mom's from ireland and um i still

1543
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:33,519
have a lot of family there and and you

1544
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:35,759
know my my great uncles

1545
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:38,000
one of them was dragged out and shot no

1546
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,480
he lived but but just based on a rumor

1547
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,280
that he was in the ira

1548
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,440
and i wasn't happy to see what happened

1549
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,319
to my mom's people because they they

1550
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,798
were

1551
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:50,880
victimized and brutalized by

1552
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:52,480
england at that time

1553
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,039
but

1554
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,599
blowing up bombs and and killing

1555
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,920
innocents and the name of that

1556
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,480
it doesn't make it right

1557
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,119
i couldn't justify something like that i

1558
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,838
i can see

1559
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:10,400
you know i was a cop i was a soldier

1560
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:12,078
and you never want to take life and in

1561
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,200
those

1562
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:17,039
jobs but sometimes you have to

1563
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,879
but you don't do it with a vengeance you

1564
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,480
don't do it with a thirst you do it

1565
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,640
because it's necessary for survival

1566
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,119
when you do it out of a bloodlust out of

1567
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,798
a thirst out of a cause

1568
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,400
that's evil there's something wrong with

1569
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:32,000
you

1570
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,200
i i have no

1571
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,599
i i respect life to the highest level i

1572
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:39,439
i mean i'm very life is sacred to me

1573
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:43,599
it's precious it's beyond

1574
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,599
it's not a commodity it's a gift

1575
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:48,480
but to take life just so randomly so

1576
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,720
there's something way wrong with that

1577
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,079
person and and maybe i'm a conflicted

1578
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,078
soul

1579
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,400
but i would have no problem seeing

1580
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,880
someone like that put to death because

1581
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,480
they do not deserve life

1582
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,280
um

1583
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,358
there's there's many uh many children

1584
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,640
around this world that are being taught

1585
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:09,039
to hate

1586
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,960
someone who's different than them

1587
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:13,679
just because the the person who's

1588
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,679
allegedly teaching them says so

1589
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:18,558
i don't understand it well that starts

1590
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,639
with just having a basic um

1591
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,720
respect and appreciation for the other

1592
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,598
human beings and yes that starts with

1593
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:28,399
empathy so yes and one of the reasons i

1594
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,680
love this country why while joking that

1595
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,358
i'm russian

1596
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,440
maybe you could say the same as you

1597
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:35,440
being irish

1598
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,200
you're actually truly an american and

1599
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,440
that's why i consider myself very much

1600
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,679
an american and one of the reasons i

1601
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,720
love this country is it serves as a

1602
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:44,480
beacon

1603
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:46,798
i still

1604
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,798
believe it serves as a beacon of hope

1605
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:50,798
and that empathy and love

1606
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:51,759
uh for the rest of the world that like

1607
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:54,318
hate

1608
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,480
is uh not gonna get you far that love

1609
00:56:54,318 --> 00:57:00,639
will get you a lot farther and i i still

1610
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,240
think you know sometimes it's easy to um

1611
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:04,879
see the press

1612
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:07,118
uh mainstream media you can see social

1613
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,960
networks because you can make so much

1614
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,160
money on division

1615
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,240
sometimes

1616
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:14,719
uh because it makes so much money it's

1617
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:16,639
easy to think like we're really divided

1618
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:18,480
i honestly don't think we are it's just

1619
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:20,159
like oh i think the very surface level

1620
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,199
thing that we see on twitter

1621
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:24,399
it's that you're abs you're 100 right

1622
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,838
there's people out there that are

1623
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:30,240
maximizing off this whole division right

1624
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:33,039
they want us divided they want people

1625
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:35,679
angry because it sells you know a lot of

1626
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:37,838
these people that are in charge of

1627
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,000
certain organizations well they all seem

1628
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,078
to have nice cars and nice houses and

1629
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,119
nice vacations

1630
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,119
and

1631
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,280
they're constantly trying to convince

1632
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,280
everybody that we hate each other yeah

1633
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,359
to me i'll use a fireman analogy right

1634
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,359
it's like a little campfire

1635
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:55,759
and if you just let the embers

1636
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,679
flutter they'll they'll go out

1637
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,440
but if you take a little cup of gasoline

1638
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:01,679
with those embers

1639
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,119
it'll blow right up in your face

1640
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:05,358
and that's what a lot of these

1641
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,960
politicians and a lot of these media

1642
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,639
folks are doing because there's

1643
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,720
something in it for them

1644
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,879
and i i think they're it's possible to

1645
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:15,439
defeat them with great leaders with

1646
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,200
great spokespeople with great human

1647
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,200
beings having a voice one of the

1648
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:20,318
powerful things of the internet

1649
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:22,239
is

1650
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,000
more and more people have a voice and i

1651
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:26,558
ultimately believe

1652
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,119
in certainly in america but in the world

1653
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:31,440
the good people outnumber

1654
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,640
the [ __ ] oh i agree though and you

1655
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,599
know there's days when i think the

1656
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:38,000
[ __ ] are you know are overrunning us

1657
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:40,640
but you know what um

1658
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,679
i think what the downfall of the world

1659
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:44,239
is

1660
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:45,679
is ego and arrogance and people that

1661
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:47,519
think they're better

1662
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:49,440
than that other guy

1663
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:52,000
my parents raised me you know to be this

1664
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,838
way my mom is such a sweet gentle soul

1665
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,960
she's an immigrant she came here at 16

1666
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,599
years old

1667
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,440
she helps everybody but herself right

1668
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,838
she's just one of those people she's

1669
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,679
sick she's got parkinson's you'd never

1670
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:06,400
know it and she's still flying around

1671
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:08,000
her condo complex helping everybody

1672
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,318
because that's what she does

1673
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,880
she loves to help people

1674
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:13,838
but she's been in their shoes she's been

1675
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,160
poor

1676
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:18,639
she's sick her husband was sick she's

1677
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:21,519
had all sorts of suffering and loss in

1678
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:24,318
her life my grandad died

1679
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:27,199
when my mom was 10 and she was one of 10

1680
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:29,519
children that survived out of 14.

1681
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:32,879
she knows hard times

1682
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:35,599
but she so appreciates the good times

1683
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:37,760
and the goodness of this country

1684
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,119
you know the

1685
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,960
fire department and the police

1686
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,358
department military told me a lot about

1687
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,079
empathy and and trying to really feel

1688
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:48,960
for someone and put yourself in there

1689
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:51,760
their situation um i remember years back

1690
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,440
i was a much younger fireman at probably

1691
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,880
five years on a job

1692
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,720
and uh

1693
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,280
i was sent down to the next firehouse

1694
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,199
over to fill in you know we would get

1695
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,280
sent around randomly when they needed an

1696
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:04,078
extra guy

1697
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,798
and

1698
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:08,960
someone came banging on a firehouse door

1699
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,719
and in the tenement apartment next door

1700
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,480
they said there was an an older woman

1701
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:13,279
that was unconscious

1702
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,358
so

1703
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,040
we dispatched ourselves and we ran over

1704
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,960
with the medical kit

1705
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:21,279
and it was an elderly woman

1706
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,960
laying there on the bed and she was

1707
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,640
obviously

1708
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,798
not breathing she was

1709
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:28,558
obviously in cardiac arrest and an older

1710
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:30,318
gentleman that was

1711
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:33,040
holding her hand just just un

1712
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:34,798
inconsolably crying and it turned out it

1713
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,960
was her husband and they were married

1714
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,559
for 65 years

1715
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,639
and um

1716
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,599
normally we would just respectfully ask

1717
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:43,279
the

1718
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,960
family members to just step aside and

1719
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,559
let us do our work

1720
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,920
and i realized that he wouldn't leave

1721
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,798
her side

1722
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,519
so i kind of gave the crew a wink and

1723
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:55,358
they were doing cpr and what they had to

1724
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,280
and and i just

1725
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:59,199
let him keep holding her hand and i said

1726
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:02,160
sir if you you know could you just come

1727
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:03,279
over just a little bit so we can work

1728
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,199
and

1729
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,920
i held his hand

1730
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:10,399
as he held hers and and i said sir i

1731
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,200
said do you do you have faith and he did

1732
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,440
and

1733
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:14,960
i said would you like to pray with me

1734
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,079
for your wife

1735
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,318
and

1736
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,318
he said i would like to so we we said

1737
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:22,318
the lord's prayer and and

1738
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:24,798
you know i just asked god to protect her

1739
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:26,318
and bless her and

1740
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:30,239
i think he realized that she didn't have

1741
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:31,838
a chance but we still gave her that

1742
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,919
that chance and we you know got her in

1743
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:35,838
the ambulance and maybe maybe it was

1744
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,519
wrong to try to make it look like we

1745
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:38,480
could save her but you know you can't

1746
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:40,960
really

1747
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:43,519
not not try

1748
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,798
but the one beautiful moment was

1749
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:45,759
he thanked me

1750
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:47,358
and

1751
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,680
he

1752
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:51,519
was almost okay with it at that point

1753
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:52,960
like he wasn't as upset he wasn't as

1754
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,038
distraught

1755
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,639
because i tried to just humanize that

1756
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,319
situation of what we were trying to do

1757
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,960
we were trying to do our best but we

1758
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:03,679
also tried to be compassionate to his

1759
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,599
sadness and

1760
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,199
it just i walked away just feeling so

1761
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,440
good even though it was a tragic

1762
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:11,679
situation and she did pass that you know

1763
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,318
he he came by to you know

1764
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:15,838
thank us days later and um

1765
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,239
just heartbreaking but you know there's

1766
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:20,880
there's just it's just happens many many

1767
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,318
times throughout the country every day

1768
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,960
people get that opportunity as a

1769
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:27,279
responder to be that last

1770
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,159
bridge to the family and the loved one

1771
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,240
and

1772
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:32,558
you only get that opportunity once

1773
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:34,239
sometimes and you really have to

1774
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,680
to me it's like your moment to shine you

1775
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,798
know you could just be very very

1776
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:40,719
dismissive and very rude or you could be

1777
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:42,480
compassionate and just show hey i've

1778
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:44,239
i've i have a mom i have a grandma i

1779
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,679
have you know and and

1780
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:46,798
just in your mind pretend that that's

1781
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,879
who you're working on and that's who

1782
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:50,880
you're with so that moment of compassion

1783
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,920
that moment of empathy even if it's

1784
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,079
brief

1785
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,480
can be the thing that saves the person

1786
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,559
from suffering

1787
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,838
make the difference between

1788
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:04,000
suffering and overcoming in the face of

1789
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:06,159
tragedy yes like i felt that even though

1790
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,318
obviously his loss was still huge it

1791
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:09,279
just made it a little more bearable and

1792
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:10,880
um

1793
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,359
you know tried to just take his grief

1794
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,798
down to a lower level and uh i it made

1795
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:16,798
me feel

1796
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:18,639
just feel really good about doing it

1797
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:20,318
that's a powerful way to see the job of

1798
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,239
a first responder of course you have to

1799
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:24,480
deal with certain aspects of the tragedy

1800
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,679
but it's to provide somebody with that

1801
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,159
moment

1802
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:30,239
of compassion yeah and you know i i made

1803
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:31,679
it a little habit because sometimes with

1804
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,519
faith it's a little bit of a tricky

1805
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:35,598
subject so

1806
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:37,679
every time i had someone who died which

1807
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:39,280
unfortunately was many many times i

1808
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:40,960
would i would just

1809
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,039
touch their hand and just say a little

1810
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,400
quick prayer and just say look you know

1811
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:45,839
i hope you're moving on to a better

1812
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,760
place i hope

1813
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,000
if you did have faith that it's it's

1814
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,440
it's strong as you depart

1815
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,280
and if you didn't have faith i hope

1816
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,200
maybe at your last moment that you found

1817
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,200
some and and you just found some closure

1818
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:59,919
so that was just my little

1819
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:02,078
my little ritual i think i just you know

1820
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,680
i felt it was important that that that

1821
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,400
person even though they were a stranger

1822
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:07,838
just had someone there it's just sort of

1823
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,160
hoping for the best for them in their

1824
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:12,558
last moments

1825
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:15,199
you mentioned cancer

1826
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:16,400
you had a rare

1827
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:19,519
leukemia

1828
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,519
due to um

1829
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,960
all the work that you did at ground zero

1830
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,680
can you maybe talk to

1831
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,880
the experience of just breathing through

1832
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:31,199
those days

1833
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,318
and what that was like being unable to

1834
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,798
breathe

1835
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:37,199
being overwhelmed by all of the dust in

1836
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:40,719
the air

1837
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:41,919
yes um the the first day especially um

1838
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:44,000
we

1839
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,920
we didn't have equipment we ran you know

1840
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,039
we didn't have breathing apparatus and

1841
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,880
we were handed little 69

1842
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,880
hardware store dust masks you know those

1843
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,000
little thin paint masks that would just

1844
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,000
get sweated up and you know sticking to

1845
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,480
your face within 30 seconds so you would

1846
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,400
you just they were useless

1847
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,318
and what what you wound up feeling like

1848
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,400
was that you you swallowed a box of

1849
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:08,079
razor blades because there was glass and

1850
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,440
there was cement and it was just so

1851
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,960
caustic

1852
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,798
and uh

1853
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,318
i remember that night you know when we

1854
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:17,519
went back just to get some medical

1855
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:19,199
relief uh for the few hours

1856
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:20,798
we were walking up the hill to the

1857
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:24,318
firehouse because they dropped us off

1858
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:26,798
like a block away down at engine 201s

1859
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:28,558
and quarters and uh

1860
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:29,679
one of the older firemen as we're

1861
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,200
walking up the block we're all

1862
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:33,118
struggling we're all having a hard time

1863
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:36,239
breathing and just just i mean i felt

1864
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:38,480
like i was dying literally it's it was

1865
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,239
pretty bad and just remember the one guy

1866
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,920
going now we're all dead and i said no

1867
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:43,679
no we made it we made it he goes no you

1868
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,159
don't get a kid he said

1869
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:48,719
we just breathed in poison after poison

1870
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:50,719
for for hours and then that went into

1871
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:52,558
days and it went into months

1872
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:54,078
he says we're all dead men this is going

1873
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:57,119
to take us all

1874
01:05:54,079 --> 01:06:00,720
and i i i thought he was crazy and then

1875
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:02,480
now years later like starting in 0.304

1876
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:03,519
guys just started coming down with these

1877
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,960
really

1878
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:08,719
rare and advanced cancers and then

1879
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,000
it just it just stopped being a

1880
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:11,598
coincidence

1881
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,920
with the number of guys and they were

1882
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:17,119
young one one of the first guys john

1883
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:20,000
mcnamara he was 33 or 34 and he came

1884
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:22,000
down colon cancer and it took him

1885
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,119
quickly in 2000

1886
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,000
it was in 2005 and

1887
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:29,280
i i kind of said to you know friends and

1888
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,679
family i said i feel like i'm running

1889
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,599
through a minefield and i wonder when my

1890
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:35,838
i'm gonna step on my mind because

1891
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:39,039
everybody's gonna get sick

1892
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:41,440
and i wasn't feeling well from 2008 on

1893
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:42,880
just i just i couldn't put it and i

1894
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,480
couldn't put my finger on it but it just

1895
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:47,519
wasn't right

1896
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,440
and in 2011 uh

1897
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:51,440
i i failed my medical

1898
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,280
my bloods my bloods came back

1899
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,599
horrifically wrong

1900
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,079
and they pulled me off the truck

1901
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,880
but uh they strung me out for a month

1902
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,039
the

1903
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,440
doctors in the fire department one of

1904
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:05,359
them said my spleen was engorged because

1905
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,159
it was probably drinking myself to death

1906
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:08,239
like

1907
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:10,159
as he said most of the guys

1908
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:11,439
did after 9 11

1909
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:13,038
which was pretty wrong of him in

1910
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,000
stereotypical you know just to

1911
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:17,760
stereotype and to categorize and

1912
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,639
guy couldn't have cared less he just he

1913
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:23,200
was so crude and nasty and then my one

1914
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:26,239
doctor who was my doctor on the outside

1915
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:28,719
my blood pressure was 240 over 140

1916
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:29,838
my spleen was about to rupture

1917
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:32,558
she didn't even show up for my

1918
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:34,719
appointment and i went down i passed out

1919
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,000
the paramedics responded

1920
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:38,639
she got into an argument with a

1921
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,400
paramedic because for big ego

1922
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:41,679
and basically telling him there wasn't

1923
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,920
really anything wrong and he's looking

1924
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:45,759
at my paperwork going this guy's got

1925
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,000
leukemia and

1926
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,400
he overrode her he raced me out of there

1927
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,239
down to brooklyn methodist

1928
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,680
and uh

1929
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:55,679
the doctor

1930
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:57,679
the charge physician the er physician he

1931
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:00,239
says you're not leaving because uh

1932
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:02,558
you're in a bad way and i said

1933
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,239
what is it he said i need four he goes i

1934
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:06,480
need i need a little while to figure it

1935
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:08,318
out he goes but

1936
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,000
you probably have one of a

1937
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:11,358
few different types of leukemia he said

1938
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,440
i'll drill into your hip take your

1939
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:15,598
marrow and find out

1940
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,920
and he said uh but in the meantime we'll

1941
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,838
get the swelling on the spleen down like

1942
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,719
some sort of rapid medicines and whatnot

1943
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,880
because my spleen is about to rupture

1944
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:27,039
i had no blood platelets left which is

1945
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,440
your clotter so i basically would have

1946
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:31,519
bled to death and uh

1947
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:34,158
i found out from my team of doctors that

1948
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,239
i had about 48 hours to live

1949
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:38,639
um and that really set me off i was

1950
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:40,639
infuriated because i was telling them

1951
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,600
for a long time that i was sick

1952
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,679
and

1953
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,359
the doctors failed you the few doctors

1954
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:49,759
in the beginning failed you i felt very

1955
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:52,880
betrayed and and other guys had died

1956
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:54,880
and uh i i had a i had it out with that

1957
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,199
one doctor i basically told her she was

1958
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,560
fired from my case and she's

1959
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,798
pretty politically

1960
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,039
in charge person and i didn't care i i

1961
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:05,278
jeopardized my my job for it because it

1962
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:06,798
was my life and i got the sense that she

1963
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,600
didn't really it didn't really matter to

1964
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:10,079
her

1965
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,039
she didn't have any empathy as you say

1966
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:16,238
it was exact so why for her why for a

1967
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:19,838
few others was there not a

1968
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:22,158
a special care special compassion for

1969
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:23,838
first of all all humans but human beings

1970
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,238
in your position especially a

1971
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:28,079
firefighter a first responder you know

1972
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:30,479
alex i think what it is in the

1973
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:34,079
department their title is just to get us

1974
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:36,479
back to duty as quickly as possible when

1975
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,719
we are either injured or sick because

1976
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,318
what happens then is your replacement is

1977
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:43,119
now in overtime

1978
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:45,120
so you're out being paid on medical eve

1979
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:47,198
but then they need to replace your spot

1980
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,679
and then that costs more money

1981
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:51,039
so i think it's just behooves them to

1982
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,279
get as many

1983
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:54,800
personnel back and especially during the

1984
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,719
summer time you know they look at it

1985
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,920
like oh maybe you want a few extra days

1986
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,198
off to uh you know go to the beach

1987
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,440
and uh

1988
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:05,198
this one doctor he tipped his hand back

1989
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:07,519
as if like i was drinking an alcohol

1990
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:09,279
beverage he says hey busy summer

1991
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,360
because i asked him to look at my spleen

1992
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:12,960
which was sticking out of my abdomen

1993
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:15,119
like a football

1994
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:18,000
and i said excuse me sir i said how dare

1995
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,960
you assume that i'm i'm abusing alcohol

1996
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,439
because

1997
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,600
you know alcohol abuse sometimes will

1998
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:26,319
present itself as the spleen

1999
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,000
is engorged and having an issue so you

2000
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:30,000
automatically just assume that that was

2001
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,279
my situation wouldn't even give me an

2002
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,600
exam

2003
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:35,599
and i was horrified i was i was so angry

2004
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,079
i mean i wanted to punch this guy out

2005
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,480
and i literally was screaming at him and

2006
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,640
an executive officer came in to defuse

2007
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:44,158
it and sent me to another doctor and

2008
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:47,039
when i showed her my paperwork she was

2009
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,960
horrified she was like what did he say

2010
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,880
and she said oh okay go go to your

2011
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,880
regular doctor tomorrow who was one of

2012
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,319
the department doctors and

2013
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,480
and she just

2014
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:59,119
it was just an indifference it was like

2015
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:01,678
i don't know i i was shocked at the lack

2016
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:04,079

2185
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,880
game together

2186
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:54,719

2187
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:57,279
human condition here here's these two

2188
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:59,920
men of two totally different faiths

2189
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:02,238
and yet we shared that that bond of

2190
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:06,319
faith and he had empathy and he had

2191
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:08,879
sympathy and he he's he saw

2192
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:11,119
me and many other patients so he just

2193
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,679
didn't assume and he and he gave me a

2194
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:15,359
fair shake and i will always be grateful

2195
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,679

i would never tell mayor bloomberg that

2231
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,480
right

2232
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,920
he's all about the book right but like

2233
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:35,359
you know honestly i would have i would

2234
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,600
have been a new york city farmer i would

2235
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:39,198
have paid them to do it yeah you know

2236
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,440
and uh

2237
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:43,519
i wasn't allowed anymore that's it you

2239
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,800
you know back when my dad got sick

2240
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,560
they'd let you hang around for 10 12

2241
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,400
years in an office but

2242
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,440
not now now it's all about the bottom

2243
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:53,119
line

2244
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:55,279
and uh

2245
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:57,599
but i was more depressed about losing a

2246
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:59,439
job than almost losing my life like as

2247
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,719
crazy as that sounds you know and it

2248
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:03,359
just uh

2249
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:05,840
it's more than a job i mean it's uh it's

2250
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:08,319

01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:34,879
of that brotherhood that i experienced

2262
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:37,359
in my life it was so god i i would give

2263
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,760
anything to have it back just yeah

2264
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:41,679
i can ask you about new york so when i

2265
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,520
i've uh unfortunately have never lived

2266
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:45,440
in new york i visit i've always wanted

2267
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,000
to live there for a bit obviously it's a

2268
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:50,238
very different experience to have really

2269
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,119
lived in new york for many many years

2270
01:19:50,238 --> 01:19:53,519
but

2271
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,559
there there's a few friends of mine that

2272
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,120
are from

2273
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,400
they got similar accent as yours yeah

2274
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:00,960
that uh

2275
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:02,639
that are a little bit saddened perhaps

2276
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,439
it's temporary but

2277
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:07,520
perhaps not they don't seem to think so

2278
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:09,919
of what new york has become especially

2279
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,840
with kovid it's losing some of the

2280
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:14,239
spirit of new york

2281
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:17,360
um do you have that sense do you have a

2282
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:20,238
hope for this city that has been so

2283
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:22,559
defining to what is america

2284
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:24,959
you know i my heart's broken

2285
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:27,199
i had moved to new jersey many years ago

2286
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,600
and but i still have close attachment to

2287
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:31,519
new york my parents are still there many

2288
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,480
many family members

2289
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:37,040
um and i've since now moved to tennessee

2290
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:39,919
i needed to go somewhere quiet i wanted

2291
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:41,039
to heal my fractured soul and i'm in the

2292
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,000
middle

2293
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:47,279
of a beautiful farming rural area in

2294
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,960
middle tennessee and um so

2295
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:51,198
they probably call me a sellout back in

2296
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:54,239
new york for leaving but it's not the

2297
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:57,198
same city and it's sad um you know i'll

2298
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:59,198
refrain from the politics and the um

2299
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:01,519
finger point

2300
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:03,599
but it's a mess compared to what it was

2301
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:06,159
and um you know i did broadway theater

2302
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,199
security for many years

2303
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,399
and

2304
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:13,039
i started to see it slide like like with

2305
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:15,839
stuff that was happening like you know

2306
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:18,158
public urination and defecation and just

2307
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,600
like you know tourists don't want to see

2308
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:22,638
that right and

2309
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:25,920
and um i i had an unfortunate incident

2310
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:28,639
um two years ago i was jumped by four

2311
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,319
teenagers coming off the subway

2312
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,119
and they were pissed off because i was

2313
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:34,799
wearing an american flag hat and i um

2314
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:36,960
i don't know i i

2315
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:40,079
i'm not really sure why but that it left

2316
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,679
me i got out of it um okay

2317
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:43,760
but

2318
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:45,279
i was taken back they were literally

2319
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,199
videoing it and the kid was just

2320
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:48,559
throwing shadow punches at my face

2321
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:50,158
wanting to beat me up and i finally

2322
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,880
looked at many eyes and i was like oh

2323
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:54,559
boy i'm a little too old for this

2324
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,400
body's a little broken down for chemo

2325
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,320
and i finally just said all right

2326
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:00,799
all right i i just i had enough i wanted

2327
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:02,399
to go home just work the 17-hour shift

2328
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,000
as a stagehand

2329
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:05,759
and i was so taken back i was so

2330
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,840
insulted i'm saying you know i spent my

2331
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,840
life protecting this city

2332
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,800
and now i'm getting attacked like for

2333
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,000
nothing and i just i gave up and i maybe

2334
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,279
i should have given it a little more

2335
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,039
time but

2336
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:18,559
it's um

2337
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,800
i don't know it's turned into an angry

2338
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,039
place it's turned into

2339
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,639
i think there's a lot of people that

2340
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:26,399
aren't getting the

2341
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:28,079
resources they need in a sense there's a

2342
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,960
lot of mental illness there's a lot of

2343
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:32,880
homelessness there's a lot of violent

2344
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,359
people just roaming around the streets

2345
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,359
and it's not good it's not safe

2346
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:38,880
and and tourists are not

2347
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:40,799
going to come back

2348
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,119
even just leading up to the covet i had

2349
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,880
some tourists say to me i won't be back

2350
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:47,599
and now i can only imagine that it's

2351
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,119
just gotten exponentially worse but

2352
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,560
i hope there's a chance it'll swing back

2353
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:53,039
because it is it's the gateway to the

2354
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,880
world i mean my grandfather came

2355
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:57,439

you know lived the american dream and it

2376
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,840
was all it was all from new york and my

2377
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:41,439
my father's mom was from irish

2378
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,440
immigrants

2379
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:45,198
and uh they all landed in ellis island

2380
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:46,960
well my mom didn't because it was closed

2381
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:49,279
at that point but

2382
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,520
it's it's there's people breaking down

2383
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:53,519
the doors to come to this country right

2384
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,040
there there there's no one breaking down

2385
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,480
the doors to leave

2386
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:57,760
and this is this is a problem i have

2387
01:23:56,479 --> 01:23:58,879
with people that aren't grateful for

2388
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,639
being here

2389
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,000
and this again it's not political just

2390
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:03,440
straight down the ball straight down the

2391
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,679
middle fastball

2392
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:08,319
if you don't like it here i'll show you

2393
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,840
the door i'll get you the plane ticket

2394
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:12,079
i mean would you want to live back in

2395
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,920
russia compared to here would you you

2396
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:16,319
might because of family ties but i mean

2397
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:18,158
if you had no ties to russia or would

2398
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:21,198
you want to go to china right now and

2399
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:23,198
possibly end up in a labor camp or right

2400
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:25,759
there's people busting down the doors to

2401
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:28,719
get to this place it's not perfect it's

2402
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:31,039
got its flaws it's got its blemishes

2403
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,880
you know um

2404
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:34,800
but it's a damn great place it's the

2405
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,960
best country in the world yeah and some

2406
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,840
of it so first of all i have hope for

2407
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,679
new york i i think that culture is very

2408
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,880
difficult to kill i think it will

2409
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:44,719
persevere

2410
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,920
and i think ultimately the same story

2411
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,359
with new york as with the rest of the

2412
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,880
united states

2413
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:52,479
um it has to do with leaders and yes i'm

2414
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,359
always hopeful that great leaders will

2415
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:57,439
emerge i agree and and the the kind of

2416
01:24:55,359 --> 01:24:59,119
leadership we see

2417
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:02,238
now and the kind of conversations we

2418
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:04,399
have now i think it has to do with um

2419
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:06,319
prosperity and comfort

2420
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:09,279
and in the face of hardship i think

2421
01:25:06,319 --> 01:25:11,359
great leaders will emerge and yeah um

2422
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:13,279
yeah i i just think ultimately in the

2423
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:15,279
long arc of history

2424
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,880
well leaders shouldn't become rich they

2425
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:18,719
shouldn't become rich in the process

2426
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,920
right you shouldn't go into political

2427
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:22,239
office

2428
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:24,399
as a you know an alleged you know

2429
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:25,759
lunch box kind of guy and then come out

2430
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:27,599
uh you know eating at the best

2431
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,600
steakhouse in the world i mean

2432
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,760
that that's the problem of politics

2433
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,960
right my irish grandmother god wrestler

2434
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,639
used to say

2435
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,319
oh those politicians they're all like

2436
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,440
dirty diapers they're full of [ __ ] and

2437
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:39,439
they stink

2438
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:41,599
and it's true i don't give a crap what

2439
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:44,479
party they're in yeah greed in power we

2440
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,239
had to beg these guys beg them

2441
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:48,479
for federal legislation to cover our

2442
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:51,198
medical bills right there's a gentleman

2443
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:54,238
john feel from the feel good foundation

2444
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:57,198
this guy is a lion of a man a general

2445
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:58,479

2446
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:01,119
and john

2447
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:02,399

2448
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:05,039
came to the

2449
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:07,039
911 site the day after

2450
01:26:05,039 --> 01:26:09,519
he was one of those guys cutting the

2451
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:12,399
steel with torches and craning it out of

2452
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:14,159
there one of those hard hats that just

2453
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:16,000
that never got

2454
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:17,920
the credit

2455
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,920
and the praise that that we did as

2456
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:23,119
responders and and i don't mean it as a

2457
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:26,158

01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,480
courts and two federal agents

2465
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:43,599
and i hope and 343 new york city

2466
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:46,479
firefighters we lost a ton of responders

2467
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:48,000
but the recovery workers

2468
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:49,759
thankfully weren't killed in that

2469
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,439
process but

2470
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,920
there's hundreds of them now who are

2471
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:56,000
dead from illnesses because they came

2472
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,319
down to recover our people and the

2473
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,039
civilians and the poor lost souls

2474
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:03,039
that were killed at work that day

2475
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:05,279
and john

2476
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:07,279
literally almost lost his foot

2477
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:09,198
in a construction accident at the site

2478
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:10,399

2481
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:16,960
ended up with massive sepsis six months

2482
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:19,439
in the hospital hundreds of thousand

2483
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,679
dollars in medical bills

2484
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:22,960
and then no one wanted to pay him

2485
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:25,520

quick right

2489
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:35,599
and he went on a mission

2490
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:37,519
formed his feel-good foundation his last

2491
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:39,199

this man

2494
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:45,279
literally went to washington dc with his

2495
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,280
army as he called it

2496
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:48,960

01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,439
dedicated some more time to it

2500
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:58,079
and what it was with john is he set out

2501
01:27:55,679 --> 01:28:00,480
on a mission to get and initially what

2502
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:02,319
he did is he got funding to take care of

2503
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:03,919
responders who were in that limbo who

2504
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:05,359
couldn't get their medical bills paid

2505
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,279
who couldn't make their mortgages who

2506
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:09,759

couldn't make their child care payments

2508
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:13,360
and john just took it upon his own to

2509
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:15,439
get donations and take care of you while

2510
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:17,119

2520
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:35,920
people who needed stuff and he was

2521
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:37,119
getting it done yeah and he with his

2522
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,119
army

2523
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:41,679
had to chase these politicians through

2524
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:43,359
the halls of congress

2525
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:46,639
to get funding to cover the medical

2526
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:49,679
bills i was getting sued for 125 000 my

2527
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:51,199
month stay in the cancer ward

2528
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:52,880
and

2529
01:28:51,198 --> 01:28:54,238
i couldn't believe it i said well wait a

2530
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,480
minute i have insurance they're like oh

2531
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:57,839
no no this is this is terrorism related

2532
01:28:56,479 --> 01:28:59,919
we don't cover that

2533
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,880
so usually then workers comp will cover

2534
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:04,560
your on-duty injury or illness oh no no

2535
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,039
leukemia is not covered under that we

2536
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,520
don't cover that so then the ping-pong

2537
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:11,679
game starts and i'm literally have

2538
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,760

01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:50,000
well john field got my medical bill paid

2557
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:51,359
he finally got these politicians with

2558
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,600
his team

2559
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:55,439
firefighter ray pfeiffer who has since

2560
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,639
died fought

2561
01:29:55,439 --> 01:30:00,079
with terminal cancer for nine years in a

2562
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:01,760
wheelchair

2563
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:02,800
literally at the end came out of hospice

2564
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,000
to go

2565
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:07,119
finalize

2566
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,079
getting us this coverage detective luis

2567
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:13,039
alvarez who testified

2568
01:30:10,079 --> 01:30:14,479
days before he died in front of congress

2569
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:16,238
and

2570
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,399
a bunch of other guys that were really

2571
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:20,559
really sick and we had to shame these

2572
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:22,960
people into signing on and luckily we

2573
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:25,840
had jon stewart come on and literally

2574
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:28,239
just just hound these guys and and shame

2575
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:31,360
them and embarrass them

2576
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:33,039
and what it all stemmed from was in 2006

2577
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:34,799
the first

2578
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:36,880
of death that was determined to be

2579
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,119
linked to 9 11 there was others but the

2580
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,199
first one that was officially linked

2581
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:43,519
was a new york city police detective who

2582
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:45,198
initially the city said he died of

2583
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,280
advanced lung disease his lungs were

2584
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:49,198
protruding out of his body

2585
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:50,719
and he was on painkillers and it was so

2586
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:53,439
bad at the end that the doctors said

2587
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:54,960
just grind them up snort them drink it

2588
01:30:53,439 --> 01:30:55,919
whatever you need to do to get instant

2589
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,480
relief

2590
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:00,719
so when they found the talcum from the

2591
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:02,479
pill lining in his lungs they said oh no

2592
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:05,600
this is opiate abuse you didn't he

2593
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:07,519
didn't die of lung disease so they said

2594
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,800
and the mayor was quoted as saying he is

2595
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,480
not a hero

2596
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:14,400
well shame on you mr mayor he was a hero

2597
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:15,759
and his father who was a retired police

2598
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:17,920
chief

2599
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,440
married up with the feelgood foundation

2600
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,960
and jon stewart

2601
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:23,279
and ray pfeiffer

2602
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,198
detective alvarez

2603
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:27,519
and they got us all covered

2604
01:31:25,198 --> 01:31:29,359
but it took so long lexi was so

2605
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:32,159
heartbreaking these people who were

2606
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:34,319
lining up three deep politicians three

2607
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:36,238
deep to catch a picture with a responder

2608
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:39,039
so they can tweet

2609
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:41,519
never forget and hashtag look at me and

2610
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:43,119
hey how am i doing all that bullcrap but

2611
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,600
they didn't know they were nowhere to be

2612
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:48,079
freaking found i phys i i literally

2613
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:50,159
witnessed them hiding in cloak rooms

2614
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:52,479
running down hallways away from us those

2615
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:54,238
freaking cowards that's cowardice

2616
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:57,279
can i just linger on the jon stewart

2617
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:59,678
thing the comedian actor jon stewart

2618
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:02,479
uh his testimony before congress over

2619
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:05,039
the benefits for 9 11 first responders

2620
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:07,919
i mean there's a lot of important human

2621
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:10,158
beings in this story but he has a big

2622
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:12,399
voice yes and he spoke from the heart

2623
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:15,359
what do you make of that testimony

2624
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:19,359
oh it was heartfelt i mean

2625
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:20,960
he spoke look i mean john john was a

2626
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:22,799
you know a polarizing guy right there's

2627
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,319
certain things like over the years he he

2628
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,480
was cutting edge and i might not have

2629
01:32:24,319 --> 01:32:28,238
agreed with all of his oh yeah you know

2630
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:30,079
well you know some stuff i'm not right

2631
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:31,919
you know like we all but but i tell you

2632
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:33,119
i found him as funny i i enjoyed his

2633
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,399
humor

2634
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:36,800
i would love the two you'd have a

2635
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:38,238
conversation no but but again i love a

2636
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,440
guy where you can have you can have a

2637
01:32:38,238 --> 01:32:40,638
difference in opinions that's the

2638
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:42,799
beautiful thing about the firehouse

2639
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:44,400
kitchen i mean it could get raucous and

2640
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,320
la and now i don't know it's a little

2641
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:47,839
different situation but

2642
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:49,599
i mean back in the day

2643
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:52,079
some funny stuff but yeah john john

2644
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,159
literally just took his talents

2645
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:56,479
you would think he was speaking from the

2646
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:58,319
heart of a fireman or a cop or a soldier

2647
01:32:56,479 --> 01:33:00,638
or a marine or you know someone who was

2648
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:02,319
there

2649
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:04,960
but i think he

2650
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:07,519
especially got to know ray so well and

2651
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,520
ray had this stack of

2652
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,360
mass cards from you know the funeral

2653
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,199
cards they give out

2654
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:15,119
it looks like you know a larger business

2655
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:17,198
card that's laminated

2656
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:19,279
and ray had a stack of them he would

2657
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:21,198
carry around i think it was close to 100

2658
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:23,759
cards

2659
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:25,599
and john saw it he said what's that

2660
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:28,480
he says these are my cards he said for

2661
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,159
what he says for my brother's funerals

2662
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:31,919
he was like oh my god you've been to

2663
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:35,198
that many funerals

2664
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:37,359
he goes yeah this this is just the ones

2665
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:41,198
i made like like you know

2666
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:43,439
and john i think was was just stunned

2667
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:46,000
and like john actually had that stack of

2668
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:47,919
cards after after ray passed and like

2669
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,399
said look this look at these look

2670
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:53,199
there's gonna be more of these cards we

2671
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:55,679
have one guy a week or a girl one one

2672
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:58,079
responder or or recovery worker or

2673
01:33:55,679 --> 01:34:00,719
someone who actually resided down there

2674
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:03,039
there's more than one a week dying

2675
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:05,439
it's one a day dying

2676
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:08,479
on average and on average two people are

2677
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:10,960
diagnosed with a 911 cancer or

2678
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:13,198
disease right now this the worst part is

2679
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,560
there's autoimmune diseases flying off

2680
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:16,000
the graph

2681
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,360
and they're not covered under the

2682
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,359
legislation

2683
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:21,839
by the grace of god my cancer is covered

2684
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:23,679
if my if my cancer comes back i mean i'm

2685
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,600
in remission it's technically incurable

2686
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:28,239
but i'm i've been blessed i'm staying

2687
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:29,840
ahead of this stuff going on 10 years

2688
01:34:28,238 --> 01:34:31,599
but if it comes back with a vengeance

2689
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,279
tomorrow and takes me

2690
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,120
you know at least my my wife will get my

2691
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:36,559
pension and be able to live her life

2692
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:38,479
without fear

2693
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,639
but my friends who are suffering from

2694
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:43,439
these advanced autoimmunes their wives

2695
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:44,560
get nothing their pension dies with them

2696
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:46,559
and

2697
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,639
we're hoping that that you know john and

2698
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:51,360
his army can can

2699
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:53,440
shame these politicians once again

2700
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:55,439
to have the kindness and decency to

2701
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:57,678
cover these autoimmunes

2702
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:01,279
you know they're throwing a lot of money

2703
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:03,279
around at a lot of things lately and

2704
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:04,880
this is one that they won't and and

2705
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:07,118
these are lives in the balance who

2706
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,079
really need it and john had this strong

2707
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:10,000
line

2708
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:11,600
they did their jobs

2709
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,679
do yours

2710
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,679
talking to the politicians yeah

and it it

2712
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:20,719
it's a strong wake-up call that

2713
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,960
um it's not about the twitter or the

2714
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:25,118
social media or all that kind of stuff

2715
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,239

2716
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:28,479
to

2717
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:31,198
it's that compassion

2718
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:33,359
uh implemented in form of money of

2719
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:35,919

01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:14,960
and the guy started tearing up the

2738
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,400
congressman and he signed it but he had

2739
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,920
to be freaking shamed and you know what

2740
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:20,158
he said well this doesn't really

2741
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:22,399
confront me this is pork as far as my

2742
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:23,759
district's concerned he goes oh yeah do

2743
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:25,439
you know there's 10 guys from your

2744
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,520
district who came across the country to

2745
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:30,559
help us that are also dying he had no

2746
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:33,199
idea yeah he had no idea and that's the

2747
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,119
sad part about alex there's there's

2748
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:36,719
it's a failure in leadership

2749
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:38,238
you know

2750
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:40,319
i mean i think some people would vote

2751
01:36:38,238 --> 01:36:42,079
for mickey mouse just because if he ran

2752
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:43,359
i mean no offense against mickey mouse i

2753
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:45,600
like him he's a good guy right i mean

2754
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:47,599
but like like allegedly allegedly

2755
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,600
supposedly yeah yeah you know but

2756
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,239
seriously like

2757
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:54,000
i i he i look at i look at some of the

2758
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:55,839
leadership sometimes and go

2759
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,319
we're in trouble and also you lose uh i

2760
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:59,039
think the way government is structured

2761
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:02,000
is

2762
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:02,880
um people who are senators or um

2763
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,960
people

2764
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,039
who are in congress they

2765
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,480
they start playing a game between each

2766
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:10,560
other and they lose track of the

2767
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:13,039
connection to the to the to the people

2768
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:15,119
to the basic humanity so you forget even

2769
01:37:13,039 --> 01:37:19,118
when you think of yourself as a cop

2770
01:37:15,118 --> 01:37:21,118
uh you forget what are like the cops

2771
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:22,719
and uh the other people

2772
01:37:21,118 --> 01:37:24,479
uh servicing the community are actually

2773
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:25,600
experiencing all the the troubles

2774
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:27,198
they're going through and how they can

2775
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,560
actually be helped because you lose

2776
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:30,158
touch that because you're not actually

2777
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,159
living you're not talking to them you're

2778
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:34,000
not living among them and i mean that's

2779
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:35,519
a natural part of the system but i think

2780
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,479
that's why character and great

2781
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:41,520
leadership is important is you say

2782
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:43,279
you leave the game of congress and you

2783
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,639
go back to the people

2784
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:46,559
i mean that's what

2785
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:49,279
the the country you know it's like the

2786
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:51,199
george washington ideal is you're not

2787
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:53,039
playing a game of power

2788
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:54,960
you ultimately see yourself as somebody

2789
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:56,800
who's servicing this country service in

2790
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,000
the community and that requires talking

2791
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,000
to the people

2792
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,319
in their time of hardship well you have

2793
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
some people some people serving in in

2794
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:05,759
congressional districts don't even live

2795
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,279
in that district yeah i mean so how are

2796
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,760
they going to empathize they're not even

2797
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:11,840
driving through there on a daily basis

2798
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,600
and and you know

2799
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:14,880
again if when

2800
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,199
anything

2801
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,639
becomes lucrative from a financial

2802
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:20,799
standpoint

2803
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:22,800
it blurries people's vision

2804
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,440
you you have to take the potential of

2805
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:28,719
becoming rich out of

2806
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:31,279
politics politics is public service

2807
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:32,639
police and fire and ems are public

2808
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:35,279
service

2809
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:37,118
but cops and firemen and medics don't

2810
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:39,279
walk out

2811
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:40,079
of their career

2812
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:42,319
with

2813
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:44,079
gazillion dollar contracts with this

2814
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:46,000
company and that company on that board

2815
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:48,000
of directors and this board of directors

2816
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,039
they walk out with a pension and that's

2817
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,639
it

2818
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:52,158
and and you have to wonder the

2819
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:54,400
intentions of people getting into

2820
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:55,759
politics are they truly going into to

2821
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:58,238
help to

2822
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,760
help the human condition or are they

2823
01:38:58,238 --> 01:39:01,759
trying to help their own damn condition

2824
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,000
with their wallet in their pocketbook

2825
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,679
and i try to lean toward the latter

2826
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,359
lately you know with what i'm seeing

2827
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:09,440
well some of them are the good ones and

2828
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:10,880
that's our job as a society to elevate

2829
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:13,439
the good ones that's

2830
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:17,279
that's it and and then uh and that has

2831
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:19,118
to do with the ideals that we elevate

2832
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:22,319
there are a number of conspiracy

2833
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:24,559
theories around the events of 9 11. do

2834
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:27,198
any of these hold true to you

2835
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:30,159
or do they just frustrate you

2836
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:32,000
even angry you

2837
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:36,000
i've been asked this

2838
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
by a few different people in my life

2839
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:42,719
this is my take on it right you're a man

2840
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:45,119
of science and a man of education so you

2841
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:47,039
allegedly allegedly but yes but you you

2842
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:49,198
know you're a very very intelligent man

2843
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:49,198
and

2844
01:39:49,439 --> 01:39:54,719
what i believe took place is this

2845
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,320
structural steel

2846
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:57,600
will fail

2847
01:39:56,319 --> 01:40:00,559
at

2848
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:02,719
a sustained temperature of 1500 degrees

2849
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:05,440
fahrenheit and i don't know exactly how

2850
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:07,679
long that would have to be sustained

2851
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:11,439
but that's the temp right

2852
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:13,279
diesel fuel kerosene fuel kerosene based

2853
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:15,678
jet fuel which

2854
01:40:13,279 --> 01:40:19,039
was the ignition there

2855
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:20,239
burns at 2200 degrees fahrenheit

2856
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:21,600
so

2857
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:24,000
that

2858
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,679
continued burning of that diesel that

2859
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,800
jet fuel but kerosene based you know

2860
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:31,440
it's all kind of similar

2861
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:33,600
exceeded the temperature needed for that

2862
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:36,638
steel in the structural members of the

2863
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:39,119
trade center to fail

2864
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:40,480
in my heart of hearts i would hate to

2865
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:42,559
ever think

2866
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:45,359
that somebody

2867
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:47,039
affiliated with our government with some

2868
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:51,198
sort of agenda

2869
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:53,039
would perpetrate that crime and that

2870
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:56,000
tragic just

2871
01:40:53,039 --> 01:40:58,960
destruction of humanity and property

2872
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:01,039
for some other form of gain

2873
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:03,118
those planes rammed into those buildings

2874
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,719
450 miles an hour

2875
01:41:03,118 --> 01:41:07,279
they were loaded with thousands and

2876
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:10,239
thousands of gallons of jet fuel

2877
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:13,439
number seven trade center had the backup

2878
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:15,279
for the emergency management system for

2879
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:17,439
the city

2880
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:21,599
and it was an emergency generator in

2881
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:25,039
that complex which had a 25 000 gallon

2882
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,960
tank of diesel fuel to continually run

2883
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:29,920
for weeks to keep the

2884
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:32,960
911 system the backup system going in

2885
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:36,239
the case of a catastrophic event

2886
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:38,158
well that tank in seven heated up

2887
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:40,238
from the fire that was already going on

2888
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:42,960
from the aircraft debris coming into the

2889
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:45,759
building so once that diesel

2890
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:46,560
became ignited in seven

2891
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,840
now

2892
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,159
you had

2893
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:51,360
enough temperature to fail that steel in

2894
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:52,319
that building

2895
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:54,559
so

2896
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:56,238
i would like to truly believe what i've

2897
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:59,679
learned from the minimal fire science

2898
01:41:56,238 --> 01:42:02,638
knowledge i have from my career

2899
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:05,359
that it was just a matter of

2900
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,639
it burned too long it burned too hot and

2901
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:08,319
it failed

2902
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:09,440
i mean if you look at the way it came

2903
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:12,079
down

2904
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:13,759
it came down as it was designed to

2905
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:16,479
in the god forbid event that it was to

2906
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,760
collapse it it came down pancaking upon

2907
01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:21,839
itself

2908
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:24,400
if it had failed horizontally and just

2909
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:25,840
sprayed out side to side

2910
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:29,759
those buildings would have dropped for a

2911
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:31,119
quarter half a mile up to canal street

2912
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,119
but you know lex fighting and the

2913
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:34,559
destruction that could have resulted in

2914
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:36,719
oh my gosh it could have been so much

2915
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:38,159
worse i mean it you would have taken out

2916
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,439
every building you know

2917
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:41,039
from that

2918
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:42,879
point all the way up

2919
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:44,639
but in my heart i'd like to just believe

2920
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,239
that it was just a fire that burned too

2921
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:48,880
long or too hot you know these these

2922
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:51,279
planes caused structural damage upon

2923
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:53,199
impact in both buildings

2924
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:54,960
and it was just a matter of time and

2925
01:42:53,198 --> 01:42:57,519
then you think about it you add all the

2926
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:59,118
plastics all the carpeting

2927
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,760
all of the stuff that was burning on

2928
01:42:59,118 --> 01:43:03,279
those floors you add that to that fire

2929
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,960
load

2930
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:05,840
i think it just had enough to collapse

2931
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:08,560
it

2932
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:10,960
and you were in uh building seven for

2933
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:13,760
part of that day i was just after it

2934
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:16,239
came down as well we were excited and we

2935
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,920
weren't in it or next to it when it

2936
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:21,599
actually did come down

2937
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:24,560
but moments after we were there and

2938
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,600
again i i would like to believe that it

2939
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:28,320
just

2940
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:30,079
it was just that that fuel was going

2941
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:32,079
and

2942
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:34,000
it just took its physics took its course

2943
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:37,439
in it and it failed

2944
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:40,639
so physics and science aside it's hard

2945
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:42,238
uh it's both i would like to believe and

2946
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:44,560
it's hard to imagine that anybody would

2947
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:45,359
be so evil as to orchestrate parts of

2948
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,440
this

2949
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:50,079
from within the united states government

2950
01:43:47,439 --> 01:43:51,599
that's very difficult for me to imagine

2951
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:52,479
yeah you know what though lex there's

2952
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,239
people

2953
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:56,238
and i and i won't elaborate i won't get

2954
01:43:54,238 --> 01:43:58,559
into it any any

2955
01:43:56,238 --> 01:44:00,000
any controversial subjects but what have

2956
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:01,920
you

2957
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,920
there's some people that don't have any

2958
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,520
problem at all perpetrating any level of

2959
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,199
evil

2960
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:09,199
people like you and i who have hearts

2961
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:11,279
and we have depth of soul

2962
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:13,279
we couldn't imagine it but there's other

2963
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:15,840
people wouldn't even be a second thought

2964
01:44:13,279 --> 01:44:17,519
i mean i've seen some horrific incidents

2965
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:19,840
in my career

2966
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,800
that i go home shaking my head at night

2967
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,880
going

2968
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,840
human beings are just they're not wired

2969
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,760
right

2970
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:28,000
you know i mean i look at animals i love

2971
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,800
animals i love dogs especially right and

2972
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,198
i and i i see this dog park when

2973
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,960
i uh i train to fly airplanes now and

2974
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:36,479
something i wanted to do

2975
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:39,198
and there's a dog park across from the

2976
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:41,118
airport and there's 60 dogs and there's

2977
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:42,719
bones flying up in the air and chewed

2978
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:45,839
toys and sticks and they're running

2979
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:47,520
around having a time of their life right

2980
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,719
and they're all getting along

2981
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,560
and they're not hurting each other

2982
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:51,600
they're not violating each other they're

2983
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,520
they're not

2984
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:55,760
canceling each other that and and i'm

2985
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:58,880
going we really need to learn from these

2986
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:01,119
dogs like right and like

2987
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:02,480
i just yeah i mean sometimes it sounds

2988
01:45:01,118 --> 01:45:04,880
crazy but i think they're better they're

2989
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:06,638
a better species than people

2990
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,159
unless they're rabid they don't hurt on

2991
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:09,840
purpose they don't you know they don't

2992
01:45:08,158 --> 01:45:12,079
cut you off in traffic and throw you the

2993
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:14,159
middle finger and you know just these

2994
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:15,760
they just don't do these

2995
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:18,479
these acts of

2996
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:20,000
humanity that sometimes are so vicious

2997
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:22,479
why do you think these conspiracy

2998
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,800
theories of which there's a lot

2999
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:26,559
uh take hold

3000
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,400
why why do you think so many people

3001
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:31,679
believe some version of different

3002
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:34,079
conspiracy theories around 9 11.

3003
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:36,000
well you know like many things in life

3004
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:38,238
it leaves me a little conflicted i i

3005
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,158
have to say this i am at the point now i

3006
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:40,879
don't know who to believe anymore

3007
01:45:40,158 --> 01:45:43,039
so

3008
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:45,279
i could see that

3009
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:48,000
lending a hand to someone who's already

3010
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:49,519
a doubter going oh yeah look that

3011
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,319
exactly that's what they're doing right

3012
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:53,119
i mean you know look at this whole virus

3013
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:55,198
like

3014
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:57,920
who do you believe like where'd it come

3015
01:45:55,198 --> 01:46:01,118
from uh you know like and and and you

3016
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:02,639
know if you plant that seed

3017
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:04,319
it's like that little campfire we're

3018
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:06,719
talking about earlier right you just

3019
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:09,039
toss a little gas into those embers you

3020
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:10,800
got a fire now i also think there's a

3021
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:12,800
lot of people with a hell of a lot of

3022
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,560
extra time on their hands right and

3023
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:17,199
they're really bored you know the two

3024
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:18,960
are combined alex yeah man you know like

3025
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:20,479
look i was a three job charlie right you

3026
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:23,039
know one guy used to say to me you know

3027
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:26,079
anything but but home i go no i i got

3028
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:27,760
deadlines responsibilities you know like

3029
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:28,719
that's that's what it comes down to is

3030
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:31,199
like

3031
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:33,840
i mean look we all we all have our

3032
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:36,158
hobbies and things we like and you know

3033
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:38,319
little nuances and that's what makes us

3034
01:46:36,158 --> 01:46:41,519
special we're unique every person is a

3035
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:43,679
unique being but

3036
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,920
i also think some people just just they

3037
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:47,679
want to cling to something

3038
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:50,000
like we all want to feel accepted and

3039
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:51,520
belong to something so

3040
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,439
all of a sudden you you group up with

3041
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,360
these people and you all believe this

3042
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:56,638
fervently like yeah yeah you know they

3043
01:46:55,359 --> 01:46:59,279
did it they took it down they took it

3044
01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:01,199
down and and now you start going

3045
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:02,800
yeah and i think what happens is when

3046
01:47:01,198 --> 01:47:04,399
you're in company of people and you

3047
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,960
start telling each other the same thing

3048
01:47:04,399 --> 01:47:08,319
often you freaking believe it i mean if

3049
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,840
you keep telling me i got a great head

3050
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:11,840
of hair i'm gonna go you know what i do

3051
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:14,159
but no i don't i mean right i got that

3052
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:15,440
waving bye bye dude but like but you

3053
01:47:14,158 --> 01:47:18,479
know i think when you start hearing

3054
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:20,079
something often you stop believing it

3055
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:21,439
but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna doubt

3056
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:23,760
their intelligence i'm not going to

3057
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:26,079
doubt their intentions but

3058
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,119
i just don't see it as being plausible i

3059
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:29,439
just i

3060
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:32,639
it would be too

3061
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:34,799
too big of an operation to to

3062
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:37,359
successfully happen i you know i mean

3063
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:39,440
look there's other things that

3064
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:40,880
you know i i won't say it on the

3065
01:47:39,439 --> 01:47:43,039
interview there but like i have my

3066
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,159
doubts with certain things uh

3067
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:46,399
you know

3068
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:49,039
that that

3069
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:51,839
i mean conspiracy theories take hold for

3070
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:53,600
a reason because some of them are true

3071
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:55,679
no yeah the hard thing is just to know

3072
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,679
which ones well when you don't have

3073
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:59,039
facts right

3074
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:00,319
you don't know who to trust sometimes

3075
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:03,039
when you don't have facts when you don't

3076
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:05,439
have figures and you don't have science

3077
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:06,960
it's hard to take someone's word on it

3078
01:48:05,439 --> 01:48:09,279
you know i had a conversation with

3079
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:11,039
someone a while back right and the guy

3080
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:13,279
is like

3081
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:16,238
just just dedicated atheists and he

3082
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:17,840
thinks i'm an idiot for believing in god

3083
01:48:16,238 --> 01:48:19,359
and he's like yo you're one of those

3084
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,880
jerks who believes in creation and i

3085
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:22,960
said well i i do

3086
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,800
well what about the big bang theory that

3087
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:26,639
he's going on this diatribe about the

3088
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,639
science and the gases and the chemistry

3089
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:30,880
and i'm going dude i barely got through

3090
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:32,960
high school chemistry slow down

3091
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,960
and he went on a tangent and also when i

3092
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,000
stopped i went

3093
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,880
uh

3094
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,039
who

3095
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:40,319
who created the gas and the molecules

3096
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:41,760
and the stuff you're talking about in

3097
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:44,639
the collisions

3098
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:47,600
and he was furious and stalled off

3099
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:50,159
and i got him and again i had no facts i

3100
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:51,840
had no figure he didn't either but but

3101
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:54,238
i stumped him

3102
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:56,400
but sometimes when you can't show some

3103
01:48:54,238 --> 01:48:57,919
people need to see something yeah

3104
01:48:56,399 --> 01:48:59,759
tangible they need to see it in their

3105
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:00,880
hand to believe it

3106
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,480
and that's that's the real hard thing

3107
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:04,400
about faith

3108
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:06,399
i see it in action

3109
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:07,679
people restore my faith

3110
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:09,679
and then i say to myself well there

3111
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:11,199
can't be that many dummies in this world

3112
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:13,118
if there's so many billions of us

3113
01:49:11,198 --> 01:49:14,479
believing in this higher power that's

3114
01:49:13,118 --> 01:49:16,479
higher right i mean

3115
01:49:14,479 --> 01:49:18,638
and and you said that you said earlier

3116
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:20,479
like you you believe most people are

3117
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:23,039
good and i do too

3118
01:49:20,479 --> 01:49:24,718
the bad outshine the good because the

3119
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:25,519
bad get the press

3120
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:27,439
right

3121
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:29,679
if it bleeds it leads that's just you

3122
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:32,000
know like think about it how many more

3123
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:33,279
damn zombie apocalypse movies can we

3124
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,359
make right i didn't even know there was

3125
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:37,759
that many zombies yeah and it just seems

3126
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:39,359
like every other show is just guys like

3127
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:41,039
you know bashing each other's heads in

3128
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:42,719
with bats with nails in it and it's like

3129
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:44,238
after a while it's like all right gosh

3130
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:47,439
you got to get a new boogie man here you

3131
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:49,439
know right like but seriously like

3132
01:49:47,439 --> 01:49:51,198
but meanwhile human civilization is

3133
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:52,879
getting better and better we just like

3134
01:49:51,198 --> 01:49:54,000
making hollywood movies that just we're

3135
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:55,679
getting better and better but we're

3136
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,198
treating each other worse and worse you

3137
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:59,440
would think with all this technology and

3138
01:49:57,198 --> 01:50:02,000
all the knowledge and all the it's like

3139
01:49:59,439 --> 01:50:04,238
what the hell is going on sometimes like

3140
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,399
i really want to see the good

3141
01:50:04,238 --> 01:50:08,559
and i think maybe maybe the level of bad

3142
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:10,000
that we're seeing was always existing

3143
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,080
it's just now everything is

3144
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,560
instantaneous news and flashes and

3145
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:15,920
tweets and this and this like like you

3146
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,520
know

3147
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,440
well with the technology we have it's

3148
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:21,599
also come to the light so you you get to

3149
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:24,238
see all these fights it almost i think

3150
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:26,159
it's step one of uh dealing with the

3151
01:50:24,238 --> 01:50:28,079
problem is revealing it in its full

3152
01:50:26,158 --> 01:50:30,399
beautiful light oh yeah

3153
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:32,399

opportunity to have someone listen to me

3158

01:52:21,039 --> 01:52:24,079
just put the freaking thing down and

3209
01:52:22,399 --> 01:52:26,158
have a conversation and that's the thing

3210
01:52:24,079 --> 01:52:27,920
we've lost the art of conversation you

3211
01:52:26,158 --> 01:52:29,839

3212
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:31,760

love to meet people i love to learn i

3217
01:52:37,279 --> 01:52:40,960
love and the only way you can do that is

3218
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:42,479
to have a conversation the hilarious

3219
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:44,560
thing about this so you're obviously

3220
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:46,158
very charismatic you got great stories

3221
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:48,000
you're a great human being and you're

3222
01:52:46,158 --> 01:52:49,679
talking to a guy who spent most of his

3223
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,198
life behind a computer hiding from

3224
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:52,560
people no no and i i don't know but

3225
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:54,158
we're like trying to bridge this right

3226
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,599
but i don't mean that as a rip but you

3227
01:52:54,158 --> 01:52:56,638
know i would never know that really i

3228
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:58,480
would never know that because you're

3229
01:52:56,639 --> 01:53:01,279
very engaging you're very like i would

3230
01:52:58,479 --> 01:53:03,118
not know like you don't have any

3231
01:53:01,279 --> 01:53:04,960
impediments to your

3232
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:06,000
social skills your personal and and

3233
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,760
that's

3234
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,198
and again i don't mean it as a knock to

3235
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:11,039
you and these youtubers no but this is

3236
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:13,198
me trying to look up from the smartphone

3237
01:53:11,039 --> 01:53:15,039
is having these conversations talking to

3238
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:15,759
people i think it's it's important i

3239
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:18,079
mean

3240
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:20,880
some of it could be it's always hard to

3241
01:53:18,079 --> 01:53:23,679
know some of it could be just you and i

3242
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:25,440
being old school like because uh you

3243
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:27,520
grew up before the internet maybe there

3244
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:29,678
is joy and deep human connection to be

3245
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:31,599
discovered inside the smartphone we

3246
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:33,920
don't know it doesn't seem that way yeah

3247
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:36,159
because the smartphone's so new maybe we

3248
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,760
just haven't figured out those

3249
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:40,559
uh those things because there's a

3250
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:42,239
globalizing aspect there's a opportunity

3251
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:44,880
for you to connect with people from

3252
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:46,399
across the world oh yeah in ways that uh

3253
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:49,118

open up that letter and written just

3269
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:24,079

with me

3350
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:01,439

3352
01:57:01,439 --> 01:57:04,879
coolest

3353
01:57:03,279 --> 01:57:06,158
little you know relationships i've ever

3354
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,000
had it wasn't like we were hanging out

3355
01:57:06,158 --> 01:57:10,319
having barbecues together but like you

3356
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,039
know it was just i was so touched by his

3357
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:15,599
decency well the basics of the like

3358
01:57:13,039 --> 01:57:16,639
cancer reveals

3359
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:18,079
you know

3360
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:20,960
it's like fundamental to the human

3361
01:57:18,079 --> 01:57:22,800
experiences trauma is is tragedy it's

3362
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:25,198
like money who gives a [ __ ] about money

3363
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:27,199
education all that is like

3364
01:57:25,198 --> 01:57:30,079
weird new inventions

3365
01:57:27,198 --> 01:57:32,399
you know life is short you suffer with

3366
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:34,158
the various diseases and that is a

3367
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:36,158
reminder that life is short and a

3368
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:38,238
reminder of the basic human connection

3369
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:40,079
and that's why you can bridge that gap

3370
01:57:38,238 --> 01:57:42,238
oh yeah all sparked by a handwritten

3371
01:57:40,079 --> 01:57:43,760
letter which just is makes for a hell of

3372
01:57:42,238 --> 01:57:45,759
a story and you know what lex this is

3373
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:48,159
the commonality between us

3374
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:50,320
a guy with three jobs two a billionaire

3375
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:52,479
yeah we both had that sense of a

3376
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:54,000
sledgehammer to the chest boom you have

3377
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:55,439
cancer

3378
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,238
and you can't breathe

3379
01:57:55,439 --> 01:57:59,678
for like 30 seconds

3380
01:57:58,238 --> 01:58:01,839
and then when your heart's just about to

3381
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:04,560
kick off and you you take a breath and

3382
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:06,960
you go i'm sorry what'd you say doc

3383
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:08,239
you have cancer and it don't matter what

3384
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:10,480
kind

3385
01:58:08,238 --> 01:58:12,238
one of my one of my best buddies bobby's

3386
01:58:10,479 --> 01:58:13,118
going through right now prostate and i

3387
01:58:12,238 --> 01:58:14,799
got

3388
01:58:13,118 --> 01:58:15,679
way too many of my buddies with cancer

3389
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,920
right

3390
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:19,520
my buddy hugh who became a vet since his

3391
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:21,279
first cancer he was a fireman he's now

3392
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:23,440
veterinarian right he diagnosed me

3393
01:58:21,279 --> 01:58:24,319
actually over the phone by the way

3394
01:58:23,439 --> 01:58:25,359
um

3395
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:28,238
when they couldn't figure out what was

3396
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:30,000
wrong with me well dr hugh he nailed it

3397
01:58:28,238 --> 01:58:32,238
to the t

3398
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,238
and we talked

3399
01:58:32,238 --> 01:58:35,759
and the same thing that the dozen of my

3400
01:58:34,238 --> 01:58:37,439
close friends that

3401
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:39,760
have cancer

3402
01:58:37,439 --> 01:58:41,598
the same thing we say is the fear

3403
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:43,599
so mr coke and i

3404
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:44,480
we shared that same sledgehammer to the

3405
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:45,920
chest

3406
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:47,439
and that same fear

3407
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:49,520
and it didn't matter how much money he

3408
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:50,719
had and how much i didn't yeah and you

3409
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:52,080
know it's just like the morning of the

3410
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:53,039
trade center

3411
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:55,679
there was

3412
01:58:53,039 --> 01:58:57,679
big time brokers

3413
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:59,840
who went to their demise right working

3414
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:02,800
in these firms god rest them and there

3415
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:04,480
was dishwashers excuse me dishwashers up

3416
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:06,880
on the windows on the world restaurant

3417
01:59:04,479 --> 01:59:08,799
on 107th floor

3418
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,400
making five bucks an hour

3419
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,920
and they died together it didn't matter

3420
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:14,399
it didn't matter if you had an armored

3421
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:15,199
car loaded with bills you were done that

3422
01:59:14,399 --> 01:59:17,519
day

3423
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:19,439
and that's i think where people need to

3424
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:21,040
humanize each other

3425
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:23,279
just because you're driving around in a

3426
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:25,439
nice car and you got your own jet and

3427
01:59:23,279 --> 01:59:27,118
you got this and you got that

3428
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:29,439
don't mean nothing when you're going

3429
01:59:27,118 --> 01:59:31,839
when you're in that vulnerable spot it

3430
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:34,399
you could have you could have more money

3431
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:37,119
you know than than the u.s reserves

3432
01:59:34,399 --> 01:59:38,799
federal reserve or you could have

3433
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:40,000
a welfare check

3434
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:41,840
you're going

3435
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,960
i learned that in a cancer ward i had

3436
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:46,800
people on my ward that died on me

3437
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:48,880
i was going around as a little bit of an

3438
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:50,400
ambassador because i was trying to i was

3439
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:52,400
putting on a fake

3440
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:55,279
i was putting on a fake like i got this

3441
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:56,319
i got this i was so scared but when i

3442
01:59:55,279 --> 01:59:59,920
got

3443
01:59:56,319 --> 02:00:02,079
past that that seven days of torture

3444
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,000
and the days leading up to it i'd go

3445
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:05,439
around and try to comfort the other

3446
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,279
cancer patients

3447
02:00:05,439 --> 02:00:08,638
i had this one older african-american

3448
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:10,719
gentleman he couldn't talk because he

3449
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:12,400
had such advanced throat cancer

3450
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:14,000
he was my roommate for a little while

3451
02:00:12,399 --> 02:00:16,638
but then he got worse they had to put

3452
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,639
him by himself

3453
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:19,679
and you couldn't understand what he was

3454
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,079
saying because his throat was just so

3455
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:24,880
radiated from the radiation

3456
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:26,639
but if you put your ear

3457
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:28,560
down to him you could make out what he

3458
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:30,159
was saying

3459
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:31,920
and i'm not faulting the nurses for

3460
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:33,920
maybe not wanting to do that right it's

3461
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:35,920
it's they're busy they got a ton going

3462
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:39,520
on they can't spend you know

3463
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:42,639
so if he was in need i'd put my ear down

3464
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:46,719
and i find out and i go get it for him

3465
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:46,719
so when they moved me down the hall

3466
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:52,639
they asked me to come down with my iv

3467
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:54,639
tower he needed me

3468
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:56,319
and uh

3469
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:59,760
i knew it was bad because he just his

3470
02:00:56,319 --> 02:00:59,759
look was was gone

3471
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,439
i said sir what do you need

3472
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:08,239
and he whispered

3473
02:01:05,439 --> 02:01:10,399
call my sister i'm going

3474
02:01:08,238 --> 02:01:11,519
he had only one survivor in his whole

3475
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:13,039
life

3476
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,639
and she was in north carolina and he

3477
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:16,880
wanted her to know she couldn't get up

3478
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:19,440
she was elderly

3479
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:20,960
and i got the nurse

3480
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:22,559
and i got on the phone i called her

3481
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:25,520
sister and i said bam

3482
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:27,039
i i explained who i was

3483
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:28,400
and i said he

3484
02:01:27,039 --> 02:01:30,158
he can't really

3485
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:34,439
verbalize too well right now but he

3486
02:01:30,158 --> 02:01:34,439
wants to say he loves you

3487
02:01:38,079 --> 02:01:42,479
and i put the phone down

3488
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:44,560
and he told her he loved her and he said

3489
02:01:42,479 --> 02:01:46,319
i'm going home

3490
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:48,320
and

3491
02:01:46,319 --> 02:01:50,799
and that was it and i hung the phone up

3492
02:01:48,319 --> 02:01:53,519
and i i just said ma'am i'm so sorry i

3493
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,800
said you know they'll notify you and

3494
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:56,719
and i stayed with him for a while

3495
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:58,480
holding his hand and then you know they

3496
02:01:56,719 --> 02:02:00,239
wanted him to rest and then i left and

3497
02:01:58,479 --> 02:02:02,079
then

3498
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:05,519
i got the tap an hour later and they

3499
02:02:02,079 --> 02:02:06,960
said we're sorry he's gone

3500
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:08,960
and then there was another girl and she

3501
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:10,800
was a young

3502
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:12,158
young girl from

3503
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,599
one of the areas i worked young

3504
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:15,118
african-american girl where i used to

3505
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:18,159
respond but i didn't know her but i knew

3506
02:02:15,118 --> 02:02:20,079
her neighborhood and uh

3507
02:02:18,158 --> 02:02:21,679
she had what i had but they weren't sure

3508
02:02:20,079 --> 02:02:23,840
which one you know leukemia is there's

3509
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:26,560
an elusive beast there's 49 of them

3510
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:28,880
right and each one of them is like

3511
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:30,719
they got their own little nuances his

3512
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,079
own specific treatments so if they don't

3513
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:33,920
know what you have they don't know what

3514
02:02:32,079 --> 02:02:35,599
to do for you

3515
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:37,199
and she refused to let him drill into

3516
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:38,960
her hip to take the marrow because it's

3517
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:41,198
vicious it hurts so much it's like

3518
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:42,800
someone's born into your hip with a wood

3519
02:02:41,198 --> 02:02:45,598
drill and and

3520
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:45,599
it's no joke

3521
02:02:45,679 --> 02:02:49,920
and they asked me to try to convince her

3522
02:02:48,399 --> 02:02:52,079
to let her

3523
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:53,599
let them do that or she was going to die

3524
02:02:52,079 --> 02:02:56,960
because if they couldn't figure it out

3525
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:59,440
it was advancing quickly she was

3526
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:01,920
so i i talked to her and she said i

3527
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:03,678
can't i can't i'm too scared

3528
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:06,239
i said but are you more scared to die

3529
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:08,239
and she said i am i said okay

3530
02:03:06,238 --> 02:03:10,479
i'll stay with you i'll hold your hand

3531
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:12,559
you squeeze it as hard as you want

3532
02:03:10,479 --> 02:03:14,238
i said if if you want they'll give you

3533
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:16,239
like a towel or something to bite on

3534
02:03:14,238 --> 02:03:18,559
whatever i said but you get that pain

3535
02:03:16,238 --> 02:03:21,439
out but you need to do this

3536
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:23,520
so you can get saved

3537
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:25,759
and she said okay and they came in and

3538
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:28,320
they this huge thick needle they just

3539
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:30,159
bore it into you and she's screaming for

3540
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:32,319
her life and she's

3541
02:03:30,158 --> 02:03:33,759
squeezing my fingers so hard and so hard

3542
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:35,679
and i said it's okay honey you keep

3543
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:38,560
going you keep going we got it it's just

3544
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:39,920
10 more seconds 10 more seconds

3545
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:42,560
they got it

3546
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:44,480
they figured out her treatment and they

3547
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:45,440
got her onto her road to recovery and

3548
02:03:44,479 --> 02:03:48,559
then

3549
02:03:45,439 --> 02:03:51,279
i spent a long time

3550
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:51,280
asking god

3551
02:03:52,319 --> 02:03:56,799
why why do i have cancer

3552
02:03:55,279 --> 02:03:59,198
but then i stopped and i went wait a

3553
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:01,520
minute i didn't die that day with my

3554
02:03:59,198 --> 02:04:01,519
friends

3555
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:07,520
shame on me for asking them why i have

3556
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:11,319
cancer i 10 years after 9 11

3557
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:11,320
with such great years

3558
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:16,960
and i got to watch my little girl being

3559
02:04:14,399 --> 02:04:20,000
born when john never got to see his son

3560
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:21,840
so it was all gravy after that

3561
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,039
and i said but now i know why i have my

3562
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:24,719
cancer

3563
02:04:23,039 --> 02:04:27,760
because i can

3564
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:30,158
i can empathize with people who have it

3565
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:32,400
and i can try to be their voice

3566
02:04:30,158 --> 02:04:34,000
when they can't talk

3567
02:04:32,399 --> 02:04:36,479
be their shield

3568
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:38,000
to try to take that pain

3569
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:40,559
because i can understand i can walk

3570
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,560
their walk

3571
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:45,598
and now i thank god for my cancer

3572
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,760
because it's made me a better human

3573
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:49,760
being it's made me i'm not gonna lie i

3574
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:53,920
brought a lot of anger for a while and

3575
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:56,320
my family suffered it but i really

3576
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:58,239
tried to go past that and heal and and

3577
02:04:56,319 --> 02:04:59,840
part of living out in the country it's

3578
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:00,959
very very healing for the mind and the

3579
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:03,039
soul

3580
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,039
but

3581
02:05:03,039 --> 02:05:06,960
i now thank god for the cancer because

3582
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:09,118
it humbled me i didn't really need

3583
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:11,359
humbling i wasn't i wasn't a

3584
02:05:09,118 --> 02:05:12,479
arrogant puffed up type of person at all

3585
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:14,158
but

3586
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:16,399
you know maybe i was running away at

3587
02:05:14,158 --> 02:05:19,279
myself a little bit working on a tv show

3588
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:21,279
i'm fine man 30 at the time while i was

3589
02:05:19,279 --> 02:05:23,519
42 and got sick you know life was

3590
02:05:21,279 --> 02:05:25,920
cruising man it was great

3591
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:27,679
and then all of a sudden it was like

3592
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:29,599
a blowout on the highway in the middle

3593
02:05:27,679 --> 02:05:31,920
of the night and you're just veering off

3594
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:34,078
towards the guardrail yeah

3595
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:36,480
you remembered uh you're reminded that

3596
02:05:34,078 --> 02:05:38,719
you're mortal and that's oh yeah

3597
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:40,559
ultimately a connection to all the rest

3598
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:42,078
of us oh yeah it's it's a good thing

3599
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:43,280
though when you you know because that's

3600
02:05:42,078 --> 02:05:44,319
the problem i think there's a lot of

3601
02:05:43,279 --> 02:05:45,679
people running around and thinking

3602
02:05:44,319 --> 02:05:47,198
they're immortal

3603
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:49,118
right you know when you look at it lex

3604
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:51,279
right you look at the heartache in a lot

3605
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:53,679
of segments of people

3606
02:05:51,279 --> 02:05:56,158
and any time like someone that's got

3607
02:05:53,679 --> 02:05:58,560
fame and wealth and success

3608
02:05:56,158 --> 02:06:00,158
and and and they they die tragically a

3609
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:02,480
lot of times it's from

3610
02:06:00,158 --> 02:06:03,439
substance abuse or just you know just

3611
02:06:02,479 --> 02:06:05,598
just some

3612
02:06:03,439 --> 02:06:07,519
just some horrible death

3613
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:09,520
and i used to say to myself

3614
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:11,280
how the hell would someone with that

3615
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:13,760
much money and that much fame and this

3616
02:06:11,279 --> 02:06:16,000
freaking mansion and you know i oh i

3617
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:17,679
love cars my son and i were just big car

3618
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
heads you know and i'm like you know

3619
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:20,880
this guy's got a collection of cars and

3620
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,479
this

3621
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:24,800
and he overdosed

3622
02:06:22,479 --> 02:06:26,718
because he was sad and i'm going how the

3623
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:28,320
frigger you said but then i stop and i

3624
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:30,078
go

3625
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:31,599
okay because maybe he doesn't have any

3626
02:06:30,078 --> 02:06:33,439
idea who loves him

3627
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:35,279
he's got a lot of people clinging on to

3628
02:06:33,439 --> 02:06:37,519
him because of his success

3629
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:40,319
and and he just

3630
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:42,000
he can't fill that void you know and and

3631
02:06:40,319 --> 02:06:44,719
then they fill the void with something

3632
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,800
destructive and i'm not i'm not bashing

3633
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:48,158
people that have substance abuse

3634
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,360
problems or alcohol problems i don't

3635
02:06:48,158 --> 02:06:53,598
mean it that way but what i mean is

3636
02:06:51,359 --> 02:06:57,118
it's just said that that

3637
02:06:53,599 --> 02:06:58,719
their level of despair is so high on the

3638
02:06:57,118 --> 02:07:00,639
surface they look like they just got

3639
02:06:58,719 --> 02:07:02,800
everything going on it's all great right

3640
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:05,199
so humans the guys dealing with the same

3641
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:06,960
yeah exactly because they want love

3642
02:07:05,198 --> 02:07:08,799
right they want love

3643
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:11,198
and they and they can't

3644
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:12,719
they can't really find it like well

3645
02:07:11,198 --> 02:07:14,158
first of all that's true for all of us i

3646
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:15,760
think we're deeply lonely and looking

3647
02:07:14,158 --> 02:07:17,679
for love when we find it that's what

3648
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:19,599
friendship is that's right absolutely

3649
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:22,800
and then that's true for whether you're

3650
02:07:19,599 --> 02:07:25,199
super rich yeah or super poor it's all

3651
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:26,960
the same journey my dad said all times

3652
02:07:25,198 --> 02:07:29,039
kid you're going to end up working with

3653
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:30,880
hundreds of guys and you know you'll

3654
02:07:29,039 --> 02:07:32,399
love a lot of them but he says when you

3655
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:34,000

3656
02:07:32,399 --> 02:07:35,679

i wasn't

3671
02:08:01,439 --> 02:08:06,879
ready to accept it in 2011. it was so

3672
02:08:04,399 --> 02:08:08,559

3673
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:10,319

3674
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:13,360
care of my kids and who you know they

3675
02:08:10,319 --> 02:08:14,960
were little you know 9 11 and 14 right

3676
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:16,880
it's like what the hell i have two girls

3677
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:19,039
and a boy between and they're beautiful

3678
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:22,159
kids they're such good good children

3679
02:08:19,039 --> 02:08:24,238
the adults now i mean but you know

3680
02:08:22,158 --> 02:08:25,920
my wife's a drill sergeant she she's

3681
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:27,839
tough you know mess you know she's this

3682
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:29,760
this big but like so you're the softy in

3683
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:31,760
the family well

3684
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:34,079
you know it's funny because my son said

3685
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:35,119
to me my son's 21 now he's a good kid

3686
02:08:34,078 --> 02:08:37,519
you know

3687
02:08:35,118 --> 02:08:39,759
and uh he says to me

3688
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:41,840
back when he's like 12 he goes dad

3689
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:43,360
i don't want you to be offended but i'm

3690
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:45,199
really scared of mom i'm not really that

3691
02:08:43,359 --> 02:08:46,719
scared of you and you know like i i

3692
02:08:45,198 --> 02:08:48,479
cracked up because it's true like she's

3693
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:50,000
got a step she's got to stand on like a

3694
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:51,919
milk crate to reach him because you know

3695
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,319
she's tiny and he's tall but it's true

3696
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:56,880
but you know but she was hard but fair

3697
02:08:54,319 --> 02:08:58,559
but loved that see this is the thing

3698
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:59,920
you take any

3699
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:01,520
child

3700
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:03,679
anywhere

3701
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:05,760
from any background

3702
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:07,440
if you love them you nurture them you

3703
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:09,360
teach them and you guide them you have a

3704
02:09:07,439 --> 02:09:11,359
successful adult

3705
02:09:09,359 --> 02:09:13,759
and see that's the problem in our

3706
02:09:11,359 --> 02:09:15,118
society it's not judgmental i'm not

3707
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:17,599
judging anyone

3708
02:09:15,118 --> 02:09:19,439
but we need to try harder

3709
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:22,078
as parents

3710
02:09:19,439 --> 02:09:22,960
as as siblings as friends

3711
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:25,519
but

3712
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:27,679
especially when when we're blessed with

3713
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:30,000
a child it's like

3714
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:31,599
you you got to put that child first it's

3715
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,399
like being a military person or

3716
02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:35,760
responder it's not about you anymore now

3717
02:09:34,399 --> 02:09:37,679
it's the team

3718
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:39,760
so that little child

3719
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:41,118
is is now the team and you know your

3720
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:43,039
wife or your

3721
02:09:41,118 --> 02:09:45,198
significant other you know

3722
02:09:43,039 --> 02:09:47,519
like it's not about you anymore and see

3723
02:09:45,198 --> 02:09:48,960
that's the problem is people have a hard

3724
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:51,199
time

3725
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:53,198
not making it about them

3726
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:55,678
you know like now it's really weird my

3727
02:09:53,198 --> 02:09:56,960
kids are 19 21 and 24 and they hardly

3728
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:59,520
want to hang with me because they're

3729
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:01,039
busy in their life we love each other

3730
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:03,119
they're probably tired of hearing me go

3731
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:06,319
on and you know preach and whatever but

3732
02:10:03,118 --> 02:10:08,078
like but but they're adults we we we did

3733
02:10:06,319 --> 02:10:11,519
pretty much the crux of what we had to

3734
02:10:08,078 --> 02:10:13,359
do to to put them into adulthood

3735
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:15,280
and i look back and i was like wow i

3736
02:10:13,359 --> 02:10:17,359
wish i didn't work so much and i wish

3737
02:10:15,279 --> 02:10:19,519
but then i say no but it was okay my

3738
02:10:17,359 --> 02:10:22,078
wife stayed home

3739
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:25,440
good lessons good you know just just

3740
02:10:22,078 --> 02:10:28,799
ultimately like you said it's love it is

3741
02:10:25,439 --> 02:10:31,039
it's the common that love is

3742
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:33,119
the most important ingredient on this

3743
02:10:31,039 --> 02:10:35,519
earth and now and that's that's the

3744
02:10:33,118 --> 02:10:37,839
problem what's going on right now like

3745
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:39,920
take politics out of it right take

3746
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:42,319
polarizing each other against each other

3747
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:44,639
take all that crap out of it and just

3748
02:10:42,319 --> 02:10:46,319
airdrop a bunch of love

3749
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:48,319
right right like

3750
02:10:46,319 --> 02:10:50,559
like i when i worked on rescue me right

3751
02:10:48,319 --> 02:10:52,158
yeah i love those people so much they

3752
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:53,440
were such great we had such a great crew

3753
02:10:52,158 --> 02:10:56,719
and they worked so hard you're a

3754
02:10:53,439 --> 02:10:58,238
celebrity no no no not at all if i was i

3755
02:10:56,719 --> 02:11:00,399
it didn't really it didn't really work

3756
02:10:58,238 --> 02:11:01,759
out so good i went on to being a stage

3757
02:11:00,399 --> 02:11:03,759
hand that way no

3758
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:05,520
i'm not pretty but uh

3759
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:08,079
they don't want old guys waving waving

3760
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:10,239
by by hairdos but uh but but it was

3761
02:11:08,078 --> 02:11:13,039
funny we the crew we became really tight

3762
02:11:10,238 --> 02:11:14,718
we had like shoot like 80 90 people on

3763
02:11:13,039 --> 02:11:15,920
us on a set right

3764
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:18,000
and you know

3765
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:19,279
the first few episodes everybody's

3766
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,479
trying to feel each other out because

3767
02:11:19,279 --> 02:11:22,800
you know you work with different crews

3768
02:11:20,479 --> 02:11:25,279
different people

3769
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:27,199
and this is going back starting in 2004

3770
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:28,319
it was a different time

3771
02:11:27,198 --> 02:11:30,078
and

3772
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:32,000
i love to hug people

3773
02:11:30,078 --> 02:11:35,439
because to me a hug

3774
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,960
is a true expression of love and caring

3775
02:11:35,439 --> 02:11:38,719
you may not know a person a long time

3776
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:41,279
but you say i care about you with a hug

3777
02:11:38,719 --> 02:11:44,078
can i can i do it's a tiny tangent this

3778
02:11:41,279 --> 02:11:47,118
is in the midst of kovid when i was in

3779
02:11:44,078 --> 02:11:49,198
boston and it was you know masks like

3780
02:11:47,118 --> 02:11:51,759
triple masks

3781
02:11:49,198 --> 02:11:52,879
and when i went to see joe here when

3782
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:54,880
he's trying to convince me to move to

3783
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:56,560
austin joe rogan yeah yeah and then well

3784
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:59,679
the first time i see him he's like ah

3785
02:11:56,560 --> 02:12:01,440
you [ __ ] big ass hug yeah and

3786
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:03,279
people but people probably looked

3787
02:12:01,439 --> 02:12:05,519
horrified you know it was just hugging

3788
02:12:03,279 --> 02:12:07,118
it was just him oh okay but if you're

3789
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:08,719
doing in public now it's like it's like

3790
02:12:07,118 --> 02:12:11,679
you committed it but that expression

3791
02:12:08,719 --> 02:12:14,239
because i was so you forget

3792
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:16,000
how oh yeah how powerful that is oh i

3793
02:12:14,238 --> 02:12:16,879
got some of my buddies i give them a

3794
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,279
huge

3795
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:21,520
huge hug and a big sloppy kiss on their

3796
02:12:19,279 --> 02:12:24,639
cheek and i mean i cuz i love them these

3797
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:26,960
are my brothers you know but on this set

3798
02:12:24,639 --> 02:12:28,639
i swear to god it got to the point

3799
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:30,239
and i'm not trying to whatever but there

3800
02:12:28,639 --> 02:12:32,880
was people that would come up to me for

3801
02:12:30,238 --> 02:12:34,479
the daily hug yeah and i said

3802
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:36,159
what are you doing and i said come on

3803
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:37,279
bring it in and i give him the hug and

3804
02:12:36,158 --> 02:12:39,598
they said you don't understand it just

3805
02:12:37,279 --> 02:12:41,359
makes me feel so good yeah it makes me

3806
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:44,239
feel like you give a crap about me i

3807
02:12:41,359 --> 02:12:46,639
really do i said but it touched my heart

3808
02:12:44,238 --> 02:12:48,799
that people were seeking me out to get

3809
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:50,078
that hug to start the day yeah and i

3810
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:52,000
remember there was a guy in manhattan he

3811
02:12:50,078 --> 02:12:53,519
was selling hugs for like 50 cents and i

3812
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,760
think he got arrested right it was just

3813
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:57,280
before covered but like i wouldn't sell

3814
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:58,880
them if but now i'm giving them away

3815
02:12:57,279 --> 02:13:00,399
well now i got leukemia i'd be kind of

3816
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:03,118
concerned of getting the covert i mean

3817
02:13:00,399 --> 02:13:04,719
yeah but but like i i really think we

3818
02:13:03,118 --> 02:13:07,839
need that we need hugging booths like in

3819
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:09,679
each city or each town like because

3820
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:11,440
there's so many people that just want to

3821
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:13,520
know someone gives a [ __ ] about them and

3822
02:13:11,439 --> 02:13:14,559
that's the problem it's like

3823
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:16,639
like you know

3824
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:19,440
that's what i love about small little

3825
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:21,039
towns like where i am now in tennessee

3826
02:13:19,439 --> 02:13:22,399
and i'm not knocking new york i'm not

3827
02:13:21,039 --> 02:13:24,078
knocking big towns but i guess it's

3828
02:13:22,399 --> 02:13:26,879
easier to do in a smaller area because

3829
02:13:24,078 --> 02:13:29,118
it's just not this massive humanity

3830
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:30,719
but they'll stop and check on you like

3831
02:13:29,118 --> 02:13:32,559
you're out in the road and you know like

3832
02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:34,239
i'm cutting and cleaning or whatever

3833
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:35,760
occasionally i'll roll a lawnmower or a

3834
02:13:34,238 --> 02:13:38,399
tractor into a ditch because i'm you

3835
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:40,079
know not a farmer too good but uh

3836
02:13:38,399 --> 02:13:42,879
it's easier to drive a fire truck in new

3837
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:44,479
york but they literally oh i was worried

3838
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:46,480
i haven't seen you and i'm like no no

3839
02:13:44,479 --> 02:13:48,399
i'm okay but they literally like check

3840
02:13:46,479 --> 02:13:50,479
on you they're worried about you and i'm

3841
02:13:48,399 --> 02:13:52,319
going these people hardly know me but

3842
02:13:50,479 --> 02:13:53,598
yet they're so

3843
02:13:52,319 --> 02:13:54,880
caring and

3844
02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:58,719
and that's the problem like this is what

3845
02:13:54,880 --> 02:14:01,520
i love about my life i spent a lot of

3846
02:13:58,719 --> 02:14:03,359
time as especially as a young boy and a

3847
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:04,639
lot of time in ireland at my grandma's

3848
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:07,198
farm

3849
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:08,880
and my mom comes from this tiny tiny

3850
02:14:07,198 --> 02:14:10,638
little village she's out in the middle

3851
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:12,639
of nowhere and and

3852
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:15,118
the childhood home she grew up and still

3853
02:14:12,639 --> 02:14:16,800
my aunt and uncle live in and still

3854
02:14:15,118 --> 02:14:19,359
i just love it there so much because

3855
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:20,320
everyone waves tennessee's similar they

3856
02:14:19,359 --> 02:14:21,839
wave

3857
02:14:20,319 --> 02:14:23,679
driving by and like who the hell is that

3858
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:25,119
i just wave you know but my cousin will

3859
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:27,118
point it out i got your third cousin's

3860
02:14:25,118 --> 02:14:29,279
second removed by you know johnny like

3861
02:14:27,118 --> 02:14:31,679
holy shoot i'm related to everyone here

3862
02:14:29,279 --> 02:14:33,920
right but like everyone stops to say

3863
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:35,279
hello and how are you

3864
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:36,560

3865
02:14:35,279 --> 02:14:38,078
my wife goes

3866
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:39,679
people think you're crazy why are you

3867
02:14:38,078 --> 02:14:42,078
talking to everybody i said

3868
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:43,840
like i'll literally stop someone and say

3870
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:47,279
randomly on the sidewalk then it looks a

3871
02:14:45,359 --> 02:14:49,359
little nuts but like if i'm buying a cup

here on the sidewalk randomly yeah no

3875
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:56,638

3877
02:14:56,639 --> 02:15:00,960

wrong i said i'm praying

3913
02:16:03,118 --> 02:16:06,960
to be like a multi-gazillionaire because

3914
02:16:05,118 --> 02:16:09,279
i want to give all away

3915
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:10,960
we used to have a sign in ladder 114

3916
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:12,719
until some other rival truck company

3917
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,239
stole it right because that's what we do

3918
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:15,760
you know they get sent to cover your

3919
02:16:14,238 --> 02:16:17,598
district when you're out of fire and now

3920
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:19,520
your stuff's missing yeah and the

3921
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:20,960
old-timers had a sign that says i am

3922
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:23,599
content

3923
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:25,760
because if you got to ladder 114

3924
02:16:23,599 --> 02:16:28,800
that was considered such a great place

3925
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:30,400
such a great assignment such great guys

3926
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:32,079
you had to be vetted to get there you

3927
02:16:30,399 --> 02:16:34,558
couldn't just randomly go and it was a

3928
02:16:32,079 --> 02:16:36,159
little exclusionary but they wanted good

3929
02:16:34,558 --> 02:16:37,920
guys

3930
02:16:36,159 --> 02:16:40,239
and i said to myself that's where i am

3931
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:41,599
in life right now i am content

3932
02:16:40,239 --> 02:16:43,679
but

3933
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:46,719
i'm restless because i want to really do

3934
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:48,799
a lot more good it's like this podcast

3935
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:50,000
i want to make sure that it's not

3936
02:16:48,799 --> 02:16:51,518
forgotten

3937
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,439
and i want to make sure that these

3938
02:16:51,519 --> 02:16:56,239
charities that are really really helping

3939
02:16:53,439 --> 02:16:58,079
people get recognized but i'd like to

3940
02:16:56,239 --> 02:16:59,599
take it a step further right a friend of

3941
02:16:58,079 --> 02:17:01,840
mine runs this

3942
02:16:59,599 --> 02:17:03,599
foundation for young folks

3943
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:06,159
suffering mental illness

3944
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:07,120
and in crisis

3945
02:17:06,159 --> 02:17:10,718
it's for

3946
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:12,880
someone that we love dearly and uh

3947
02:17:10,718 --> 02:17:14,478
he's on a mission now to get

3948
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:16,638
therapy dogs

3949
02:17:14,478 --> 02:17:18,959
for really really

3950
02:17:16,638 --> 02:17:21,518
mentally wounded warriors right these

3951
02:17:18,959 --> 02:17:24,239
these a lot of these young soldiers

3952
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:25,840
are having a really hard time and now

3953
02:17:24,239 --> 02:17:28,959
they could be out a while they may have

3954
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:31,439
come back in country two three years ago

3955
02:17:28,959 --> 02:17:33,358
now it's just starting to set in

3956
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:36,719
and there's a waiting list for thousands

3957
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:38,960
of therapy dogs and he said

3958
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:40,638
that they can't get enough of them quick

3959
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:43,919
enough but he said when you see the

3960
02:17:40,638 --> 02:17:45,598
response the way these

3961
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:48,159
veterans just light up when they get

3962
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:50,960
these dogs it just changes their life

3963
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:51,840
radically immediately and i said that's

3964
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:53,039
it

3965
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:54,799

had all the supplies or you know there's

3993
02:18:42,079 --> 02:18:45,519
massive buildings where you could just

3994
02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:47,679
retrofit it and

3995
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:50,159
make light manufacturing within two

3996
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:52,159
weeks give these guys jobs they live

3997
02:18:50,159 --> 02:18:53,920
there they work they'll take care of it

3998
02:18:52,159 --> 02:18:55,599
military guys they teach you how to take

3999
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:57,599
care of stuff right

4000
02:18:55,599 --> 02:19:00,558
how the hell in this country should any

4001
02:18:57,599 --> 02:19:02,639
vet come back home and be homeless

4002
02:19:00,558 --> 02:19:04,638
because now they now have to dedicate

4003
02:19:02,638 --> 02:19:08,239
their lives for six seven ten twelve

4004
02:19:04,638 --> 02:19:10,079
years five five six deployments making

4005
02:19:08,239 --> 02:19:12,079
7.50 an hour and then you know they

4006
02:19:10,079 --> 02:19:14,398
spend seven years or they get a whopping

4007
02:19:12,079 --> 02:19:16,478
16 an hour right you know they they walk

4008
02:19:14,398 --> 02:19:18,959
out making 35 grand

4009
02:19:16,478 --> 02:19:21,358
and now no one gives them a job no one

4010
02:19:18,959 --> 02:19:23,358
gives them a chance so very quickly they

4011
02:19:21,359 --> 02:19:25,920
end up homeless

4012
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:27,040
by no fault in their own

4013
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:28,879
and

4014
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:30,240
i don't know how that's even possible

4015
02:19:28,879 --> 02:19:32,879
the people in this country who have

4016
02:19:30,239 --> 02:19:35,119
given the very most

4017
02:19:32,879 --> 02:19:37,039
and they're struggling they're hurting

4018
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:38,559
that's not fair and my whole thing is if

4019
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:40,559
if i can

4020
02:19:38,558 --> 02:19:41,438
have this dream of succeeding so to

4021
02:19:40,558 --> 02:19:43,920
speak

4022
02:19:41,439 --> 02:19:44,880
i want to try i want to try to change it

4023
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:46,558
you know

4024
02:19:44,879 --> 02:19:49,279
and just just so that's why i'm praying

4025
02:19:46,558 --> 02:19:51,199
to be a billionaire

4026
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:52,399
gazillion yeah well my wife my irish

4027
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:53,920
mother probably wouldn't agree either

4028
02:19:52,398 --> 02:19:56,478
because you're not supposed to right

4029
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:58,079
well i i'm i'm the same with you uh the

4030
02:19:56,478 --> 02:19:59,920
more the more money you have the more

4031
02:19:58,079 --> 02:20:01,120
you're able to help yeah

4032
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:02,799
help people you could put smiles on

4033
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:04,960
people's faces

4034
02:20:02,799 --> 02:20:07,759
i i have to ask you

4035
02:20:04,959 --> 02:20:11,438
the us invaded afghanistan in october

4036
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:13,600
2001 in response to terror attacks

4037
02:20:11,439 --> 02:20:15,920
now 20 years later we still had a

4038
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:17,280
presence and abruptly withdrew all

4039
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:19,280
troops

4040
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:20,399
what do you think about this war across

4041
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:23,280
the world

4042
02:20:20,398 --> 02:20:25,680
that was uh sparked by this tragedy

4043
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:27,280
whenever you do something quickly

4044
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:29,120
without thinking it out thinking it

4045
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:31,439
through and planning

4046
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:34,079
it doesn't succeed

4047
02:20:31,439 --> 02:20:36,318
i understand that we needed to exit

4048
02:20:34,079 --> 02:20:38,959
i mean how how long we're going to stay

4049
02:20:36,318 --> 02:20:40,559
over there and and we've lost over 7 000

4050
02:20:38,959 --> 02:20:43,039
of our young souls

4051
02:20:40,559 --> 02:20:44,478
over there

4052
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:46,479
for sometimes people i don't know if

4053
02:20:44,478 --> 02:20:47,519
they're grateful for it or not right i i

4054
02:20:46,478 --> 02:20:48,559
mean

4055
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:50,399
i don't know

4056
02:20:48,559 --> 02:20:52,079
so there's the other element and sorry

4057
02:20:50,398 --> 02:20:56,159
to interrupt that's okay one is the

4058
02:20:52,079 --> 02:20:58,639
financial of six trillion dollars and

4059
02:20:56,159 --> 02:21:01,600
that money is not just money it's it's

4060
02:20:58,639 --> 02:21:03,358
education it's everything um

4061
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:04,559
it it's money that could have gone

4062
02:21:03,359 --> 02:21:06,880
towards first of all the first

4063
02:21:04,559 --> 02:21:08,959
responders oh yeah but all the service

4064
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:11,119
men and women of all kinds throughout

4065
02:21:08,959 --> 02:21:14,559
this country and then there's the other

4066
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:16,640
side which is the over 800 000 people

4067
02:21:14,559 --> 02:21:19,039
who died in direct

4068
02:21:16,639 --> 02:21:21,599
uh result of this conflict so not just

4069
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:24,160
the american side of the troops but just

4070
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:26,079
people who died those humans humans yeah

4071
02:21:24,159 --> 02:21:28,318
and those humans

4072
02:21:26,079 --> 02:21:31,039
um

4073
02:21:28,318 --> 02:21:32,398
many of them civilians

4074
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:33,280
that's spreading

4075
02:21:32,398 --> 02:21:35,119
hate

4076
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:37,760
especially if you have leaders on the

4077
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:39,920
other side who frame the death of those

4078
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:41,920
civilians in certain ways that just

4079
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:43,600
spreads hate throughout the world and so

4080
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:47,520
you think about this

4081
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:49,120
kind of um 20-year saga and think

4082
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:51,359
what are the ways that money could have

4083
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:54,000
spent be spent better

4084
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:55,920
and what was the way that we could

4085
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:58,159
spread more love in the world versus

4086
02:21:55,920 --> 02:22:00,478
hate and you wonder

4087
02:21:58,159 --> 02:22:02,159
but then the the other side

4088
02:22:00,478 --> 02:22:04,398
uh

4089
02:22:02,159 --> 02:22:06,000
what is it i'm not sure who says this

4090
02:22:04,398 --> 02:22:07,519
line but um

4091
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:09,840
it's something like

4092
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:12,560
we sleep at night because there's uh

4093
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:14,000
rough men out there ready to

4094
02:22:12,559 --> 02:22:15,039
to fight for you

4095
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,040
um

4096
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:18,160
there is some sense in which we have to

4097
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:19,920
make sure

4098
02:22:18,159 --> 02:22:23,200
that there's strength coupled with the

4099
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:24,239
love right otherwise evil

4100
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:25,840
men

4101
02:22:24,239 --> 02:22:28,398
um

4102
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:30,000
will do evil onto the world so it's it's

4103
02:22:28,398 --> 02:22:32,478
a very difficult decision but then you

4104
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,398
look at the final picture it's like what

4105
02:22:32,478 --> 02:22:36,799
have we gotten for the six trillion

4106
02:22:34,398 --> 02:22:37,599
dollars what have we gotten for this 20

4107
02:22:36,799 --> 02:22:40,079
years

4108
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:41,200
the the thousands of americans soldiers

4109
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:44,318
who died

4110
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:47,600
the uh the hundreds of thousands of uh

4111
02:22:44,318 --> 02:22:47,600
civilians who have died

4112
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:53,760
you know it's it's a

4113
02:22:50,879 --> 02:22:55,599
it's a troubling subject for me um i'm a

4114
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:58,159
patriot i love this country

4115
02:22:55,600 --> 02:23:00,239
i love it so with my soul

4116
02:22:58,159 --> 02:23:01,760
and uh i was

4117
02:23:00,239 --> 02:23:03,920
just about to head over to the first

4118
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:06,079
iraqi war and we went out for desert

4119
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:08,079
warfare training and then it ended

4120
02:23:06,079 --> 02:23:09,760
i was at that time a combat medic

4121
02:23:08,079 --> 02:23:11,280
assigned to an armored cav unit so

4122
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:12,639
basically tanks

4123
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:15,040
driving around an armored personnel

4124
02:23:12,639 --> 02:23:17,119
carrier and when it gets hit then you

4125
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:18,399
you tend to that guy try to save his

4126
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:19,680
life

4127
02:23:18,398 --> 02:23:22,159
i didn't want to go

4128
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:23,359
i may sound like a coward i did not want

4129
02:23:22,159 --> 02:23:25,119
to go to war

4130
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:27,439
i would have went

4131
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:29,920
willingly if i was sent to defend my

4132
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:32,880
country i took my oath

4133
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:36,318
i didn't join the military to kill

4134
02:23:32,879 --> 02:23:38,879
but if necessary i would

4135
02:23:36,318 --> 02:23:40,719
i'll use the analogy of cancer

4136
02:23:38,879 --> 02:23:42,079
if you have a cancer and you're aware of

4137
02:23:40,719 --> 02:23:44,879
its presence

4138
02:23:42,079 --> 02:23:47,200
and you don't annihilate those cells

4139
02:23:44,879 --> 02:23:48,559
and take them out quickly

4140
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:51,439
it's going to spread

4141
02:23:48,559 --> 02:23:53,199
and it's going to kill you

4142
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:55,359
those evil bastards

4143
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:56,640
that flew those airplanes

4144
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:58,880
one of those airplanes had a little

4145
02:23:56,639 --> 02:24:00,959
three-year-old child in it from ireland

4146
02:23:58,879 --> 02:24:02,478
where my mom's hometown

4147
02:24:00,959 --> 02:24:04,639
a friend of mine who since died of a

4148
02:24:02,478 --> 02:24:05,679
heart attack from 9 11 toxins he found

4149
02:24:04,639 --> 02:24:08,318
her shoe

4150
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:09,760
with human remains in it

4151
02:24:08,318 --> 02:24:11,279
and he thought someone was messing with

4152
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:13,520
us because we didn't know there was any

4153
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:15,439
kids in the building he's his boss this

4154
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:16,960
this there's a baby shoe and it looks

4155
02:24:15,439 --> 02:24:18,398
like there's something in it but but

4156
02:24:16,959 --> 02:24:19,279
there's no kids in the trade center i

4157
02:24:18,398 --> 02:24:20,639
went

4158
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:23,200
the plane

4159
02:24:20,639 --> 02:24:26,239
it's a little girl's shoe

4160
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:28,640
i can never get that shoe out of my mind

4161
02:24:26,239 --> 02:24:31,359
the evil bastards who perpetrated that

4162
02:24:28,639 --> 02:24:33,119
needed to have missiles strike and rain

4163
02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:34,960
down upon them and annihilate them like

4164
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:37,120
a cancer that they are

4165
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:39,839
what what just fascinates me is they'll

4166
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:41,600
show videos of these guys flying around

4167
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:43,439
and pick up trucks with 50 cows on the

4168
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:45,680
back it's like well wait a minute if a

4169
02:24:43,439 --> 02:24:48,239
camera crew can get this footage

4170
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:51,520
you think all these freaking drones and

4171
02:24:48,239 --> 02:24:53,920
planes and radar assisted systems can't

4172
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:53,920
just go

4173
02:24:54,239 --> 02:24:58,318
good night you're gone so kill the

4174
02:24:57,359 --> 02:25:00,720
cancer

4175
02:24:58,318 --> 02:25:02,159
kill the cells get rid of it get rid of

4176
02:25:00,719 --> 02:25:05,279
it quickly

4177
02:25:02,159 --> 02:25:08,398
and go into remission like an undeniable

4178
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:11,200
show of force that sends a message that

4179
02:25:08,398 --> 02:25:15,358
uh gets rid of most

4180
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:17,439
of the obvious centers of um terrorism

4181
02:25:15,359 --> 02:25:20,000
and that no that's though because we

4182
02:25:17,439 --> 02:25:21,200
offline mention a discussion with jocko

4183
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,559
and

4184
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:27,280
maybe a romanticized view and mentioning

4185
02:25:24,559 --> 02:25:29,760
brothers in arms by dire straits and

4186
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:31,359
saying we're all brothers in arms

4187
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:32,318
even when it's on the opposite side of

4188
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:34,640
fighting

4189
02:25:32,318 --> 02:25:36,879
which is more of a vision and growing up

4190
02:25:34,639 --> 02:25:39,439
in the soviet union you saw about world

4191
02:25:36,879 --> 02:25:41,039
war ii yes that it's all just kids

4192
02:25:39,439 --> 02:25:44,000
thrown into the

4193
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:45,040
kids sent to die in all sides

4194
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:47,600
but then

4195
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:49,040
presenting that to jiako

4196
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:51,120
who was

4197
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:53,200
in iraq

4198
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:55,200
he did not see

4199
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:56,880
it as brothers in arms

4200
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:59,680
which is there's

4201
02:25:56,879 --> 02:26:00,719
his basic statement is there's evil

4202
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:02,720
people

4203
02:26:00,719 --> 02:26:05,119
and some people don't deserve the

4204
02:26:02,719 --> 02:26:06,879
compassion you give them a few chances

4205
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:09,120
they don't take the chances they have to

4206
02:26:06,879 --> 02:26:12,000
go because they're spreading evil onto

4207
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:14,160
the world and so it's not we're not

4208
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,719
all of us deserve a chance

4209
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:19,600
oh no but uh but the difference though

4210
02:26:16,719 --> 02:26:21,199
and and believe me i i jockle i am from

4211
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:22,880
a way way

4212
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:24,640
minor league compared to him right i

4213
02:26:22,879 --> 02:26:26,639
mean this man was right there in the

4214
02:26:24,639 --> 02:26:28,079
firing line but

4215
02:26:26,639 --> 02:26:29,358
i can understand his analogy because

4216
02:26:28,079 --> 02:26:31,280
when you think about it right those

4217
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:32,880
young conscripts back in germany and

4218
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:34,399
russia and you know all the countries

4219
02:26:32,879 --> 02:26:36,159
where they were being drafted even our

4220
02:26:34,398 --> 02:26:37,358
guys were being drafted and thrown into

4221
02:26:36,159 --> 02:26:38,398
this

4222
02:26:37,359 --> 02:26:41,680
they were

4223
02:26:38,398 --> 02:26:43,599
they were gallantly and and bravely

4224
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:44,479
defending their country

4225
02:26:43,600 --> 02:26:47,200
now

4226
02:26:44,478 --> 02:26:49,119
i'm sure the the young germans felt well

4227
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:51,040
hey hitler must be right

4228
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:53,760
right and young russians fell hey stalin

4229
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:55,680
must be right and you know the young

4230
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:57,200
americans figure hey president roosevelt

4231
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:58,960
must be right

4232
02:26:57,200 --> 02:27:01,359
so they

4233
02:26:58,959 --> 02:27:03,039
were romantically in a sense defending

4234
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:04,399
the honor of their country of their

4235
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:06,960
motherland

4236
02:27:04,398 --> 02:27:08,879
the difference between those so they did

4237
02:27:06,959 --> 02:27:11,199
have that commonality if you and i were

4238
02:27:08,879 --> 02:27:13,438
firing across each other from france to

4239
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:14,800
germany or you know from germany to

4240
02:27:13,439 --> 02:27:16,559
russia

4241
02:27:14,799 --> 02:27:18,079
we're just these two kids who got thrown

4242
02:27:16,559 --> 02:27:20,318
into this we didn't freaking ask for

4243
02:27:18,079 --> 02:27:22,639
this right but the difference with

4244
02:27:20,318 --> 02:27:25,199
jocko's enemy is

4245
02:27:22,639 --> 02:27:26,478
no one was attacking their country over

4246
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:28,560
there right

4247
02:27:26,478 --> 02:27:30,559
no one was taking their country over

4248
02:27:28,559 --> 02:27:32,239
maybe in their mind they didn't want

4249
02:27:30,559 --> 02:27:33,760
people trying to build their government

4250
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:35,199
this and that i don't i don't know i

4251
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:38,639
don't know enough about the history

4252
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:41,520
there to to really elaborate

4253
02:27:38,639 --> 02:27:42,398
we didn't attack them

4254
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:44,640
and

4255
02:27:42,398 --> 02:27:47,358
if a soldier attacks a soldier that's an

4256
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:49,760
understood concept amongst warriors but

4257
02:27:47,359 --> 02:27:51,840
when a soldier attacks a civilian now

4258
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:53,600
you're after a different beast

4259
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:55,760
and you've written that beast off if

4260
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:59,200
that makes any sense yeah and then the

4261
02:27:55,760 --> 02:28:02,398
the enemy i mean as jocko explains the

4262
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:04,000
the enemy uh in iraq and just uh certain

4263
02:28:02,398 --> 02:28:06,398
parts of the middle east

4264
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:08,079
is um essentially

4265
02:28:06,398 --> 02:28:10,159
terrorists who are

4266
02:28:08,079 --> 02:28:11,840
who don't value the lives of the

4267
02:28:10,159 --> 02:28:14,318
civilians of their own country they

4268
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:17,840
don't and so it becomes like this weird

4269
02:28:14,318 --> 02:28:18,719
guerrilla warfare slash game of violence

4270
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:21,040
that

4271
02:28:18,719 --> 02:28:22,559
ultimately allows them to gain more

4272
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:24,880
power within their country but they

4273
02:28:22,559 --> 02:28:27,359
don't care if they're playing with

4274
02:28:24,879 --> 02:28:29,358
civilian lives as pawns if you have a

4275
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:32,559
child who dies

4276
02:28:29,359 --> 02:28:34,800
on their on um that's a civilian in

4277
02:28:32,559 --> 02:28:36,478
their country that could be seen as a

4278
02:28:34,799 --> 02:28:39,519
positive for them because they can use

4279
02:28:36,478 --> 02:28:41,920
that to leverage for more and more power

4280
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:44,079
within that country so when you're

4281
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:46,159
fighting an enemy like that

4282
02:28:44,079 --> 02:28:48,239
that's a vicious that's an evil enemy

4283
02:28:46,159 --> 02:28:50,318
absolutely it's like snakes are

4284
02:28:48,239 --> 02:28:51,439
beautiful but if you go pet a rattler

4285
02:28:50,318 --> 02:28:53,119
you're getting bit and you're getting

4286
02:28:51,439 --> 02:28:54,639
dead right yeah and that's with

4287
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:57,359
terrorists you got to cut the head of

4288
02:28:54,639 --> 02:28:59,279
the snake off and and i feel no don't

4289
02:28:57,359 --> 02:29:00,800
commit our guys to me there anymore but

4290
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:03,600
what we need to do is go with tech

4291
02:29:00,799 --> 02:29:06,159
warfare if we have intel from drones or

4292
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:07,520
planes or whatever it is that so and so

4293
02:29:06,159 --> 02:29:09,520
and so and so and so so-and-so are

4294
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:10,640
driving down in that pickup or whatever

4295
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:12,239
take it out

4296
02:29:10,639 --> 02:29:13,680
and do it again tomorrow and tomorrow

4297
02:29:12,239 --> 02:29:15,760
and tomorrow and maybe they'll get

4298
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:17,840
they'll get the message after a while oh

4299
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:20,000
[ __ ] these guys aren't messing around

4300
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:22,799
instead of throwing wave after wave of

4301
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:25,520
our brave warriors brave seals brave you

4302
02:29:22,799 --> 02:29:27,679
know special ops guys and god bless them

4303
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:31,040
for what they do i couldn't do it

4304
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:34,398
i could not have done it but

4305
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:36,479
they have to be now sitting home going

4306
02:29:34,398 --> 02:29:37,760
what the hell

4307
02:29:36,478 --> 02:29:40,079
my friends

4308
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:41,359
my body myself like they must feel so

4309
02:29:40,079 --> 02:29:43,200
betrayed

4310
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:46,239
because they passionately went over

4311
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:47,920
there to cure a cancer the cancer of

4312
02:29:46,239 --> 02:29:50,478
terrorism

4313
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:52,000
and now the cancer is back

4314
02:29:50,478 --> 02:29:54,239
and i hate to say it but i think the

4315
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:56,000
cancer might start running wild

4316
02:29:54,239 --> 02:29:58,159
we need to change our tactics up this is

4317
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,318
just my opinion

4318
02:29:58,159 --> 02:30:02,639
i can't see committing all of our guys

4319
02:30:00,318 --> 02:30:05,039
to to a continuous

4320
02:30:02,639 --> 02:30:06,398
eternal war but i think what we need to

4321
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:08,800
do is hit

4322
02:30:06,398 --> 02:30:11,358
surgically and hit hard

4323
02:30:08,799 --> 02:30:14,079
at that cancer that is over there we are

4324
02:30:11,359 --> 02:30:16,399
never going to rebuild that region

4325
02:30:14,079 --> 02:30:18,159
it's just it's it's thousands of years

4326
02:30:16,398 --> 02:30:20,478
of traditions that you're not going to

4327
02:30:18,159 --> 02:30:22,000
change it's just some people are

4328
02:30:20,478 --> 02:30:24,398
unchangeable

4329
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:27,120
because they don't want to

4330
02:30:24,398 --> 02:30:28,799
and we have so many social problems here

4331
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:30,880
in our country i think that we need to

4332
02:30:28,799 --> 02:30:33,599
fix first you know

4333
02:30:30,879 --> 02:30:35,759
i heard this spoken in the past by many

4334
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:37,840
people it's like the garden theory you

4335
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:39,680
have your garden with a fence around it

4336
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:41,439
you tend to your garden there may be

4337
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:43,600
weeds on the outside of the fence but as

4338
02:30:41,439 --> 02:30:45,600
long as they're not inside your garden

4339
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:48,318
your garden will prosper

4340
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:50,399
and i know some people don't agree to

4341
02:30:48,318 --> 02:30:51,199
that america first and you know the

4342
02:30:50,398 --> 02:30:53,680
whole

4343
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:56,880
take care of our own but it's like

4344
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:58,079
how are we gonna take in more people now

4345
02:30:56,879 --> 02:31:01,279
and and i

4346
02:30:58,079 --> 02:31:03,520
i have a human feeling for them

4347
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:05,280
but it's almost like the lifeboat theory

4348
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:07,200
how many people can we take into the

4349
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:08,399
lifeboat before the lifeboat itself

4350
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:11,439
sinks

4351
02:31:08,398 --> 02:31:13,760
as the ship is going down so if we can't

4352
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:17,520
take care of our own homeless vets and

4353
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:20,000
our own homeless people and

4354
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:21,920
it's just going to become worse

4355
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:24,639
and and it doesn't make any sense it's

4356
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:26,840
just like we we need to just take a time

4357
02:31:24,639 --> 02:31:29,680
out and i

4358
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:30,478
think switch our tactics a little bit

4359
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,680
and

4360
02:31:30,478 --> 02:31:33,279
invest

4361

into helping people here at home

absolutely absolutely

4363
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:39,439
there's very few

4364
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:41,600
as obvious of cases as the first

4365
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:42,559
responders in 911

4366
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:44,000

4367
02:31:42,559 --> 02:31:45,600
that

4368
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,879
one one of the things that i really want

4369
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:48,880
to kind of

4370
02:31:46,879 --> 02:31:50,799
talk about at least a little bit

4371
02:31:48,879 --> 02:31:53,119
we've already talked about the amazing

4372
02:31:50,799 --> 02:31:54,559
project that you're doing the 24-20

4373
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:56,560

02:31:54,559 --> 02:31:59,279
um that you host

4375
02:31:56,559 --> 02:32:01,439
we mentioned one story stephen siller

4376
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:03,120
is there other stories or maybe you can

4377
02:32:01,439 --> 02:32:05,439
speak out at a high level what are you

4378
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:09,200
hoping to tell and all these different

4379
02:32:05,439 --> 02:32:12,398
stories that are weaved about um

4380
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:14,319
that that connect the

4381
02:32:12,398 --> 02:32:16,879
the tragedies and the triumphs the

4382
02:32:14,318 --> 02:32:19,199
heroism of uh of that day and the and

4383
02:32:16,879 --> 02:32:21,279
the days and the years that followed

4384
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:25,040
you know alex it seems like the common

4385
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:26,880
few themes the common threads are

4386
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:28,560
being selfless

4387
02:32:26,879 --> 02:32:31,199
helping out others even though they

4388
02:32:28,559 --> 02:32:34,398
might be a stranger

4389
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:36,720
in acts of kindness acts of love

4390
02:32:34,398 --> 02:32:38,559
and it seems to all be weaved together

4391
02:32:36,719 --> 02:32:39,760
with faith they all seem to have some

4392
02:32:38,559 --> 02:32:41,920
sort of faith

4393
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:44,000
i mean we have one gentleman

4394
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:47,120
uh mark hannah

4395
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:48,639
and he he's a coptic egyptian priest

4396
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:50,160
and he's an is an immigrant to the

4397
02:32:48,639 --> 02:32:51,680
united states he was a port authority

4398
02:32:50,159 --> 02:32:54,398
building engineer

4399
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:55,920
and with his crew who subsequently

4400
02:32:54,398 --> 02:32:57,279
passed away

4401
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:59,600
the crew did

4402
02:32:57,280 --> 02:33:01,439
he was effectively rescuing dozens of

4403
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:03,520
people on the upper floors

4404
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:05,760
and his boss ordered him to assist an

4405
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:08,319
elderly gentleman who was 89

4406
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:10,800
down 78 flights of stairs

4407
02:33:08,318 --> 02:33:12,318
to get him out and in stopping on the

4408
02:33:10,799 --> 02:33:13,759
21st floor

4409
02:33:12,318 --> 02:33:16,239
he figured they would just wait there

4410
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:18,800
for medics he came across

4411
02:33:16,239 --> 02:33:21,680
captain patty brown of ladder company 3

4412
02:33:18,799 --> 02:33:23,519
who told him no sir you need to evacuate

4413
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:24,880
and captain brown picked his brain a

4414
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:26,640
little bit about the structure because

4415
02:33:24,879 --> 02:33:27,679
he figured he found out he was an

4416
02:33:26,639 --> 02:33:30,000
engineer

4417
02:33:27,680 --> 02:33:31,840
and captain patty brown continued on to

4418
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,879
defect rescues and he and his crew were

4419
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:36,318
killed

4420
02:33:32,879 --> 02:33:38,799
but father he's now mark was able to e

4421
02:33:36,318 --> 02:33:40,719
effectively evacuate this gentleman

4422
02:33:38,799 --> 02:33:42,478
they were the two known last survivors

4423
02:33:40,719 --> 02:33:44,398
to come out of the tower

4424
02:33:42,478 --> 02:33:47,199
he now has dedicated his life to

4425
02:33:44,398 --> 02:33:49,358
becoming a coptic priest in st mary's

4426
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:51,439
church in east brunswick new jersey

4427
02:33:49,359 --> 02:33:54,399
he did this for a total stranger and he

4428
02:33:51,439 --> 02:33:55,920
said he was inspired by his his bosses

4429
02:33:54,398 --> 02:33:58,318
who died

4430
02:33:55,920 --> 02:34:00,000

4434
02:34:04,239 --> 02:34:07,199
melting pot

4435
02:34:05,439 --> 02:34:09,200

firefighter i mentioned earlier danny

who was killed

4475
02:35:24,639 --> 02:35:28,239
and father judge was in the lobby of the

4476
02:35:26,398 --> 02:35:30,159
building giving a blessing praying to

4477
02:35:28,239 --> 02:35:32,159
god to please stop this

4479
02:35:32,159 --> 02:35:34,719
killed

4480
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:36,720
and

4481
02:35:34,719 --> 02:35:38,639
bobby goes on to elaborate about father

4482
02:35:36,719 --> 02:35:40,079
judge's story father judge used to walk

4483
02:35:38,639 --> 02:35:42,079
the streets of new york city helping

4484
02:35:40,079 --> 02:35:43,280
aids patients just with whatever they

4485
02:35:42,079 --> 02:35:45,439
needed and

4486
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:47,920
he was a franciscan friar they wear

4487
02:35:45,439 --> 02:35:50,720
sandals and a robe they're just they

4488
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:53,520
just live very humble lives of

4489
02:35:50,719 --> 02:35:55,920
and it's just the common denominator is

4490
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:58,239
loving each other

4491
02:35:55,920 --> 02:36:00,639
and helping each other regardless if you

4492
02:35:58,239 --> 02:36:02,799
know the person or not and really when

4493
02:36:00,639 --> 02:36:06,840
you think about it that's how america

4494
02:36:02,799 --> 02:36:10,000
was made we we fought for independence

4495
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:12,239
stranger fought next to stranger

4496
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:13,600
and and fought tyranny and because they

4497
02:36:12,239 --> 02:36:15,600
wanted freedom

4498
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:17,840
they wanted to be able to

4499
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:18,800
live love

4500
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:20,398
pray

4501
02:36:18,799 --> 02:36:22,079
and prosper

4502
02:36:20,398 --> 02:36:24,079
and they fought and died alongside of

4503
02:36:22,079 --> 02:36:25,760
strangers and it's sort of symbolic of

4504
02:36:24,079 --> 02:36:27,760
what happened that day and then

4505
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:29,359
strangers from around this great country

4506
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:31,920
just flocked in

4507
02:36:29,359 --> 02:36:33,520
by the thousands to help they didn't

4508
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:36,318
know who was in that pile but they

4509
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:38,560
didn't care that was another american

4510
02:36:36,318 --> 02:36:41,119
and what i ultimately am trying to do

4511
02:36:38,559 --> 02:36:42,478
involved in this beautiful project

4512
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:45,200
is

4513
02:36:42,478 --> 02:36:46,239
spread the message of doing the right

4514
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:48,640
thing

4515
02:36:46,239 --> 02:36:51,600
look at these examples

4516
02:36:48,639 --> 02:36:53,439
these brave people who didn't have to

4517
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:55,520
especially to civilians they weren't

4518
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:57,920
paid to run back in there and help

4519
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:59,920
person after person and they had no

4520
02:36:57,920 --> 02:37:02,960
obligation they could have just said hey

4521
02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:05,120
man i'm out of here and just bolted

4522
02:37:02,959 --> 02:37:07,839
but they didn't

4523
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:09,600
so we're just trying to say to people

4524
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:11,520
let's bring back that unity and that

4525
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:13,840
feeling of 9 12.

4526
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:15,600
as strange as 9 12 of the day it was it

4527
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:18,719
was so sad because

4528
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:20,479
it we it was the first dawn of the sun

4529
02:37:18,719 --> 02:37:22,559
where we realized

4530
02:37:20,478 --> 02:37:24,478
this wasn't a dream this was real and

4531
02:37:22,559 --> 02:37:26,159
it's not going away

4532
02:37:24,478 --> 02:37:28,000
but the beauty of it was there was

4533
02:37:26,159 --> 02:37:30,079
thousands of people lined up along the

4534
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:32,799
west side highway with signs

4535
02:37:30,079 --> 02:37:35,760
and american flags and they were from

4536
02:37:32,799 --> 02:37:38,559
every country and every race and every

4537
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:41,920
creed and it didn't matter who they were

4538
02:37:38,559 --> 02:37:44,799
but they all shared one bond love

4539
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:47,200
and they were hugging and crying

4540
02:37:44,799 --> 02:37:48,559
and thanking rescuers

4541
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:51,040
and it

4542
02:37:48,559 --> 02:37:53,439
brought the morale so high

4543
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:55,280
for a group of people that was so beaten

4544
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:57,040
down the day before

4545
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:59,520
it just started lifting them around

4546
02:37:57,040 --> 02:38:02,160
making us realize you know what

4547
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:03,920
people really do give a crap they really

4548
02:38:02,159 --> 02:38:05,520
do love each other

4549
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:06,879
and now i'm gonna be honest with you

4550
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:08,079
i've been doubting that a little bit

4551
02:38:06,879 --> 02:38:09,920
lately

4552
02:38:08,079 --> 02:38:11,840
i still have these examples of it you

4553
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:14,000
know that lady who helped me last night

4554
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:15,840
with the phone and just you know i know

4555
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,079
there's these shining little examples

4556
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:20,318
but sometimes i think

4557
02:38:18,079 --> 02:38:22,799
i don't know are we running out of them

4558
02:38:20,318 --> 02:38:24,799
well i got to give you some advice

4559
02:38:22,799 --> 02:38:27,039
says uh two words that were repeated

4560
02:38:24,799 --> 02:38:29,039
often

4561
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:31,600
in the days and the years after 9 11

4562
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:33,359
which is never forget so

4563
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:36,000
might i remind you

4564
02:38:33,359 --> 02:38:38,479
to never forget about 9 12.

4565
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:40,398
i mean those words uh you talked about

4566
02:38:38,478 --> 02:38:43,199
that you know there's people

4567
02:38:40,398 --> 02:38:45,039
what is it college freshman maybe they

4568
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:46,640
weren't even born they weren't even born

4569
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:49,439
and there's people in the 20s that were

4570
02:38:46,639 --> 02:38:50,959
too young to remember to understand the

4571
02:38:49,439 --> 02:38:52,559
events of that day

4572
02:38:50,959 --> 02:38:54,719
but i think what that day as you're

4573
02:38:52,559 --> 02:38:56,398
describing means it's not about a

4574
02:38:54,719 --> 02:38:58,478
terrorist attack it's about

4575
02:38:56,398 --> 02:39:00,719
the unity that followed

4576
02:38:58,478 --> 02:39:03,199
it was tremendous lex i never felt so

4577
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:04,719
proud i was always proud of this country

4578
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:06,479
you know i remember my grandpa nelson

4579
02:39:04,719 --> 02:39:08,159
used to walk by i'd see a flag i hear a

4580
02:39:06,478 --> 02:39:10,000
star spangled banner and he'd tear up

4581
02:39:08,159 --> 02:39:10,799
and i'd say grant why are you crying he

4582
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,719
said

4583
02:39:10,799 --> 02:39:15,039
i'm not crying is the tears of joy i

4584
02:39:12,719 --> 02:39:16,799
love this country so much

4585
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:19,359
and i just remember like feeling that

4586
02:39:16,799 --> 02:39:22,398
way i felt that way 9 10

4587
02:39:19,359 --> 02:39:25,040
i felt that way on 9 11 but then on 9 12

4588
02:39:22,398 --> 02:39:27,119
i was just so proud of just the people

4589
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:28,479
the way they stepped up

4590
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:30,720
and i just want to try to see if that

4591
02:39:28,478 --> 02:39:32,398
can happen again and i hope it's it's

4592
02:39:30,719 --> 02:39:34,719
not necessary for us to have another

4593
02:39:32,398 --> 02:39:37,279
tragedy to bring that about

4594
02:39:34,719 --> 02:39:39,760
let's do that without the tragedy let's

4595
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:41,600
just stop and say hey

4596
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:43,280
you know what let me listen to what this

4597
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:44,720
guy has to say

4598
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:46,640
and maybe he's he probably won't

4599
02:39:44,719 --> 02:39:48,959
convince me but maybe i'll go well you

4600
02:39:46,639 --> 02:39:52,159
know i never thought of it that way

4601
02:39:48,959 --> 02:39:55,119
stop the finger pointing the bickering

4602
02:39:52,159 --> 02:39:57,119
the tantrums the fighting it's just not

4603
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:58,720
necessary it gets you nowhere right it's

4604
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:00,000
like you know i was two years old like

4605
02:39:58,719 --> 02:40:01,519
stomping around because i wanted a

4606
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:03,680
cookie or a piece of candy i still

4607
02:40:01,520 --> 02:40:05,600
didn't get it right you know turned blue

4608
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:07,760
in the face and whatever got a swat in

4609
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:09,040
the rear end but it didn't get the candy

4610
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:10,960
and that's what we got going on right

4611
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:12,240
now everybody's just stomping around

4612
02:40:10,959 --> 02:40:15,278
being a baby

4613
02:40:12,239 --> 02:40:17,520
stop just stop we're really lucky look

4614
02:40:15,279 --> 02:40:19,520
country's not perfect right

4615
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:21,439
you know but it's damn good

4616
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:23,520
yeah it gives us all these opportunities

4617
02:40:21,439 --> 02:40:25,279
you know like i said no one's rushing

4618
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:27,279

4619
02:40:25,279 --> 02:40:29,040
