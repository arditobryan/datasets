00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
the following is a conversation with poe

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,798
shen lo a professor of mathematics

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,080
at carnegie mellon university national

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,638
coach of the usa

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,280
international math olympia team and

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,000
founder of

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,279
xp that does online education of basic

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,519
math and science

9
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,399
he's also the founder of novid an app

10
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,079
that takes a

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,079
really interesting approach to contact

12
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,038
tracing making sure you stay completely

13
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,719
anonymous

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,480
and it gives you statistical information

15
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,118
about covet cases in your

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,640
physical network of interactions so you

17
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,200
can maintain privacy

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,160
very important and make informed

19
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
decisions

20
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,279
in my opinion we desperately needed

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,439
solutions like this in

22
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,600
early 2020 and unfortunately i think

23
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,640
we will again need it for the next

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,960
pandemic

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,679
to me solutions that require large-scale

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,320
distributed coordination of human beings

27
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,439
need ideas that emphasize freedom and

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,679
knowledge

29
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,799
quick mention of our sponsors jordan

30
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:00,159
harbinger show

31
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:02,000
on it betterhelp eight sleep and

32
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,238
element check them out in the

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,118
description to support this podcast

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,118
as a side note let me say that poe and i

35
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,640
filmed a few short videos about simple

36
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,519
beautiful math concepts

37
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,000
that i will release soon it was really

38
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,599
fun

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,759
i really enjoyed poe sharing his passion

40
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,919
for math with me in those videos

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,118
i'm hoping to do a few more short videos

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
in the coming months

43
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,560
that are educational in nature on ai

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,920
robotics math science philosophy

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,280
or if all else fails just fun snippets

46
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,920
into my life on music

47
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,799
books martial arts and other random

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,240
things

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,320
if that's of interest to anyone at all

50
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:41,679
this is the lex friggman podcast and

51
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,478
here's my conversation

52
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,520
with po shenlo you know you mentioned

53
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,759
you really enjoy

54
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,679
flying and experiencing different people

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,280
in different places

56
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,079
there's something about flying for me i

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,118
don't know if you have the same

58
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,679
experience

59
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,118
that every time i get on an airplane

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,719
it's incredible to me

61
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,239
that human beings have actually been

62
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,359
able to achieve this

63
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,399
and when i look at like what's happening

64
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,239
now with humans traveling out into space

65
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080
i see it as all the same thing it's

66
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,280
incredible that humans are able to get

67
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,560
into a box

68
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,439
and fly in the air and

69
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,000
and safely and land in the same it seems

70
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,079
like

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,199
and everybody's taking it for granted so

72
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
when i observe them

73
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,119
it's quite fascinating because i see

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,640
that cleanly mapping

75
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,519
to the world where we're now on uh

76
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,719
in rockets and traveling to the moon

77
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,480
traveling to mars

78
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,479
and at the same kind of way i can

79
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,000
already see the future

80
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,679
where we will all take it for granted

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,318
so i don't know i don't know if you have

82
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,400
uh you personally when you fly

83
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,159
have the same kind of magical experience

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,120
of like how the heck did humans actually

85
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,039
accomplish this

86
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,480
so i do especially when there's

87
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,560
turbulence

88
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,560
which is you know like on the way here

89
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,479
yeah there was turbulence and

90
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,158
the the plane jiggled even the flight

91
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,518
attendant had to hold on to the side

92
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,120
and i was just thinking to myself it's

93
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,560
amazing that this happens all the time

94
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
and the wings don't fall off you know

95
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,640
like

96
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,479
given how many planes are flying but

97
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,238
then i often think about it and i'm like

98
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,840
you know a long time ago i think people

99
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,599
didn't trust elevators

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
yeah in a 40-story building in new york

101
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,560
city and

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,920
now we just take it completely for

103
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
granted that you can step into this

104
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,919
shaft

105
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,719
which is 40 floors up and down and it

106
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,238
will just not

107
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,000
fail yeah again i'm the same way with

108
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,560
elevators but also buildings

109
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,680
when i'll stand on the 40th floor and

110
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
wonder

111
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,280
how the heck are we not falling right

112
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,158
now

113
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,120
like how how amazing it is with the high

114
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,199
winds

115
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,878
like structurally just the earthquakes

116
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,719
and the vibrations i mean

117
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,318
natural vibrations in the ground like

118
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,080
how is this how are

119
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:49,839
all of these you go like new york city

120
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,519
all of these buildings standing

121
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,759
i mean to me one of the most beautiful

122
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,640
things actually mathematically too is uh

123
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,318
bridges

124
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,318
i used to build bridges in high school

125
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,079
from like toothpicks just like out of

126
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,280
the pure joy

127
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,000
of like physics making

128
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
some structure really strong

129
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,479
understanding

130
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,719
like from a civil engineering

131
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,639
perspective what kind of

132
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,000
structure will be stronger than another

133
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,199
kind of structure like suspension

134
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
bridges and then you see that at scale

135
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,240
humans being able to span a body of

136
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,839
water with a giant bridge

137
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,478
and it's i don't know it it's so

138
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,839
humbling

139
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,839
it makes you realize how

140
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,079
how dependent we are on each other sort

141
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,599
of i talk about love a lot but

142
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,120
there is there's a certain element in

143
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,199
which we

144
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,319
little ants have just a small amount of

145
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,639
knowledge about

146
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,478
our particular thing and then we're

147
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,519
depending on a network

148
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,240
of knowledge that other experts hold and

149
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,079
then

150
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,040
most of our lives most of the quality of

151
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,839
life we have has to do with the

152
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,560
the richness of that network of

153
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,279
knowledge

154
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,079
of that collaboration and then sort of

155
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,839
the ability to build on top of it

156
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,680
levels of abstractions you start from

157
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,839
like bits in a computer

158
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,519
then you can have assembly and you can

159
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,119
have c plus so you have an operating

160
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,959
system that you can see plus plus and

161
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,439
python finally some machine learning on

162
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,038
top

163
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,639
all of these are abstractions and

164
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,680
eventually we have ai that runs all of

165
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,478
us humans but

166
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,360
anyway uh but speaking of abstractions

167
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:26,478
and programming in high school you wrote

168
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,038
some impressive games for amaz i got a

169
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,519
chance to

170
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,680
in browser somehow it's magic got a

171
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,478
chance to play them

172
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,840
alien attack one two three and four

173
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,120
what's the hardest part about

174
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,519
programming those games

175
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,120
and maybe can you tell the story about

176
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,599
about building those games

177
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,360
sure i actually tried to do those in

178
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,479
high school because i was just curious

179
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,400
if i could

180
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,839
and yeah and that's a good starting

181
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,719
point for anything right yeah yeah it's

182
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,478
like could you but

183
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
the appealing thing was also it was a

184
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,680
soup to nuts kind of thing

185
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,199
so something that has always attracted

186
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,280
me is i like

187
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,038
beautiful ideas i like seeing beautiful

188
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,079
ideas but i actually also like

189
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,519
seeing execution of an idea all the way

190
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,000
from beginning to end in something that

191
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,279
works so for example in high school i

192
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,319
was lucky enough to grow up

193
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,000
in the late 90s when even

194
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,479
a high school student could hope to make

195
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,319
something sort of comparable to the

196
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,159
shareware games that were out there

197
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,919
not i say the word sort of like still

198
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,360
quite far away but at least i didn't

199
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,159
need to hire a 3d

200
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,120
cg artist there weren't enough pixels to

201
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,160
draw anybody

202
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,478
even i can draw right bad art of course

203
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,919
but

204
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,599
the point is i wanted to know is it

205
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,560
possible for me to try to do those

206
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,199
things

207
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
where back in those days you didn't even

208
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,079
have an

209
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
easy way to draw letters on the screen

210
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,879
in a particular font

211
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,478
you couldn't just say import a font it

212
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,079
wasn't like python so

213
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,758
for example back then if you play those

214
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,800
games in the in the web browser which is

215
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,840
emulating

216
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,840
um the the old school computer

217
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,079
those even the letters you see those are

218
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,519
made by individual calls to draw pixels

219
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,439
on the screen so you built that from

220
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,959
scratch almost building a computer

221
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,120
graphics library from scratch

222
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,799
yes the primitive that i got to use was

223
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,720
some code i copied off of a book

224
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,639
in assembly of how to put a pixel on the

225
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,400
screen in a particular color

226
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,680
and the programming programming language

227
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,478
was pascal

228
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,360
ah yeah the first one was in pascal but

229
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:17,359
then the

230
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,598
other ones were in c plus plus after

231
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,038
that how's the emulation in the browser

232
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:21,519
work by the way is that is that true

233
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:22,959
real

234
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,639
because it's pretty cool you get to play

235
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,680
these games that have a very much

236
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,598
90s feeling to them ah so it's literally

237
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,079
making an ms-dos environment which is

238
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,399
literally

239
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,399
running the old exe file wow

240
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,360
that could be more amazing than the

241
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,598
airplane so it wasn't so much about the

242
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,479
video games it was more about can you

243
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,878
build something

244
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:48,399
really cool from scratch yes and

245
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,560
you did a bunch of programming

246
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,038
competitions

247
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
what was your interest your love for

248
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,800
programming

249
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,160
what did you learn to that experience

250
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
especially now that

251
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,039
as much of your work has taken a long

252
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,199
journey through mathematics

253
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:06,240
i think i always was amazed by how

254
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,199
computers

255
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,800
could do things fast if i wanted to make

256
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,120
it an abstract

257
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,560
analysis of why it is that i saw some

258
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,399
power in the computer

259
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,079
because if the computer can do things so

260
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,439
many times faster than humans

261
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,758
where the hard part is telling the

262
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,240
computer what to do and how to do it

263
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,439
if you can master that asking the

264
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,879
computer what to do

265
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,519
then you could conceivably achieve more

266
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,000
things and those contests i was in

267
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,559
those were the opposite in some sense of

268
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,719
making

269
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,759
a complete product like a game as a

270
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,919
product

271
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,599
those contests were effectively write a

272
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,718
function to do something extremely

273
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,719
efficiently

274
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,320
and if you are able to do that then you

275
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,680
can unlock more of the power of the

276
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,839
computer

277
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,159
but also doing it quickly there's a time

278
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,040
element from the human perspective to be

279
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,799
able to

280
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,879
program quickly there's something nice

281
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,838
so there's like almost like an athletics

282
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,320
component

283
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,360
to where you're almost like uh an

284
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,600
athlete

285
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,600
seeking optimal performance as a human

286
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,440
being trying to write these programs

287
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
and at the same time it's kind of art

288
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,120
because you're

289
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,360
the best way to write a program quickly

290
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,879
is to write a simple program

291
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,959
you used to have a damn good solution so

292
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,519
it's not necessary you have to type fast

293
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,599
you have to think through a really clean

294
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,959
beautiful

295
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,320
solution i mean

296
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,000
what do you think is the use of those

297
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,360
programming competitions do you think

298
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,039
they're ultimately something you would

299
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,399
recommend for students for people

300
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,000
interested in programming or people

301
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,639
interested in building stuff

302
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,080
yes i think so because especially with

303
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,480
the work that i've been doing nowadays

304
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,639
even

305
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,480
trying to control kovit something that

306
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,639
was very helpful from day one

307
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,039
was understanding that the kinds of

308
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,199
computations we would want to do

309
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,199
we could conceivably do on like a four

310
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
core cloud machine on amazon web

311
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,399
services

312
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,759
out to a population which might have

313
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
hundreds of thousands or millions of

314
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,919
people

315
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,600
the reason why that was important to

316
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,719
have that back of the envelope

317
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,040
calculation with efficient algorithms

318
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,639
is because if we couldn't do that then

319
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,240
we would bankrupt ourselves before we

320
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,078
could get to a big enough skill

321
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,440
if you think about how you grow anything

322
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,599
from small to big

323
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,880
if in order to grow it from small to big

324
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
you also already need 10

325
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,278
000 cloud servers you'll never get too

326
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
big

327
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,958
and also the nice thing about

328
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,000
programming competitions is that you

329
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,039
actually build

330
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,039
a thing that uh works so you

331
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,879
you finish it there's a completion thing

332
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,879
and you realize

333
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,399
i think there's a magic to it where you

334
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,480
realize that

335
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
it's not so hard to build something that

336
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,759
works

337
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
to have a system that uh successfully

338
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,278
takes in inputs and produces outputs and

339
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,759
solves a difficult problem

340
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,078
and that directly transfers to building

341
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,399
a startup essentially that can help

342
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,000
some aspect of this world as long as

343
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
it's mostly be

344
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
based on software engineering things get

345
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,399
really tricky when you have to

346
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,240
manufacture stuff

347
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
that's why people like elon musk are so

348
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,799
impressive that they it's not just

349
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,720
software

350
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,240
tesla autopilot is just not just

351
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
software it's it's like you have to

352
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,440
actually

353
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,360
like have factories that build uh cars

354
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,560
and there's like a million components

355
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,399
involved in in the machinery required to

356
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,919
assemble those cards and so on but in

357
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,639
software one person

358
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,360
can change the world which is uh uh

359
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,078
incredible

360
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,560
but on the mathematics side what uh if

361
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,120
you

362
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,599
look back or maybe today what made you

363
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,480
fall in love with mathematics

364
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,200
for me i think i've always been very

365
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,839
attracted

366
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,278
to challenge as i already indicated with

367
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,320
the writing the program

368
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:43,600
i guess if i see something that's hard

369
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,360
or supposed to be impossible it

370
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,040
certain sometimes i say maybe maybe i

371
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,120
want to see if i can pull that off

372
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,360
and with the mathematics the math

373
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,320
competitions presented problems

374
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,959
that were hard that i didn't know how to

375
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,200
start

376
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,958
but for which i could conceivably try to

377
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,079
learn how to solve them

378
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,679
so i mean there are other things that

379
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,359
are hard called like get something to

380
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,919
mars get people to mars

381
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,560
and i didn't i still don't think that

382
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,479
i'm

383
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,078
able to solve that problem on the other

384
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,959
hand the math problems struck me as

385
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,638
things which are

386
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,638
hard and with significant amount of

387
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,919
extra work i could figure it out

388
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,159
and maybe they would actually even be

389
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,879
useful like that mathematical skill is

390
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,919
the core

391
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,919
of lots of other things

392
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,159
that's really interesting maybe you

393
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,359
could speak to that because

394
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:32,799
a lot of people say that math is hard

395
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,039
as a kind of negative statement

396
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:37,359
it always seemed to me a little bit like

397
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,759
that's kind of a positive statement

398
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,360
that all things that are worth having in

399
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,360
this world are hard

400
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,399
i mean everything that people think

401
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,879
about

402
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,679
that they would love to do whether it's

403
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,879
sports

404
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:53,679
whether it's art music

405
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,559
and all the sciences they're going to be

406
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,239
hard if you want to do something special

407
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,078
so is there something you could say to

408
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,278
that idea that math is hard

409
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,159
should it be made easy or should it be

410
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,720
hard

411
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,278
ah so i think maybe i want to dig in a

412
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,200
little bit onto this hard part and say

413
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,439
uh i think the interesting thing about

414
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,360
the math is that

415
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,560
you can see a question that you didn't

416
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,200
know how to

417
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,679
start doing it before and over a course

418
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,240
of

419
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,039
thinking about it you can come up with a

420
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,519
way

421
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,240
to to solve it and so you can move from

422
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,320
a state of

423
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,320
not being able to do something to a

424
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,720
state of being able to do something

425
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,720
where you help to take yourself through

426
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,680
that instead of somebody else

427
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,440
spoon feeding you yes that technique so

428
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,439
actually here i'm already digging into

429
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,880
maybe part of my teaching philosophy

430
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,079
also which is that

431
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,720
i actually don't want to ever just tell

432
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,278
somebody

433
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,800
here's how you do something i actually

434
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,078
prefer to say here's an interesting

435
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,078
question

436
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,519
i know you don't quite know how to do it

437
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,679
do you have any ideas

438
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,120
this is i'm actually coming up with i'm

439
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,399
actually explaining another way that you

440
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,959
could try to do teaching

441
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,078
and i'm contrasting this to a method of

442
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,719
watch me do this

443
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,759
now practice it 20 times i'm trying to

444
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,519
say a lot of people

445
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,799
consider math to be hard because maybe

446
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,039
they can't remember

447
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,919
all of the methods that were taught but

448
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,000
for me

449
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,519
i look at the hardness and i don't think

450
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,399
of it as a memory hardness

451
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,879
i think of it as a can you invent

452
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,039
something

453
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,320
hardness and i think that if we can

454
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,439
teach more people

455
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,360
how to do that art of invention

456
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,600
in a pure cognitive way not as hard as

457
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,720
the actual hardware stuff right but like

458
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,240
in terms of the concepts and the

459
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,040
thoughts and the mathematics teaching

460
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,919
people how to

461
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,719
invent then suddenly actually they might

462
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,399
not even find math to be that

463
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,800
tiresomeness hard anymore but that

464
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,000
rewardingness hard

465
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,838
of i have the capability of looking at

466
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,440
something which i don't know what to do

467
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,720
and coming up with how to do it i

468
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,959
actually think we should be doing that

469
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,360
giving giving people that capability

470
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,078
so hard in the same way that invention

471
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,879
is hard

472
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,838
that is ultimately rewarding so maybe

473
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,399
you can dig in

474
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,399
that a little bit longer which is um

475
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:13,278
do you see basically the way to teach

476
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:15,519
math is to present a problem

477
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,600
and to give a person a chance to try to

478
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,360
invent a solution

479
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,040
without with minimal amount of

480
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,120
information first

481
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,120
is that is that basically how do you

482
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,320
build that muscle of invention

483
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,959
in a student yes so the way that i i

484
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
guess i have

485
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,000
two different sort of ways that i try to

486
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,440
teach actually one of them is

487
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,679
in fact this semester because all my

488
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,120
classes were remotely delivered i even

489
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,159
threw them all onto my youtube channel

490
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,360
so you can see

491
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,198
you can see how i teach at carnegie

492
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,519
mellon but i'd often say

493
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,559
hey everyone let's try to do this any

494
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,879
ideas

495
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,679
and that actually changes my role as a

496
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,919
professor

497
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,758
from a person who shows up for class

498
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,319
with a script of what i want to talk

499
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,159
through

500
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,680
i actually i don't have a script the way

501
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,039
i show up for class is

502
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,958
there's something that we want to learn

503
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,000
how to do and we're going to do it by

504
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,758
improv

505
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,759
i'm talking about the same method as

506
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,000
improv comedy which is where

507
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,399
you tell me some ideas and i'll try to

508
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,320
yes and them

509
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
you know what i mean and then together

510
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,160
we're gonna come up with a proof

511
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,959
of this concept where you were deeply

512
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,879
involved

513
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,799
in creating the proof actually every

514
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,559
time i teach the class we do every proof

515
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,000
slightly differently because it's based

516
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,719
on how the students came

517
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,679
up with it and that's how i do it when

518
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,360
i'm in person

519
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,120
i also have another line of courses that

520
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,959
we make that is delivered online

521
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,480
those things are where i can't do it

522
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,479
live but

523
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,240
the teaching method became also similar

524
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,039
it was just here's an interesting

525
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,480
question

526
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,480
i know it's out of reach why don't you

527
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,839
think about it and then automatic hints

528
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,000
we feed automatically hints

529
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,600
uh through you know through the internet

530
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,839
to go and let the person

531
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,079
try to invent so that's like a more

532
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,440
rigorous prodding of invention

533
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:57,278
but you did mention disease and

534
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,279
coven and you've been doing some very

535
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,838
interesting stuff from a mathematical

536
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:05,359
but also software engineering angle

537
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,160
of coming up with ideas it's back to the

538
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,519
i can

539
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,360
i see a problem i think i can help uh

540
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,879
so you stepped into this world can you

541
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,078
tell me about

542
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,520
your work there under the flag of novid

543
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:21,678
and uh both the the software and the

544
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,599
technical details of how the thing works

545
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,839
sure sure so first i want to make sure

546
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,678
that i say this is actually team effort

547
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,200
i happen to be the one speaking but

548
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,120
there's no way this would exist without

549
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,080
an incredible team of people who inspire

550
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,079
me every day to

551
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,079
work on this but i'll speak on behalf of

552
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:39,199
them so

553
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:40,079
the idea was indeed that we stepped

554
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,480
forward

555
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,079
in march of last year when the world

556
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,519
started to become our part of the world

557
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,319
started to become our part meaning the

558
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,960
united states

559
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,720
started to become paralyzed by coven the

560
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,600
shutdown started to happen

561
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,919
and at that time it started as a figment

562
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:58,399
of an idea which was

563
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,440
network theory which is the area of math

564
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,200
that i work in

565
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,600
could potentially be combined with

566
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,480
smartphones and some kind of

567
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,959
health information anonymized exactly

568
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,240
how

569
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,960
we didn't know yet we tried to

570
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,359
crystallize it and many months into this

571
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,480
work

572
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:17,599
we ended up accidentally discovering

573
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,160
a new way to control diseases which

574
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,399
is now what is the main impetus of all

575
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,400
of this work is to take this idea

576
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,840
and polish it and hopefully have it be

577
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,759
useful not only now

578
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,199
but for future pandemics the idea is

579
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,038
really simple to describe

580
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,240
um actually my main thing in the world

581
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,640
is i come up with obvious

582
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,798
observations that's that's i'll explain

583
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,840
it now einstein did the same thing

584
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:42,400
and he wrote a few short papers

585
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,038
but but so the idea is like this if we

586
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
describe

587
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:49,200
how usually people control disease

588
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,840
for a lot of history it was that you'd

589
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,919
find out

590
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,199
who was sick you'd find out who they've

591
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,720
been around

592
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,120
and you try to remove all of those

593
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,440
people from society against their will

594
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,879
yes now that's the problem the against

595
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,038
the will part

596
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,960
gives you the wrong kind of a feedback

597
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,400
loop which makes it hard to control the

598
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,519
disease because then the people you're

599
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,640
trying to control keep getting other

600
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,160
people sick

601
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,000
you can see already how i'm thinking and

602
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
talking about this feedback loops this

603
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,160
is actually related to something you

604
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,079
said earlier

605
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,558
about even like how skyscrapers stay in

606
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,279
the air uh the whole point is

607
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,639
control theory you actually want to or

608
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,279
even how an airplane stays

609
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,038
you need to have control loops which are

610
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,639
feedbacking in the right way

611
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,319
and what we observed was that the

612
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,240
feedback control loop for

613
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:33,839
controlling disease by asking people to

614
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,400
be removed from society against their

615
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,639
will

616
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,320
was not working it was running against

617
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,679
human incentives and you suddenly are

618
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,759
trying to control seven

619
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,600
billion eight billion people in ways

620
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,960
that they don't individually want

621
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,558
to necessarily do so here's the idea

622
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,160
and this is inspired by the fact that at

623
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,200
the core of our team were user

624
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,880
experience designers

625
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,480
that's actually the in fact the first

626
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,080
thing i knew we needed when we started

627
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,240
was to bring user experience

628
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:02,158
at the core okay but so um

629
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,839
the idea was suppose there was a penta

630
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,280
suppose hypothetically there was a

631
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,720
pandemic

632
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,798
what would you want you would want a way

633
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,839
to be able to live your life as much as

634
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,319
possible

635
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,199
and avoid getting sick can we make an

636
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,918
app to help

637
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,600
you avoid getting sick notice how i've

638
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,320
just articulated the problem

639
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,719
it is not can we make an app so that

640
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,359
after you are around somebody who's sick

641
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,919
you can be removed from society it's can

642
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,558
we make an

643
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,280
app so that you can avoid getting sick

644
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,759
that would

645
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,798
run a positive feed however i don't know

646
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,000
if i want to call it positive or

647
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:36,879
negative but they would run a good

648
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,880
feedback loop yes

649
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,080
okay so then how would you do this the

650
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,480
only problem is that

651
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,079
you don't know who's sick because

652
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,679
especially with this disease

653
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:48,319
if i see somebody who looks perfectly

654
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,000
healthy the disease spreads two days

655
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,480
before you have any symptoms

656
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,720
and so it's actually not possible that's

657
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,759
where the network theory comes in

658
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,159
you caught it from someone what if

659
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,400
we changed the paradigm and we said

660
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,039
whenever there's a sickness

661
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,240
tell everybody how many physical

662
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,158
relationships

663
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,759
separate them from the sickness that is

664
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,919
the trivial idea we added

665
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,279
the trivial idea was the distance

666
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,559
between you and a disease

667
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:19,519
is not measured in feet or seconds

668
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,119
it's measured in terms of how many close

669
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,960
physical relationships

670
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,439
separate you like these six degrees of

671
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,279
separation like linkedin

672
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,159
simple idea what if we told everyone

673
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,319
that it turns out that actually unlocks

674
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,760
some interesting behavioral feedback

675
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,000
loops which

676
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,759
for example let me let me now jump to a

677
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,359
non-covered example to show why this

678
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,319
maybe it could be useful

679
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,558
actually we think it could be quite

680
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,000
useful imagine there was ebola or some

681
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:45,839
hemorrhagic fever

682
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,519
imagine it spread through contact

683
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,199
through the air in fact pretend

684
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:53,440
pretend that's a

685
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,640
that's a disastrous disease it has high

686
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,840
fatality rate

687
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,320
and uh as you die you're bleeding out of

688
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,519
every

689
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:03,359
orifice okay so yeah

690
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,000
no not pleasant not pleasant so the

691
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,519
question is suppose that such a disease

692
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,279
broke

693
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,519
who would want to install an app that

694
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,480
would tell them how many relationships

695
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,839
away from them

696
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,640
this disease had struck like a lot of

697
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,158
people a lot of people in fact

698
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,280
almost i don't want to say almost

699
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,120
everyone that's a very strong statement

700
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,200
but a very large number of people

701
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,199
that's fascinating framing like the the

702
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,319
more deadly and transmissible the

703
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,558
disease

704
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,439
the the stronger the incentive to

705
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,240
install it

706
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,720
in a positive sense the in in in the

707
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,120
good

708
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,720
feedback loop sense that's a really good

709
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,359
example it's a really good way to frame

710
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,640
it because

711
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:45,119
with covet it was not as deadly

712
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,799
as uh as potential pandemics could have

713
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,719
been viruses could have been so

714
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,400
it's sometimes muddled with how we think

715
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,240
about it but yeah this is a really good

716
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,679
framing if the virus was a lot more

717
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,359
deadly

718
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,519
you want to create a system that has a

719
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,519
set of incentives that

720
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,038
it quickly expresses a population where

721
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,519
everybody is using it

722
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,240
and is contributing in a positive way to

723
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,759
the system

724
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,038
exactly and actually that point you just

725
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,558
made i don't take credit for that

726
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,319
observation there was another person i

727
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,240
talked to who pointed out that

728
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,558
it's very interesting that this feedback

729
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,359
loop is even more effective

730
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,079
when the disease is worse and that's

731
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,918
actually

732
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,079
not a bad characteristic to have in your

733
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,799
feedback loop if you're trying to help

734
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,439
civilization keep running yeah it's a

735
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,480
really

736
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,400
it's in this dynamic like people

737
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,839
figure out they dynamically figure out

738
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,880
how bad the disease is

739
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,079
the more it spreads and the deadlier it

740
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,679
is as the people observe

741
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:42,079
it as long as the spread of information

742
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
like uh semantic information natural

743
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,519
language information

744
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,798
is closely aligned with the reality of

745
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,158
the disease which is a whole nother

746
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,480
conversation right

747
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,159
we that's we might maybe we'll chat

748
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,679
about that how we sort of

749
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,520
make sure there's not misinformation

750
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,000
while there's accurate information but

751
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,879
that aside okay so this is a really nice

752
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,798
property

753
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,240
right and and just going on on that

754
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:03,759
actually just talking more about what

755
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,079
that could do and why we're so excited

756
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:06,480
about

757
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,639
it it's that not only would people want

758
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,720
to install it

759
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,640
what would they do if you start to see

760
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,640
that this disease is getting closer and

761
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,640
closer we we surveyed informally

762
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,159
people but they said as we saw getting

763
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,679
closer we would

764
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,278
hide we would try to not have contacts

765
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,880
but now you notice what this has just

766
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,599
achieved the whole goal

767
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,600
on on this whole exercise was you got

768
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,519
the people who might be sick

769
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,278
and you got everyone else set a and set

770
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:34,798
b set a is the people who might be six

771
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,599
that b is everyone else

772
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,599
and for the entirety of the past uh

773
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,480
contact tracing approaches

774
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,439
you try to get set a to do things that

775
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,120
might not be

776
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,798
to their liking or their will because

777
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,959
that's removing them from society

778
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,038
yes we found out that there's two ways

779
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,440
to separate set a from set b

780
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,679
you can also let the people at set b at

781
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,840
the fringe of set a

782
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,679
attempt to remove themselves from this

783
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,519
interface it's just it's the symmetry of

784
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,480
a and b separation

785
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,359
everyone was looking at a we look at b

786
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,880
and suddenly b

787
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:11,119
is in their incentive to do so beautiful

788
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,919
so there's a virus that jumps from human

789
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,479
to human

790
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,240
so there's a network sometimes called

791
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,960
graph

792
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,599
of the spread of a virus it hops from

793
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,720
person to person to person to person

794
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,678
and each one of us individuals are

795
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,319
sitting

796
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,880
or plop plopped into that network we

797
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,519
have

798
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,720
close friends and relations and so on

799
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,158
it's kind of fascinating to actually

800
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,839
think about this network and we can

801
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,520
maybe talk about the shapes of this kind

802
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,119
of network

803
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,359
because i was i was trying to think

804
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,439
exactly this like how many people do i

805
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,119
was i'm kind of an introvert not kind of

806
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,600
i'm very much an introvert

807
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,639
but so can i be explicit about the kind

808
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,119
of people i

809
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,880
meet in regular life say when it was

810
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,519
completely opened up there's no pandemic

811
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,320
there is a kind of network of cl and

812
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,200
there's maybe

813
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,240
um in the graph theoretic sense there's

814
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,519
some weights

815
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,359
or something about how

816
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,798
close that relationship is in terms of

817
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,319
the frequency visits

818
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,119
the duration of business and all those

819
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:16,879
kinds of things so you're saying

820
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,558
we might want to be to create

821
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,559
on top of that network a spread of

822
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:23,359
information

823
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,038
to let you know as the virus travels

824
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,158
through this network how close is it

825
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,079
getting to you

826
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,278
and the number of hops away it is on

827
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,439
that network

828
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,919
is really powerful information that

829
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,840
creates a positive uh feedback loop

830
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,720
where you can act essentially

831
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:41,839
anonymously

832
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,159
uh and on your own like

833
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:46,959
nobody's telling you what to do which is

834
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,320
really important is decentralized

835
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,159
and uh and not yeah whatever the

836
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,558
opposite of authoritarian is

837
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,400
but you get to sort of the american way

838
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,918
you get to choose to do it yourself you

839
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,600
have the freedom to do it

840
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,840
yourself and you're incentivized to do

841
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,959
it and you're most likely going to do it

842
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,639
to to uh

843
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,798
to protect yourself against um

844
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,480
against you getting the disease as the

845
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,000
the closer it gets to you based on the

846
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,038
information that you have

847
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,440
but uh can you maybe elaborate uh first

848
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:19,278
of all brilliant

849
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,600
uh whenever i saw the thing you're

850
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:24,240
working on so forget for covid

851
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,038
this is of course really relevant for

852
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,960
covid

853
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,558
but it's also probably relevant for

854
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,480
future diseases as well so this

855
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,678
uh that was the thing i'm nervous about

856
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,759
like if this whole

857
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,720
if our society shut down because of

858
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,919
covid

859
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,399
like what the heck is gonna happen

860
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,960
when there's a much deadlier disease

861
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,519
like this

862
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,360
this is disappointing the whole time

863
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:45,918
2020 the whole time i'm just sitting

864
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,038
like this

865
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,440
like is the incompetence of

866
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,558
everybody except the people developing

867
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,399
vaccines

868
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,918
uh the biologists are the only ones that

869
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:57,519
got their stuff together

870
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,200
but in terms of institutions and all

871
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,720
that kind of stuff oh it's just been

872
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,798
it's just been terrible

873
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,000
but this is exactly the power of

874
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,079
information

875
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,919
and the power of information that

876
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,319
doesn't limit personal freedom

877
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,640
so your idea is brilliant okay

878
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,639
mathematically can you maybe elaborate

879
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,399
what are we talking about like how do

880
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,640
you actually make that work

881
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,558
what's involved sure first i'm going to

882
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,440
reply to something you said about

883
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,038
the freedom inside this because actually

884
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,440
that was the idea the idea

885
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:30,640
is this is game theory right and

886
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,440
effectively what we did is analogous to

887
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,399
free market economy as opposed to

888
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,558
central planning

889
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:38,079
yeah if you just line up the set of

890
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:41,678
incentives correctly

891
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:43,199
so that people have in their purely

892
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,600
selfish behavior

893
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,720
are contributing to the optimization of

894
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,879
the global function

895
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,880
yes that's it and the the point of what

896
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,640
we do i guess in mathematics is we try

897
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,399
to explore the search space

898
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,919
to go and find out as many possibilities

899
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:56,319
as there are and in this case it's an

900
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,679
apply

901
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,000
in this case it's an applied search

902
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,759
space that's why the inputs from design

903
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,558
user experience design and actual people

904
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,398
are important

905
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,319
but you asked about um i guess that the

906
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:06,639
tech the mathematical or the technical

907
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,639
things

908
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,759
underpinning it so i think the first

909
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,200
thing i'll say is

910
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:14,720
we wanted to make this thing not require

911
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,880
your personal information

912
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,759
and so in order to do that what gave me

913
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,760
the confidence

914
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,519
to i guess lead our team to run at the

915
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,960
beginning is we saw that this could be

916
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:27,359
done without using gps information

917
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,079
so technically what's going on is if two

918
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,759
smartphones

919
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,439
it's a smartphone app if two smartphones

920
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,919
have this thing installed

921
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,278
they just communicate with each other by

922
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,240
bluetooth

923
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:40,159
to go and find out how far they can they

924
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,440
can detect nearby things by bluetooth

925
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,360
and then they can find out that these

926
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,798
two phones were approximately such and

927
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,798
such distance apart

928
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,879
and that kind of relative proximity

929
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,558
information is enough to construct this

930
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,559
big network

931
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,398
okay so the physical network is

932
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,398
constructed based on proximity

933
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:57,918
that's through bluetooth and you don't

934
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:01,038
have to specify

935
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,559
your exact location it's the proximity

936
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,960
i'm not using the pythagorean theorem

937
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,639
basically i mean if i just knew the gps

938
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,159
coordinates we could use the pythagorean

939
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,399
theorem too sorry that's just how i call

940
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,600
it

941
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:09,939
distance formula whatever you want to

942
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,038
call it

943
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:15,120
[Laughter]

944
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:16,720
uh yeah so we're not doing the old

945
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,679
pythagorean

946
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,200
based violation of privacy okay

947
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:24,399
[Laughter]

948
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,679
but so is that

949
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,000
is that enough to form to give you

950
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,200
enough

951
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,798
information about physical connection to

952
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,519
another human being

953
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,079
is there a time element there is there

954
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,839
so

955
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:42,079
okay that sounds like a really strong

956
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,678
like low hanging fruit like if you have

957
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,798
that you could probably go really really

958
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,679
far

959
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:49,679
my natural question is is there extra

960
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,000
information you can add on top of that

961
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,200
like

962
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,200
the duration of the physical proximity

963
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,558
uh so first of all we actually do

964
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,480
estimate the duration

965
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,319
but the way we estimate the duration is

966
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,319
like how a movie is filmed

967
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,439
in the sense that every so often every

968
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,599
few minutes we

969
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,720
check what's nearby it's it's like how a

970
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,439
movie is filmed you take lots of

971
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,159
snapshots

972
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,200
yes so there's no way in a battery

973
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,559
efficient way

974
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,159
to really keep track of that proximity

975
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:18,480
however fortunately we're using

976
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,480
probability the fact is

977
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,919
the paradigm that we're using is it's

978
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,679
not super important

979
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,519
if you run into that person only for 10

980
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,038
minutes at the grocery store

981
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,798
if that's a stranger that you run into

982
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,319
10 minutes in this grocery store

983
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,398
that's not going to be relevant for our

984
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:34,879
paradigm because our paradigm is not

985
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,918
telling you who were you around before

986
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,960
and might therefore

987
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,080
have gotten infected by already ours is

988
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,840
about predicting the future

989
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,599
we changed from i mean the standard

990
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,839
paradigm was what already happened

991
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,839
quick damage control ours predict the

992
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,678
future if you run into that person once

993
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,959
in the grocery store today and never see

994
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,399
them again it's irrelevant for

995
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,319
predicting the future

996
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,398
and therefore for ours what really

997
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,398
matters is the many hours

998
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,759
around the other person at which point

999
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:00,558
if you're scanning every five to eight

1000
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,919
minutes

1001
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,440
that's going to come out in the problem

1002
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,440
like statistically speaking it's going

1003
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,240
to come out as a strong relationship and

1004
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,320
a person

1005
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,159
in the grocery store is going to wash

1006
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,278
out that's not an important physical

1007
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,320
relationship

1008
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,079
i mean this is brilliant what uh

1009
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:17,839
how difficult is it to make work so you

1010
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:18,879
said one there's a mathematical

1011
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,278
component

1012
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,799
that we just kind of talked about and

1013
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,000
then there's the user experience

1014
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,319
component

1015
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,599
so how difficult is it to go just like

1016
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,278
you built the video game

1017
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:33,918
alien attack from zero to

1018
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,798
to completion what's involved how

1019
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,799
difficult is it

1020
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,200
so i'm going to answer that question in

1021
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,798
terms of building the product

1022
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,399
but then i'm also going to acknowledge

1023
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,599
that just having an

1024
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:48,479
app doesn't make it useful because the

1025
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,759
the that's actually maybe the easy part

1026
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,360
if you know what i mean there's like all

1027
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,919
of this stuff about rollout adoption and

1028
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,759
awareness

1029
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,120
but let's focus on the app part first so

1030
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,119
that's again why i said

1031
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,158
the team is incredible so we have a

1032
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:01,359
bunch of people

1033
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,640
who let's just say that the technology

1034
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,879
that we use to make it

1035
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,559
is not the standard way you make an app

1036
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,440
if you think about a standard

1037
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,398
ios app or android app those are a user

1038
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,320
interface

1039
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:13,918
that contacts a web server and sends

1040
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,918
some information back and forth

1041
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,038
we're doing some stuff that has to hook

1042
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,880
into the operating system

1043
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,200
of saying let's go use bluetooth for

1044
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,039
something it wasn't really meant for

1045
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,399
right so there's that part and by the

1046
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:28,640
way what is the app called

1047
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:30,158
oh it's called novid covered with an ad

1048
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,399
very nice so you have to hook into

1049
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,519
bluetooth you're saying you have to do

1050
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:36,879
that

1051
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,919
um beyond the permissions that are

1052
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,559
like at the very surface level provided

1053
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,759
on the phone

1054
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,359
well i don't want to call them

1055
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:45,359
permissions i just want to say that's

1056
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,839
not what you usually do with bluetooth

1057
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,079
gotcha

1058
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,038
usually with bluetooth you say do i have

1059
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,359
headphones nearby

1060
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,278
yes okay i'm done you don't go and say

1061
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,798
do i have headphones nearby

1062
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,079
or do i have another phone nearby which

1063
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:56,720
is doing something and then keep asking

1064
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:59,359
that system keep

1065
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,720
asking the question right so so this is

1066
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,798
actually not easy and

1067
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,240
i mean there were some parts of it which

1068
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:05,759
actually a lot of people had tried

1069
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,000
unsuccessfully

1070
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,800
actually it's known that for example the

1071
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,960
uk was trying to do something

1072
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,240
similar and the problem they ran into

1073
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,519
was when you program things on ios

1074
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,598
ios is very good at making it hard to do

1075
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,199
things in the background

1076
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,280
and so there was quite a lot of effort

1077
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,199
required to go and make this thing work

1078
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,800
so the whole point this thing would run

1079
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,239
in the background and

1080
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,079
ios i mean most

1081
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,598
android probably as well right but yeah

1082
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,879
iowa certainly makes it difficult for

1083
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,720
something to run in the background

1084
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,078
especially when it's to eating up your

1085
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,439
battery right

1086
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,599
ah well we wanted to make sure we didn't

1087
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,960
eat up the battery so that one we can we

1088
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,800
actually are very proud of the fact that

1089
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,000
ours uses very little battery

1090
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,039
uh actually even if compared to apple's

1091
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,039
own system

1092
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,480
so beautiful so what else is required to

1093
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,480
make this thing work

1094
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,320
right so the the key was that you had to

1095
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,079
do significant amount of work on the

1096
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,680
actual mobile app development

1097
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,280
which fortunately the team that we

1098
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,000
brought was this kind of general

1099
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,320
thinkers

1100
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
where we would dig in deep into the

1101
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,280
operating system documentation and the

1102
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,800
api libraries

1103
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,800
so we got that working but there's

1104
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,240
another angle which is you also need the

1105
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,880
servers to be able to compute fast

1106
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,199
enough

1107
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,800
which is tying back to this old school

1108
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,000
computer programming competitions and

1109
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,320
math olympiads

1110
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,320
in fact our team that was working on the

1111
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,880
algorithm and back-end side

1112
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,599
included several people who had been in

1113
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,920
these

1114
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,960
competitions from before which i happen

1115
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,440
to know because i

1116
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,960
i do coach the team for the math yes and

1117
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,679
so we were able to bring people

1118
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,559
in to build servers a server

1119
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,358
infrastructure in

1120
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,039
c plus actually so that we could support

1121
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:45,679
significant numbers of people

1122
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,199
without needing tons of servers is there

1123
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,039
some distributed algorithms

1124
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,319
working here or you basically have to

1125
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,199
keep

1126
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,640
in in the same place the entire graph as

1127
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,078
it builds because

1128
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,159
especially the more and more people use

1129
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,200
it the bigger the bigger the graph gets

1130
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:02,239
i mean this is very difficult uh scaling

1131
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,399
problem right

1132
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,479
ah so that's actually why uh this

1133
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,119
computer algorithm competition stuff was

1134
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,159
handy

1135
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,880
it's because there are only about

1136
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,920
seven to eight giga people in the world

1137
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,760
yeah

1138
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,000
that's not that many so if you can make

1139
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,920
your algorithms linear time or almost

1140
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,400
linear time

1141
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,760
a computer operates in gigahertz yeah i

1142
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,000
only need to do one run

1143
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,760
one one recalculation every hour in

1144
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,960
terms of telling people how far away

1145
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,440
these dangers are

1146
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,280
yes so i suddenly have 3600 seconds

1147
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,880
and my cpu cores are running in

1148
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,839
gigahertz and

1149
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,000
at most they're eight giga people well

1150
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,960
you're skipping over the fact that uh

1151
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,800
there's n squared potential connections

1152
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,559
between people

1153
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,920
so how do you get around the fact that

1154
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,440
uh

1155
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,119
you know that we you know the potential

1156
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,519
set of relationship any one of us could

1157
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,160
have

1158
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,119
8 billion so it's 8 billion times uh

1159
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,118
squared

1160
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,640
that's you that's potential amount of

1161
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,480
data you have to be storing

1162
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,639
and computing over and constantly

1163
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,000
updating so the way we dealt with that

1164
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,719
is we actually expect

1165
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
that the typical network is very sparse

1166
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,118
the

1167
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,359
the technical term sparse would mean

1168
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,519
that the average degree or the average

1169
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,639
number of connections that a person has

1170
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,559
is going to be at most like 100 strong

1171
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,838
connections that you care about

1172
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,000
if you if you think of it almost in

1173
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:29,358
terms of the heavy hitters actually

1174
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,199
in most people's lives 100 if we just

1175
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:33,358
kept track of their top 100

1176
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,519
interactions that's probably most of the

1177
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:39,119
signal

1178
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,880
yeah yeah i i i'm saddened to think

1179
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,320
that i might not be even in a double

1180
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,320
digits but oh

1181
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,760
i i was intentionally giving a crazy

1182
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,760
number to account for college students

1183
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,400
you call oh those are the who you're

1184
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,000
calling the heavy hitters the people who

1185
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,119
are like the social butterflies

1186
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,960
yeah yeah yeah i need to uh um i'd love

1187
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,800
to know that information about myself by

1188
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,838
the way the

1189
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,560
that i do do you uh expose the graph

1190
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:06,000
like how many like about yourself how

1191
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,239
many connections you have

1192
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,760
we do expose to each person how many

1193
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:11,519
direct connections they have that's

1194
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,359
great but for privacy purposes

1195
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,039
we don't tell anybody who their

1196
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:16,799
connections like how their connections

1197
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,719
are interconnected yes gotcha

1198
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,320
but at the same time we do expose also

1199
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,879
to everyone an interesting chart that

1200
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,800
says

1201
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,320
here's how many people you have that

1202
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,880
you're connected to directly

1203
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,359
here's how many at distance two meaning

1204
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,640
via

1205
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,799
people and then here's how many at

1206
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,799
distance three and the reason we do that

1207
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,720
is that actually ends up being a dynamic

1208
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,160
that also boosts adoption it drives

1209
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,919
another feedback loop

1210
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,358
the reason is because we saw actually

1211
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,400
when we deployed this in some

1212
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,880
universities

1213
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,760
that when people see on their app that

1214
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,079
they are

1215
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,359
indirectly connected to hundreds or

1216
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,720
thousands of other people

1217
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,559
they get excited and they tell other

1218
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,000
people hey let's download this app yeah

1219
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:53,759
but you know we also saw in those

1220
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,440
examples especially looking at the

1221
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,760
screenshots people gave

1222
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,480
that is hit as soon as the typical

1223
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,560
person

1224
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,480
has two or three other direct

1225
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,559
connections on the system

1226
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,760
because that means that our app has

1227
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,159
reached a virality

1228
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,800
are not of two to three the key is we

1229
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,719
were making a viral app to fight a virus

1230
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,720
spreading on the same network that the

1231
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,959
virus spreads out

1232
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,639
so you're trying to out virus the virus

1233
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,519
that's right

1234
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,319
that's exactly right okay great what

1235
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,400
have you learned

1236
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,519
from this whole experience in terms of

1237
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,200
um

1238
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,838
let's say for covid but for future

1239
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,719
pandemics as well

1240
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:34,480
is it possible to use the power

1241
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:35,598
information here of networked

1242
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,559
information

1243
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,640
as the virus spreads and travels in

1244
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,920
order to basically keep the society

1245
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:46,078
open is it possible for for people to

1246
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,119
protect themselves with this information

1247
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,039
or do you still have to have most like

1248
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,000
in this overarching policy of everybody

1249
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,159
should stay at home

1250
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,358
all that kind of thing we are trying to

1251
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,598
answer that question right now

1252
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,199
so the answer is we don't know yet but

1253
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,280
that's actually why we're very happy

1254
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,639
that now the idea has started to become

1255
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,839
become more widely known

1256
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,400
and we're already starting to

1257
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:09,119
collaborate with epidemiologists

1258
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,880
again i'm just a mathematician right and

1259
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,240
a mathematician should not be the person

1260
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,480
who is telling everybody

1261
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,239
this will definitely work but because of

1262
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,240
the potential power

1263
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,078
of this approach especially the

1264
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:23,519
potential power of this being an

1265
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,079
end game for kovid we have gotten the

1266
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,719
interest

1267
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,599
of real researchers and we're now

1268
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:29,358
working together

1269
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,880
to try to actually understand the answer

1270
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,880
to that question because you see

1271
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,000
there's a theory so what i can share is

1272
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,680
the mathematics of

1273
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
here's why there's some hope that this

1274
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,759
would work yeah and that's because

1275
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,519
i'm talking about end game now end game

1276
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,440
means you have very few cases

1277
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:44,880
but everywhere we're always thinking

1278
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,400
once there's few cases then does that

1279
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,240
mean we now open up

1280
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,519
once you open up in the past then the

1281
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,358
cases go up again

1282
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:53,119
until you have to lock down again yeah

1283
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,078
and now when we talk about the dynamic

1284
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,838
process that makes

1285
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,280
it's guaranteeing you always have cases

1286
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:57,519
until you have the great vaccines which

1287
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,519
is

1288
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,679
you know we both got vaccinated this is

1289
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,599
this is good but at the same time why

1290
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,639
i'm thinking this is still important is

1291
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,640
because we know that

1292
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,679
many vaccine makers have said they're

1293
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:11,759
preparing for the next dose next year

1294
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,759
and if we have a perpetual thing where

1295
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,400
you just always need a new vaccine every

1296
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,000
year

1297
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,000
it could actually be beneficial to make

1298
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,719
sure we have as many other techniques as

1299
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,800
possible

1300
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,000
for parts of the world that can't afford

1301
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,519
for example

1302
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,358
that kind of distribution yeah so

1303
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,239
actually no matter no matter how deadly

1304
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,000
the virus is

1305
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,598
no matter how many things whether you

1306
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,280
have a vaccine or not

1307
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,720
it's still useful to be having this

1308
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,640
information yes because

1309
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:35,759
to stay home or not depending on how

1310
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:37,759
risky like

1311
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,040
i'm a big fan just like you said of uh

1312
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,200
having the freedom

1313
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,639
for you to decide how risk-averse you

1314
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,480
want to be right

1315
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,199
and depending on your own conditions but

1316
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,240
also on the state of like what you

1317
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:51,519
just how dangerously you like to live so

1318
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,358
i think that actually makes a lot of

1319
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,679
sense and i also think that

1320
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:56,880
um since we're when we when you think of

1321
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,358
disease spreading

1322
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,920
it spreads in aggregate in the sense

1323
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:02,400
that

1324
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,760
uh if there are some people who maybe

1325
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,519
are more

1326
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,520
risk tolerant because of other things in

1327
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,400
their life well there might also be

1328
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,318
other people who are

1329
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,920
less risk tolerance and then those

1330
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:13,838
people decide to

1331
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,680
isolate but what matters is in the

1332
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:16,639
aggregate that this are naught of the

1333
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,279
infection

1334
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,118
uh spreading drops below one and so the

1335
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,359
key is if you if you can empower people

1336
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,720
with that power to make that decision

1337
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,598
you might actually still be able to

1338
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:30,879
drive that are not down below one

1339
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,960
yeah and also this is me talking i

1340
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,960
yes people get a little bit nervous i

1341
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,199
think

1342
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,960
with uh information somehow mapping to

1343
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,960
privacy violation but

1344
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,240
i i first of all in the approach you're

1345
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,318
describing

1346
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:49,199
that's respecting anonymity

1347
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,239
but i would love to have information

1348
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:54,000
from the very beginning

1349
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:58,239
from march and april of last year

1350
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,519
almost like a map of like where

1351
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:04,318
it's risky and where it's not to go

1352
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,759
and not map based on sort of the exact

1353
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,519
location of people but where people

1354
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,000
usually hang out kind of thing

1355
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:13,838
just maybe not necessarily about

1356
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,119
actual location but just maybe

1357
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,279
activities

1358
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,800
like just to have information about what

1359
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,359
is

1360
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,039
what is good to do or not you know uh in

1361
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,679
terms of like safety

1362
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:27,679
is it okay to run outside and not is it

1363
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,118
okay to go to a restaurant or not

1364
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,519
i just feel like we're operating the

1365
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,400
blind and then what you had

1366
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,159
is a very imperfect signal which is like

1367
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,639
basically politicians

1368
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,239
desperately trying to make statements

1369
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,440
about what is safe and not they don't

1370
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,118
know what the heck they're doing

1371
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,800
they have a bunch of smart scientists

1372
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,519
telling them stuff and the scientists

1373
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,480
themselves

1374
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:49,519
also very important don't always know

1375
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,960
what they're doing

1376
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:54,719
epidemiology is not

1377
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,318
is as much an art as a science you're

1378
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:57,919
desperately trying to predict the future

1379
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,599
which nobody can do

1380
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,119
and then you're trying to speak with

1381
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,880
some level of authority

1382
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,400
i mean if i were to criticize scientists

1383
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,440
they spoke with too much authority

1384
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,559
it's okay to say i'm not sure but then

1385
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,480
they think like if i say i'm not sure

1386
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,078
then there's going to be a distrust what

1387
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,039
they realize is when you're wrong and

1388
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,880
you say i'm sure

1389
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,559
it's going to lead to more distrust so

1390
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,160
there's this imperfect like

1391
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,400
just chaotic messy system of people

1392
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,358
trying to figure out with very little

1393
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,440
information

1394
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,719
and what you're proposing is just a huge

1395
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,480
amount of information

1396
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:34,959
and information is power is there um

1397
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,679
challenges with adoption that you see in

1398
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,599
the future

1399
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,838
here so there's uh maybe we could speak

1400
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,400
to there's approaches i guess from

1401
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:42,799
google

1402
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,800
there's different people that have tried

1403
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,720
similar kind of ideas

1404
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,519
not in you have a quite a novel idea

1405
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,318
actually

1406
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:54,719
but speaking the umbrella idea of

1407
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:57,838
contact tracing

1408
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,879
is is there is there something you can

1409
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:00,719
comment about

1410
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,920
why their approaches haven't been fully

1411
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:04,000
adopted

1412
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,680
is there challenges there is there is

1413
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,358
there reasons why novid might be a

1414
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:09,759
better idea moving forward

1415
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:11,039
in general just about adoption yeah so

1416
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,920
first of all i want to say i always have

1417
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,599
respect for the

1418
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,039
methods that other people use and so

1419
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,000
it's good to see that other people have

1420
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:18,559
been trying

1421
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,559
but what we have noticed is that the

1422
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,559
difference between our

1423
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,239
value proposition to the user and the

1424
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,400
value proposition to the user delivered

1425
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,679
by everything that was made before

1426
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,400
is that unfortunately the action of

1427
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,679
installing

1428
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,480
a standard contact tracing app will then

1429
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:36,480
tell you

1430
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,679
after you have already been exposed to

1431
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,519
the disease

1432
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,078
so that you can protect other people

1433
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:44,559
from you and what that does to your

1434
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,599
own direct probability of getting sick

1435
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:47,119
if you think about it

1436
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,800
suppose you were making the decision

1437
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,519
should i or should i not install one of

1438
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,599
those apps

1439
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:54,800
yeah what does that do to your own

1440
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,359
probability of getting sick

1441
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,000
it's close to zero this is uh the sad

1442
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:01,119
thing you're

1443
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,199
um you're speaking to not sad i suppose

1444
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,440
it's the way the world is

1445
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,838
the only incentive there is to just help

1446
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,200
other people i suppose but

1447
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,519
a much stronger incentive is is anything

1448
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,759
that

1449
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,880
allows you to help yourself yes so what

1450
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,040
i'm saying is that

1451
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,160
uh let's just say free market capitalism

1452
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,599
was not

1453
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:23,358
based on altruism i think it's based on

1454
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,440
if you make a system of incentives so

1455
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:26,880
that everybody trying to maximize their

1456
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,880
own situation

1457
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,800
somehow contributes to the whole that's

1458
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,680
a game's theoretic solution to a very

1459
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,960
hard problem

1460
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,118
and so this is actually basically

1461
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,559
mechanism design we've basically come up

1462
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,440
with a different mechanism

1463
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:41,119
different set of incentives which

1464
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,480
incentivizes the adoption because

1465
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,039
actually whenever we've been rolling it

1466
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,119
out

1467
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,639
usually the first question we ask people

1468
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,800
like say in the university is

1469
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:50,559
do you know what nova does and most of

1470
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,000
them have read about the other apps and

1471
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,279
they say oh no of it will tell you after

1472
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,920
you've been around someone so you can

1473
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,599
quarantine

1474
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,280
and we have to explain to them actually

1475
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,079
novad never wants to ask you to

1476
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,280
quarantine

1477
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,119
yeah that's not the principle our

1478
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,640
principle isn't based on that at all

1479
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,400
we just want to let you know if

1480
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,519
something is coming close

1481
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,200
so that you can protect yourself if you

1482
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,199
want yeah if you want if you want

1483
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,358
and then the the quarantine is like yes

1484
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,199
in that case if you're quarantining

1485
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,119
it's because you're shutting the door

1486
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,838
from the inside if that's exciting yes

1487
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,400
exactly exactly i mean this is brilliant

1488
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,039
but so

1489
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,960
what um do you think the future looks

1490
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:25,759
like for future pandemics what's your

1491
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,440
plan

1492
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,960
with novid what's your plan with these

1493
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,559
set of ideas i

1494
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,240
am actually still an academic and a

1495
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,359
researcher so the biggest work i'm

1496
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:34,719
working on right now

1497
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,719
is to try to build as many

1498
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:37,598
collaborations with other public health

1499
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,239
researchers

1500
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,640
at other universities to actually work

1501
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:42,639
on

1502
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,000
pilot deployments together in various

1503
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:45,920
places that's the goal

1504
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,519
that's actually ongoing work right now

1505
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,720
and so for example if anyone's watching

1506
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,679
this and you happen to be a public

1507
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,519
health researcher

1508
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,199
and you want to be involved in something

1509
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:55,199
like this i'm just going to say i'm

1510
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,318
still incentive thinking

1511
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,480
there's something in it for the

1512
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:00,318
researchers too this could open up an

1513
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,838
entire new way of controlling disease

1514
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:04,239
that's my hope

1515
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,519
i mean it might actually be true and

1516
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:07,919
people who are involved

1517
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,199
in figuring out how to make this work

1518
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,920
well it could actually be good for their

1519
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:11,279
careers too

1520
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,880
i i always have to think like if a

1521
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,160
researcher was getting involved what are

1522
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,920
they getting out of it

1523
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,759
oh so you mean like uh from a research

1524
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:21,039
perspective you can um

1525
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,559
like publications and sets of ideas

1526
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:27,679
about how to from a sort of uh

1527
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:30,079
uh network theory perspective understand

1528
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:30,719
how we control the spread of a pandemic

1529
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,079
yes and

1530
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,679
what i'm doing right now is this is

1531
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,359
basically interdisciplinary research

1532
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,039
where maybe our side is bringing the

1533
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,199
technology and the network theory

1534
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,880
and the missing parts are epidemiology

1535
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,118
and public health expertise

1536
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,280
and if the two things start to join also

1537
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,400
because everywhere that you deploy

1538
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,240
let's just say that the world is

1539
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,358
different in the philippines as it is in

1540
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,199
the united states

1541
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:52,960
and just the natures of the of the

1542
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,318
locality would mean that

1543
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,760
someone like me should not be trying to

1544
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:57,279
figure out how to do that but if we can

1545
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,760
work with the researchers who are based

1546
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,280
there

1547
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,200
now suddenly we might come up with a

1548
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,800
solution that will help scale in parts

1549
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,639
of the world where they aren't all

1550
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,519
getting the modern and fizer vaccines

1551
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:07,920
which cost

1552
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,280
like 20 a pop in the u.s so if they want

1553
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,039
to participate

1554
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,040
who do they reach out to oh that would

1555
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:13,519
just be us i mean the novid.org website

1556
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:15,920
has

1557
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:16,880
nova.org it has it has a feedback reach

1558
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,039
out form

1559
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,960
and actually we are i mean again this is

1560
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,279
the dna of being a researcher

1561
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,240
i am actually very excited by the idea

1562
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,960
that this could

1563
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,479
contribute knowledge that will outlast

1564
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,880
all of our generations like

1565
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,679
all of our lifetimes there you go reach

1566
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,200
out

1567
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,000
to novanova.org uh what about individual

1568
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:37,439
people

1569
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,280
should they install the app and try it

1570
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,000
out or is this really geographically

1571
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,680
restricted

1572
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,119
oh yeah i didn't come on here to tell

1573
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,719
everyone to install the app i did not

1574
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,400
come to tell everyone to install the app

1575
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,399
because it works best

1576
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,639
if your local health authority is

1577
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,880
working with us gotcha there's a reason

1578
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,639
it's because this is back to the game

1579
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,318
theory

1580
00:49:54,639 --> 00:50:01,199
if anyone could just say i'm positive

1581
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:01,759
the high school senior prank would be to

1582
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:03,279
say that

1583
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,119
we have a massive outbreak on finals

1584
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,720
week let's not have final exams

1585
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,880
so the way that our system works it

1586
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,318
actually borrows some ideas no borrowers

1587
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,000
we came up with them independently but

1588
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:13,838
this idea is similar to what

1589
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,440
google and apple do which is that if the

1590
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:16,078
local health authority is working with

1591
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,838
this

1592
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,599
they can for everyone who's positive

1593
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:20,558
gives them a passcode that expires in a

1594
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,079
short time

1595
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,319
so for ours if you're on the app and

1596
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,960
saying i'm positive you can either just

1597
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:27,119
say that

1598
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,639
and that's called unverified or you can

1599
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,240
enter in one of these codes that you got

1600
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,078
from the local health authority

1601
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,358
so basically for anyone who's watching

1602
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,559
this it's not that you should just go

1603
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:36,078
and download it unless you want to go

1604
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,599
and look at it that's cool

1605
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,200
but if you on the other hand if you

1606
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,000
happen to know anyone at the local

1607
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,679
health authority which

1608
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,119
is trying to figure out how to handle

1609
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:44,960
kovid well then

1610
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,318
i mean we'd be very happy to also work

1611
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,400
with you

1612
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:49,679
guys so the the verified there is really

1613
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,680
important because you're

1614
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,279
you're maintaining anonymity and because

1615
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,480
of that you have to have some source of

1616
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,119
verification

1617
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,960
in order to make sure that it's not uh

1618
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,720
possible to manipulate

1619
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,760
because uh it's it's ultimately about

1620
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,838
trust and information and so it could be

1621
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,359
um verification is really important

1622
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:09,358
there so basically individual people

1623
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:11,759
should um

1624
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:14,880
ask their local health authorities to to

1625
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,119
just to sign up to contact you

1626
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,800
i hope this spreads i hope this spreads

1627
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,358
uh for future pandemics because i'm

1628
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,079
really

1629
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:23,119
i'm it's the amount the millions of

1630
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,318
people

1631
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,559
who are hurt by this i think our

1632
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:30,960
response to the virus

1633
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,480
economically speaking the number of

1634
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,639
people who lost their dream

1635
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,559
lost their jobs but also lost their

1636
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:38,558
dream entrepreneurs

1637
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,079
you know jobs often give meaning there's

1638
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,160
people who financially and

1639
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,599
psychologically are suffering because of

1640
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:45,920
our

1641
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,280
i'll say incompetent response to the

1642
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,200
virus

1643
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,079
across the world but certainly united

1644
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,239
states that should be the beacon

1645
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,519
of uh entrepreneurial hope for the world

1646
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,719
so

1647
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:01,119
i i hope that uh

1648
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,639
we'll be able to respond to these kinds

1649
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,880
of events much better in the future and

1650
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:08,159
this is exactly the right kind of idea

1651
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:11,358
and now is the time to do the investment

1652
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,879
let's step back to the beauty of of uh

1653
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:15,598
mathematics

1654
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,440
maybe ask the the big silly question

1655
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,800
first which is uh

1656
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,720
what do you find beautiful about

1657
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,880
mathematics

1658
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:27,358
i think that being able to look at a

1659
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,480
complicated problem which looks

1660
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:30,000
unsolvable

1661
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,599
and then to be able to change the

1662
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,318
perspective to come from a different

1663
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,559
angle

1664
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,000
and suddenly see that there's a nice

1665
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,760
solution

1666
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,440
i don't mean that every problem in math

1667
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,079
is supposed to be this way but i think

1668
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,000
that these

1669
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,920
reframings and changing of perspectives

1670
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,519
that cause difficult things to get

1671
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,519
simplified and crystallize

1672
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:49,280
and factored in certain ways is

1673
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:50,559
beautiful actually that's

1674
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,480
related to what we were just talking

1675
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,760
about with even this fighting pandemics

1676
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,719
the the crystal idea was just

1677
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,079
quantify proximity by the number of

1678
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:02,318
relationships in the phys

1679
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,480
in the physical network instead of just

1680
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,480
by the feet and meters

1681
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,318
right it's it's just if you change that

1682
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,119
perspective now all of these things

1683
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:12,239
follow

1684
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:15,358
and so mathematics to me is beautiful

1685
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,719
in the pure sense just for that yeah

1686
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,000
it's quite interesting to see a human

1687
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:23,039
civilization as a network as a graph

1688
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,719
and our relationships as kind of

1689
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:29,599
edges in that graph and to then

1690
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:30,879
do outside of just pandemic do

1691
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,880
interesting inferences

1692
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,880
based on that this this is true for like

1693
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,200
twitter social networks and so on

1694
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,079
how we expand the kind of things we talk

1695
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,318
about

1696
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,839
think about sort of politically if you

1697
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:45,920
have this little bubble

1698
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:46,880
quote-unquote of ideas that you play

1699
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,519
with

1700
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,200
it's uh nice from a recommender system

1701
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:51,838
perspective how do you jump out of those

1702
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:54,078
bubbles

1703
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,838
it's really fascinating uh youtube was

1704
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,880
working on that

1705
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:00,239
twitter's working on that but not always

1706
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,960
so successfully but

1707
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:03,838
there's a lot of interesting work from a

1708
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,159
mathematical

1709
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,440
and a psychological sociological

1710
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:10,799
perspective there in

1711
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,960
within those graphs but if we look at

1712
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,039
the cleanest formulation of that

1713
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,159
of looking at a problem from different

1714
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,599
perspective

1715
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:20,159
you're also involved with the

1716
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:24,720
international mathematics olympiad

1717
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:27,679
which takes a small clean

1718
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,598
uh problems that are really hard but

1719
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:32,799
once you look at them differently

1720
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:36,318
can become easy but that little jump of

1721
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,880
innovation is is uh is the entire trick

1722
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,558
so maybe at the high level can you say

1723
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,519
what is the international mathematical

1724
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,559
olympiad

1725
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:46,960
sure so this is uh the competition

1726
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,480
for people who aren't yet in college uh

1727
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,159
math competition which is

1728
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,719
the most prestigious one in the entire

1729
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,078
world it's the olympics of mathematics

1730
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,558
but only for people who aren't yet in

1731
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,920
college now the kinds of questions that

1732
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,160
they ask you to do

1733
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:03,200
are not computational usually you're not

1734
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:05,519
supposed to find that the answer is 42

1735
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,798
right instead you're supposed to explain

1736
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:09,358
why something is true

1737
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:10,719
yes and the the problem is that at the

1738
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:11,440
beginning when you look at each of the

1739
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:13,039
questions

1740
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,039
first of all you have four and a half

1741
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,480
hours to solve three questions

1742
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:17,599
and this is one day and then you have a

1743
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,318
second day which is four and a half

1744
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,000
hours

1745
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:21,838
three questions but when you look at the

1746
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,358
questions they're all asking you explain

1747
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:25,119
why the following thing is true which

1748
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:26,960
you've never seen before

1749
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,318
and by the way even though there are six

1750
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,920
questions if you solve any one of them

1751
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,039
you're a genius and you get an honorable

1752
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,119
mention so this is

1753
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,279
this is hard to explain a hard problem

1754
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,920
what about is it one person is it a team

1755
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,720
ah so it's each country can send six

1756
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,599
people

1757
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,199
and the score of the country is actually

1758
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,760
unofficial there's not an official

1759
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:46,078
country

1760
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,839
versus country system although everyone

1761
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,240
just adds up the point scores of the six

1762
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:49,920
people

1763
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:51,358
and they say well now which country uh

1764
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,599
stacked up where

1765
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,440
yeah so maybe as a side comment i should

1766
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,880
say that um

1767
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,519
there's a bunch of countries including

1768
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,880
the former soviet union and russia

1769
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:04,318
uh where i grew up where this is one of

1770
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,798
the

1771
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:08,318
most important competitions that the

1772
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:11,039
country participates in like

1773
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,079
it was a source of pride for a lot of

1774
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,519
the country

1775
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,519
you look at the olympic sports like uh

1776
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:18,798
wrestling weightlifting there's certain

1777
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:22,000
sports

1778
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:24,960
and hockey that russia

1779
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,318
and the soviet union truly took pride in

1780
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,440
and actually the

1781
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:30,000
mathematical olympiad it was one of them

1782
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,960
for many

1783
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,159
years it's still one of them and that's

1784
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,079
kind of fascinating we don't

1785
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:37,920
think about it this way in the united

1786
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,880
states maybe you can correct me if i'm

1787
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,000
wrong but

1788
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,160
it's not nearly as popular in the united

1789
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,599
states in terms of its integration into

1790
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:48,078
the culture

1791
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,039
into uh just basic conversation into the

1792
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,920
pride

1793
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,838
like you know if you win an olympic gold

1794
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,079
medal or if you win the super bowl you

1795
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,199
can walk around proud

1796
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,200
i think that was the case with the

1797
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:02,000
mathematical olympiad in russia

1798
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:02,960
not not as much the case in the united

1799
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,318
states i think

1800
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,880
so i just want to give that a little

1801
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:08,719
aside because beating anybody

1802
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,240
from russia from the eastern republic or

1803
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,719
from china is very

1804
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:14,479
very difficult that like if i remember

1805
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,558
correctly

1806
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,519
you know there's people this was a

1807
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,640
multi-year

1808
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:23,679
training process they train hard

1809
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:25,039
and this is this is everything that

1810
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:28,399
they're focused on

1811
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,838
my uh my dad was was uh was a

1812
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,400
participant in this and

1813
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:33,759
it's i mean it's uh it's as serious as

1814
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,280
olympic sports you think about like

1815
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,559
gymnastics like young athletes

1816
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,480
participating gymnastics

1817
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,319
is this as serious as that if not more

1818
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,519
serious so i just want to give that a

1819
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:44,798
little bit of context because we're

1820
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:47,280
talking about serious high level math

1821
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:48,798
athletics almost here yeah and actually

1822
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,798
i also think that it

1823
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,920
made sense from the soviet union's

1824
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:54,000
perspective because

1825
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,440
if you look at what these people do

1826
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,079
eventually

1827
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,720
even though let's look at the ussrs or

1828
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,798
the

1829
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,039
international math olympiad record even

1830
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:05,199
though they i say even though they won

1831
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,199
a lot of awards at the high school thing

1832
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:07,759
many of them went on to do incredible

1833
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:09,679
things

1834
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,960
in research mathematics or research

1835
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,000
other things and

1836
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,240
that's showing the generalization

1837
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,318
generalizability

1838
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:18,159
of what they were working on because

1839
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,880
ultimately

1840
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:22,318
we're just playing with ideas of how to

1841
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,119
prove things

1842
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:26,480
and if you get pretty good at inventing

1843
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,960
creative ways to

1844
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,760
turn problems apart split them apart

1845
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,720
observe

1846
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,000
neat ways to turn messy things into

1847
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:35,598
simple crystals

1848
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,039
well if you're going to try to solve any

1849
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,280
real problem in the real world

1850
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:41,039
that could be a really handy tool too so

1851
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,519
i don't think it was a bad investment

1852
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,880
i i think it clearly worked well for

1853
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:47,280
soviet union

1854
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:49,358
yeah so this this is interesting people

1855
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,319
sometimes ask me you know you go up and

1856
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:55,598
and under communism you know was there

1857
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:58,000
anything good about communism

1858
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,119
and it's difficult for me to talk about

1859
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,719
it because it's not

1860
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,798
uh communism is one of those things

1861
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:05,679
that's looked down on like without

1862
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,239
in absolutist terms currently but you

1863
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:08,558
could still

1864
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:11,039
in my perspective talk about the actual

1865
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:15,040
forget communism or whatever the actual

1866
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:16,880
term is but you know certain

1867
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:18,079
ways that the society function that we

1868
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,838
can learn lessons from

1869
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,559
and one of the things in the soviet

1870
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:26,159
union that was highly prized

1871
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:30,559
is knowledge not even now it's

1872
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:34,078
wisdom and the skill of invention

1873
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:36,720
of innovation at a young age

1874
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:39,039
so we're not talking about a selection

1875
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:42,159
process where you pick the best students

1876
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:45,119
in the school to do the mathematics

1877
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:46,000
or to read literature it's like

1878
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,838
everybody

1879
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,039
did it everybody it was almost treated

1880
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:53,039
as if

1881
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:54,798
anyone could be the next einstein

1882
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:57,279
anybody could be the next

1883
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,000
i don't know hemingway james joyce and

1884
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,119
so you're

1885
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,480
forcing an education on the populace

1886
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:07,200
and a rigorous deep education like

1887
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,159
as opposed to kind of like oh we want to

1888
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:12,838
make sure we

1889
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:14,239
um we teach to the weaker student in the

1890
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:16,880
class

1891
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:18,159
which american systems can sometimes do

1892
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,280
because we don't want to leave anyone

1893
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:23,039
behind

1894
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,960
the the russian system was

1895
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,318
anyone can be the strongest student and

1896
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,880
we're going to teach you the strongest

1897
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:29,679
student

1898
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,160
and we're going to just to pretend or

1899
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:32,159
force

1900
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,399
everybody even the weakest student to be

1901
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,159
strong and what that results in

1902
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,079
it's obviously this is what people talk

1903
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:40,480
about is a huge amount of pressure

1904
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,000
like it's psychologically very difficult

1905
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,318
this is why people struggle when they go

1906
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
to mit this very competitive environment

1907
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:48,000
it can be very psychologically difficult

1908
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,760
but at the same time it's bringing out

1909
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,079
the best out of people

1910
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,200
and that mathematics was certainly one

1911
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,880
of those things

1912
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:56,480
and exactly what you're saying which

1913
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,798
kind of clicked with me just now as

1914
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,358
opposed to kind of a spelling bee

1915
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:02,000
in the united states which i guess you

1916
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:03,598
spell

1917
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,440
i'm horrible at this but it's a

1918
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,440
competition about spelling which

1919
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,000
i'm not sure but you could argue doesn't

1920
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,079
generalize well to future skills

1921
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,280
mathematics especially this kind of

1922
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,920
mathematics

1923
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,119
is essentially formalized competition of

1924
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,720
invention

1925
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:23,358
of uh of creating

1926
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:24,480
new ideas and that generalizes really

1927
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:25,838
really well so

1928
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,679
that's that's quite brilliantly put i

1929
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:29,279
didn't really think about that so this

1930
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,318
is not just about the competition this

1931
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,359
is about

1932
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:36,159
developing minds that uh

1933
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:37,279
will come come to do some incredible

1934
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,719
stuff in the future

1935
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,000
yeah actually i want to respond to a

1936
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:40,558
couple of things there the first one

1937
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,480
this one

1938
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,040
um which is this notion of whether or

1939
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,159
not that is possible in a

1940
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:47,838
non-authoritarian regime

1941
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:49,440
i think it is and that's actually why i

1942
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:51,519
spent some of my efforts

1943
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,760
before the covet thing actually trying

1944
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:54,400
to work towards there the reason is

1945
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,079
because

1946
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,400
if you think about it let's say in

1947
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,160
america lots of people are pretty

1948
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,119
serious about training very hard for

1949
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:02,879
football

1950
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:04,400
or baseball or basketball basketball

1951
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,680
it's very very accessible but lots of

1952
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,639
people are doing that

1953
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:09,118
why well actually i think that what this

1954
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,719
what

1955
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,318
what was going on with the authoritarian

1956
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:14,798
thing was at least

1957
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:15,920
the message that was universally sent

1958
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,880
was

1959
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,240
being a good thinker and a creator of

1960
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,440
ideas

1961
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:24,879
is a good thing yes exactly

1962
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,798
there's no reason why that message can't

1963
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,720
be sent that's right everywhere

1964
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:30,239
and i think it actually should be so

1965
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:31,838
that's the first thing the second thing

1966
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:34,719
is what you commented about

1967
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:36,239
this thing about um you know the

1968
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:38,000
generalizable skill and what what could

1969
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:39,358
people do with olympiads afterwards so

1970
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,838
that's actually my interest in the whole

1971
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:43,199
thing

1972
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:45,279
uh i don't i mean i don't

1973
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,879
just coach students how to do problems

1974
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,240
in fact i'm not even the best person for

1975
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,358
that i'm not the best at solving these

1976
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:50,399
problems

1977
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:51,920
there are other people who are much

1978
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,200
better at making problems and teaching

1979
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,760
people how to solve problems

1980
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:57,519
in fact when i was when the mathematical

1981
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,960
association of america which is the

1982
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:01,199
group which is in charge of

1983
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,880
the u.s participation in these olympiads

1984
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,239
when they were deciding whether or not

1985
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,039
to put me in

1986
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,399
back in 2013 as the head coach i had a

1987
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,119
conversation with their executive

1988
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,639
director

1989
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:15,440
where i commented that we might do worse

1990
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,318
because my position was i don't i mean i

1991
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,480
actually didn't

1992
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:20,400
want to focus on winning i said if

1993
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:23,199
you're going to let me work with

1994
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,920
60 very strong minds as picked through

1995
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,519
this

1996
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,119
system because the coach works with

1997
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:27,599
these gets to run a camp for these

1998
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,680
students

1999
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,599
i said i'm actually not going to define

2000
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:34,719
my success in terms of winning

2001
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,920
this contest i said i wanted to maximize

2002
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,078
the number of the students

2003
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,280
that i read about in the new york times

2004
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,599
in 20 years

2005
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:44,000
oh yeah and the executive director of

2006
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:46,000
the mathematical association of america

2007
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,838
was fully in support of this because

2008
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,920
that's also how their philosophy is

2009
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:50,960
so in america the way we run this is

2010
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,838
we're actually not

2011
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,280
just training to win even though the

2012
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:56,400
students are very good and they can win

2013
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,079
anyway

2014
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,760
one reason for example i went and even

2015
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,440
did the covid thing involving quite a

2016
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,280
few of them

2017
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,760
is so that hopefully some of them get

2018
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,680
ideas because in 20 30 years i won't

2019
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,400
have the energy or the insight to solve

2020
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,480
problems

2021
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,920
we'll have another catastrophe and

2022
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,039
hopefully some of these people will step

2023
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,559
up and do it

2024
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,200
and ultimately have that long-term

2025
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:19,039
impact i wonder if this is scalable to

2026
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:20,318
because that's such a great metric for

2027
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:24,160
education

2028
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:27,199
not how to get an a

2029
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:29,679
on the test uh

2030
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:31,199
but how to have how to be on the cover

2031
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:34,239
of new york times

2032
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:36,639
for inventing something new and i

2033
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:38,479
do you think that's generalizable to

2034
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,519
education beyond just this particular

2035
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,599
olympia like

2036
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:42,719
it's even you're saying this feels like

2037
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,559
a rare statement

2038
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:45,919
almost like a radical statement as a

2039
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,920
goal for education

2040
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,440
so actually the way i teach my classes

2041
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,639
at carnegie mellon which i will admit

2042
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,318
right away is not

2043
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:53,679
equivalent to the average in the world

2044
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:55,838
but it's already not

2045
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,440
it's already not just the top 60 in the

2046
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:59,759
country as picked by something

2047
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,960
um let me just explain i have exams in

2048
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,319
my class which are 90

2049
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,240
of the grade so the exams are the whole

2050
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:06,000
thing or most of the whole thing and

2051
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:07,358
the way that i let students prepare for

2052
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,960
the exams is i show them

2053
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:11,119
all the problems i've ever given on the

2054
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,720
previous exams and the whole the exam

2055
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:13,838
that they will take is open notes they

2056
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:14,879
can take all the notes they want on the

2057
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:16,480
previous problems

2058
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,160
and the guarantee is that the exam

2059
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,519
problems this time will have no overlap

2060
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:20,879
with anything you've seen me give in the

2061
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:22,480
past

2062
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,240
as well as no overlap with anything i

2063
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,358
taught in the class

2064
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:30,239
so the entire exam is invention

2065
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:30,480
wow but that's how i go right my point

2066
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:32,719
is

2067
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,119
i have explained to people when i teach

2068
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:36,558
you i don't want you to have remembered

2069
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,160
a method i showed you

2070
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,400
i want you to have learned enough about

2071
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:41,759
this area that if you face a new

2072
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,480
question which i came up with the night

2073
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,400
before

2074
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,000
by thinking about like what could i ask

2075
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,599
that i have never asked before

2076
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,199
oh that's cute i wonder what the answer

2077
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,440
is ah that's an exam problem that's

2078
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,879
exactly what i do before the exam

2079
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,960
and then that's what i want them to

2080
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,400
learn yeah and the first exam usually

2081
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,159
people have a rough time because it's

2082
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,440
like what what kind of crazy class is

2083
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:02,159
this the professor doesn't

2084
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,838
teach you anything for the exam but then

2085
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,199
by the second or third and by the time

2086
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:08,558
they finish the class

2087
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:10,399
they have learned how to solve anything

2088
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,160
in the area how to invent how they

2089
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,240
intend in that area yeah

2090
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:15,759
can we uh walk back to the the

2091
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:18,399
mathematical olympia yes what's the

2092
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:21,440
scoring and format like

2093
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,639
and also what does it take to win so the

2094
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,679
way it works is that

2095
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:27,199
each of the six students

2096
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:29,038
do the problems and there are six

2097
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,719
problems all the problems are equally

2098
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,160
weighted so each one's worth seven

2099
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:34,399
points that means that

2100
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,358
your maximum score is six problems times

2101
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,480
seven points which is

2102
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:40,318
the nice number of 42. and now

2103
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,838
the way that they're scored by the way

2104
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:43,199
is there's partial credit so the

2105
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:46,318
question is asking you

2106
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:48,239
explain why this weird fact is true

2107
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:50,000
okay if you explain by you get seven

2108
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:51,199
points if you make minor mistake maybe

2109
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,358
you get six points

2110
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:54,558
but if you don't succeed in explaining

2111
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:57,920
why but you explain

2112
01:06:54,559 --> 01:07:02,079
some other true fact

2113
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:04,480
which is along the way of proving it

2114
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:06,160
then you get partial credit and and

2115
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,920
actually now this is tricky because

2116
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:10,000
how do you score such a thing it's not

2117
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:13,039
like it was the answer was

2118
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
72 and you wrote 71 and it's close right

2119
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,920
the answer is 72

2120
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,358
and you wrote 36 oh but that's pretty

2121
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,960
close because you were you know you

2122
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,558
that maybe you're just off by it by the

2123
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,440
way they're not numerical anyway but i'm

2124
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,920
just giving some

2125
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,480
numerical analog to the way the scoring

2126
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,960
might work

2127
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,599
they're all essays and that's where i

2128
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,280
guess i have

2129
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,119
some role as well as some other people

2130
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,319
who helped me in the u.s delegation for

2131
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,358
coaches

2132
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:37,679
we actually debate with the

2133
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:39,440
country which is organizing it the

2134
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:40,318
country which is organizing the olympiad

2135
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,920
brings about

2136
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:45,119
50 people to help judge the written

2137
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,440
solutions

2138
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,318
and you you schedule these half hour

2139
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,400
appointments

2140
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:52,318
where the delegation from one country

2141
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,400
sits down at the table like this

2142
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,519
opposite side is two or three people

2143
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,200
from the host country

2144
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,639
and they're just looking over these exam

2145
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,798
papers saying

2146
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:02,960
well how many points is this worth based

2147
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:05,838
on some rubric that has been designed

2148
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,480
and this is a negotiation process where

2149
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:08,078
we're not

2150
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,000
we're not trying to bargain and get the

2151
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,599
best score we can in fact sometimes we

2152
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,119
go to this table and we will say

2153
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,280
we think we want less than what you gave

2154
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,880
us this is how this is how our

2155
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,880
these are our principles if you give us

2156
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,119
too much we say no you gave us too much

2157
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,239
we do that however the reason why this

2158
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,679
is an interesting process

2159
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:25,278
is because if you can imagine every

2160
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,640
country which is participating has its

2161
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,759
own language

2162
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,119
and so if you're trying to grade the

2163
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,960
mongolian scripts and they're written in

2164
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:32,559
mongolia

2165
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,000
if you don't read mongolian which most

2166
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,798
people don't then the

2167
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,640
the coaches are explaining to you this

2168
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:40,399
is what the student has written

2169
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,159
it's actually quite interesting process

2170
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:45,679
it's almost like um

2171
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:47,358
like a jury yeah you have you have uh

2172
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,920
in the american legal system you have a

2173
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:53,039
jury that where they're deliberating

2174
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,600
but unlike a jury there's the members of

2175
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:55,759
the jury

2176
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,120
speak in different languages sometimes

2177
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:00,719
that's fascinating

2178
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,519
but uh i mean it's hard to know what to

2179
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,600
do

2180
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,759
because it's probably really really

2181
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:10,239
competitive

2182
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:13,198
but your sense is that ultimately people

2183
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:14,000
like how do you prevent manipulation

2184
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,198
here

2185
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
right well we just hope that it's not

2186
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:20,639
happening

2187
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,399
so so we write in english therefore

2188
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,719
everything that the u.s does

2189
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,920
everyone can look at so it's a it's very

2190
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,880
hard for me it's very hard for you to

2191
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,359
manipulate

2192
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,400
we don't manipulate we only hope that

2193
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,319
other people aren't

2194
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:34,479
but at the same time as you see our

2195
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,480
philosophy was we want to use this as a

2196
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:38,318
way to develop general talent

2197
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,238
and although we do this for the six

2198
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,359
people who go to the international math

2199
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:43,678
olympiad

2200
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,920
we really want that everyone at any

2201
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,440
touch at any stage of this process

2202
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,679
get some skills that can help to

2203
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,678
contribute more later so

2204
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,880
i don't know if you can uh say something

2205
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:55,119
insightful to this

2206
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,119
question but what do you think makes a

2207
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:59,359
really hard math problem

2208
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,479
on on this olympiad maybe in the courses

2209
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:03,679
you teach

2210
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:05,759
or in general what makes for a hard

2211
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,039
problem you've seen i'm sure a lot of

2212
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,280
really difficult problems

2213
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:12,000
what makes a heart problem so i could

2214
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:12,880
quantify it by the number of leaps of

2215
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,719
insight

2216
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,079
of changes of perspective that are along

2217
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,600
the way and here's why

2218
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:19,279
it's this is like a very theoretical

2219
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,560
computer science way of looking at it

2220
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:24,639
okay it's the is that each reframing of

2221
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,000
the problem and using of some tool i

2222
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,440
actually call that a leap of insight

2223
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,840
when you say oh wow

2224
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:31,519
now i see i should kind of put these

2225
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,440
plugs into those sockets

2226
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,679
like so yes and suddenly i get to use

2227
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:38,000
that machine oh but i'm not done yet

2228
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,199
now i need to do it again each such step

2229
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,960
is a large

2230
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:43,198
possible large fan out in the search

2231
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,679
space the number of these

2232
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:47,279
tells you the exponent the base of the

2233
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,880
exponent is like how big

2234
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,039
how many different possibilities you

2235
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,119
could try and that's

2236
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:54,960
that's actually why like if you have a

2237
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:57,279
three inside problem

2238
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,239
that is not three times as hard as a one

2239
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,840
inside problem

2240
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:01,519
because after you've made the one inside

2241
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,400
it's not clear that that was the right

2242
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,600
track necessarily well unless there's

2243
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:07,109
still a branching

2244
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,320
uh of possible yeah

2245
01:11:07,109 --> 01:11:12,079
[Laughter]

2246
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:13,679
you're saying there's problems like on

2247
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:14,800
the math olympia that requires more than

2248
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,319
one insight yes

2249
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,079
those are the hard ones and also i can

2250
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:20,158
tell you how how you can tell

2251
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:21,198
so this is how i also taught myself math

2252
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:23,679
when i was in college

2253
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:25,279
so in if you are taking uh not taught

2254
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:27,119
myself i was taking classes of course

2255
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:28,559
but i was trying to read the textbook

2256
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:29,760
and i found out i was very bad at

2257
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,159
reading math textbooks

2258
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,119
a math textbook has a long page of stuff

2259
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:34,879
that is all true

2260
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,158
which after you read the page you have

2261
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,640
no idea what you just read

2262
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:39,599
yeah this is just a good summary of a

2263
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,800
math textbook

2264
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:45,039
okay yeah because it's it's not clear

2265
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,800
why anything was done that way and yes

2266
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:47,760
everything is true but how the heck did

2267
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,159
anyone think of that

2268
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,800
so the way that i taught myself math

2269
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:53,679
eventually

2270
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,079
was the way i read a math textbook is i

2271
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:56,239
would

2272
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:57,279
look at the theorem statement i would

2273
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:59,678
look at the length

2274
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,279
of the proof and then i would close the

2275
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:04,079
book and attempt to reprove it myself

2276
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,880
yeah now that's brilliant the length of

2277
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:06,719
the proof

2278
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,000
is telling you the number of insights

2279
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,800
because the length of the proof

2280
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,158
is linear in the number of insights that

2281
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,239
each insight takes space

2282
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:15,519
yeah and if i know that it's a short

2283
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:16,079
proof i know that there's only one

2284
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,239
insight

2285
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:20,079
so when i'm doing my own way of solving

2286
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:20,479
the problem like so i mean finding the

2287
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:22,479
proof

2288
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:24,238
i quit if i'm if i have to do too many

2289
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:24,799
pluggings it's equivalent to a math

2290
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:26,238
contest

2291
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,920
in a math context i look is it problem

2292
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:28,799
one two or three that tells me how many

2293
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,158
insights there are

2294
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,239
this is exactly what i did that's

2295
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:32,559
brilliant linear in the number i don't

2296
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:35,519
know

2297
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,239
i i think um well it's possible that

2298
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,199
that's true

2299
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:40,639
approximately approximately

2300
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,839
approximately yeah just i don't know uh

2301
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,760
somebody out there is going to try to

2302
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,079
formally prove this oh no i mean you're

2303
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,520
right

2304
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:47,439
there are cases where maybe it's not

2305
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,280
quite linear but in general well some of

2306
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:51,039
it's notation too and some of it is uh

2307
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:52,639
style and all those kinds of things but

2308
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:53,039
within a textbook within the same book

2309
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,119
within

2310
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:56,079
the same book yes within the same book

2311
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:57,920
on the same subject

2312
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,600
yeah that's what i was using that's

2313
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,960
hilarious because you know if it's a

2314
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,239
two-page proof you just know this is

2315
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,800
going to be insane

2316
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:06,639
right that's the uh that's the scary

2317
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,560
thing about insights

2318
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,520
uh you look like andrew wiles working on

2319
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:14,640
the firm oz last theorem

2320
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,080
is you don't know something seems like a

2321
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,079
good idea

2322
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,158
and you have that idea and it feels like

2323
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:22,479
this is a leap

2324
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:23,839
like a totally new way to see it but you

2325
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:26,479
have no idea if it's

2326
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,560
at all useful uh even if you think it's

2327
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,399
correct you have no idea if this is like

2328
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,400
going to go down a path that's

2329
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:35,599
completely counterproductive

2330
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:38,559
or not productive at all that's

2331
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,280
that's a crappy thing about invention is

2332
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,600
um

2333
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:44,559
like i have i'm sure you do i have a lot

2334
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:48,560
of really good ideas every single day

2335
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:49,520
but like and then i'll i'll go inside my

2336
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,320
head along them

2337
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,560
along that little trajectory but it

2338
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:56,559
could be just a total waste

2339
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,239
and it's that i that you know what that

2340
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,400
feels like it just feels like

2341
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:01,759
patience is required not to get excited

2342
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:03,599
any one thing

2343
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,199
so i think this is interesting because

2344
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,280
you raised andrew biles he spent

2345
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:08,319
seven years attacking the same thing

2346
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:10,319
yeah right

2347
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:12,238
and and so i think that what attracts

2348
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:14,719
professional researchers to this

2349
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:16,639
is because even though it's very painful

2350
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:19,359
that you keep fighting with something

2351
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:20,480
when you finally find the right insights

2352
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:23,599
and string them together

2353
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:24,238
it feels really good so well there's

2354
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,600
also like

2355
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:31,359
short term it feels good to

2356
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,440
to uh whether it's real or not

2357
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:35,599
to pretend like you've solved something

2358
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:37,198
in the sense like you have an insight

2359
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,960
and there's a sense like this might be

2360
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:42,399
the insight that solves it

2361
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,960
so at least for me i just enjoy

2362
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:46,799
that rush of positivity even though i

2363
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,399
know statistically speaking is probably

2364
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,920
going to be a dead end

2365
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:51,519
i'm the same way i'm the same way in

2366
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,359
fact that's how i know whether

2367
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,360
i might want to keep thinking about this

2368
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:56,000
general problem it's like if i still see

2369
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:58,880
that i'm getting

2370
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,238
some insights i'm not at a dead end yet

2371
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,079
but that's also where i learned

2372
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:02,718
something from my phd advisor actually

2373
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:04,479
he was a

2374
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:06,480
real big inspiration on my life his name

2375
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:08,000
is benny sudokov in fact he grew up in

2376
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:11,198
the former soviet union

2377
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,238
he was from georgia but he he's an

2378
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:15,439
incredible person

2379
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:17,599
but one thing i learned was choose the

2380
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:19,599
problems to work on

2381
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,960
that might matter if you sub if you

2382
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,640
succeed

2383
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,560
because that's why for example we dug

2384
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,320
into cope it was just well

2385
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,679
suppose we succeed in finding some

2386
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:29,279
interesting insight here

2387
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:31,039
well it actually matters then it's

2388
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:33,759
worthwhile

2389
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:34,719
yeah and i think covid the the way

2390
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,520
you're approaching

2391
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:38,239
uh kovid has two interesting

2392
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,159
possibilities

2393
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:41,678
one it might help with the covet or

2394
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:46,000
another pandemic

2395
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:49,840
but two i mean just this whole

2396
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,520
network theory space you might unlock

2397
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,440
some deep understanding about the

2398
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,840
interaction with human beings that might

2399
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:56,158
have

2400
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,319
nothing to do with the pandemic there's

2401
01:15:56,158 --> 01:15:59,599
a there's a space of possible impacts

2402
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:02,158
that may be direct or

2403
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,280
indirect and the same thing is like with

2404
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:06,879
andrew wiles's proof

2405
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:09,439
i don't understand but apparently

2406
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,880
the pieces of it are really impactful

2407
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:13,839
for

2408
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,880
for mathematics even if the main theorem

2409
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,679
is not

2410
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,239
so along the way the the insights you

2411
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:21,679
have

2412
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:23,519
might be really powerful for

2413
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:24,719
unexpected reasons so i like what you

2414
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,440
said this is something that i learned

2415
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:27,279
from another

2416
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:28,559
friend of mine who's also he's a very

2417
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:29,920
famous researcher all these people are

2418
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,760
more famous than i am

2419
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,520
his name is jacob fox he's jacob fox at

2420
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,280
stanford also a very big inspiration for

2421
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,719
me we were both grad students together

2422
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:38,158
at the same time well most importantly

2423
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:39,600
you're good at selecting good friends

2424
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:40,879
ah yeah well that's that's that's that's

2425
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,840
the key you've got to find good people

2426
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,319
to learn things from yeah

2427
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,920
but his thing was he often said you know

2428
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:46,719
if you solve a math problem and have

2429
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,640
this math proof

2430
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,840
math problem for him is like a proof

2431
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,320
right so suppose you came up with this

2432
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,800
proof

2433
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:54,719
he always asks what have we learned from

2434
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,000
this that we could potentially use for

2435
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,920
something else

2436
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,279
it's not just did you solve the problem

2437
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,920
that was supposed to be famous

2438
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:03,198
it was and is there something new in the

2439
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,039
course of solving this

2440
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:06,559
that you had to invent that we could now

2441
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:10,158
use as a tool elsewhere

2442
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:12,560
you know there's this funny effect where

2443
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:14,879
uh just looking at different fields

2444
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,480
where people discover parallels

2445
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,159
they'll prove something it'll be a

2446
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:20,079
totally new result and then somebody

2447
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:21,759
later realizes this was already done 30

2448
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:24,079
years ago and another discipline

2449
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:26,320
in another way and it's really

2450
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,238
interesting

2451
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:30,158
uh we did this offline in another

2452
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:32,238
illustration you showed to me

2453
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:33,839
it's interesting to see the different

2454
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:37,519
perspectives

2455
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:40,960
on a problem it kind of points like

2456
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:43,360
there's just like very few novel ideas

2457
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:45,520
that everything else that most of us are

2458
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:47,119
just looking at different perspective on

2459
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,000
the same idea

2460
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:51,439
and it makes you wonder this this uh

2461
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
this old silly question

2462
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:54,479
that i have to ask you is uh do you

2463
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,079
think

2464
01:17:54,479 --> 01:18:01,919
mathematics is uh discovered or invented

2465
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:04,079
do you think we're creating

2466
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,039
a new idea we're building a set of

2467
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:09,119
knowledge

2468
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:12,399
that's that's distinct from reality

2469
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:14,238
or are we actually like it is math

2470
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:14,559
almost like a shovel where we're digging

2471
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:17,439
to

2472
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,920
like this core set of truths that are oh

2473
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:20,479
that

2474
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,640
that were always there all along so i

2475
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:24,639
personally feel like it's discovered

2476
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,640
but that's also because i guess the way

2477
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,280
that i'd like to choose what questions

2478
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,199
to work on

2479
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:31,119
are questions that maybe we'll get to

2480
01:18:29,198 --> 01:18:32,879
learn something about

2481
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:34,479
why is this hard i mean i'm often

2482
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,359
attracted to questions that

2483
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:38,799
look simple but are hard right and what

2484
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:40,238
could you possibly learn from that sort

2485
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,840
of like probably the attraction of

2486
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:43,839
fermat's last theorem

2487
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,079
as you mentioned simple statement why is

2488
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,640
it so hard so i'm more on the

2489
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:50,640
discovered side and i also feel like if

2490
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:54,719
we ever ran into an intelligent

2491
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:57,039
other species in the universe

2492
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,439
probably if we compared notes there

2493
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:01,119
might be some similarities between

2494
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:02,799
both of us realizing that pi is

2495
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:04,719
important because

2496
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,320
you might say why why humans do humans

2497
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,960
like circles more than others i think

2498
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:10,799
stars also like circles i think planets

2499
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,039
like circles they're not perfect circles

2500
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,400
but nevertheless the concept of a circle

2501
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:16,079
is just point and

2502
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:18,158
constant distance it doesn't get any

2503
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:21,039
simpler than that it's possible that

2504
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:22,399
that like an alien species will have

2505
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:23,519
depending on different cognitive

2506
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:25,119
capabilities and

2507
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,679
different perception systems we'll be

2508
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:27,679
able to see

2509
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,480
things that are much different than

2510
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:34,158
circles and so

2511
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:36,319
if it's discovered it would still be

2512
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:37,119
pointing at a lot of same geometrical

2513
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:40,319
concepts

2514
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:43,039
mathematical concepts but

2515
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:44,559
it's interesting to think of how many

2516
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:47,198
things we would have to still

2517
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,760
align not just based on notation but

2518
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:51,198
based on

2519
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:54,159
understanding like just the like um

2520
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:55,119
some basic mathematical concepts like

2521
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:57,759
how much work is

2522
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:59,039
there going to be in trying to find a

2523
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,360
common language

2524
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:03,119
i mean this is um i think stephen

2525
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:04,559
wolfram and his son help with the movie

2526
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:07,039
arrival

2527
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,639
like the developing an alien language

2528
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:10,479
like how would aliens communicate with

2529
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,800
humans

2530
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:14,718
it's fascinating because like math seems

2531
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,760
to be the most promising thing but even

2532
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:19,359
like math

2533
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:22,719
like how do you visualize

2534
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:23,359
mathematical ideas it feels like there

2535
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,119
has to be an

2536
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:26,399
interactive component just like we have

2537
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:27,920
a conversation

2538
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,079
there has to be this is something we

2539
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,279
don't i think think about often which is

2540
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:32,960
like

2541
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:34,960
with somebody who doesn't know anything

2542
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,439
about math doesn't know anything about

2543
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:40,800
english or any other natural language

2544
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:42,319
how would we describe we talked offline

2545
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,440
about visual proofs

2546
01:20:42,319 --> 01:20:47,359
how would we through visual proofs have

2547
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:49,039
a conversation

2548
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:52,399
where we say something here's the

2549
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:55,439
concept the way we see it

2550
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:57,519
does that make sense to you and like

2551
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:58,719
can you mess with that concept to make

2552
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,639
it sense for you

2553
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:03,039
and then go back and forth in this kind

2554
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,319
of way so purely through mathematics i'm

2555
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:05,840
sure it's possible to have those kind of

2556
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:07,679
experiments with like tribes

2557
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,279
on earth that don't there's no common

2558
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:11,520
language through math

2559
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:12,399
like draw a circle and see what they do

2560
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,600
with it

2561
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:17,599
right do some of these visual proofs uh

2562
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,600
like the summation of the odds and the

2563
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,840
the adds up to the squares

2564
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,520
yes i wonder how difficult that is uh

2565
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,920
before one one or the other species

2566
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,920
murders

2567
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,360
i i hope that the curiosity for

2568
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:33,439
knowledge will overpower the greedy

2569
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:35,359
this is back to our game theory thing

2570
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:38,000
that the curiosity of like

2571
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:40,000
discovering math together will overpower

2572
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,119
the desire for resources

2573
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,719
and uh ultimately like you know

2574
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:46,319
willing to commit violence in order to

2575
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:48,399
gain those resources

2576
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:50,238
i think as we progress become more and

2577
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:51,039
more intelligence as a species i'm

2578
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,399
hoping

2579
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,158
we would value more and more the

2580
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:56,238
knowledge because we'll come up with

2581
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:58,079
clever ways to gain more resources so we

2582
01:21:56,238 --> 01:21:59,678
won't be so resource starved

2583
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:01,198
i don't know that's a hopeful message

2584
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:04,560
from when we finally meet aliens

2585
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:07,519
yeah yeah see the cool thing about

2586
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,920
the math olympiad um i don't know if you

2587
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,360
know

2588
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:13,760
work from francois chole

2589
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:15,679
from google he come up he came up with

2590
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,960
this kind of

2591
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:21,760
iq test slash it kind of has

2592
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,279
similar aspects to it that also math

2593
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:27,360
olympia does

2594
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:27,920
for for ai so he came up with these

2595
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:31,039
tests

2596
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:33,679
where they're very simple for humans

2597
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:35,840
but very difficult for ai to illustrate

2598
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:40,639
exactly why we're just not good at

2599
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,639
seeing a totally new problem

2600
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:47,119
we sorry ai systems are not good at

2601
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,158
looking at a new problem that requires

2602
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:50,079
you to

2603
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:51,439
detect that there's a symmetry of some

2604
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:54,399
kind or

2605
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:55,759
there's a pattern that's that hasn't it

2606
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:58,638
hasn't seen before

2607
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:00,480
the pattern is like obvious to us humans

2608
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,199
but it's not so obvious to find that

2609
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:03,678
kind of

2610
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:05,678
it's you're inventing a pattern that's

2611
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:10,158
there

2612
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:10,158
in order to then find a solution

2613
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:14,880
some i don't know if you can comment on

2614
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:18,079
but from an

2615
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:19,600
ai perspective and from a math problem

2616
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:22,158
perspective

2617
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,520
what do you think is intelligence what

2618
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:25,920
do you think is the thing

2619
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:28,639
that allows us to solve that problem and

2620
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:31,920
how hard is it to build a machine

2621
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:32,560
to do that asking for a friend yeah so i

2622
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,920
guess

2623
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,840
you see because if i just think of the

2624
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,279
raw search space it's huge yeah

2625
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,039
that's why you can't do it and if i

2626
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:41,119
think about what makes somebody good at

2627
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:42,880
doing these things they have this

2628
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:44,238
heuristic sense it's almost like a good

2629
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,920
chess player of saying

2630
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:47,439
let's not keep analyzing down this way

2631
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,119
because there's some heuristic reason

2632
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,399
why that's a bad way to go yes

2633
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:52,960
where did they get that heuristic from

2634
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:55,279
now that's a good question i don't know

2635
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,560
because that if you asked them to

2636
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:57,840
explain to you

2637
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,360
they could probably say something in

2638
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,119
words that sounds like it makes sense

2639
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:02,000
yeah but i'm guessing that's only a part

2640
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,840
of what's really going

2641
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,520
on in their brain of evaluating that

2642
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,119
position you know what i mean if you ask

2643
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,960
gary kasparov what is good or

2644
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:11,279
why is this position good he will say

2645
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,119
something yeah but it's probably not

2646
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:13,840
approximating everything that's going on

2647
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:15,359
inside

2648
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,520
so there's basically a function being

2649
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:19,039
computed yeah but it's hard to

2650
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,199
articulate what that function is

2651
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:22,719
now the question is could a computer get

2652
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:24,158
as good at computing these kinds of

2653
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:26,800
heuristic functions

2654
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:27,759
maybe i i'm not enough of an expert to

2655
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,199
understand

2656
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,199
but one bit of me has always been a

2657
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:32,079
little bit curious of whether or not the

2658
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:34,638
human brain

2659
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:36,399
has a particular tendency due to its

2660
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,359
wiring to come up with certain kinds of

2661
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:39,439
things

2662
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:40,479
which is just natural due to the way

2663
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:42,638
that the

2664
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:44,959
topology of the neurons and whatever is

2665
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:47,199
there for which if you tried to just

2666
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,560
build from scratch a computer to do it

2667
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:49,519
would it naturally have different

2668
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,280
tendencies

2669
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,800
i don't know and this is just me being

2670
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:53,519
completely ignorant and just saying a

2671
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,039
few ideas

2672
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,679
well this is a good thing with that

2673
01:24:55,039 --> 01:25:00,319
mathematics shows is we don't have to be

2674
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:00,880
so math and physics or mathematical

2675
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:02,319
physics

2676
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,239
operates in a world that's different

2677
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:07,439
than our

2678
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:10,479
descendant of a brains operate in

2679
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:12,638
so it allows us to to have multiple

2680
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:15,439
many many dimensions it allows us to

2681
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:18,560
work on on weird surfaces

2682
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:19,919
uh with like topology as a discipline

2683
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,760
it's just weird to me

2684
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,600
it's really complicated but it allows us

2685
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:25,199
to work in that space

2686
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,639
the differential geometry and all those

2687
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:29,919
kinds of things where

2688
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,639
it's totally outside of our natural

2689
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,679
day-to-day

2690
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:34,800
four-dimensional experience uh 3d

2691
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:37,760
dimensional with time

2692
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,320
experience so math gives us gives me

2693
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,360
hope

2694
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:45,039
that we can that

2695
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:46,719
we can see we can discover the processes

2696
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:50,158
of intelligence

2697
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:51,920
uh outside the limited nature of our own

2698
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:55,920
like human experiences

2699
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:59,520
but you said that you're not an expert

2700
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:02,639
it's kind of funny i i i find that um

2701
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:05,840
we know so little about intelligence

2702
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,239
that uh i think i honestly think like

2703
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,360
almost

2704
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:12,158
children are more expert at

2705
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:12,559
creating artificial intelligence systems

2706
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:15,359
uh

2707
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,120
than than adults i feel like we know so

2708
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:18,079
little we really need to think outside

2709
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:21,359
the box

2710
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:23,359
and those little i found people should

2711
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:24,559
uh check out francois charley's little

2712
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:27,759
exams

2713
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:29,760
but even just solving math problems

2714
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,520
i don't know if you've ever done this

2715
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,760
for yourself but

2716
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,199
when you solve a math problem you kind

2717
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:38,079
of then

2718
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:40,399
traced back and tried to figure out

2719
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:43,439
where did that idea come from

2720
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:45,198
like what how did like what was i

2721
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:48,319
visualizing in my head

2722
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:50,479
how did i start visualizing it that way

2723
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:52,158
how why did i start rotating that cube

2724
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:53,839
in my head in that way

2725
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:55,599
like what is that if i were to try to

2726
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,360
build a program that does that

2727
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,960
where that come from so this is

2728
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:01,679
interesting um

2729
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,639
so i try to do this to teach middle

2730
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:04,399
school students

2731
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:06,719
how to learn how to create create and

2732
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:08,158
think and invent and the way i do it

2733
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,760
is there are these math competition

2734
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:11,359
problems and i'm working in

2735
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,920
collaboration with the people who run

2736
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:14,158
those

2737
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,600
and i will turn on my youtube live and

2738
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:16,319
for the first time look at those

2739
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,440
questions

2740
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:21,198
and live solve them the reason i do this

2741
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:22,319
is to let the middle school students and

2742
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:23,359
the high school students and the adults

2743
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:25,920
whoever wants to watch

2744
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:27,359
just see what exactly goes on through

2745
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,440
someone's head

2746
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:32,000
as they go and attempt to invent what

2747
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:34,559
they need to do to solve the question

2748
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,600
so i've actually thought about that i

2749
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,159
think that

2750
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:39,840
first of all as a teacher i think about

2751
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:41,920
that because whenever i want to explain

2752
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:44,239
to a student how to do something

2753
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,679
i want to explain how it made sense why

2754
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:46,079
it's intuitive to do the following

2755
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:48,960
things

2756
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:51,760
and why the wrong things are wrong not

2757
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,840
just by this one short fast way

2758
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,600
well why this is the right way if that

2759
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,119
makes sense so my point is i'm actually

2760
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,480
always thinking about that

2761
01:27:57,119 --> 01:28:00,000
like how would you think about these

2762
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:01,599
things and then i eventually decided the

2763
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,639
easiest way to expose this

2764
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,920
would just be to go live on youtube and

2765
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:07,760
just say i've never seen any of these

2766
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,319
questions before here we go

2767
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:12,079
don't you get uh man that's that's

2768
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:15,198
anxiety inducing for me

2769
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:17,359
uh don't you get trapped in

2770
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:18,638
a kind of like little dead ends of

2771
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:20,479
confusion

2772
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:21,840
even on middle school problems yes

2773
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:23,279
that's what the comments are for

2774
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,520
the live contents come in and students

2775
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:27,279
say try this oh wow

2776
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,280
it's actually pretty good i'll never get

2777
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:30,319
stuck i mean i'm i'm willing to go on

2778
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:32,158
camera and say

2779
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:34,079
guess what potion though can't do this

2780
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:34,638
that's fine but then what ends up

2781
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:36,319
happening

2782
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,520
is you will then see how maybe

2783
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:39,279
somebody's saying something and i look

2784
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,199
at the chat and i say aha

2785
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:42,960
that actually looks useful now that also

2786
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:44,960
shows how

2787
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:46,239
not all ideas not all suggestions are

2788
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,279
the same power

2789
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,638
if that makes sense because if i

2790
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:49,399
actually do get stuck i'll go fishing

2791
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:51,920
through the chat

2792
01:28:49,399 --> 01:28:53,279
[Laughter]

2793
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,359
i don't know if you can speak to this

2794
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:57,599
but is there a moment

2795
01:28:55,359 --> 01:28:59,759
for the middle school students maybe

2796
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,280
high school as well

2797
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,320
where there's like a turning point for

2798
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:06,639
them

2799
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:07,759
where they maybe fall in love with

2800
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:11,039
mathematics

2801
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:12,800
or they or they get it is there um

2802
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:14,639
is there something to be said about like

2803
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:17,360
discovering that moment and

2804
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,920
and trying to grab them to get to get

2805
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:20,238
them to

2806
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,520
understand that mathematics is so no

2807
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:23,039
matter what they want to do in life

2808
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,199
could be part of their life

2809
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,800
yes i actually do think that the middle

2810
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:28,399
school is exactly the right time

2811
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,400
because that's the place where your

2812
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:32,719
mathematical understanding

2813
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:34,559
gets just sophisticated enough that you

2814
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:37,600
can start doing interesting things

2815
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,280
because if you're early on in counting

2816
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,639
i'm honestly not very good at teaching

2817
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:42,238
you new insights

2818
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:43,679
my wife is pretty good at that but

2819
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:45,198
somehow once you get to this

2820
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,960
this part where you know what a fraction

2821
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:49,599
is and when you know

2822
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,198
um how to add and how to multiply and

2823
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,440
what the area of a triangle is

2824
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:55,119
at that point to me the whole world

2825
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,279
opens up and you can start observing

2826
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:58,960
there are really nifty coincidences

2827
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:00,319
the things that made the greek

2828
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,079
mathematicians and the ancient

2829
01:30:00,319 --> 01:30:03,920
mathematicians excited

2830
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:05,600
actually back then it was exciting to

2831
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:09,920
discover the pythagorean theorem

2832
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:12,000
it wasn't just homework so is there

2833
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,960
what which discipline do you think has

2834
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:18,880
the most exciting coincidences so

2835
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:22,079
is it geometry is it algebra

2836
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,600
um is it calculus well you see you're

2837
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:24,479
asking me and i'm the guy who gets the

2838
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,560
most excited

2839
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:28,399
when the combinatorics shows up in the

2840
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:32,000
geometry

2841
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:33,839
is it okay so it's the combinatorics

2842
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,119
in the geometry so first of all the nice

2843
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,639
thing about geometry

2844
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:38,479
this is the same nice thing about

2845
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:41,600
computer vision is it's

2846
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:43,198
visual so geometry you can draw circles

2847
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:47,280
and triangles and stuff so

2848
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:49,839
it naturally uh presents itself to uh

2849
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:51,840
to the visual proof right but also the

2850
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:55,760
nice thing about geometry i think

2851
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:58,400
for me is the earliest

2852
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,880
class the earliest discipline where

2853
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:01,039
there's

2854
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,319
uh that's most amenable to the

2855
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:05,279
exploration

2856
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:07,519
of the invention through proofs the idea

2857
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:10,079
of proofs i think is most easily

2858
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,239
shown in in geometry because it's so

2859
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:14,719
visual i guess

2860
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:16,000
so that that to me is like uh if i were

2861
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:17,198
to think about when i first

2862
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,158
fell in love with math it would be

2863
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:22,399
geometry and sadly enough

2864
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:24,960
that's not used geometry only has a

2865
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:28,879
little appears briefly

2866
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:31,439
in the journey of of an um of a student

2867
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:33,600
and it kind of disappears and not until

2868
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:35,919
much later which

2869
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,199
you know to maybe like differential

2870
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:39,600
geometry i don't know where else it

2871
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:42,158
shows up for me in computer science like

2872
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:44,159
you can start to think about like

2873
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:45,679
computational geometry or even graph

2874
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:47,119
theory is the kind of geometry you can

2875
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:49,840
start to think about it visually

2876
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:50,960
although it's pretty tricky but yeah it

2877
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,880
was always um

2878
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,880
that that was the most beautiful one

2879
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,400
everything else i guess calculus can be

2880
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,679
kind of visual too that can that could

2881
01:31:56,399 --> 01:32:01,519
be pretty beautiful

2882
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:05,279
but is there um something

2883
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:08,560
you try to look for in the student

2884
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:09,759
to see like how can i inspire them at

2885
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,360
this moment

2886
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,280
or is this like individual student to

2887
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,759
student is there something you could say

2888
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:15,279
there

2889
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,280
so first of all i really think that

2890
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:17,759
every student can pick up all of this

2891
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:19,119
skill

2892
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,199
i really do think so i don't think it's

2893
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:23,920
something only for a few and so

2894
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:24,960
if i'm looking for a student actually

2895
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,719
oftentimes when i'm

2896
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,399
if i'm looking at a particular student

2897
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,800
the question is

2898
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:32,879
how can we help you feel like you have

2899
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,480
the power to invent also

2900
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,920
because i think a lot of people are used

2901
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:37,439
to thinking about math as something

2902
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,840
where the teacher will show you what to

2903
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:39,919
do

2904
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:41,119
and then you will do it yes so i think

2905
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:42,560
that the key is to

2906
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:44,158
show that they have some let them see

2907
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:46,639
that they have some power to invent

2908
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:47,759
and at that point it's often starting by

2909
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:48,560
trying to give a question that they

2910
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,840
don't know how to do

2911
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,920
you want to find these questions that

2912
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,319
they don't know how to do that they

2913
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,520
can think about and then they can solve

2914
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:57,679
and then suddenly they say

2915
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,880
my gosh i've had a situation i haven't

2916
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:00,719
i've had an experience

2917
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:03,279
where i didn't know what to do and after

2918
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:06,639
a while i did

2919
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:10,000
is there um advice you can give on how

2920
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:13,199
to learn math for people whether it's

2921
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,960
middle school whether it's somebody

2922
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:19,198
as an adult kind of gave up on math

2923
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,480
maybe early on

2924
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:22,479
i actually think that these math

2925
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:23,599
competition problems those school and

2926
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:25,759
high school are really good

2927
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,960
they're actually very hard so if you if

2928
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:30,960
you haven't had this

2929
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:32,800
kind of experience before and you grab a

2930
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,480
middle school math competition problem

2931
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,400
from the state level which is used to

2932
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:39,039
decide who represents the state in the

2933
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:41,359
country in the united states for example

2934
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:43,439
those are pretty tricky and even if

2935
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:45,439
you're a professional

2936
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:46,638
maybe not doing mathematical things and

2937
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:48,158
you're not a middle school student

2938
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:49,920
you'll struggle

2939
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:51,759
so i find that these things really do

2940
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,039
teach you things but by trying to work

2941
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:56,159
on these questions

2942
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:57,920
is there a a googleable term that you

2943
01:33:56,158 --> 01:34:00,559
could use for the organization

2944
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:02,158
for the state competitions ah yeah so

2945
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,440
there are a number of different ones

2946
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:06,119
that are quite popular

2947
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:07,678
one of them is called math counts

2948
01:34:06,119 --> 01:34:09,039
m-a-t-h-c-o-u-n-t-s

2949
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,880
and that's a big tournament which

2950
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:13,880
actually has a state level there's also

2951
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:16,000
a math league.org

2952
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:17,760
mathleaguelegue.org also has

2953
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,079
this kind of tiered the tournament

2954
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,480
structure there's also the american math

2955
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:25,279
competitions amc8

2956
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:27,119
amc also has amc 10 that's for 10th

2957
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:28,559
grade and below and amc 12.

2958
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:30,158
these are all run by the mathematical

2959
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:31,600
association of america

2960
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:33,679
and these are all ways to find old

2961
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,039
questions what about the daily

2962
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:36,719
challenges that you run

2963
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:38,880
what are those about we do that too but

2964
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:41,039
i mean the difference was um ours isn't

2965
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,319
that one is not free so so this i should

2966
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:43,760
actually probably be careful the things

2967
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:44,158
that i've just mentioned are also not

2968
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,440
free

2969
01:34:44,158 --> 01:34:47,118
not all of those things i mentioned just

2970
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:48,638
now are free either but people can

2971
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:50,399
figure out what it is

2972
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:52,159
but yeah this is really nice to know

2973
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:53,679
what's out there but can you speak a

2974
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:55,679
little bit to the daily challenges

2975
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,719
sure sure so that's actually what we did

2976
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:59,679
when um

2977
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,000
i guess i was thinking about how would i

2978
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,239
try

2979
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,079
to develop that skill in people if we

2980
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:05,198
had the power to architect the entire

2981
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:06,319
system ourselves

2982
01:35:05,198 --> 01:35:08,719
so that's called the daily challenge

2983
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:10,000
with potion low it's not free because

2984
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:12,719
that's actually how i pay for everything

2985
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:15,198
else i do so that's that was the idea

2986
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:16,319
but the the concept was aha now let's

2987
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:17,919
invent from scratch

2988
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:19,679
so if we're going to go from scratch and

2989
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:23,039
we're going to use technology

2990
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:24,960
what if we made every single lesson

2991
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:26,238
something where first i say hey here's

2992
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,600
an interesting question recorded of

2993
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:28,718
course it's not live but it's like i say

2994
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,679
hey here's an interesting question why

2995
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,198
don't we think about this

2996
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:32,800
but i know i know you don't know how to

2997
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:34,399
do it so now you think

2998
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,639
and a minute later a hint pops on the

2999
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:38,479
screen but you still think and a minute

3000
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:40,480
later a big hint pops on the screen

3001
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:42,158
you still think and then finally after

3002
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:43,599
the three minutes hopefully you got some

3003
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:45,359
ideas you try to answer

3004
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:47,600
and then suddenly there's like this

3005
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:49,599
pretty extended explanation of

3006
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,880
oh yeah so here's like multiple

3007
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,520
different ways that you can do the

3008
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,440
question

3009
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,560
and by accident you also just learn this

3010
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:56,719
other concept

3011
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,080
that's what we did so is this targeted

3012
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:59,920
towards middle school students

3013
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:01,439
high school students it's targeted

3014
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,239
towards middle school students with

3015
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:03,599
competitions

3016
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:05,439
but there's a lot of high school

3017
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,239
students who didn't do competitions in

3018
01:36:05,439 --> 01:36:07,678
middle school

3019
01:36:06,238 --> 01:36:09,678
where they would also learn how to think

3020
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:11,840
if you can see the whole concept was

3021
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:13,279
can we teach people how to think how

3022
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,400
would you do that you need to give

3023
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:17,198
people the chance to

3024
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:18,799
on their own invent without that kid in

3025
01:36:17,198 --> 01:36:20,238
the front row answering every question

3026
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,400
in two seconds

3027
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:25,839
and people can find it i think with

3028
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:25,839
daily dot

3029
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,198
but if you go to find my website you

3030
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,840
you'll be able to find it

3031
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:32,799
beautiful can we zoom out a little bit

3032
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:35,760
and uh

3033
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:38,480
so day to day week to week month to

3034
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:41,600
month year to year what does

3035
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:42,000
the lifelong educational process look

3036
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,119
like

3037
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:48,319
do you think for for yourself

3038
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:50,719
but for for me what would you recommend

3039
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:52,639
in in the world of mathematics or sort

3040
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:53,840
of as opposed to studying for a test but

3041
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:57,600
just like

3042
01:36:53,840 --> 01:37:00,639
lifelong expanding

3043
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:03,600
of uh knowledge and that skill for

3044
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:04,960
invention i think i often articulate

3045
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:08,079
this as

3046
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:10,800
can you always try to do more than you

3047
01:37:08,079 --> 01:37:14,158
could do in the past

3048
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:16,159
yeah but that comes in many ways and

3049
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:17,599
i will say it's great if one wants to

3050
01:37:16,158 --> 01:37:19,359
build that with mathematics

3051
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,960
but it's also great to use that

3052
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:23,118
philosophy with all other things

3053
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,198
in fact if i if i just think of myself i

3054
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:27,118
just think what do i know now that i

3055
01:37:25,198 --> 01:37:28,319
didn't know a year ago or a month ago or

3056
01:37:27,118 --> 01:37:29,920
a week ago

3057
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:31,840
and not just know but like what do i

3058
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,679
have the capability of doing yes

3059
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:34,960
and if you just have that attitude it

3060
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:38,239
brings more

3061
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:42,158
see the thing is there's also a habit

3062
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:45,118
like it is a skill like i've been using

3063
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:46,638
anki it's an app for helps you memorize

3064
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:49,839
things

3065
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:52,239
and i've actually just a

3066
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,039
few months ago started doing this daily

3067
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:55,919
of uh

3068
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:58,238
setting aside time to think about an

3069
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:01,679
idea

3070
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:02,319
that's outside of my work like let's say

3071
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,399
let's pick

3072
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:06,399
put it it's all over the place by the

3073
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:07,839
way but let's say politics like gun

3074
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:09,599
control

3075
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,679
uh is it good to have a lot of guns or

3076
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:14,960
not in society

3077
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:16,639
and just i've set aside time every day

3078
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:19,039
i do at least 10 minutes but i try to do

3079
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:20,480
30 where i think about a problem and

3080
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:22,158
kind of outlining for myself from

3081
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:23,519
scratch from not looking anything up

3082
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:27,359
just thinking about it

3083
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:29,040
using common sense and i think the

3084
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:30,960
practice of that is really important

3085
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:33,519
it's the daily routine of it

3086
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,399
it's the discipline of it it's not just

3087
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,040
that

3088
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:38,719
i figured something out from that

3089
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:42,719
thinking about gun control

3090
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:44,800
it's more that that muscle is built

3091
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:46,880
too it's that thinking muscle so i'm

3092
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:50,239
kind of interested in

3093
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,560
you know math has because especially

3094
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:52,479
because

3095
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,320
i've gotten specialized into machine

3096
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:55,198
learning and because i love programming

3097
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:58,319
so much

3098
01:38:55,198 --> 01:39:01,359
i've lost touch with math

3099
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:03,359
a little bit to where i feel

3100
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:04,960
quite sad about it and i want to fix

3101
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:07,118
that um

3102
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,960
even just not math like pure knowledge

3103
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:10,079
math but math like these middle school

3104
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:13,198
problems

3105
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:14,719
the challenges right um

3106
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:16,719
is that something you see a person be

3107
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,279
able to do every single day kind of just

3108
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:20,399
practice

3109
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:22,319
every single day for years so i can give

3110
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:23,759
an answer to that that gives a practical

3111
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:24,319
way you could do it assuming you have

3112
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,840
kids

3113
01:39:24,319 --> 01:39:27,840
so i

3114
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,840
i'm just saying this because i'm just

3115
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:32,559
thinking out loud right now like what

3116
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,159
could i do

3117
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,000
what could i do to suggest because what

3118
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:37,519
i have noticed is that for example if

3119
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,118
you do have kids who are in elementary

3120
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,520
school or middle school

3121
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:42,960
if you yourself go and look at those

3122
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,719
middle school math problems

3123
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:46,158
to think about interesting ways that you

3124
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:47,600
can teach your elementary school or

3125
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:49,039
middle school kid

3126
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,960
it works that's what my wife did she

3127
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:53,039
never did any of those contests before

3128
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,319
but now she knows quite a lot about that

3129
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:55,118
i didn't teach her anything i don't i

3130
01:39:54,319 --> 01:39:57,279
don't do that

3131
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:58,238
she just was messing around with them

3132
01:39:57,279 --> 01:40:00,399
and taught herself

3133
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:02,238
all of that stuff and that had the

3134
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:03,679
automatic daily i i'm always thinking

3135
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:04,879
how do you make it practical right yes

3136
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:06,960
and the way to make it practical

3137
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:08,639
is if the the timer on the automatically

3138
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,158
daily is that you are going to

3139
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,800
automatically daily do something with

3140
01:40:10,158 --> 01:40:13,599
your own kid

3141
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:15,039
yes now it feeds back okay and that

3142
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,400
includes the whole lesson that if you

3143
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:16,800
want to learn something you should teach

3144
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:19,198
it

3145
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:21,199
oh i strongly believe that yes i

3146
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:23,359
strongly believe

3147
01:40:21,198 --> 01:40:24,319
and that so i currently don't have kids

3148
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:25,920
so that's uh

3149
01:40:24,319 --> 01:40:27,599
maybe i should just get kids to help me

3150
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:30,800
with the math thing but

3151
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:32,239
outside of that i i do want to do great

3152
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,079
math into daily practice so

3153
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:35,359
i'll definitely take out uh i'll

3154
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:36,719
definitely check out the daily

3155
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:39,759
challenges and see

3156
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:41,039
because um what is it uh grant sanderson

3157
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:43,840
we talked about offline

3158
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:44,319
three blue one brown he he speaks to

3159
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,800
this

3160
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:48,319
as well that his videos aren't

3161
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,000
necessarily

3162
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:52,559
they don't speak to the thing that i'm

3163
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:56,238
referring to which is the daily practice

3164
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:58,639
they're more almost tools of inspiration

3165
01:40:56,238 --> 01:40:59,519
they kind of show you the beauty of a

3166
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:03,520
particular

3167
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:06,320
of problem in mathematics

3168
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,880
but they're not a daily ritual and i'm

3169
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:08,559
i'm in

3170
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,639
i'm in search of that daily ritual

3171
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,400
mathematics it's not it's not trivial to

3172
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:15,920
find

3173
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:18,319
um but uh i hope

3174
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:20,880
i hope to find that because i think math

3175
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:24,319
gives you a perspective on the world

3176
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,760
that enriches everything else so i like

3177
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:28,158
what you said about the daily also

3178
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:30,239
because that's also one reason why i put

3179
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:31,679
my carnegie mellon class online it's not

3180
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:33,198
every day it was every it's every other

3181
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:35,600
day semester is almost over

3182
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:37,439
but the idea was i guess my philosophy

3183
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,800
was if i'm already doing the class let's

3184
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:40,960
just like put it there right

3185
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,159
but i do know that there are people who

3186
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,158
have been following it

3187
01:41:42,158 --> 01:41:46,238
who are not in my class at all who have

3188
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:47,439
just been following it because yes it's

3189
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:49,839
combinatorics

3190
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:51,359
and the value of that is you could you

3191
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,639
don't really need to know calculus to

3192
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:54,000
follow it if that makes sense

3193
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,600
so it's actually something that people

3194
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,399
could follow so again and that one's

3195
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,960
free so

3196
01:41:56,399 --> 01:42:00,479
that was just there on youtube well

3197
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:03,198
speaking of combinatorics

3198
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:05,519
uh what is it what do you find

3199
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:08,719
interesting what do you find beautiful

3200
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,360
about combinatorics so combinatorics to

3201
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:13,039
me

3202
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:16,238
is is the study of things where

3203
01:42:13,039 --> 01:42:17,198
they might be more finite and more

3204
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:18,479
discreet

3205
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:19,919
what i mean is like if i look at a

3206
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:21,279
network actually a lot of times the

3207
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:22,880
combinatorics will boil down to

3208
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:24,479
something and the combinatorics i think

3209
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,639
about might be something related to

3210
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:28,718
graphs or networks and they're very

3211
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:31,279
discreet because if you have a node

3212
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,000
it's not that you have point seven of a

3213
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:33,359
node

3214
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,039
and point three of a node over there

3215
01:42:33,359 --> 01:42:37,359
it's like you got one node and then you

3216
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:38,960
jump one step to go to the next node

3217
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:40,719
so that that notion is different from

3218
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,880
say calculus which is very

3219
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:43,840
uh continuous where you go and say i

3220
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,239
have this

3221
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:47,600
speed which is changing over time and

3222
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:48,959
now what's the distance i've traveled

3223
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,560
that's the notion of an integral

3224
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:52,560
where you have to think of subdividing

3225
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,480
time into very very small pieces

3226
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,880
so the kinds of things that you do when

3227
01:42:54,479 --> 01:43:00,079
you reason about these

3228
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:03,199
finite discrete structures often might

3229
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:05,519
be iterative algorithmic inductive

3230
01:43:03,198 --> 01:43:07,118
these are ideas where i go from one step

3231
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,080
to the next step and so on and make

3232
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:10,399
progress

3233
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:11,198
i guess i actually personally like all

3234
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:12,879
kinds of math

3235
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:14,559
my area of research just ended up in

3236
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:17,039
here because

3237
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,920
i met a really interesting phd advisor

3238
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:18,960
potential that's

3239
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,960
actually that's honestly the reason i

3240
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,000
went into that direction i met a really

3241
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:24,000
interesting guy

3242
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,439
he seemed like he did good stuff

3243
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,560
interesting stuff and he looked like he

3244
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:28,079
cared about students

3245
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,920
and i said let me just go and learn

3246
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:32,399
whatever you do even though

3247
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:34,319
my prior practice and preparation before

3248
01:43:32,399 --> 01:43:35,039
my phd was not combinatorics but

3249
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:38,399
analysis

3250
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:39,519
the continuous stuff the the annoying

3251
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:42,559
thing about

3252
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:45,199
combinatorics and discrete stuff

3253
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,840
is uh it's often uh really difficult to

3254
01:43:45,198 --> 01:43:49,599
solve

3255
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:52,800
uh from a uh sort of uh uh running time

3256
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:58,320
complexity perspective

3257
01:43:52,800 --> 01:44:00,800
is there could you speak to the idea of

3258
01:43:58,319 --> 01:44:04,399
complexity analysis of problems do you

3259
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:07,039
find it useful to find it interesting

3260
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:08,158
do you do you find that lens of studying

3261
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:11,118
the difficulty

3262
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:12,479
of how difficult the computer science

3263
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:15,519
problem is

3264
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:16,158
a useful lens onto the world oh very

3265
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:19,679
much so

3266
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:21,519
because um if you want to make something

3267
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,639
practical which has large numbers of

3268
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:25,199
people using it

3269
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:27,118
the computational complexity to me is

3270
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:29,039
almost question one

3271
01:44:27,118 --> 01:44:30,399
and that's again that's at the origin of

3272
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:31,679
when we started doing this stuff with

3273
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:32,960
disease control

3274
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:34,239
from the very beginning the deep

3275
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,359
questions that were running through my

3276
01:44:34,238 --> 01:44:37,039
mind were

3277
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:38,399
would we be able to support a large

3278
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:41,760
population

3279
01:44:38,399 --> 01:44:42,559
with only one server and if the answer

3280
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,239
is no

3281
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:48,159
we can't start because i don't have

3282
01:44:44,238 --> 01:44:50,718
enough money

3283
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:52,479
yeah and there the question is very much

3284
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:55,520
you know linear time versus

3285
01:44:52,479 --> 01:44:58,718
anything uh

3286
01:44:55,520 --> 01:45:00,159
anything slower than linear time um it's

3287
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:01,760
a very specific thing you have a bunch

3288
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:02,079
of really interesting papers if i could

3289
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,360
ask

3290
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:06,079
maybe we could pull out some cool

3291
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:07,920
insights at the high level

3292
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:09,439
can you describe the data structure of a

3293
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,118
voting tree and

3294
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:13,678
what are some interesting results on it

3295
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:17,039
you have a paper that i noticed on it

3296
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:20,319
yeah so this is an example of i guess

3297
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:22,238
um how in math we might say here's an

3298
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:24,880
interesting kind of a question

3299
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:25,599
that we just can't seem to understand

3300
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,960
enough about

3301
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:30,079
maybe there's something else going on

3302
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:31,679
here and the way to describe this is

3303
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:33,279
you could imagine trying to hold

3304
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:35,199
elections where

3305
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:36,719
if you have only two candidates that's

3306
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:38,479
kind of easy you just run them against

3307
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:39,760
each other and see who gets more votes

3308
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:42,000
but as you know once you have more

3309
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,039
candidates it's very difficult to decide

3310
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,039
who wins the election

3311
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:46,319
and there's an entire like voting theory

3312
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:49,359
around this

3313
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:52,479
so a a theoretical question became

3314
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:55,439
what if you made a like a system of

3315
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:57,039
runoffs like a system of heads uh

3316
01:45:55,439 --> 01:45:58,879
head-to-head contests

3317
01:45:57,039 --> 01:46:00,079
which you structure like a tree almost

3318
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,000
looking like a circuit

3319
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:03,600
i'm using that way of thinking because

3320
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,960
it's sort of like a in

3321
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,199
electrical engineering or computer

3322
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,679
science you might imagine having a bunch

3323
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:09,759
of

3324
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:11,118
leads that carry signal which are going

3325
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,480
through and gates and or gains and

3326
01:46:11,118 --> 01:46:13,519
whatnot and you've managed to compute

3327
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:15,519
beautiful things

3328
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:17,360
this is just from a purely abstract

3329
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,480
point of view what if the inputs are

3330
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:20,799
candidates

3331
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:22,399
and for every two candidates it is known

3332
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,360
which of the candidates is more popular

3333
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:25,359
than the other

3334
01:46:23,359 --> 01:46:26,559
now can you build some kind of a circuit

3335
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:28,238
board which says

3336
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,480
first candidate number four will play

3337
01:46:28,238 --> 01:46:33,118
against five and see who wins

3338
01:46:30,479 --> 01:46:33,919
and so on okay so now what would be a

3339
01:46:33,118 --> 01:46:35,519
nice

3340
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:37,600
outcome right this is a general question

3341
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:39,040
of could i make a big circuit board to

3342
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,560
feed an election into

3343
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:42,079
like maybe one nice outcome would be

3344
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,199
whoever wins at least

3345
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:47,519
is preferred over a lot of people yes

3346
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:48,479
so for example if you ran in 1024

3347
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,400
candidates

3348
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:52,319
ideally we would like a guarantee that

3349
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:55,920
says that the winner

3350
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:57,599
beats a lot of people actually in any

3351
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,760
uh system where there are 1024

3352
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:01,600
candidates there's always a candidate

3353
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:04,000
who beats at least 512

3354
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:05,360
of the others this is a mathematical

3355
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,039
fact that there's actually always a

3356
01:47:05,359 --> 01:47:11,039
person who beats at least half

3357
01:47:07,039 --> 01:47:13,439
of the other people i'm trying to

3358
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:14,719
make sense of that mathematical fact is

3359
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:17,919
this supposed to be obvious

3360
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:20,480
uh no but i can explain it no no i can't

3361
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:21,359
the way it works is that think of it

3362
01:47:20,479 --> 01:47:23,519
this way

3363
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:25,279
every time i i think imagine i have all

3364
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,440
these candidates and everyone is

3365
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:29,198
competing is everyone is like compared

3366
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:30,879
with everyone else at some point

3367
01:47:29,198 --> 01:47:32,238
well think of it this way whenever

3368
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,279
there's a comparison

3369
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:37,519
somebody gets a point that's the one who

3370
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:38,719
is better than the other one my claim is

3371
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:41,840
there's somebody whose

3372
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:42,800
score is at least half of how many other

3373
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,679
people there are

3374
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:47,279
yeah i'm just trying to like my

3375
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:48,560
intuition is very close to that being

3376
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:51,599
true but it's beautiful

3377
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:52,159
i didn't at first that's not an obvious

3378
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,880
fact

3379
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:56,479
no it's not and it's it feels like a

3380
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:57,199
beautiful fact well let me explain it

3381
01:47:56,479 --> 01:48:00,479
this way

3382
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:02,399
imagine that for every uh match

3383
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:03,759
you didn't give one point but you gave

3384
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:06,000
two points

3385
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:07,280
you gave one point to each person now

3386
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,560
that's not what we're really doing we

3387
01:48:07,279 --> 01:48:10,719
really want to give one point to the

3388
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:12,480
winner of the match

3389
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:14,158
but instead we'll just give two if you

3390
01:48:12,479 --> 01:48:16,559
gave two points to everyone

3391
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:18,319
on every matchup actually everyone has

3392
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,920
the same number of points

3393
01:48:18,319 --> 01:48:22,399
and the number of points they get is how

3394
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:23,760
many other people there are

3395
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:25,279
does that sort of make sense i'm just

3396
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,239
like saying no no everything everything

3397
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:28,800
is same makes perfect

3398
01:48:26,238 --> 01:48:30,718
okay so the point is if for every

3399
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,560
comparison between two people

3400
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,399
which i'm doing for every two people i

3401
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:36,560
gave one point to each person

3402
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:38,479
your score everyone's score is the same

3403
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:40,639
it's how many other people there are yes

3404
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:41,519
now we only make one change for each

3405
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:44,400
match up

3406
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:46,960
you give one point only to the winner so

3407
01:48:44,399 --> 01:48:49,519
we're awarding half the points

3408
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:50,239
so now the deal is if in the original

3409
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,119
situation

3410
01:48:50,238 --> 01:48:54,799
everyone's score was equal which is how

3411
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:56,158
many other people there are

3412
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:58,480
now there's only half the number of

3413
01:48:56,158 --> 01:49:00,960
points to go around

3414
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:02,638
so what ends up happening is that

3415
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,639
there's always going to be like the

3416
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:06,159
average number of points per person

3417
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:07,840
is going to be half of how many other

3418
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:08,399
people there are and somebody is going

3419
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:10,800
to be above

3420
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:12,559
somebody's going to be at least average

3421
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,039
yeah this is this notion of expected

3422
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,639
value

3423
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:16,079
that if i have a random variable which

3424
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:17,840
has an expected value

3425
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:19,198
there's going to be some possibility in

3426
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,119
the probability space

3427
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:22,638
where you're at least as big as the

3428
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:23,679
expected yeah when you describe it like

3429
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:25,760
that it's obvious

3430
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:27,679
but when you're first saying in this

3431
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,079
little circuit that there's going to be

3432
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:32,079
one

3433
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:35,118
candidate better than uh than half

3434
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:38,319
that's not obvious yeah that's funny

3435
01:49:35,118 --> 01:49:39,118
math this is nice uh okay so do you have

3436
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:41,118
this but

3437
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:42,719
ultimately you want you're trying to

3438
01:49:41,118 --> 01:49:44,158
with the voting tree

3439
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:46,000
i don't know if you're trying this but

3440
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:49,039
uh to have a circuit that's

3441
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:52,719
that's like compressed that's small well

3442
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:55,920
that achieves the the achieves the

3443
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:56,480
the same kind of um i mean the smaller

3444
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:59,039
it is

3445
01:49:56,479 --> 01:50:00,799
the if we look at practically speaking

3446
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:01,439
the the lower the cost of running the

3447
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:03,039
election

3448
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:04,559
of running through of computing the

3449
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:06,639
circuit that is true

3450
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:08,159
but actually at this point the the

3451
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:11,599
reason the question was interesting

3452
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:12,799
yes is because the there was no good

3453
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:15,760
guarantee

3454
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,880
that the winner of that circuit would

3455
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,560
have

3456
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:20,719
like have beaten a lot of people let me

3457
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:22,320
give an example the best known circuit

3458
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:24,719
when we started thinking about this

3459
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:26,319
was the circuit called candidate one

3460
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:28,639
plays against candidate two

3461
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:30,399
candidate three plays against four and

3462
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:31,920
then the winners play against each other

3463
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:33,519
and then by the way five plays against

3464
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:34,719
six seven against eight

3465
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,320
the winners play against each other you

3466
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:38,158
understand it's like a giant binary tree

3467
01:50:36,319 --> 01:50:39,039
where yeah the binary like a balanced

3468
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:41,198
binary tree

3469
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:42,639
okay it's a balanced binary tree one two

3470
01:50:41,198 --> 01:50:44,079
three four up two thousand twenty four

3471
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:45,520
everyone going up to find the winner

3472
01:50:44,079 --> 01:50:48,559
beautiful well you know what

3473
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:49,679
there's a system in the world where it

3474
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,360
could just be

3475
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:53,520
that there's a candidate called number

3476
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:57,279
one that just beats

3477
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:58,159
like 10 other people just the 10 that

3478
01:50:57,279 --> 01:51:00,399
they need to be

3479
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:02,158
on their way up and they lose to

3480
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:03,759
everyone else

3481
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:05,359
but somehow they would get all the way

3482
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:08,880
up yes my point is

3483
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:12,000
it is possible to outsmart

3484
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:14,319
that circuit in one

3485
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,920
weird way of the world which makes that

3486
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:17,599
circuit a bad one because you want to

3487
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,880
say i will use this circuit for all

3488
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:21,119
elections

3489
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:22,400
and you might have a system of inputs

3490
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:24,399
that go in there

3491
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:25,679
where the winner only beat 10 other

3492
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:26,638
people which is the people they had to

3493
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,000
beat on the way up

3494
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:31,118
so you want to have a circuit where

3495
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:34,158
there's as many like the final result

3496
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:37,039
is as strong as possible yes

3497
01:51:34,158 --> 01:51:37,359
and so what what ideas do you have for

3498
01:51:37,039 --> 01:51:40,000
that

3499
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:41,679
so um we actually only managed to

3500
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,079
improve it to square root of n

3501
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:46,000
so if n is the number of vertices n over

3502
01:51:44,079 --> 01:51:47,519
two would be the ideal

3503
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,118
we got it to and we got the square root

3504
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:52,320
of n versus

3505
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:54,559
log base two yeah exactly yeah

3506
01:51:52,319 --> 01:51:55,759
which is well that is happening it could

3507
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,840
be a lot

3508
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,960
yeah it could be a big improvement so

3509
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,119
that's uh okay cool

3510
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,000
is there something you can say with

3511
01:52:01,118 --> 01:52:04,639
words about what

3512
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,520
kind of circuit what that looks like i

3513
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:08,079
can give an

3514
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,679
idea of one of the tools inside yeah but

3515
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:10,399
the actual execution ends up being more

3516
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:13,679
complicated

3517
01:52:10,399 --> 01:52:16,079
but one of the widgets inside this is

3518
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:16,880
building a system where you have like a

3519
01:52:16,079 --> 01:52:19,760
candidate

3520
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:21,279
who plays like the one part of the whole

3521
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:23,280
huge huge tree is that

3522
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:24,800
that same candidate let's column seven

3523
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:26,399
seven plays against

3524
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,440
somebody let's let's pick up some

3525
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:30,638
numbers let's call the others like

3526
01:52:27,439 --> 01:52:32,158
letters so seven plays against a

3527
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:34,639
seven is also going to play against b

3528
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:36,479
separately and the winners of each of

3529
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:38,400
those will play each other

3530
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:39,519
by the way seven's also going to play c

3531
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:40,638
seven's going to play d

3532
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,840
and the winners are going to play each

3533
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:43,199
other and the winners are going to play

3534
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:45,599
each other we call this

3535
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:47,598
seven against all well seven against

3536
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:49,520
like everyone from a bunch of

3537
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:50,719
got it so there's some nice overlap

3538
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:52,800
between the matchups

3539
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:53,840
yeah that somehow has a nice feature to

3540
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:55,679
it yes and i can tell you the nice

3541
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:56,560
feature because if at the base of this

3542
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:57,920
giant tree

3543
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,360
at the base of this giant circuit like

3544
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:00,480
this is a widget you rebuild the things

3545
01:52:59,359 --> 01:53:01,279
out of widgets so i'm just describing

3546
01:53:00,479 --> 01:53:03,678
one widget

3547
01:53:01,279 --> 01:53:05,118
but in the base of this widget you have

3548
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:06,639
lots of things which are seven against

3549
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:07,839
someone seven against someone seven

3550
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:10,239
against someone in fact

3551
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:11,440
every match up at the bottom is seven

3552
01:53:10,238 --> 01:53:14,479
against someone

3553
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:17,439
what that means is

3554
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:19,198
if 7 actually beat everyone they were

3555
01:53:17,439 --> 01:53:20,238
matched up against well 7 would rise to

3556
01:53:19,198 --> 01:53:22,799
the top

3557
01:53:20,238 --> 01:53:23,839
so one possibility is if you see a 7

3558
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:25,760
emerge from the top

3559
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,360
you know that 7 actually beat every one

3560
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:29,119
they were against

3561
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:30,719
on the other hand if anyone else is on

3562
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:33,439
top let's call it

3563
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:34,880
f if f is on top how did f get there

3564
01:53:33,439 --> 01:53:36,238
well f beats seven on the way at the

3565
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,159
beginning

3566
01:53:36,238 --> 01:53:40,079
so the point is the outcome of this

3567
01:53:38,158 --> 01:53:41,759
circuit has a certain property

3568
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:43,840
if you see a seven you know that the

3569
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:45,599
seven actually be the brazilian people

3570
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:46,960
if you see anyone else at least you know

3571
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:48,880
they beat seven

3572
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,800
yeah then you can prove that it has a

3573
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:54,000
nice property that's really interesting

3574
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:55,840
is there something you can say

3575
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,118
perhaps going completely outside of what

3576
01:53:55,840 --> 01:54:00,800
we're talking about is

3577
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:04,479
uh how we may um

3578
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:07,440
have mathematical ideas of improving

3579
01:54:04,479 --> 01:54:08,959
the electoral process that one no no i

3580
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:11,118
can't give you that one

3581
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:13,279
i mean is there like do you ever see it

3582
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:15,759
as um

3583
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:17,359
as as there be do you see is there being

3584
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:20,400
a lot of opportunities

3585
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:23,039
for improving how we vote uh

3586
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:24,719
like from your i i don't know if you saw

3587
01:54:23,039 --> 01:54:27,039
parallels but

3588
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:28,000
you know it seems like if this actually

3589
01:54:27,039 --> 01:54:30,319
kind of maps to your

3590
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,520
sort of covid work which is there's a

3591
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:33,920
network effect

3592
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:35,520
right it seems like we should be able to

3593
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:38,800
apply similar kind of effects

3594
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:39,360
of how we decide other things in our

3595
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:42,079
lives

3596
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:44,319
and and one of the big decisions we make

3597
01:54:42,079 --> 01:54:45,359
is who represents us in government

3598
01:54:44,319 --> 01:54:47,198
do you ever think about like

3599
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:48,079
mathematically about those kinds of

3600
01:54:47,198 --> 01:54:50,000
systems

3601
01:54:48,079 --> 01:54:51,359
i think a little bit about those because

3602
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,039
where i went to college

3603
01:54:51,359 --> 01:54:54,719
the way we voted for student government

3604
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:56,238
was based on this

3605
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:58,480
is it called ranked choice where you're

3606
01:54:56,238 --> 01:55:01,279
eliminated you eliminate the bottom

3607
01:54:58,479 --> 01:55:02,718
and there's runoff elections so so i

3608
01:55:01,279 --> 01:55:04,079
that was the first time i ever saw that

3609
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:06,239
and i thought that made sense

3610
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:07,760
yeah the only problem is it doesn't seem

3611
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:09,678
so easy to get something that makes

3612
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,760
sense adopted as the new voting system

3613
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:13,760
that's a whole nother there's that's not

3614
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,679
a math solution that's uh

3615
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,719
well it's math and sentences game

3616
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:18,399
theories you have to come up with

3617
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:19,840
incentive it's mechanism design you have

3618
01:55:18,399 --> 01:55:23,839
to figure out how to

3619
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:27,119
trick us despite our basic human nature

3620
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:28,880
uh to adopt uh solutions that are better

3621
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:30,399
yeah that's a whole other conversation i

3622
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:32,239
think um

3623
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:34,158
can you just because it sounded really

3624
01:55:32,238 --> 01:55:36,079
cool uh talk a little bit about

3625
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:39,359
stochastic coalescence

3626
01:55:36,079 --> 01:55:41,039
and uh you have a paper on showing that

3627
01:55:39,359 --> 01:55:43,279
something you describe what it is but i

3628
01:55:41,039 --> 01:55:45,439
guess it's a super linear

3629
01:55:43,279 --> 01:55:46,800
super logarithmic time and you came up

3630
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:47,598
with some kind of trick to make it

3631
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,960
faster

3632
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:50,719
just can you just talk about it a little

3633
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:51,520
bit yeah so this was something which

3634
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:53,359
came up

3635
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:55,840
when i was at microsoft research for a

3636
01:55:53,359 --> 01:55:57,679
summer and that i'm putting that context

3637
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,960
because that shows that it has some

3638
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:02,158
practical motivation at some point

3639
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,840
actually i think it still it doesn't

3640
01:56:02,158 --> 01:56:05,519
need to yeah it doesn't need to it could

3641
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,279
be beautiful and it's all right yeah

3642
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:08,960
so the easiest way to describe this is

3643
01:56:07,279 --> 01:56:09,840
suppose you got like a big crowd of

3644
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:11,760
people

3645
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,199
and everybody knows how many hours of

3646
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,480
sleep they got last night

3647
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:16,399
and you want to know how many total

3648
01:56:14,479 --> 01:56:18,238
hours of sleep were gotten by this big

3649
01:56:16,399 --> 01:56:19,920
big crowd of people at the beginning you

3650
01:56:18,238 --> 01:56:20,638
might say that sounds like a linear time

3651
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:22,639
algorithm

3652
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:24,159
of saying hey you how many hours you got

3653
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:25,440
how many you got how many you got add

3654
01:56:24,158 --> 01:56:27,198
add add yes

3655
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:28,879
but there's a way to do this if you

3656
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:30,319
remember that there are people and they

3657
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:32,079
presumably know how to add

3658
01:56:30,319 --> 01:56:33,359
you could make a distributed algorithm

3659
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:34,719
to make this happen

3660
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:38,479
for example while we're thinking of

3661
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:40,480
these trees imagine you had 1024 people

3662
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:42,638
if you could just say hey person number

3663
01:56:40,479 --> 01:56:44,799
one and person number two you will add

3664
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:46,079
your hours of sleep

3665
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,360
person number two will go away and

3666
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:48,319
person number one is going to remember

3667
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:51,359
the sum

3668
01:56:48,319 --> 01:56:53,599
person three and four add up and person

3669
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:55,359
three takes charge of remembering it

3670
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:56,880
person four goes away now this like

3671
01:56:55,359 --> 01:56:58,158
person one knows the sum of these two

3672
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,800
person three knows some of those two

3673
01:56:58,158 --> 01:57:00,238
they talk

3674
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,159
you see what i mean it's like you're

3675
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:03,359
going up this tree

3676
01:57:02,158 --> 01:57:05,118
same tree that we've talked about

3677
01:57:03,359 --> 01:57:05,839
earlier built up a tree from the bottom

3678
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:07,519
up

3679
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:09,119
yeah build a retreat from the bottom up

3680
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:11,280
and the beautiful thing is

3681
01:57:09,118 --> 01:57:12,880
since everyone's doing stuff in parallel

3682
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:15,279
the amount of time it takes

3683
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:17,279
to get the total sum is actually just

3684
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:20,000
the number of layers in the tree

3685
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:21,840
which is 10. so now that's logarithmic

3686
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,719
time to add up the number of hours

3687
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:25,119
that people slept today sounds fantastic

3688
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:26,560
yeah

3689
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:28,079
there's only one problem how do you

3690
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:29,679
decide who's person number one and

3691
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:31,760
person number two

3692
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:33,279
yes so if for example you just went out

3693
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,000
into the downtown and said hey get these

3694
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:36,000
thousand people

3695
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,359
go well if you're gonna go and say and

3696
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,719
by the way you're one and you're two and

3697
01:57:37,359 --> 01:57:41,118
you're three that's linear time

3698
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:42,960
yes that's cheating so now the question

3699
01:57:41,118 --> 01:57:44,719
is how to do this in a distributed way

3700
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,198
and there were some people who proposed

3701
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:48,960
a very elegant algorithm

3702
01:57:47,198 --> 01:57:50,559
and they wanted to analyze it that's so

3703
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:52,719
i came in onto the analyze side

3704
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:54,000
but the elegant algorithm was like this

3705
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:56,880
it was like well

3706
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,719
we don't actually know what this big nut

3707
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:00,960
big tree is there isn't any big tree

3708
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:02,319
so what's going to happen is first

3709
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:05,198
everyone is going to

3710
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:05,599
decide right now oh what one important

3711
01:58:05,198 --> 01:58:07,359
thing

3712
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:08,719
everyone is going to at the very

3713
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:11,359
beginning of the whole

3714
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:13,279
game uh they will have delegated

3715
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:16,319
responsibility to themselves

3716
01:58:13,279 --> 01:58:18,238
as the one who knows the sum so far

3717
01:58:16,319 --> 01:58:20,079
so so the point is there's there's going

3718
01:58:18,238 --> 01:58:21,678
to be people are all going to have like

3719
01:58:20,079 --> 01:58:24,479
a pointer which says

3720
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:26,560
uh you are the one who knows my you

3721
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:29,359
you've taken care of my ticket my number

3722
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,840
yeah okay they select the representative

3723
01:58:29,359 --> 01:58:31,679
for this

3724
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:32,800
particular piece of knowledge and at the

3725
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:33,520
very beginning you're your own

3726
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,119
representative

3727
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:37,040
the thing has to start simple right so

3728
01:58:35,118 --> 01:58:38,000
at the beginning you're pointing to

3729
01:58:37,039 --> 01:58:40,238
yourself you've got it

3730
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,319
yep and and how the way this works is

3731
01:58:40,238 --> 01:58:44,238
that at every time step someone blares a

3732
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:46,319
ding dong on the on the on the

3733
01:58:44,238 --> 01:58:48,638
tongue clock or whatever yes and each

3734
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:51,679
person flips a coin themselves to decide

3735
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:54,400
am i going to hunt for somebody to

3736
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:55,118
give my number to and let them represent

3737
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:57,279
me

3738
01:58:55,118 --> 01:58:58,880
or am i going to sit here and wait for

3739
01:58:57,279 --> 01:59:02,559
someone to come

3740
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:04,000
okay okay well they they flip their coin

3741
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:06,080
some of the people start asking other

3742
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:09,039
people saying hey i would like

3743
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:10,079
you to be um my representative here is

3744
01:59:09,039 --> 01:59:11,439
my number

3745
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:12,800
but the problem is that there's limited

3746
01:59:11,439 --> 01:59:14,000
bandwidth of the people who are getting

3747
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:16,000
asked it's like you can't

3748
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,760
get you can't go out to prom with five

3749
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,039
people this is not what we're doing

3750
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,800
we're adding numbers okay

3751
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:22,479
but you can only add one number yeah so

3752
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,840
the person who has suddenly gotten asked

3753
01:59:22,479 --> 01:59:25,439
by all these people

3754
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:27,199
well they'll have to decide who they're

3755
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:29,519
going to take it from

3756
01:59:27,198 --> 01:59:31,198
and they randomly just choose one when

3757
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:32,400
they randomly choose one all the others

3758
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:34,319
are rejected and they

3759
01:59:32,399 --> 01:59:35,839
don't get to delegate anything in that

3760
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:38,079
round but now if

3761
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,119
this person has absorbed this one who

3762
01:59:38,079 --> 01:59:41,118
said okay here

3763
01:59:39,118 --> 01:59:42,559
you take charge of my number this person

3764
01:59:41,118 --> 01:59:45,439
now updates their pointer

3765
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:47,599
you're you're in charge and this person

3766
01:59:45,439 --> 01:59:50,399
adds the two numbers

3767
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:51,119
that was the first round in the next

3768
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:52,960
round

3769
01:59:51,118 --> 01:59:54,479
when they do the coin flipping this

3770
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:56,079
person doesn't flip anymore because

3771
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:58,319
they're just delegating

3772
01:59:56,079 --> 01:59:59,760
it's that anyone who has the pointers

3773
01:59:58,319 --> 02:00:01,920
themselves that's a

3774
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,199
like a person who is in charge of some

3775
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:04,960
number of informations

3776
02:00:03,198 --> 02:00:06,719
they flip the coin to decide should i

3777
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:09,279
find other people who are

3778
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:10,079
agents or should i wait for people to

3779
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:12,479
ask me

3780
02:00:10,079 --> 02:00:14,479
yes brilliant this is somebody else's

3781
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:16,000
idea and and now the idea is okay if you

3782
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:16,799
just keep doing this process what ends

3783
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,960
up happening

3784
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:20,400
oh yeah oh and also by the way if you

3785
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,679
decide that you want to go reach out to

3786
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:23,039
other people here's the here's the

3787
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:24,639
here's the here's the catch

3788
02:00:23,039 --> 02:00:27,359
when you're one of these agents saying

3789
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:29,599
okay i'm going to go look for someone

3790
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:30,639
you have no idea who in this crowd is an

3791
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:32,719
agent

3792
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:35,520
or somebody who delegated it to someone

3793
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:37,279
else you just pick a random person

3794
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:39,360
when you pick the random person if it

3795
02:00:37,279 --> 02:00:41,759
lands on someone and the person says oh

3796
02:00:39,359 --> 02:00:42,559
i i actually delegated it to someone

3797
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,480
then you

3798
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:46,239
you you follow up you walk through the

3799
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:46,959
delegation chat up delegation chain and

3800
02:00:46,238 --> 02:00:49,039
you can do

3801
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:50,719
like path compression in the algorithm

3802
02:00:49,039 --> 02:00:51,920
to make it so you don't consistently do

3803
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:53,920
lots of walking up

3804
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:55,279
but the bottom line is that what ends up

3805
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:57,679
happening is that

3806
02:00:55,279 --> 02:00:59,039
you end up reaching out whenever you're

3807
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:01,199
one of the ones reaching out

3808
02:00:59,039 --> 02:01:03,279
you can think of it as each agent is

3809
02:01:01,198 --> 02:01:04,879
responsible for some number of people

3810
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:07,118
it's almost like they're the leader of a

3811
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:10,800
bunch as the process is evolving

3812
02:01:07,118 --> 02:01:13,279
you have these lumps each lump has an

3813
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:14,639
agent and when the agent reaches out

3814
02:01:13,279 --> 02:01:17,039
they reach out to another

3815
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:18,159
lump where the probability of them

3816
02:01:17,039 --> 02:01:21,279
hitting that lump

3817
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:24,079
is proportional to the size of the lump

3818
02:01:21,279 --> 02:01:24,479
yeah that is the one funny thing about

3819
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:27,198
this

3820
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:29,198
process this is not that they can reach

3821
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:30,879
out to a uniformly random lump

3822
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:32,399
where every lump has the same chance of

3823
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:35,440
going to yeah

3824
02:01:32,399 --> 02:01:37,920
the bigger the lump is the less like

3825
02:01:35,439 --> 02:01:40,079
the more likely it is that you end up

3826
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:41,520
reaching that lamp which is a problem

3827
02:01:40,079 --> 02:01:43,599
let me explain why that's a problem

3828
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:45,440
because you see you're hoping that this

3829
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:47,679
has a small number of steps yeah but

3830
02:01:45,439 --> 02:01:50,638
here's a bad situation that could happen

3831
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:52,000
imagine if you had like their end people

3832
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:54,159
that you're adding up

3833
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:55,679
imagine that you have exactly square

3834
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:59,279
root of n

3835
02:01:55,679 --> 02:02:01,359
lumps left of which

3836
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:02,399
almost all of them are just one person

3837
02:02:01,359 --> 02:02:04,639
who's still their own

3838
02:02:02,399 --> 02:02:06,000
boss their own their own manager except

3839
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:07,199
one giant one giant one

3840
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,118
now what's going to happen is going to

3841
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:10,960
be a huge bottleneck because every round

3842
02:02:09,118 --> 02:02:11,359
the giant one can only absorb one of the

3843
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:13,760
others

3844
02:02:11,359 --> 02:02:15,679
yes and now you suddenly have time which

3845
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:17,360
is about square root of n

3846
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:19,279
the square root of n is chosen because

3847
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:21,759
that is one where the

3848
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:23,519
the lumps are such that um you really

3849
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:26,079
are limited by this large one

3850
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:28,080
slowly sucking up the rest of them so

3851
02:02:26,079 --> 02:02:30,399
the the heart of the question became

3852
02:02:28,079 --> 02:02:32,639
well but is that just so unusual that we

3853
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:34,559
don't that it doesn't usually happen

3854
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:36,560
because remember you start with everyone

3855
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:38,239
just being independent it's like a lot

3856
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,599
of lumps of size well how naturally do

3857
02:02:38,238 --> 02:02:41,759
the big lumps emerge

3858
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:43,679
yes and so what that part of the proof

3859
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,960
was was showing that that was a joint

3860
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:48,399
work with al lubetsky

3861
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:49,920
that one was showing that actually

3862
02:02:48,399 --> 02:02:51,920
in that thing the lumps do kind of get

3863
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:54,560
out of whack and so it's not

3864
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:56,639
the purely logarithmic number of steps

3865
02:02:54,560 --> 02:03:00,320
but if you make one very slight change

3866
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:02,319
which is if you are one of the agents

3867
02:03:00,319 --> 02:03:03,599
and you have just been propositioned

3868
02:03:02,319 --> 02:03:05,599
possibly relayed along

3869
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:07,599
by a couple of different people if you

3870
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:12,159
just say don't take a random one

3871
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:12,159
but accept the smallest lump

3872
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:15,599
that actually does enough to even

3873
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:17,599
distribute the lump size

3874
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:19,039
yeah that's i mean yeah it's fascinating

3875
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:19,599
how would the distributed algorithms a

3876
02:03:19,039 --> 02:03:22,399
little

3877
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:23,039
yes make all the difference in the world

3878
02:03:22,399 --> 02:03:25,439
yeah

3879
02:03:23,039 --> 02:03:27,439
actually by the way this does this back

3880
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:29,359
to our voting conversation this makes me

3881
02:03:27,439 --> 02:03:30,799
think of like

3882
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:32,399
these networking systems are so

3883
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:35,199
fascinating to study

3884
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:36,000
they immediately spring to mind ideas of

3885
02:03:35,198 --> 02:03:39,118
how to have

3886
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:42,158
representation like i maybe

3887
02:03:39,118 --> 02:03:45,598
as opposed to me voting for a president

3888
02:03:42,158 --> 02:03:48,879
i want to vote for for like uh

3889
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:50,560
for you paul to represent me maybe on a

3890
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:52,480
particular issue

3891
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:54,079
and then you'll delegate that further

3892
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:55,039
and then we naturally construct those

3893
02:03:54,078 --> 02:03:58,000
kinds of networks

3894
02:03:55,039 --> 02:03:59,519
because that that feels like i can have

3895
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,800
a good conversation with you and figure

3896
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:02,079
out that you know what you're doing and

3897
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:04,560
i can delegate it to you and

3898
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:05,439
in that way construct a representative

3899
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:08,719
government

3900
02:04:05,439 --> 02:04:09,279
or representative decision maker that

3901
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:11,359
feels

3902
02:04:09,279 --> 02:04:12,399
that feels really nice as opposed to

3903
02:04:11,359 --> 02:04:14,559
like us

3904
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:16,879
like a tree of height one or something

3905
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:19,520
where it's like everybody's just

3906
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:21,840
um it feels like there's a lot of room

3907
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:23,679
for layers of representation to form

3908
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:25,279
organically from the bottom up

3909
02:04:23,679 --> 02:04:26,480
i wonder if there are systems like that

3910
02:04:25,279 --> 02:04:27,039
this is the cool thing about the

3911
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:28,479
internet

3912
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:30,560
and the digital space where we're so

3913
02:04:28,479 --> 02:04:33,279
well connected just like with

3914
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:34,960
the novid app to to distribute

3915
02:04:33,279 --> 02:04:37,359
information about the

3916
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:38,000
the the spread of the disease we can the

3917
02:04:37,359 --> 02:04:40,880
same way

3918
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:42,880
in a distributed sense form anything

3919
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:46,000
like

3920
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:49,199
any kind of knowledge bases that are

3921
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:52,158
formed in a decentralized way and

3922
02:04:49,198 --> 02:04:53,598
uh in a hierarchical way as opposed to

3923
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:56,000
sort of

3924
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:56,880
old way where there's no mechanism for

3925
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,800
large scale

3926
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:01,599
fast uh like distributed transactional

3927
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,039
information

3928
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:06,800
this is really interesting this is where

3929
02:05:03,039 --> 02:05:09,840
almost like network graph theory

3930
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:11,360
becomes practical yeah most of that

3931
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:12,880
exciting work was done in the 20th

3932
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:14,799
century but most of the application will

3933
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:15,599
be in the 21st which is cool to think

3934
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:17,199
about

3935
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:21,199
uh let me ask the most ridiculous

3936
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:25,359
question you think p equals np wow

3937
02:05:21,198 --> 02:05:25,359
i don't know i mean i would say

3938
02:05:26,479 --> 02:05:30,238
i i know there are enough people who

3939
02:05:28,158 --> 02:05:33,118
have very strong interest in trying to

3940
02:05:30,238 --> 02:05:36,479
show that it is i'm talking about

3941
02:05:33,118 --> 02:05:36,479
government agencies

3942
02:05:37,279 --> 02:05:40,399
for security purposes for security

3943
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:43,199
purposes and most computer scientists

3944
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:45,679
which would say believe that p equals np

3945
02:05:43,198 --> 02:05:47,198
uh my question almost like this is back

3946
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:48,399
to our aliens discussion you want to

3947
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:51,839
think outside the box

3948
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:54,479
the the low probability event

3949
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:56,880
what is the world what kind of

3950
02:05:54,479 --> 02:06:01,598
discoveries would lead us to

3951
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:03,319
to to prove that p does not equal to np

3952
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:05,440
like there could be giant

3953
02:06:03,319 --> 02:06:07,599
misunderstandings

3954
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:09,118
or gaps in our knowledge about computer

3955
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:10,880
science about theoretical computer

3956
02:06:09,118 --> 02:06:13,519
science about computation

3957
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:14,719
which allow us to think like flatten all

3958
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:16,719
problems

3959
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:18,078
yeah so i don't know the answer to this

3960
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:18,880
question i think i think it's very

3961
02:06:18,078 --> 02:06:21,359
interesting but i

3962
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:22,800
actually i know let's put it this way by

3963
02:06:21,359 --> 02:06:24,078
being at carnegie mellon and being

3964
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,800
around the theoretical computer

3965
02:06:24,078 --> 02:06:26,479
scientists

3966
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:28,719
i know enough about what i don't know

3967
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:30,399
what to say i'm wrong to be humble

3968
02:06:28,719 --> 02:06:32,319
i'm the only person to answer this

3969
02:06:30,399 --> 02:06:34,238
question yeah yeah

3970
02:06:32,319 --> 02:06:35,519
it's a great one well scott aaronson

3971
02:06:34,238 --> 02:06:38,158
who's now here ut

3972
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:39,920
austin he used to be at mit puts the

3973
02:06:38,158 --> 02:06:42,839
probability of uh

3974
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:44,399
p and p not equals to np at three

3975
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,719
percent

3976
02:06:44,399 --> 02:06:48,000
he put it's i you know i always love it

3977
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:50,399
when you ask

3978
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,679
it's very rare in science in in

3979
02:06:50,399 --> 02:06:54,799
academics because you're

3980
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:56,880
because most folks are humble

3981
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:59,360
in in the face of the mystery the

3982
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:01,279
uncertainty of everything around us

3983
02:06:59,359 --> 02:07:02,799
to have the the both the humor and the

3984
02:07:01,279 --> 02:07:05,759
guts to say um

3985
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:07,920
like what are the chance that there's um

3986
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:09,280
aliens in our galaxy intelligent alien

3987
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:10,719
civilizations

3988
02:07:09,279 --> 02:07:12,238
as opposed to saying i don't know it

3989
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:13,599
could be you know it could be zero it

3990
02:07:12,238 --> 02:07:14,559
could be depending on the fact you're

3991
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:18,239
saying

3992
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:20,239
it's 2.5 percent there's something very

3993
02:07:18,238 --> 02:07:24,238
pleasant about just having uh

3994
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:25,839
it's the it's the number thing um

3995
02:07:24,238 --> 02:07:27,839
this power to the number it's just like

3996
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:29,520
42 it's like why 40 i don't know but

3997
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:31,440
it's a powerful number

3998
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:33,440
and then everything this is the power of

3999
02:07:31,439 --> 02:07:36,399
human psychology is once you have the

4000
02:07:33,439 --> 02:07:36,399
number 42

4001
02:07:36,479 --> 02:07:40,158
it's not that the number has meaning but

4002
02:07:39,439 --> 02:07:43,279
because

4003
02:07:40,158 --> 02:07:43,839
it's placed in a book with humor around

4004
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:47,519
it

4005
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:50,639
it has the meme effect of actually

4006
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:53,440
creating reality i mean you could say

4007
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:56,480
that 42 has a strong contribution

4008
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:58,638
of helping us colonize mars because

4009
02:07:56,479 --> 02:08:00,399
it created it gave the whatever

4010
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:02,800
existential crisis to many of us

4011
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:04,319
including elon musk when he was young

4012
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:06,320
you know reading a book like that and

4013
02:08:04,319 --> 02:08:06,960
then like now 42 is not part of his

4014
02:08:06,319 --> 02:08:09,198
humor

4015
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:11,198
he doesn't shut up about constantly

4016
02:08:09,198 --> 02:08:12,158
joking about and that humor is spreading

4017
02:08:11,198 --> 02:08:14,158
through our minds

4018
02:08:12,158 --> 02:08:16,078
and somehow this like silly number just

4019
02:08:14,158 --> 02:08:17,679
had an effect in that same way

4020
02:08:16,078 --> 02:08:19,279
after scott told me like the three

4021
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:21,199
percent chance

4022
02:08:19,279 --> 02:08:23,118
it's stuck in my head and i think it's

4023
02:08:21,198 --> 02:08:23,598
been having a ripple effect in everybody

4024
02:08:23,118 --> 02:08:29,118
else

4025
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:30,960
the believing that p is not equal to np

4026
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:32,158
scott almost as a joke saying it's three

4027
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:34,000
percent

4028
02:08:32,158 --> 02:08:35,920
is make it's actually motivating a large

4029
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,960
number of researchers to work on it

4030
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:38,560
three percent is high

4031
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:41,198
it's very high because for the potential

4032
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:43,440
impact that that would happen

4033
02:08:41,198 --> 02:08:45,198
but then three percent is not that high

4034
02:08:43,439 --> 02:08:46,799
because it's only you know it's

4035
02:08:45,198 --> 02:08:48,479
like we're not very good i feel like

4036
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:49,119
humans are only able to really think

4037
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:52,399
about like

4038
02:08:49,118 --> 02:08:54,960
one percent 50 and we kind of

4039
02:08:52,399 --> 02:08:57,118
i think a lot of people around three

4040
02:08:54,960 --> 02:09:00,078
percent up to 50 percent

4041
02:08:57,118 --> 02:09:00,559
like in our minds like three percent i

4042
02:09:00,078 --> 02:09:02,639
think

4043
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:04,719
it could happen it could happen and it

4044
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:06,960
could happen is like yeah

4045
02:09:04,719 --> 02:09:08,399
like half the time it'll probably happen

4046
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:10,239
so we're not very good at that that's

4047
02:09:08,399 --> 02:09:13,598
that's the other thing with the pandemic

4048
02:09:10,238 --> 02:09:16,839
is uh we're not the exponential growth

4049
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:20,078
that we also talked about offline uh is

4050
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:22,560
uh something that we can't quite intuit

4051
02:09:20,078 --> 02:09:24,158
and that's something we probably should

4052
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:26,560
if we were to predict the future to

4053
02:09:24,158 --> 02:09:28,559
anticipate the future and to understand

4054
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:32,239
how to create technologies that'll let

4055
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:34,639
us sort of control the future

4056
02:09:32,238 --> 02:09:37,198
can i ask you for some recommendations

4057
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:40,400
uh maybe for books or movies

4058
02:09:37,198 --> 02:09:45,279
in your life long ago

4059
02:09:40,399 --> 02:09:45,279
when you were baby po or today

4060
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:49,039
that uh you found insightful or you

4061
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:50,638
learned

4062
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:52,479
you learned a lot from what you would

4063
02:09:50,639 --> 02:09:55,118
recommend to others yeah

4064
02:09:52,479 --> 02:09:57,118
so i think i don't necessarily have an

4065
02:09:55,118 --> 02:10:00,639
exact name of these old things but

4066
02:09:57,118 --> 02:10:03,679
i was generally inspired by stories

4067
02:10:00,639 --> 02:10:06,319
true or fictional of

4068
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:07,760
campaigns or you know like for example

4069
02:10:06,319 --> 02:10:08,479
like the lord of the rings that's the

4070
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:10,320
content

4071
02:10:08,479 --> 02:10:12,399
right but yes the thing that always

4072
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:15,198
inspired me was

4073
02:10:12,399 --> 02:10:16,399
it could be possible for somebody who's

4074
02:10:15,198 --> 02:10:18,078
crazy enough

4075
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:19,839
to go up against adversity after

4076
02:10:18,078 --> 02:10:22,719
adversity after adversity

4077
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:23,360
and it succeeds i mean those are false

4078
02:10:22,719 --> 02:10:24,719
those are

4079
02:10:23,359 --> 02:10:26,479
fictitious but i also spent a lot of

4080
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:28,239
time i guess reading about i don't know

4081
02:10:26,479 --> 02:10:30,238
i was interested somehow in like

4082
02:10:28,238 --> 02:10:31,678
world war ii history for whatever reason

4083
02:10:30,238 --> 02:10:32,399
that's a campaign which is much more

4084
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:35,599
brutal

4085
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:39,039
but nevertheless the idea of

4086
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:39,520
difficulty strategy uh fighting even

4087
02:10:39,039 --> 02:10:41,279
when

4088
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:43,119
things that in that case was really

4089
02:10:41,279 --> 02:10:44,559
fighting but just pushing on even when

4090
02:10:43,118 --> 02:10:46,479
things are difficult

4091
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:48,639
i guess these are these are the kinds of

4092
02:10:46,479 --> 02:10:51,439
general stories that

4093
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:52,078
made me i guess want to work on things

4094
02:10:51,439 --> 02:10:55,519
that would be

4095
02:10:52,078 --> 02:10:57,039
hard and where it could be a campaign

4096
02:10:55,520 --> 02:11:00,719
it could be that you work on something

4097
02:10:57,039 --> 02:11:03,279
for a year multiple years

4098
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:04,719
because that was the point yeah it

4099
02:11:03,279 --> 02:11:06,238
starts with a single person

4100
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:07,840
that that's that's the interesting thing

4101
02:11:06,238 --> 02:11:09,678
i've obviously been

4102
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:11,760
don't shut up about it recently about

4103
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:13,199
world war ii especially on the hitler

4104
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:15,199
side and the stalin side

4105
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:17,839
some of that has really affected my own

4106
02:11:15,198 --> 02:11:18,559
family the the roots of my family very

4107
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:22,560
much

4108
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:25,440
but it's interesting to think um

4109
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:26,800
that it was just an idea and one person

4110
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:29,439
decided to do stuff

4111
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:29,840
and it just builds and builds and builds

4112
02:11:29,439 --> 02:11:31,279
and

4113
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:33,199
you can truly have an impact on the

4114
02:11:31,279 --> 02:11:36,479
world both uh

4115
02:11:33,198 --> 02:11:40,479
horrendous and and

4116
02:11:36,479 --> 02:11:43,598
uh like exceptionally positive

4117
02:11:40,479 --> 02:11:44,638
and inspiring so yeah that's uh it's

4118
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:47,760
like

4119
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:49,279
it's uh agency of us individuals

4120
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:51,119
sometimes we think we're just reacting

4121
02:11:49,279 --> 02:11:52,000
to the world but we have the full power

4122
02:11:51,118 --> 02:11:55,118
to actually change the

4123
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,920
world is there um advice you can give to

4124
02:11:55,118 --> 02:11:58,000
young folks

4125
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:59,118
we talked we gave a bunch of advice on

4126
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,118
middle school

4127
02:11:59,118 --> 02:12:03,359
high school mathematics is there more

4128
02:12:01,118 --> 02:12:06,399
general advice you would give about

4129
02:12:03,359 --> 02:12:07,839
how to succeed in life how to learn for

4130
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:09,118
high school students for college

4131
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:11,039
students

4132
02:12:09,118 --> 02:12:12,158
career or life in general so i think the

4133
02:12:11,039 --> 02:12:13,679
first one would be

4134
02:12:12,158 --> 02:12:16,000
to make sure that you're learning to

4135
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:19,039
invent and to make sure you're not

4136
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:21,279
just learning how to mimic

4137
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:23,279
because a lot of times you learn how to

4138
02:12:21,279 --> 02:12:25,279
do x by watching somebody do x and then

4139
02:12:23,279 --> 02:12:26,238
repeating x many times with different

4140
02:12:25,279 --> 02:12:27,439
inputs

4141
02:12:26,238 --> 02:12:29,759
i'm just being very generic in

4142
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:30,399
explaining this but i guess this is just

4143
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:32,880
my own

4144
02:12:30,399 --> 02:12:34,399
attitude towards the world i didn't like

4145
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:36,000
ever following anyone's directions

4146
02:12:34,399 --> 02:12:37,679
exactly even if you told me this

4147
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,359
this is the way to do your homework is

4148
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:42,800
to write in pencil i would say

4149
02:12:39,359 --> 02:12:45,598
but i think that is nice let's try right

4150
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:46,480
so i've been that kind of a funny person

4151
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:49,840
but i do

4152
02:12:46,479 --> 02:12:52,000
encourage that if you can learn how to

4153
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:53,679
invent as your core skill then you can

4154
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,880
do a lot but then the second piece that

4155
02:12:53,679 --> 02:12:56,239
comes with that is something i learned

4156
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:59,118
from my phd advisor

4157
02:12:56,238 --> 02:12:59,839
phd advisor which was well make sure

4158
02:12:59,118 --> 02:13:02,880
that what you're

4159
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:04,960
working on is big enough and so in that

4160
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:07,520
sense i usually advise to people once

4161
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:09,920
they have learned how to invent

4162
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:11,440
ideally don't just try to settle for

4163
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:13,840
something comfortable

4164
02:13:11,439 --> 02:13:14,559
try to see if you can aim for something

4165
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:16,639
which is

4166
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:17,920
hard which might involve a campaign

4167
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:20,960
which might be important

4168
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:22,399
which might make a difference and it's

4169
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:24,480
more of

4170
02:13:22,399 --> 02:13:26,879
i guess rather than worrying what if you

4171
02:13:24,479 --> 02:13:29,118
didn't achieve that

4172
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:30,239
there's also the regret of what if i

4173
02:13:29,118 --> 02:13:32,158
didn't try

4174
02:13:30,238 --> 02:13:33,759
see that's how i operate i don't operate

4175
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:34,559
based on did i succeed or fail it was

4176
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:36,000
hard anyway

4177
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:38,079
if i did this novid thing and the whole

4178
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,000
thing failed would i feel terrible no

4179
02:13:38,078 --> 02:13:41,359
it's a very hard problem but would i

4180
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,399
have had the regret of

4181
02:13:41,359 --> 02:13:46,078
not jumping in yes so it's that

4182
02:13:44,399 --> 02:13:48,638
different mentality of don't worry about

4183
02:13:46,078 --> 02:13:50,880
the failing part as much of the

4184
02:13:48,639 --> 02:13:52,719
make sure you give yourself the shot at

4185
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:56,319
those potentially unbounded

4186
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:58,319
opportunities you almost make it sound

4187
02:13:56,319 --> 02:14:00,000
like there's a meaning to it all uh let

4188
02:13:58,319 --> 02:14:01,759
me ask the big ridiculous question what

4189
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,319
do you think is the meaning of life

4190
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:06,000
or maybe the easier version of that is

4191
02:14:04,319 --> 02:14:07,840
what brings your life joy

4192
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:11,599
so i'll just answer that one personally

4193
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:13,760
for me i'm a little bit weird i sort of

4194
02:14:11,599 --> 02:14:15,599
i guess you can tell that but i see the

4195
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,800
pen and pencil discussion from earlier

4196
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:19,440
yes yeah yeah

4197
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:20,320
so i mean my thing is i guess i

4198
02:14:19,439 --> 02:14:24,238
personally

4199
02:14:20,319 --> 02:14:28,078
just wanted to maximize a certain score

4200
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:29,598
which was for how many person years

4201
02:14:28,078 --> 02:14:33,359
after i'm no longer

4202
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:35,039
here anymore did what i do mattered

4203
02:14:33,359 --> 02:14:36,719
yeah and it didn't matter if it's

4204
02:14:35,039 --> 02:14:36,960
necessarily attributed to me it's just

4205
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:39,118
like

4206
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:40,399
did it did it matter and so that's what

4207
02:14:39,118 --> 02:14:43,759
i that's what i

4208
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:44,158
wanted um i guess that is very inspired

4209
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:46,560
by

4210
02:14:44,158 --> 02:14:48,559
how scientists work it's like why do we

4211
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:50,159
keep talking about newton it's because

4212
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:52,159
newton discovered some interesting

4213
02:14:50,158 --> 02:14:53,519
things and so newton's score is pretty

4214
02:14:52,158 --> 02:14:56,479
high

4215
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:58,560
it's going to be infinity right well

4216
02:14:56,479 --> 02:15:02,559
let's hope it's infinity but pretty high

4217
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:04,320
ah yes yes so you're going for so person

4218
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:07,039
person years you're going for like

4219
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:08,880
triple digits you're going for

4220
02:15:07,039 --> 02:15:11,198
it's like newton is like four digits

4221
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:13,440
probably like a thousand years

4222
02:15:11,198 --> 02:15:15,279
yeah yeah or personal lifetimes like how

4223
02:15:13,439 --> 02:15:17,519
do you like to think well what are we

4224
02:15:15,279 --> 02:15:19,039
sorry i've met people times years people

4225
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:20,560
sometimes so so then it's like

4226
02:15:19,039 --> 02:15:22,158
actually this is huge this is like going

4227
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:25,440
to be billions or trillions yeah

4228
02:15:22,158 --> 02:15:27,598
right the trillions but um i guess

4229
02:15:25,439 --> 02:15:29,359
for me i actually changed the metric

4230
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:31,440
after a while and the reason is because

4231
02:15:29,359 --> 02:15:33,519
you may have seen i found some simple

4232
02:15:31,439 --> 02:15:35,678
way to solve quadratic equations

4233
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:36,560
that is easier than every textbook yes

4234
02:15:35,679 --> 02:15:39,118
so

4235
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:40,719
my score might already be not bad which

4236
02:15:39,118 --> 02:15:41,519
is why i decided then let's change it

4237
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:44,078
into

4238
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:45,840
the number of hours in the lifetimes as

4239
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:49,279
well so the way i was doing it

4240
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:52,400
before is that

4241
02:15:49,279 --> 02:15:55,279
if a person was sort of remembering

4242
02:15:52,399 --> 02:15:56,078
or using or or or appreciating what i

4243
02:15:55,279 --> 02:15:59,279
had done

4244
02:15:56,078 --> 02:16:01,599
for for like 10 years if

4245
02:15:59,279 --> 02:16:03,599
of their life oh that would count as 10

4246
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:04,239
i see so if there was one person who for

4247
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:05,840
10 years

4248
02:16:04,238 --> 02:16:07,439
yes remembered or appreciated something

4249
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:08,719
i did that counts as a score of 10 and

4250
02:16:07,439 --> 02:16:12,638
we add up over all people

4251
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:14,319
yes and then uh and that was with the

4252
02:16:12,639 --> 02:16:17,520
hypothesis that the score

4253
02:16:14,319 --> 02:16:19,198
would be very finite in the sense that

4254
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:20,400
if i didn't come up with anything that

4255
02:16:19,198 --> 02:16:21,279
might potentially help a lot of

4256
02:16:20,399 --> 02:16:23,359
generations

4257
02:16:21,279 --> 02:16:24,880
in a forever way then your score will be

4258
02:16:23,359 --> 02:16:27,519
finite because at some point

4259
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:29,440
it's not people don't remember that you

4260
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:32,159
made like nice bottles or something yeah

4261
02:16:29,439 --> 02:16:32,959
right but then after the quadratic

4262
02:16:32,159 --> 02:16:34,959
equation thing

4263
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:36,079
it was that there's some chance that

4264
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:36,959
that actually might make it into

4265
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:39,120
textbooks

4266
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:40,398
yes and if it makes it in textbooks the

4267
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,319
chance that there will be an easier way

4268
02:16:40,398 --> 02:16:45,199
discovered is actually quite small

4269
02:16:42,318 --> 02:16:46,239
yes so in that case then the score might

4270
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:47,280
get bigger

4271
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:49,599
i was just saying the score might

4272
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:52,880
actually already have been achieved in

4273
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:53,599
non-trivial way so see because it's fun

4274
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:54,799
to think about

4275
02:16:53,599 --> 02:16:56,880
because it could be different you can

4276
02:16:54,799 --> 02:17:00,000
achieve a high score

4277
02:16:56,879 --> 02:17:01,438
by a small number of people using it for

4278
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,280
most of their lifetime and then

4279
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:06,079
generations and generations

4280
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:07,920
or you can have if we do dissipate if we

4281
02:17:06,079 --> 02:17:10,318
do spread colonize

4282
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:11,280
become multi-planetary species you could

4283
02:17:10,318 --> 02:17:13,840
have that little

4284
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:14,479
um a clever way to solve differential

4285
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:17,840
equations

4286
02:17:14,478 --> 02:17:19,920
um uh spread

4287
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:21,679
through like trillions of people as they

4288
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:23,840
yes spread throughout the galaxy

4289
02:17:21,679 --> 02:17:24,719
and they it would they would only use it

4290
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:27,280
each one

4291
02:17:24,718 --> 02:17:28,638
a few hours in their lifetime but yes

4292
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:30,159
their kids would use it the kids the

4293
02:17:28,638 --> 02:17:31,199
kids would use it it'll spread and

4294
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:33,679
you'll have that

4295
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:35,439
impact in that kind of way yes so that's

4296
02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:36,799
why i renormalized it because i was like

4297
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:38,079
well that's kind of dumb because what's

4298
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:39,358
the importance of that that will save

4299
02:17:38,079 --> 02:17:41,439
people 15 minutes

4300
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:44,960
um but so so what i meant is i didn't

4301
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:44,960
want to count that as the main score

4302
02:17:46,239 --> 02:17:49,119
well i'm gonna have to try to come up

4303
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:50,960
with uh some kind of device that

4304
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:51,679
everyone would want to use maybe to make

4305
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:54,638
coffee because

4306
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:55,920
coffee seems to be the prevalent uh

4307
02:17:54,638 --> 02:17:57,518
performance performance-enhancing

4308
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:58,960
chemical that everyone uses so

4309
02:17:57,519 --> 02:18:00,639
i'll have to think about in those kinds

4310
02:17:58,959 --> 02:18:02,239
of metrics yeah but

4311
02:18:00,638 --> 02:18:04,558
but you see that that's just giving an

4312
02:18:02,239 --> 02:18:06,079
idea of i guess what i found meaningful

4313
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:07,438
in general like whether or not it's like

4314
02:18:06,079 --> 02:18:08,239
whether or not that quadratic thing is

4315
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:10,318
important or not

4316
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:11,760
the general idea was i wanted to do

4317
02:18:10,318 --> 02:18:13,359
things that would outlast me

4318
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:14,639
yes and that was what inspired me and

4319
02:18:13,359 --> 02:18:15,599
that's just how i choose what problems

4320
02:18:14,638 --> 02:18:17,358
to work on

4321
02:18:15,599 --> 02:18:19,200
and that's the kind of immortalities

4322
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:22,960
ideas that you've

4323
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:25,599
invented living on long after you

4324
02:18:22,959 --> 02:18:27,119
in the minds of others and humans are

4325
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:30,398
ultimately not

4326
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:32,880
are like meat vehicles

4327
02:18:30,398 --> 02:18:33,599
that carry ideas for brief for just a

4328
02:18:32,879 --> 02:18:35,039
few years

4329
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:37,439
may not be the important thing it might

4330
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:39,679
be the ideas that we carry with us

4331
02:18:37,439 --> 02:18:41,519
and invent new ones like we get a bunch

4332
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:43,280
of baby ideas in our head

4333
02:18:41,519 --> 02:18:44,960
we borrow them from others and then

4334
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:46,800
maybe we invent a new one

4335
02:18:44,959 --> 02:18:48,799
and that new one might have a life of

4336
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:50,478
its own and

4337
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:52,000
it's fun it's fun to think about that

4338
02:18:50,478 --> 02:18:54,159
idea living from many

4339
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:56,799
centuries to come unless we destroy

4340
02:18:54,159 --> 02:18:59,760
ourselves but maybe ai will borrow it

4341
02:18:56,799 --> 02:19:00,478
and we'll remember poe as like that one

4342
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:03,760
human that

4343
02:19:00,478 --> 02:19:05,358
that that helped us out before we of

4344
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:06,719
course killed him and the rest of human

4345
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:09,760
civilization

4346
02:19:06,718 --> 02:19:12,799
on that note well this is a huge honor

4347
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:15,040
you're one of the great educators

4348
02:19:12,799 --> 02:19:16,638
i've uh ever gotten a chance to interact

4349
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:18,479
with so it's it's truly an honor that

4350
02:19:16,638 --> 02:19:20,558
you would talk with me today

4351
02:19:18,478 --> 02:19:22,398
it means especially a lot that you would

4352
02:19:20,558 --> 02:19:24,638
travel out to austin to talk to me

4353
02:19:22,398 --> 02:19:26,398
it really means a lot so thank you so

4354
02:19:24,638 --> 02:19:30,239

4360
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:41,358
really intellectual conversation through

4361
02:19:38,638 --> 02:19:42,318
all of these topics thanks bo

4362
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:44,559
thanks for listening to this

4363
02:19:42,318 --> 02:19:45,279
conversation with paul shanlow and thank

4364
02:19:44,558 --> 02:19:48,799
you to

4365
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:51,920
jordan harbor the show on it better help

4366
02:19:48,799 --> 02:19:53,199
eight sleep and element check them out

4367
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:54,398
in the description to support this

4368
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:56,399
podcast

4369
02:19:54,398 --> 02:19:58,239
and now let me leave you with some words

4370
02:19:56,398 --> 02:20:00,239
from isaac newton

4371
02:19:58,239 --> 02:20:03,600
i can calculate the motion of heavenly

4372
02:20:00,239 --> 02:20:05,119
bodies but not the madness of people

4373
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:16,800
thank you for listening and hope to see

4374
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:16,800
you next time
