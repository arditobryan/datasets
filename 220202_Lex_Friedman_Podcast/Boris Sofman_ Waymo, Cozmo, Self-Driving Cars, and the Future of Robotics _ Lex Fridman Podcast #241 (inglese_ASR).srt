00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,240
boris sofman who is the senior director

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,879
of engineering and head of trucking at

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,120
waymo the autonomous vehicle company

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,320
formerly the google self-driving car

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,119
project

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,000
before that boris was the co-founder and

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:21,278
ceo of anki a robotics company that

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,518
created cosmo which in my opinion is one

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:24,719
of the most incredible social robots

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,038
ever built

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,879
it's a toy robot but one with an

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,920
emotional intelligence that creates a

14
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,558
fun and engaging human robot interaction

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,640
it was truly sad for me to see anki shut

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,439
down when he did

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,558
i had high hopes for those little robots

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,280
we talk about this story and the future

19
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:47,039
of autonomous trucks vehicles and

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,600
robotics in general

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,160
i spoke with steve vaseli recently on

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,120
episode 237 about the human side of

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,959
trucking this episode looks more at the

24
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,280
robotic side

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,439
this is the lex friedman podcast to

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,879
support it please check out our sponsors

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,359
in the description

28
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,399
and now here's my conversation with

29
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,239
boris

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,240
sofman

31
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,399
who is your favorite robot in science

32
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,319
fiction books or movies

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,920
wally and r2d2 where they were able to

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:21,279
convey such an incredible degree of

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
intent emotion and kind of character

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
attachment without

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
having any language whatsoever

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,960
and just purely through the emotion

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,040
richness of emotional interaction so

40
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,199
those were fantastic and then uh

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,159
the terminator series just like really

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,880
really

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,640
pretty wide wide range right uh but uh i

44
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,560
kind of love this uh dynamic where you

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
have this like incredible terminator

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,439
itself that arnold played but uh and

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,280
then he was kind of like the inferior

48
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,519
like previous generation version that

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,359
was like totally outmatched uh you know

50
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,039
in terms of kind of specs by the new one

51
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,799
but you know still kind of like held his

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,960
own and so it was kind of interesting

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,799
where you you realize how many how many

54
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,718
levels there are on the spectrum from

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,680
human to kind of potentials and ai and

56
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,319
robotics to uh futures and so yeah that

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,719
movie really uh as much as it was like

58
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,239
kind of a dark world in a way was

59
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,598
actually quite fascinating gets the

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,280
imagination going well from an

61
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,679
engineering perspective both the movies

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,919
you mentioned wally and

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,319
terminator the first one

64
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,359
is probably achievable you know humanoid

65
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,000
robot

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,840
maybe not with like the realism in terms

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,080
of skin and so on but

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,239
that humanoid form we have the humanoid

69
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
form it seems like a compelling form

70
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,159
maybe the challenge is just super

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,719
expensive to engine to build but you can

72
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,878
imagine maybe not a machine of war but

73
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,560
you could imagine terminator type robots

74
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,399
walking around

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,159
and then the same obviously with wall-e

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,640
you've basically so for people who don't

77
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,280
know you uh created the company anki

78
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:52,000
that created a small robot with a big

79
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,159
personality called coswell that just it

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,840
does exactly what wally does which is

81
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,439
somehow with

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,439
very few basic

83
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,239
visual tools is able to communicate a

84
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,598
depth of emotion and that's fascinating

85
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,959
but then again the humanoid form is

86
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:11,039
uh super compelling so like uh cosmo is

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,120
very distant from a humanoid form and

88
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,039
then the terminator has a humanoid form

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,200
you can imagine both of those actually

90
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,280
being in our society it's true and it's

91
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,238
interesting because um it was very

92
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,840
intentional to go really far away from

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,319
human form when you think about a

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,000
character like cosmo or like wall-e

95
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,560
where

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,799
you can completely rethink uh the

97
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,878
constraints you put on that character um

98
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,080
what tools you leverage and then how you

99
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:39,598
actually create a personality uh and a

100
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
level of intelligence interactivity that

101
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,878
actually

102
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,679
matches the constraints that you're

103
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,798
under whether it's mechanical or sensors

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,560
or ai of the day this is why i almost

105
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
was always really surprised by how much

106
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,878
energy people put towards trying to

107
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,479
replicate human form in a robot because

108
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,878
you actually take on some pretty

109
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,399
significant um kind of constraints and

110
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,399
downsides when you do that

111
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,239
um the first of which is obviously the

112
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,200
cost where it's just the the

113
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,599
articulation of a human body is just so

114
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,598
like magical um in both the precision as

115
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,199
well as the dimensionality that to

116
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,878
replicate that even in this quote

117
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,039
reasonably close form takes like a giant

118
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,039
amount of joints and actuators and uh in

119
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,680
motion and and you know sensors and

120
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,919
encoders and so forth but then um you're

121
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,439
almost like setting an expectation that

122
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,879
the closer you try to get to human form

123
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,079
the more you expect the strengths to

124
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,519
match and that's not the way ai works is

125
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,120
there's places where you're way stronger

126
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,879
and there's places where you're weaker

127
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,399
and by moving away from human form you

128
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,240
can actually

129
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,000
change the rules and embrace your

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,879
strengths and bypass your weaknesses and

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,199
at the same time the human form

132
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,439
like has way too many degrees of freedom

133
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,520
to play with it's it's kind of

134
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,639
counterintuitive just as you're saying

135
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:55,758
but when you have fewer constraints

136
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,000
it's almost harder to master the the

137
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,160
communication of emotion like you see

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,680
this with cartoons like stick figures

139
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,479
you can communicate quite a lot with

140
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,519
just

141
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:08,159
very minimal like two dots for eyes

142
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,839
and a line for for a smile i think like

143
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
you can almost communicate arbitrary

144
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,239
levels of emotion with just two dots and

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,240
a line yeah and like that's enough and

146
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
if you focus on just that

147
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,478
you can communicate the full range and

148
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,038
then you like if you do that then you

149
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,120
can focus on the actual magic

150
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,800
of of uh

151
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,519
human and

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,199
dot line interaction versus all the

153
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,879
engineering mess that's right like

154
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,639
dimensionality voice all these sort of

155
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,199
things actually become a crutch where

156
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,360
you get lost in a search space almost um

157
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,720
and so some of the best animators that

158
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,800
we've worked with um they almost like

159
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,280
study when they come up uh you know kind

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,319
of in building their expertise by

161
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,478
forcing these um projects where all you

162
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:54,478
have is like a ball that can like kind

163
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,159
of jump and manipulate itself or like

164
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,478
really really like aggressive

165
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,000
constraints for your force to kind of

166
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,240
extract the deepest level of motion and

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
so in a lot of ways um you know we

168
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,960
thought when we thought about cosmos

169
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,639
like you're right like our if we had to

170
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,959
like describe it in like one small

171
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,800
phrase it was bringing a pixar character

172
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,038
to life in the real world it's uh it's

173
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,079
what we were going for and um in a lot

174
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,839
of ways what was interesting is that

175
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,519
with like wall-e which we studied

176
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,318
incredibly deeply and in fact some of

177
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,240
our team were you know kind of had

178
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,160
worked previously at um at pixar and on

179
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,918
that project um they intentionally

180
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,600
constrained wall-e as well even though

181
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,079
in an animated film you could do

182
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,199
whatever you wanted to because it forced

183
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,038
you to like

184
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,080
really saturate the smaller amount of

185
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,879
dimensions but uh you sometimes end up

186
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:41,680
getting a far more beautiful output um

187
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,918
because you're pushing at the extremes

188
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,439
of this emotional space in a way that

189
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,198
you just wouldn't because you get lost

190
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,639
in a surface area if you have like

191
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,639
something that is just infinitely

192
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,918
articulable so if we backtrack a little

193
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,960
bit and uh you thought of cosmo in 2011

194
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,959
and 2013 actually uh designed and built

195
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:03,519
it what is anki what is cosmo

196
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,198
i guess who is cosmo and

197
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,680
uh what was the vision behind this

198
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,280
incredible little robot we started

199
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,560
uh anki back in

200
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,079
like while we were still in graduate

201
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,038
school so myself and my two co-founders

202
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,879
we were phd students uh in the robotics

203
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,000
institute at carnegie mellon um and so

204
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,279
we were uh studying robotics ai machine

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,279
learning kind of different you know

206
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,198
different uh uh areas one of my

207
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,679
co-founders working on walking robots uh

208
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,478
you know for a period of time and so we

209
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,038
all had a um a bit of a

210
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,680
really deep kind of a deeper passion for

211
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,800
applications of robotics and ai where um

212
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,240
there's like a spectrum where there's

213
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,319
people that get like really fascinated

214
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,560
by the theory of ai and machine learning

215
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,240
robotics where um whether it gets

216
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,079
applied in the near future or not is

217
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,360
less of a kind of factor on them but

218
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,800
they love the pursuit of like the

219
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,598
challenge and that's necessary and

220
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,879
there's a lot of incredible

221
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,000
breakthroughs that happen there we're

222
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,599
probably closer to the other end of the

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,079
spectrum where we love the technology

224
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,918
and the um and all the evolution of it

225
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,439
but we were really driven by

226
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,478
applications like how can you really

227
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,719
reinvent experiences and functionality

228
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,120
and build value that wouldn't have been

229
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,960
possible without these approaches and

230
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,399
and that's what drove us and we had a

231
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,839
kind of some experiences through

232
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,598
previous jobs and internships where we

233
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,679
like got to see the applied side of

234
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,680
robotics and at that time there was

235
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,959
actually relatively few applications of

236
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,639
robotics um that were outside of um

237
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,038
you know peer research or industrial

238
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,360
applications um military applications

239
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,120
and so forth there were very few outside

240
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
of it so maybe you know my robot was

241
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,080
like one exception and maybe there were

242
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,519
a few others but for the most part there

243
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,759
weren't that many and so we got excited

244
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,679
about consumer applications of robotics

245
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,838
where you could leverage

246
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,158
way higher levels of intelligence

247
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,240
through software to create value and

248
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,519
experiences that were just not possible

249
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,600
in

250
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,120
in those fields today

251
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,879
and we saw

252
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,480
kind of a pretty wide range of

253
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,000
applications

254
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,839
that varied in the complexity of what it

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,799
would take to actually solve those and

256
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,560
what we wanted to do was to

257
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,759
commercialize this into a company but

258
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,518
actually

259
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,439
do a bottoms-up approach where we could

260
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,759
have a huge impact in a space that was

261
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
ripe to have an impact at that time and

262
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,639
then build up off of that and move into

263
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,879
other areas and entertainment became the

264
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,480
place to start because um

265
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,838
you had relatively little innovation in

266
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,120
a toy space

267
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,399
an entertainment space you had these

268
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,560
really rich

269
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,399
experiences in video games and uh and

270
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,799
movies but there was like this chasm in

271
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,039
between and so we thought that

272
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,719
we could really reinvent that experience

273
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,000
and there was a

274
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,040
really fascinating transition

275
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,440
technically that was happening at the

276
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,360
time where the cost of components was

277
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,560
plummeting because of the mobile phone

278
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,159
industry and then the smartphone

279
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,000
industry and so the cost of a

280
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,759
microcontroller of a camera of a motor

281
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,399
of memory of

282
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,559
microphones cameras was dropping by

283
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,200
orders of magnitude and then on top of

284
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,958
that with the iphone coming out in 2000

285
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,320
uh i think it was 2007 i believe

286
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,838
um

287
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,000
it started to become apparent within a

288
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,519
couple of years that this could become a

289
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,240
really incredible

290
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,159
interface device and the brain with much

291
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,839
more computation behind a physical world

292
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,360
experience that wouldn't have been

293
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,320
possible previously

294
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,959
and so

295
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,200
um we really got excited about that and

296
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:13,199
how we push all the complexity from the

297
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,879
physical world into software by using

298
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,320
really inexpensive components but

299
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,559
putting huge amounts of complexity into

300
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,000
the ai side and so cosmo became our

301
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,838
second product and then the one that

302
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,159
we're probably most proud of the idea

303
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,399
there was to create a physical character

304
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,240
that had enough understanding and

305
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,320
awareness of the physical world around

306
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,440
it in the context that mattered to feel

307
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,760
like

308
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,760
like he was alive um and

309
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,159
to be able to have these like emotional

310
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,519
kind connections and experiences with

311
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,919
people that you would typically only

312
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,159
find uh inside of a movie and the

313
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,559
motivation very much was was pixar like

314
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:48,399
we had an incredible uh respect and

315
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:50,000
appreciation for what they were able to

316
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,240
um build in this like really beautiful

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,399
fashion and film um but it was always

318
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,480
like a you know when it was virtual and

319
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,480
two it was like a story on rails that

320
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,278
had no interactivity to it it was very

321
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,200
fixed and it obviously had a magic to it

322
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,559
but where you really start to hit a

323
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
different level of experiences when

324
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:06,879
you're actually able to physically

325
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,720
interact with that robot and then that

326
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,159
was your idea with anki like the first

327
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,720
product was the cars

328
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,799
so basically you take

329
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,120
you take a toy

330
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,439
you add intelligence into it in the same

331
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,679
way you would add intelligence into ai

332
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
systems within a video game but you're

333
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,239
not bringing into the physical space so

334
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:29,039
the idea is is really brilliant which is

335
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,959
you're basically bringing video games to

336
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,559
life exactly that's exactly right we

337
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,879
literally use that exact same phrase

338
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,159
because in the case of drive this was a

339
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:41,039
parallel of the racing genre and the

340
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,519
goal was to effectively have a physical

341
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,599
racing experience but have a virtual

342
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,360
state at all times that matches what's

343
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,720
happening in the physical world and then

344
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,360
you can have a video game off of that

345
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,278
and you can have uh different characters

346
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,639
different traits for your

347
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,078
the cars

348
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,278
weapons and interactions and special

349
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,359
abilities and all these sort of things

350
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,200
that you think of virtually but then you

351
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,480
can have it physically and um one of the

352
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,040
things that we were like really

353
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,560
surprised by that really stood out and

354
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,360
immediately led us to really like kind

355
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,359
of accelerate the path towards um cosmo

356
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,560
is that things that feel like they're

357
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,079
really constrained and simple in the

358
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,919
physical world they have an amplified

359
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,039
impact on people where the exact same

360
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,639
experience virtually would not have

361
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,278
anywhere near the impact but seeing it

362
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,680
physically really stood out and so

363
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,200
effectively we've with with drive we

364
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,439
were creating a video game engine for

365
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,360
the physical world um and then with

366
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,279
cosmo we expanded that video game engine

367
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,959
to create a character and and

368
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,000
kind of an animation and interaction

369
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,638
engine

370
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,799
on top of it that allowed us to start to

371
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,120
create these much more rich experiences

372
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,399
and a lot of those elements were uh

373
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,959
almost like a proving ground for what

374
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,200
would human robot interaction feel like

375
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,119
in a domain it's much more forgiving

376
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,920
where you can make mistakes in a game

377
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,320
it's okay if like uh if you know car

378
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,159
goes off the track or if if cosmo makes

379
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,160
a mistake um and what's funny is

380
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,319
actually we're so worried about that

381
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,838
in reality we realized very quickly that

382
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,040
those mistakes can be endearing and if

383
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,560
you make a mistake as long as you

384
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,919
realize you make a mistake and have the

385
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,679
right emotional reaction to it it builds

386
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,319
even more empathy with the character

387
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,159
that's brilliant exactly so when uh the

388
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,399
the thing you're optimizing for is fun

389
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:17,679
you have so much more freedom to fail

390
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,159
to explore

391
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,919
and and also in the toy space like all

392
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,159
this is really brilliant like i got to

393
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,399
ask you backtrack

394
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,639
it seems for a roboticist

395
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,360
to take us jump

396
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,600
in into the direction of fun

397
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,278
is a brilliant move because when you

398
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,800
have the freedom to explore to design

399
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,838
all those kinds of things

400
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,599
and you can also build cheap robots

401
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,519
like you don't have to like if you're

402
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,720
not chasing perfection

403
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,480
and like

404
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,759
toys it's understood that you can go

405
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,000
cheaper which means in robot it's still

406
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,759
expensive but it's actually affordable

407
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,919
by a large number of people so it's a

408
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,519
really brilliant space to explore yeah

409
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,719
that's right it's uh and in fact we

410
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,480
realized pretty quickly that like

411
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,079
perfection is actually not fun yeah

412
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,720
because like in a traditional robotic

413
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,559
roboticist sense the first kind of path

414
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,839
planner and uh this is the you know the

415
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,759
part that i worked worked on out of the

416
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,600
gate was like a lot of the kind of ai

417
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,799
systems where you have these you know

418
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,240
vehicles and

419
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,919
you know cars racing kind of making

420
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,680
optimal maneuvers to try to kind of get

421
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,599
ahead and you realize very quickly that

422
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,958
like that's actually not fun because you

423
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,040
want the like

424
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,159
chaos from mistakes and the

425
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,679
and so you start to kind of

426
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,679
intentionally almost add noise to the

427
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,198
system uh in order to kind of create

428
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,519
more of a realism in the exact same way

429
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,439
the human player might start really

430
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,959
ineffective and inefficient and then

431
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,480
start to kind of increase their quality

432
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,000
bar as they

433
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,600
as they progress and

434
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,440
there is a really really aggressive

435
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,278
constraint that's forced on you by

436
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,360
being a consumer product where the price

437
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,759
point matters a ton particularly in like

438
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,440
kind of an entertainment where um

439
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,720
you know you you can't make a thousand

440
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,480
dollar product unless you're going to

441
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,879
meet the qua like the expectations of a

442
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,720
thousand dollar product and so um in

443
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,958
order to make this work like your cost

444
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,040
of goods had to be like like you know

445
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,559
well under a hundred dollars uh uh in

446
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,078
the case of cosmo we got it under fifty

447
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:05,439
dollars end-to-end fully packaged and

448
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:06,638
delivered and it was under two hundred

449
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,560
dollars

450
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,278
it cost the retail yeah

451
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,039
so uh okay if we sit down like at this

452
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,879
early stages

453
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,078
if you go back to that

454
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,919
and you're sitting down and thinking

455
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,519
about what kosovo looks like from a

456
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,039
design perspective and from a cost

457
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,759
perspective i imagine that was part of

458
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,759
the conversation

459
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,639
first of all what came first did you

460
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,160
have a cost in mind is there a target

461
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,560
you're trying to chase

462
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,399
did you have a vision in mind like size

463
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,078
did you have because there's a lot of

464
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,039
unique qualities to cosmos so for people

465
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:38,239
who don't know they should definitely

466
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,078
check it out

467
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,480
there's a display there's eyes on the

468
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,638
little display and those eyes can it's

469
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,800
pretty uh low resolution eyes right but

470
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,320
they they still able to convey a lot of

471
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,799
emotion and there's this arm

472
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,759
like that out lift sort of lifts stuff

473
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:59,519
but there's something about arm movement

474
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,919
that adds even more kind of depth

475
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,799
it's like uh the face communicates

476
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,360
emotion and sadness and disappointment

477
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,319
and happiness and then the arms

478
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,680
kind of communicates i'm trying here

479
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,680
yeah i'm doing my best

480
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,399
exactly so it's um

481
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,838
uh it's interesting because like um

482
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,440
all of cosmo's only four degrees of

483
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,360
freedom and two of them are the two

484
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,839
treads which is for basic movement and

485
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,440
so you literally have only

486
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,720
a head that goes up and down a lift that

487
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,079
goes up and down and then your two

488
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,320
wheels uh and you have sound uh and a

489
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,519
screen yeah and a low resolution screen

490
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,199
and with that it's actually pretty

491
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,480
incredible what you can uh what you can

492
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,679
come up with where like you said it's a

493
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,278
uh it's a really interesting give and

494
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,719
take because there's a lot of ideas far

495
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,240
beyond that obviously as you can imagine

496
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,680
where like you said how big is it how

497
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,240
much degrees of freedom what does it

498
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,078
look like um uh what does he sound like

499
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,759
how does he communicate it's it's a

500
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,198
formula that actually scales way beyond

501
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,240
entertainment this is the formula for

502
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,399
human

503
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,039
kind of robot interface more generally

504
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,879
is you almost have this triangle between

505
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,480
um the physical aspects of it the

506
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,240
mechanics the industrial design what's

507
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,360
mass producible the cost constraints and

508
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,599
so forth

509
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,279
you have the ai side of

510
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,038
how do you understand the world around

511
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,879
you interact intelligently with it

512
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,558
execute what you want to execute so

513
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
perceive the environment

514
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,160
make intelligent decisions and

515
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,519
and move forward and then you have the

516
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,558
character side of it

517
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,558
um

518
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:27,359
most uh companies have done anything in

519
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,480
human robot interaction really uh missed

520
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,879
the mark or under invest in the

521
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,279
character side of it um they over invest

522
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,200
in the mechanical side of it uh

523
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,038
you know and then varied results on the

524
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,640
ai side of it and so the thinking is

525
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,119
that you put more mechanical flexibility

526
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,480
into it you're gonna do better um you

527
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,038
don't necessarily you actually create a

528
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,400
much higher bar uh for a high roi

529
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,798
because now your price point goes up

530
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,798
your expectations go up and if the ai

531
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,798
can't meet it or the overall experience

532
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,200
isn't there you missed the mark

533
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,599
um so who like how did you through those

534
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,798
conversations get the cost down so much

535
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,558
and make it made it so simple like that

536
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,960
there's a big theme here because you

537
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:08,000
come from the mecca of robotics which is

538
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,919
carnegie mellon university robotics like

539
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,558
for all the people i've interacted with

540
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,880
that come from there or just from

541
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,399
you know the world experts at robotics

542
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,000
they don't

543
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,640
they would never build something like

544
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,919
cosmo yeah and so where did that come

545
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,520
from so the simplicity it came from this

546
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,280
combination of a team that we had it was

547
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,879
it was quite cool because like we and by

548
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,639
the way you ask anybody that's like

549
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,320
experienced in the like kind of you know

550
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,320
toy entertainment space you'll never

551
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,079
sell a product over 99 um that was

552
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,000
fundamentally false and we believed it

553
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,839
to be false it was because experience

554
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,440
had to kind of you know meet the mark

555
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,879
and so we pushed past that amount but

556
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,880
there was a pressure where the higher

557
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,200
you go the more seasonal you become and

558
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,000
the tougher it becomes and so on the

559
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,519
cost side we very quickly partnered up

560
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,679
with some previous contacts that we

561
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,480
worked with where just as an example one

562
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,240
our head of mechanical engineering um

563
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,319
was one of the earliest heads of

564
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,079
engineering at logitech and has a

565
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,079
billion units of consumer products and

566
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:06,639
circulation that he's worked on yeah so

567
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,319
like crazy low cost high volume consumer

568
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,240
product experience with a really great

569
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,399
mechanical engineering team and just a

570
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,240
very practical mindset where we were not

571
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,080
going to compromise on feasibility in

572
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,160
the market in order to chase something

573
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,599
that would be enabler and we pushed a

574
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,880
huge amount of expectations onto the

575
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,639
software team where yes we're going to

576
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,120
use cheap

577
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,919
noisy motors and sensors but we're gonna

578
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,599
fix it in the um on the software side

579
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,440
then we found on the design and

580
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,798
character side there was a faction that

581
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,558
was more from like a game design

582
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,798
background that thought that it should

583
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,839
be very games driven cosmo where you

584
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:39,759
create a whole bunch of games

585
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,558
experiences and it's all about like game

586
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,558
mechanics and then there was um a

587
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,000
faction which my my co-founder and i the

588
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,599
most involved in this like really

589
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,279
believed in which was character driven

590
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,798
and the argument is that you will never

591
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,038
compete with what you can do virtually

592
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,720
from a game standpoint but you actually

593
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,879
on the character side put this into your

594
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,839
wheelhouse and put it more towards your

595
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,600
advantage

596
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,720
because a physical character has a

597
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,959
massively

598
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,640
higher impact uh physically than

599
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,840
virtually this is okay i can't just

600
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,679
pause on that because this is so

601
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,119
brilliant when i uh for people who don't

602
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,120
know cosmo

603
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,038
plays games with you

604
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,639
but there's also a depth of character

605
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,279
and i actually when i was

606
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,840
you know playing with it

607
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,000
i wondered

608
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:24,319
exactly what is the compelling aspect of

609
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,640
this because to me obviously i'm i'm

610
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,879
biased but to me the character i get

611
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,840
what i enjoyed most honestly

612
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,559
or what

613
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,918
got me to return to it is the character

614
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,000
that's right but that's that's a

615
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,080
fascinating discussion of uh

616
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
you're right ultimately

617
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,960
you cannot compete

618
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,558
on the

619
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,079
quality of the gaming experience too

620
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,079
restrictive the physical world is just

621
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,599
too restrictive and uh you don't have a

622
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,038
graphics engine it's like all this but

623
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,439
on the character side

624
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,519
we uh and clearly we moved in that

625
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,679
direction is like kind of the the the

626
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,720
winning path and um

627
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,600
we partnered up with this uh really we

628
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,759
immediately like went towards pixar and

629
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,759
carlos bana he was um one of like had

630
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,759
been in pixar for nine years he'd worked

631
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,640
on tons of the movies including wally

632
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,558
and others and just immediately kind of

633
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,000
spoke the language and just clicked on

634
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,079
how you think about that like kind of

635
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,359
magic and drive and then he we built out

636
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,720
a team uh

637
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,959
you know with him as like a really kind

638
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,319
of prominent kind of driver of this with

639
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,480
different types of backgrounds and

640
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,678
animators and character developers where

641
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,839
um we put these constraints on the team

642
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,798
but then got them to really try to

643
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,959
create magic despite that and we

644
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:37,759
converged on this system that was at the

645
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,798
overlap of character and the character

646
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,319
ai

647
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,639
that where if you imagine the

648
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:46,720
dimensionality of emotions happy

649
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,559
sad angry surprised confused uh um

650
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,480
scared like you think of these extreme

651
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,678
emotions

652
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
we almost like kind of put this

653
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,600
challenge to kind of populate this

654
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,279
library of responses on how do you show

655
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,759
the extreme

656
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,918
response that like goes to the extreme

657
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,000
spectrum on angry or frustrated or

658
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,320
whatever and and so that gave us a lot

659
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,679
of intuition and learnings and um and

660
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,960
then we started parameterizing them

661
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,400
where it wasn't just a fixed recording

662
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,640
but they were parameterized and had

663
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,480
randomness to them where you could have

664
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,400
infinite permutations of happy and

665
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,720
surprised and so forth

666
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,798
and then we had a behavioral engine that

667
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,720
took the context from the real world

668
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,879
and would interpret it and then create

669
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,640
kind of probability mappings on what

670
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,200
sort of responses you would have that

671
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,440
actually made sense and so if cosmo saw

672
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
you for the first time in a day um he'd

673
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,558
be really surprised and happy in the

674
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,960
same way that the first time you walk in

675
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,240
and like your toddler sees you they're

676
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,240
so happy but they're not gonna be that

677
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,079
happy for the entirety of your next two

678
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,000
hours but like you have this like spike

679
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,439
in response or if you leave him alone

680
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,119
for too long he gets bored and starts

681
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,279
causing trouble and like nudging things

682
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,678
off the table um or if you beat him in a

683
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,918
game um the most enjoyable emotions are

684
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,600
him getting frustrated and grumpy to a

685
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,120
point where our testers and our

686
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,480
customers would be like

687
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,399
i had to let him win because i don't

688
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,558
want him to be upset and

689
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,559
so you start to like create this

690
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,240
feedback loop where you see how powerful

691
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:07,599
those emotions are and just to give you

692
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,679
an example something as simple as eye

693
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,519
contact um you don't think about it in a

694
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,679
movie just like it kind of happens like

695
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,839
you know camera angles and so forth um

696
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,200
but that's not really a prominent source

697
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,599
of interaction

698
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,440
what happens when a physical character

699
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,519
like cosmo when he makes eye contact

700
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,159
with you um

701
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,319
it built universal kind of connection

702
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,480
kids all the way through adults um and

703
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,480
it was truly universal it was not like

704
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,079
people stopped caring after 10 12 years

705
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,519
old

706
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,960
and so

707
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,798
we started doing experiments and we

708
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,960
found something as simple as

709
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,558
increasing the amount of eye contact

710
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,000
like the amount of times in a minute

711
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,960
that he'll look over for your approval

712
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,278
to like kind of make eye contact just by

713
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,798
i think doubling it we increase the play

714
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,400
time engagement by 40

715
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:53,359
like you see these sort of like kind of

716
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
interactions where you build that

717
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,519
empathy and and so we studied pets we

718
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
studied um virtual characters there's

719
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:02,798
like a lot of times actually dogs are

720
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
one of the perfect most perfect uh um

721
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:05,918
influencers behind these sort of

722
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,519
interactions and what we realized is

723
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,360
that the games were not there to

724
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,519
entertain you the games were to create

725
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,879
context to bring out the character and

726
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,400
if you think about the types of games

727
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,400
that you know that you played they're

728
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,240
relatively simple but they were always

729
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,480
once to create scenarios of either

730
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,720
tension or winning or losing or surprise

731
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,960
or whatever the case might be and they

732
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,798
were purely there to just like create

733
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,720
context to where an emotion could feel

734
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,759
intelligent and not random

735
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
and in the end it was all about the

736
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,558
character

737
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,400
so yeah there's so many

738
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,440
elements to play with here so you said

739
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,159
dogs what lessons do we draw from cats

740
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,080
who don't seem to give a damn about you

741
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,760
is that just another character is this

742
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,519
another it's just another character and

743
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,679
so you you could almost like in early

744
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,359
aspirations we thought it would be

745
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,440
really incredible if you had a diversity

746
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,959
of characters where you almost help

747
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,840
encourage which direction it goes just

748
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,319
like in a role-playing game um and you

749
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,879
had uh like think of like the you know

750
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,079
seven dwarfs sort of and uh um and

751
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,400
initially we even thought that it would

752
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:07,038
be amazing if like the other like

753
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,960
you know like their characters actually

754
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,240
help them be have strengths and

755
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,240
weaknesses and some you know like

756
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,599
whatever they end up doing like some are

757
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
scared some are

758
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,719
you know

759
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,400
arrogant some are uh

760
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,000
you know super warm and like kind of

761
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,600
friendly and in the end we focused on

762
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,798
one because it made it very clear that

763
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,079
hey we got to build out enough depth

764
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,000
here because you're

765
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,359
kind of trying to expand

766
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,720
it's almost like how long can you

767
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,278
maintain a fiction that this character

768
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,360
is alive um to where the person's

769
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,798
explorations don't hit a boundary um

770
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,839
which happens almost immediately with

771
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:40,400
with typical toys um and you know even

772
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,240
with video games uh how long can we

773
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,840
create that immersive experience to

774
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,240
where you expand the boundary and one of

775
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,480
the things we realized is that you're um

776
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,038
just way more forgiving when something

777
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,640
has a personality and it's physical

778
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,000
that is the key

779
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,159
that unlocks

780
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,839
uh robotics interacting you know in the

781
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,840
physical world more generally is that

782
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,439
that uh the

783
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,119
when you have a when you don't have a

784
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,440
personality and you make a mistake as a

785
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,038
robot the stupid robot made a mistake

786
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,880
why is it not perfect when you have a

787
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,319
character and you make a mistake you

788
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,679
have empathy and it becomes endearing

789
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,599
and you're way more forgiving and that

790
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,679
was the key that was like i think goes

791
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,439
far far beyond entertainment it actually

792
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,000
builds the depth of the personality the

793
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,840
mistakes so let me ask the the movie her

794
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,519
question then

795
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,639
how and so

796
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,319
cosmos seem feels like the early days of

797
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,360
something that will obviously be

798
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,960
prevalent throughout society at a scale

799
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,119
that

800
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,558
we cannot even imagine

801
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,399
my sense is

802
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,158
it seems obvious

803
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,720
that these kinds of characters will

804
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,640
permeate society and they will be

805
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,759
friends with them we'll be interacting

806
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,759
with them in different ways the in the

807
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,519
way we i mean you don't think of it this

808
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:53,599
way but when you play video games

809
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,960
they're kind they're often cold and

810
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,439
impersonal

811
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,600
but but even then

812
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,200
uh you think about role-playing games

813
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,278
you become friends with certain

814
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,000
characters in that game they're they

815
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,839
don't remember much about you they

816
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,440
they're they're just telling a story

817
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,599
it's exactly what you're saying they

818
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,679
they exist in that virtual world but if

819
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:15,599
they acknowledge that you exist in this

820
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,880
physical world if the characters in the

821
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:21,359
game remember that you exist that you

822
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,240
like for me like lex they understand

823
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:28,158
that i'm a human being who has like

824
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,319
hopes and dreams and so on it seems like

825
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,440
there's going to be a like

826
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,000
billions

827
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,480
if not trillions of cosmos in the world

828
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,240
so if we look at that future

829
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,880
there are several questions to ask how

830
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,159
intelligent does that future cosmo need

831
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,240
to be

832
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,159
to create

833
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,880
fulfilling

834
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,799
relationships like friendships yeah it's

835
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,159
a great question and and part of it was

836
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,278
a recognition it's going to take time to

837
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,440
get there because it has to be a lot

838
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:56,558
more intelligent um because what's good

839
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,720
enough to

840
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,440
be a magical experience for

841
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,600
uh you know an eight-year-old um it's a

842
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,480
higher bar to do that be a complaint

843
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,918
like a pet in the home or to help with

844
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,159
functional interface in an office

845
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,240
environment or in a home or uh and so

846
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,600
forth and so and the idea was that you

847
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,919
build on that and you kind of get there

848
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,439
and as technology becomes more prevalent

849
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,919
and less expensive and so forth you can

850
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,960
start to kind of work up to it um but

851
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,960
you know you're absolutely right at the

852
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,360
end of the day um we almost equated it

853
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,038
to how uh the touchscreen created like

854
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,119
this really novel interface to you know

855
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,879
physical kind of devices like this

856
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,678
this is the extension of it where you

857
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,679
have

858
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,600
much richer physical interaction in the

859
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,240
real world this is this is the enabler

860
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,599
for it um and it shows itself in a few

861
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,798
kind of really obvious places so just

862
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,439
take something as simple as a voice

863
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,918
assistant um you will never most people

864
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,480
will never tolerate uh an alexa or a

865
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,120
google home just starting a conversation

866
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,880
um proactively uh when you weren't kind

867
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,239
of expecting it because it it feels

868
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,919
weird it's like you were listening and

869
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
like and then now you're kind of it

870
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,559
feels intrusive but if you had a

871
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,319
character um like a cat that touches you

872
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,678
and gets your attention or toddler like

873
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,000
you never think twice about it what we

874
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,679
found really kind of immediately is that

875
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,720
um these types of characters like cosmo

876
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,240
and they would like roam around and kind

877
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,079
of get your attention and we had a

878
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,759
future version it was always on kind of

879
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,798
called vector people were way more

880
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,119
forgiving

881
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,839
and so you could initiate interaction in

882
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:22,879
a way that is not acceptable for

883
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,720
for machines and in general um you know

884
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,120
there's a lot of ways to customize it

885
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,038
but it makes people who are skeptical of

886
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,398
technology much more comfortable with it

887
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:31,599
there was like there were a couple of

888
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,519
really really

889
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,918
prominent examples of this so when we

890
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,398
launched in europe and so we were in um

891
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,919
uh i think like a dozen countries if i

892
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:41,918
remember correctly but like we were we

893
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,278
went pretty aggressively in launching in

894
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,880
um germany and france and uh and uk and

895
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,640
we were very worried in europe because

896
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,039
there's obviously like a really a

897
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,960
socially higher bar for privacy and you

898
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,079
know security where you you've heard

899
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,720
about how many companies have had

900
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,319
troubles on uh uh that might things that

901
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,919
might have been okay in the u.s but like

902
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,599
are just not okay in germany and france

903
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,679
in particular um and so we were worried

904
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:07,439
about this because you have um you know

905
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,880
cosmo who's um uh you know in our future

906
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,159
product veteran like where you have

907
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,919
cameras you have microphones it's kind

908
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,559
of connected and like you're playing

909
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,480
with kids and like in these experiences

910
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,480
and you're like this is like ripe to be

911
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,319
like a nightmare if you're not careful

912
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,679
yes um and

913
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,599
uh and the journalists are like

914
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,759
notoriously like really really tough on

915
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,759
on these sort of things um

916
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:30,079
we were shocked and we prepared so much

917
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,679
for what we would have to encounter we

918
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,240
were shocked in that

919
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,798
not once from any journalists or

920
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,960
customer do we have any complaints

921
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,000
beyond like a really casual kind of

922
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,679
question

923
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and it was because

924
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,159
of the character where um

925
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
when it conversation came up it was

926
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,600
almost like well of course he has to see

927
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,119
in here how else is he going to be alive

928
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,359
and interacting with you

929
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:56,000
and it completely disarmed um this like

930
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,759
fear of technology that enabled this

931
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,200
interaction to be much more fluid and

932
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,558
again like entertainment was a proving

933
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,558
ground but that is like a you know

934
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,038
there's like ingredients there that

935
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,879
carry over to a lot of other uh

936
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,640
elements down the road that's hilarious

937
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,360
that we're a lot less concerned about

938
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,120
privacy if the if the thing is value and

939
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:14,879
charisma

940
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,319
i mean that's true for all of women to

941
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,240
human interaction too it's an

942
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,678
understanding of intent where like well

943
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,038
he's looking at me he can see me if he's

944
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,640
not looking at me he can't see me right

945
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,038
so it's almost like uh

946
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,399
um you're communicating intent and with

947
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,319
that intent

948
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,158
people are like kind of kind of more

949
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,519
understanding and calmer and it's a it's

950
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,039
interesting we just it was just the

951
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,880
earliest kind of version of starting an

952
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,798
experiment with this but um it wasn't

953
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,600
enabler and um and then and then you

954
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:38,798
have like completely different

955
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,639
dimensions where like you know kids with

956
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,079
autism had like an incredible connection

957
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,000
with cosmo that just went beyond

958
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,759
anything we'd ever seen and we have like

959
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,679
these just letters that we would receive

960
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,960
from parents and we had some research

961
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,840
projects kind of going on with some

962
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,600
universities on studying this but um

963
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:54,959
there are like there's an interesting

964
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,759
dimension there that got unlocked that

965
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,240
just hadn't existed before um that has

966
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:02,079
these really interesting kind of links

967
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,240
into society and

968
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,319
and a potential building block of future

969
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,159
experiences so

970
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,480
if you look out into the future do you

971
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,960
think we will have

972
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,399
beyond a particular game

973
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,798
you know a companion

974
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,239
like uh like her

975
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,558
like the movie her

976
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,679
or like a cosmo that's

977
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,798
kind of asks you how your day went too

978
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,200
right

979
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,798
you know like a friend

980
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,880
how many years away from that do you

981
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:32,480
think we are what's your intuition good

982
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,240
question so

983
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,839
i think the idea of a different type of

984
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,440
character like more closer to like kind

985
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,918
of a pet style companionship it will

986
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,720
come way faster um

987
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,278
and there's a few reasons one is like to

988
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,839
to do something like in her that's like

989
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,599
effectively almost general ai and the

990
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,038
bar is so high that if you miss it by

991
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,158
bit you hit the uncanny valley where it

992
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,158
just becomes creepy and like and not um

993
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,840
not appealing um because the closer you

994
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,120
try to get to a human in form and

995
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,158
interface and

996
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:04,639
voice the harder it becomes whereas

997
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,559
you have way more flexibility on

998
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,080
still landing a really great experience

999
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,319
if you embrace the idea of a character

1000
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,319
and that's why um one of the other

1001
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,398
reasons why we didn't have a voice uh

1002
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,918
and also why like a lot of video game

1003
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:17,678
characters uh like

1004
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,200
sims for example does not have a voice

1005
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,200
when you uh when you think about it it

1006
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,519
was it wasn't just a cost savings like

1007
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,679
for them it was actually for all of

1008
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,440
these purposes it was because when you

1009
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,960
have a voice you immediately narrow down

1010
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,679
the appeal to some particular

1011
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,319
demographic or age range or um kind of

1012
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,159
style or gender uh if you don't have a

1013
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,359
voice people interpret what they want to

1014
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,799
interpret

1015
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,319
and an eight-year-old might get a very

1016
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:41,038
different interpretation than a 40 year

1017
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,639
old

1018
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,158
but you create a dynamic range and so

1019
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,559
you just you can lean into these

1020
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,240
advantages much more um and something

1021
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,079
that doesn't resemble a human and so

1022
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,399
that'll come faster

1023
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:55,199
i don't know when a human like that's

1024
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,199
just uh still like ma just complete r d

1025
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,440
at this point the the chat interfaces

1026
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,278
are getting way more interesting and

1027
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,759
richer but it's still a long way to go

1028
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:07,038
to kind of pass the test of

1029
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:09,838
you know well let me like let's consider

1030
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:12,320
like let me play devil's advocate

1031
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,440
so google is a very large company that's

1032
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,200
servicing

1033
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,800
it's creating a very compelling product

1034
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,239
that wants to provide a service a lot of

1035
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,519
people but let's go outside of that you

1036
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,439
said characters yeah it feels like and

1037
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,599
you also said that it requires general

1038
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,519
intelligence to be a successful

1039
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,280
participant in a relationship which

1040
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:32,079
could explain why i'm single this is

1041
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,399
very

1042
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,679
but the i i honestly want to push back

1043
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,799
on that a little bit

1044
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,800
because i feel like is it possible

1045
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,960
that if you're just good at playing a

1046
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,399
character yeah you're in in a movie

1047
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,480
there's a bunch of characters if you

1048
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:47,679
just understand what creates compelling

1049
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,000
characters

1050
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,000
and then you you just are that character

1051
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,079
and you exist in the world and other

1052
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,440
people find you and they connect with

1053
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,519
you just like you do when you talk to

1054
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,960
somebody at a bar i like this character

1055
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,800
this character is kind of shady i don't

1056
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,280
like them you pick the ones that you

1057
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,079
like and you know maybe it's somebody

1058
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,920
that's uh reminds you of your father or

1059
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,839
mother i don't know what it is but the

1060
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,159
the freudian thing but there's some kind

1061
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:14,159
of connection that happens and that's

1062
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,000
that that's the cosmo you connect to

1063
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,960
that's the future cosmo you connect and

1064
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,400
that's

1065
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,039
so i guess the statement i'm trying to

1066
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,680
make is it possible to achieve a depth

1067
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,119
of friendship without solving

1068
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,960
general intelligence i think so it's

1069
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,320
about intelligent kind of constraints

1070
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,000
right and just uh you set expectations

1071
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,000
and constraints such that in the space

1072
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,719
that's left you can be successful and so

1073
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,838
you can do that by having a very focused

1074
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,118
domain that you can operate in for

1075
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:40,799
example you're a customer support agent

1076
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,240
for a particular product and you create

1077
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,280
intelligence and a good interface around

1078
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,118
that or uh you know kind of in the

1079
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,800
personal companionship side you can't be

1080
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,079
everything to

1081
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,599
across the board

1082
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,839
you you kind of solve those constraints

1083
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,000
and i think uh i think it's possible my

1084
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:59,519
my worry is like i

1085
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,760
right now i don't see anybody that has

1086
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,838
picked up on where kind of cosmo left

1087
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,280
off yes and is pushing on it in the same

1088
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,519
way and so i don't know if it's a sort

1089
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,800
of thing where similar to like how you

1090
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,880
know in dot com there were all these

1091
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,880
concepts that we considered like you

1092
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,480
know that didn't work out or like failed

1093
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,079
or like were too early or whatnot and

1094
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,000
then 20 years later you have these like

1095
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,680
incredible successes on almost the same

1096
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,440
concept like it might be that sort of

1097
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:23,598
thing where like there's another pass at

1098
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,880
it that happens in five years or in 10

1099
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,359
years but um it does feel like that

1100
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,280
appreciation of that like that this the

1101
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,799
three like it's duel if you will between

1102
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,519
like you know the hardware the ai and

1103
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,240
the character um that balance it's hard

1104
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,639
to

1105
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:40,639
i'm not aware of of any pro anywhere

1106
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,799
right now where like that same kind of

1107
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,799
aggressive drive with the value on the

1108
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,599
character is uh is happening and so to

1109
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,320
me

1110
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,160
just a prediction exactly as you said

1111
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,480
something that looks awfully a lot like

1112
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,559
cosmo not in the actual physical form

1113
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,400
but in the three-legged stool

1114
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,480
something like that in some number of

1115
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,800
years would be a trillion dollar company

1116
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,800
i don't understand like it's obvious to

1117
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,839
me yeah that

1118
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,880
like

1119
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,599
character not just as robotic companions

1120
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,240
but in all our computers they'll be

1121
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,720
there it's like uh

1122
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,559
clippy was like

1123
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,159
two legs of that stool or something like

1124
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:19,838
that yeah i mean that those are all

1125
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,440
different attempts and

1126
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:24,799
what's really confusing to me is they

1127
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,960
they're born

1128
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,640
these attempts and they they everybody

1129
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,880
gets excited and for some reason they

1130
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,679
die and then nobody else tries to pick

1131
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,920
it up and then maybe a few years later

1132
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:39,279
a crazy guy like you comes comes around

1133
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,480
with just enough brilliance and vision

1134
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,079
to create this thing and it's born a lot

1135
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,159
of people love it a lot of people get

1136
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,280
excited but maybe the timing is not

1137
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:49,679
right yet

1138
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,680
and then and then when the timing is

1139
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,000
right it just blows up and it just keeps

1140
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,639
blowing up more and more until it just

1141
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,920
blows up and i guess everything in the

1142
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,679
full span of human civilization

1143
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,119
collapses eventually

1144
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:02,239
and that wouldn't surprise me at all and

1145
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,559
like what's gonna be different in

1146
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,719
another five years or ten years what not

1147
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,519
physical component costs will continue

1148
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,598
to come down uh in price and you know

1149
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,719
mobile devices and computations going to

1150
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,359
become more and more prevalent as well

1151
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,399
as cloud as a big tool uh to offload

1152
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,920
cost um ai is going to be a massive

1153
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,639
transformation compared to what we dealt

1154
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,079
with uh where um everything from voice

1155
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:29,118
understanding to um uh to just

1156
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,039
you know kind of a broader contextual uh

1157
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,400
understanding and mapping of

1158
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:36,480
of semantics and uh understanding scenes

1159
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,760
and so forth and then the character side

1160
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,119
will continue to kind of you know

1161
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,440
progress as well because that magic does

1162
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,240
exist it just exists in different forms

1163
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,838
and you have just the brilliance of uh

1164
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,399
that's happening in animation and you

1165
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:50,880
know these other areas where um that is

1166
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,200
that was a big unlock in um you know in

1167
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,400
film obviously uh and so i think yeah

1168
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,519
the pieces can reconnect and the

1169
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,200
building blocks are actually gonna be

1170
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,440
way more impressive than they were five

1171
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,838
years ago so

1172
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,960
so in 2019

1173
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:07,119
uh anki the company that created cosmo

1174
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,400
the company that you started had to shut

1175
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,880
down

1176
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,000
how did you feel at that time

1177
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,160
yeah

1178
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,400
it was tough uh that was a really

1179
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:17,679
emotional stretch and it was really

1180
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,599
tough year

1181
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,838
like about a year ahead of that was

1182
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,760
actually a pretty brutal stretch because

1183
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:25,838
we were um

1184
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,560
kind of light life or death on many many

1185
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,880
moments um just navigating

1186
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,279
these insane kind of just ups and downs

1187
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,240
and um barriers and the thing that made

1188
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,680
it

1189
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,919
like um

1190
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,679
like just rewinding a tiny bit like what

1191
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,680
you know what ended up being really

1192
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,118
challenging about it as a business where

1193
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,319
is um

1194
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,079
from a commercial standpoint and

1195
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,200
customer reception standpoint there's a

1196
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,720
lot of things you could point to that

1197
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,000
were like you know pretty big successes

1198
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,598
sold millions of units uh like you got

1199
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,679
to like pretty serious revenue like kind

1200
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,160
of close to 100 million annual revenue

1201
00:39:55,679 --> 00:40:00,159
um uh number one kind of product in kind

1202
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,159
of various categories

1203
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,159
but it was pretty expensive it ended up

1204
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,039
being very seasonal where something like

1205
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:09,279
85 percent of our volume was in q4

1206
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,119
because it was a you know a present and

1207
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,519
and it was expensive to market it and

1208
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,440
explain it and so forth um and even

1209
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,800
though though the volume was like really

1210
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,960
sizeable and like the reviews were

1211
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,359
really fantastic um

1212
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,440
forecasting and planning for it and

1213
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,759
managing the cash operations was just

1214
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,639
brutal like it was absolutely brutal you

1215
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,839
don't think about this when you're

1216
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:29,039
starting a company or when you have a

1217
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,599
few million in

1218
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,119
you know in revenue because it's just

1219
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,400
your biggest costs are kind of just your

1220
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,559
head count and operations and

1221
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,639
everything's ahead of you but we got to

1222
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,480
a point where um

1223
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,239
you know you if you look at the entire

1224
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,400
year you have to

1225
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,598
operate your company pay all you know

1226
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,119
the people and so forth you have to pay

1227
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,480
for the manufacturing the marketing and

1228
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,000
everything else

1229
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,440
to do your sales in mostly november

1230
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,159
december and then get paid in december

1231
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,200
january by retailers and those swings

1232
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:59,199
were pretty um were really rough um and

1233
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,639
just made it like so difficult because

1234
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,399
the more successfully became the more

1235
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,400
wild those swings became

1236
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,160
because you'd have to like spend

1237
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,680
you know tens of millions of dollars on

1238
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:09,279
inventory tens of millions of dollars on

1239
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,358
marketing and tens of millions of

1240
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,880
dollars on payroll and everything else

1241
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:15,119
and then there's the bigger dip and then

1242
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,960
you're waiting for the 204 yeah and it's

1243
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,318
not a business that like is recurring

1244
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,760
kind of month-to-month and predictable

1245
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,480
and it's just and then you're walking in

1246
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,359
your forecast in july um you know maybe

1247
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,358
august

1248
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,119
if you're lucky um

1249
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,639
and uh and it's also like very hit

1250
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,720
driven and seasonal where like you don't

1251
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:32,639
have the sort of continued uh kind of

1252
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,959
slow growth like you do in some other uh

1253
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,400
consumer electronics industries and so

1254
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,400
before then like hardware kind of like

1255
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,318
went out of favor too and so you had

1256
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,440
fitbit and gopro dropped from 10 billion

1257
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:42,800
revenue to 1 billion revenue and

1258
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,440
hardware companies are getting valued at

1259
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,519
like 1x revenue oftentimes um which is

1260
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,358
tough right and so

1261
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,440
we effectively kind of got caught in the

1262
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:53,519
middle where we were trying to

1263
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,679
quickly evolve out of entertainment and

1264
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,199
move into some other categories but you

1265
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,480
can't let go of that business because

1266
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,318
like that's what you're valued on that's

1267
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,760
what you're raising money on um but

1268
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,079
there's no path to prop kind of pure

1269
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,640
profitability just there because it was

1270
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,640
you know such you know uh specific type

1271
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:09,440
of price points and so forth and so

1272
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,358
um

1273
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,000
we tried really hard to make that

1274
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:15,358
transition and um yeah we had a

1275
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,719
financing round that fell apart at the

1276
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,679
last second and effectively there was

1277
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:21,358
just no path to kind of get through that

1278
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,679
and get to the next kind of like holiday

1279
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,358
season and so we ended up um

1280
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,358
uh selling some of the assets and kind

1281
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,039
of winding down the company it was uh it

1282
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,039
was brutal like we i was very

1283
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,800
transparent with the company like in the

1284
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,719
the team while we were going through it

1285
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,800
where actually despite how challenging

1286
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,559
that period was very few people left i

1287
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,318
mean like people loved the vision the

1288
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,519
team the culture of the like kind of

1289
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:42,719
chemistry and kind of what we were doing

1290
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:44,559
there was just a huge amount of pride

1291
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,559
there and we wanted to see it through

1292
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:49,440
and we felt like we had a shot to kind

1293
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:52,239
of get through these checkpoints um

1294
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,000
we ended up uh and i mean by brutal i

1295
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,159
mean like literally like days of cash

1296
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,159
like three four different times uh

1297
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,960
runway like in the year you know kind of

1298
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:03,598
before it um where you're like

1299
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,240
playing games of chicken on negotiating

1300
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,838
credit line timelines and

1301
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,598
like repayment

1302
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,279
terms and how to get like a bridge loan

1303
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,039
from an investor it's just like

1304
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,400
level of stress that like is as hard as

1305
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:16,079
things might be anywhere else like

1306
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,280
you'll never come you know come close to

1307
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,519
that where you feel that like

1308
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,960
responsibility for you know 200 plus

1309
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:22,480
people right um

1310
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,000
and so we were very transparent during

1311
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,480
our fundraise on who we're talking to

1312
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,159
the challenges um that we have

1313
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,318
how it's going and when things are going

1314
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,318
well when things were tough um and so it

1315
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,079
wasn't a complete shock when it happened

1316
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,759
but it was just very emotional where

1317
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,039
like i you know like

1318
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,520
you know when we announced it finally

1319
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,880
that like um you know we you know

1320
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,159
basically we're just like watching kind

1321
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,440
of like you know the runway and trying

1322
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:44,879
to kind of time it and when we realized

1323
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,960
that like we didn't have any more outs

1324
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,119
we wanted to like kind of wind it down

1325
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,240
make sure that it was like clean and you

1326
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,920
know we could like kind of take care of

1327
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,239
people the best we could but yeah like

1328
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,680
broke down crying at all you know hands

1329
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,199
and somebody else had to step in for a

1330
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,279
bit and like it was just very very

1331
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:00,639
emotional but the beautiful part is like

1332
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,640
afterwards like everybody stayed at the

1333
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,559
office to like two three in the morning

1334
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,078
just like drinking and hanging out and

1335
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,279
telling stories and celebrating and it

1336
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,440
was just like

1337
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,040
one of the best uh for many people was

1338
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,639
like the best kind of work experience

1339
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,480
that they had and there was a lot of

1340
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:15,920
pride in what we did and there wasn't

1341
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,280
anything obvious we could point to that

1342
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,240
like hey if only we had done that

1343
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,800
different things would have been

1344
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:24,318
completely different it was just like

1345
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,039
the physics didn't line up uh and uh

1346
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:29,440
um but the experience was pretty uh

1347
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,960
incredible but it was hard like it was

1348
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,519
uh it had this feeling that there was

1349
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,599
this like incredible beauty in both the

1350
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,199
technology and products and the team

1351
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,160
that um

1352
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:39,598
uh

1353
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,078
you know there's there's a lot there

1354
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,119
that like in the you know right context

1355
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,440
could have been

1356
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,880
uh pretty incredible but it was um

1357
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,960
emotional just

1358
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,358
yeah just thinking i mean just looking

1359
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,079
at this company like you said the

1360
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,480
product and technology but the vision

1361
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,920
the implementation you got the cost down

1362
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,079
very low

1363
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,880
yeah and the compelling the nature of

1364
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,920
the product was great so many robotics

1365
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,920
companies failed at this at they

1366
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,240
the robot was too expensive it didn't

1367
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,720
have the personality it didn't really

1368
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:15,199
provide any value like a sufficient

1369
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:18,159
value to justify the price so like you

1370
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:20,159
succeeded where basically every single

1371
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,920
other robotics company or most of them

1372
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:25,358
that are like going the category of

1373
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,400
social robotics have kind of failed

1374
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:29,279
and

1375
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,480
i mean it's uh it's quite tragic i

1376
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,920
remember uh

1377
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,559
reading that i'm not sure if i talked to

1378
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,400
you before that happened or not

1379
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:37,519
but i remember you know i'm distant from

1380
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,680
this

1381
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,559
i remember being heartbroken reading

1382
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:42,799
that

1383
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,239
because like

1384
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,359
if

1385
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:49,358
if cosmo's not going to succeed

1386
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,440
what is going to succeed because that to

1387
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:52,719
me was incredible

1388
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,880
like

1389
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:57,039
it was an incredible idea

1390
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,920
cost is down the minimum the

1391
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,960
the

1392
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,440
it's just like the most minimal design

1393
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,240
in physical form that you could do it's

1394
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,639
really compelling the balance of games

1395
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,919
so it's a it's a fun toy it's a great

1396
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,239
gift

1397
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,880
for all kinds of age groups right it's

1398
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,199
just it's compelling in every single way

1399
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,599
and it seemed like uh it was a huge

1400
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:22,960
success and it it failing was

1401
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,280
i don't know there was heartbreak on

1402
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,960
many levels for me just as an external

1403
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,599
observer

1404
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,720
is i was thinking how hard is it to run

1405
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,160
a business

1406
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,919
that's that's what i was thinking like

1407
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:37,279
if this failed this must have failed

1408
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,760
because uh it's obviously not like

1409
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,119
yeah it's b it's business yeah maybe

1410
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,960
it's some aspect of the manufacturing

1411
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,039
and so on but i'm now realizing it's

1412
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,920
also not just that it's

1413
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,838
yeah

1414
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,280
sales marketing also it's everything

1415
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,880
right like how do you explain something

1416
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,920
that's like a new category to people

1417
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,559
that like how all these previous

1418
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,358
positions and so like uh you know it it

1419
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:58,799
had some of the hardest elements of

1420
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,039
if you were to pick a business it had

1421
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,440
some of the hardest uh um customer

1422
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:06,000
dynamics because like to sell a 150

1423
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,679
product you got to convince both the

1424
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,199
child to want it and the parents to

1425
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:10,559
agree that it's valuable so you're

1426
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,318
having like this dual prong marketing

1427
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,239
challenge you have manufacturing you

1428
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:15,599
have like really high precision on the

1429
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,358
components that you need you have the ai

1430
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,359
challenges so there were a lot of tough

1431
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:22,159
elements but is this feeling where like

1432
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:23,838
just really great alignment of unique

1433
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:26,159
strength across kind of like all these

1434
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,679
different areas just an incredible like

1435
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,358
you know kind of character and animation

1436
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:30,558
team between this like carlos and

1437
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:31,838
there's like a character director day

1438
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,000
that came on board and like you know

1439
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:35,838
really great people there the ai side

1440
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,519
the um uh

1441
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:41,119
the manufacturing the you know where um

1442
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,318
like never missing a launch right and

1443
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,240
actually you know he kind of hitting

1444
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,880
that quality was um yeah it was it was

1445
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,639
heartbreaking but uh

1446
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,039
here's one neat thing is like we we had

1447
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:53,039
so much like fan mail from kind of kids

1448
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,880
parents like i actually like there was a

1449
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:57,199
bunch they collected in the end yeah

1450
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,880
that um i actually saved and like i

1451
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,879
never it was too emotional to open it

1452
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,240
and i still haven't opened it um and so

1453
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,000
i actually have this giant envelope of

1454
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,399
like a stack this much of like letters

1455
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
from you know kids and families just

1456
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,680
like every you know perpetration

1457
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,960
permutation you can imagine and so

1458
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,879
planning to kind of i don't know maybe

1459
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,639
like a five year you know five year

1460
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,400
eight some year reunion just inviting

1461
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,159
everybody over and we'll just like kind

1462
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,559
of dig into it and um kind of bring back

1463
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:23,039
some memories but um you know good

1464
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:26,400
impact and uh um well i i think there

1465
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:28,400
will be companies uh maybe waymo and

1466
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,519
google will be somehow involved that

1467
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,358
will carry this flag forward and will uh

1468
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:35,679
will make you proud whether you're

1469
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,679
involved or not i think this is one of

1470
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:41,039
the greatest robotics companies in the

1471
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:44,239
history of robotics so you should be

1472
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:46,000
proud it's still tragic to know that

1473
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:49,439
you know because you read all the

1474
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,760
stories of apple and and

1475
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,679
let's see spacex and like companies that

1476
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,440
were just on the verge of failure

1477
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,358
several times through that story and

1478
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,519
they just it's almost like a roll of the

1479
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:04,078
diet they succeeded and here's the role

1480
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,440
of the dice that just happened to go

1481
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,880
and that's the appreciation that like

1482
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,760
when you really like talk to a lot of

1483
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,200
the

1484
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,520
founders like everybody goes through

1485
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:13,598
those moments and sometimes it really is

1486
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,199
a matter of like you know timing a

1487
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,680
little bit of luck like some things are

1488
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:19,598
just out of your control and um

1489
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:22,078
uh and you you get a much deeper

1490
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,240
appreciation for um just the

1491
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,240
dimensionality of of that challenge but

1492
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,759
um the great thing is that like a lot of

1493
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,479
the team actually like stayed together

1494
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,400
and so um they were actually a couple of

1495
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,519
companies that we we kind of kept big

1496
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,920
chunks of the team together and we

1497
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:38,159
actually kind of helped align this uh um

1498
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,559
you know to help people out as well um

1499
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:44,239
and one of them was waymo where uh

1500
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,720
a majority of the ai and robotics team

1501
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:47,919
actually had the exact background uh

1502
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:49,519
that you would look for in like kind of

1503
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,079
a b space it was a space that a lot of

1504
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:53,440
us like you know were you know worked on

1505
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,839
in grad school were always passionate

1506
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,200
about and ended up uh you know maybe the

1507
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:58,558
time you know

1508
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,279
serendipitous timings from another

1509
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,960
perspective where like uh um kind of

1510
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,240
landed in a really unique um

1511
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,760
circumstance it's actually been quite

1512
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:08,000
exciting too

1513
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,960
so it's interesting to ask you just your

1514
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,599
thoughts uh cosmo still lives on

1515
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,199
under dream labs i think

1516
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,039
is that

1517
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,358
are you tracking the progress there or

1518
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,279
is it too much pain

1519
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:24,000
is it are you is that something that

1520
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,079
you're excited to see where that goes

1521
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,679
so keeping an eye on it of course just

1522
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,160
out of your curiosity and obviously just

1523
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,679
kind of care for product line i think um

1524
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,719
it's deceptive how complex it is to

1525
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:38,159
manufacture and evolve that product line

1526
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:41,358
um and the amount of

1527
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:42,719
experiences that are required to

1528
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:44,159
complete the picture and be able to move

1529
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,480
that forward and i think that's going to

1530
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,719
make it pretty hard to do something

1531
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,240
really substantial with it it would be

1532
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:52,318
cool if like even the product in the way

1533
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,318
it was was able to be manufactured yes

1534
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,960
again that would be

1535
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:59,199
yeah which would be neat um but uh it's

1536
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,519
i think it was it's deceptive how tricky

1537
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,759
that is on like everything from the

1538
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,000
quality control the details and um and

1539
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,119
then like technology changes that forces

1540
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,079
you to rick

1541
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,160
reinvent and update certain things um so

1542
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,680
uh i haven't been super close to it but

1543
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:16,000
just kind of keeping an eye on it yeah

1544
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:17,759
it's really interesting how

1545
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,239
it's deceptively difficult just as

1546
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,119
you're saying for example

1547
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:24,558
those same folks uh and i've spoken with

1548
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,079
them they're

1549
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:30,319
they partnered up with rick and morty uh

1550
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,680
creators to uh to do the butter robot

1551
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:35,599
yes i love the idea i just recently

1552
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:37,838
i've kind of half-assed watch rick and

1553
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,838
morty previously but now i just watched

1554
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,400
like the first season it's such a

1555
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,239
brilliant show i i like

1556
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,639
i did not understand how brilliant that

1557
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:48,558
show is and obviously i think in season

1558
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:51,759
one is where the butter robot comes

1559
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,200
along for just a few minutes or whatever

1560
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,359
but i just fell in love with the butter

1561
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,719
robot the sort of the

1562
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,799
that particular character just like you

1563
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:00,239
said there's characters you can create

1564
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,599
personalities you can create and that

1565
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:03,199
particular

1566
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,440
a robot

1567
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,719
who's doing a particular task

1568
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,720
realizes

1569
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,399
you know

1570
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:12,719
this like realizes that's the

1571
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,119
existential question this the myth of

1572
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:17,598
sisyphus question that uh camus writes

1573
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,519
about it's like is this all there is

1574
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,440
because he moves butter

1575
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,358
but you know

1576
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,280
that realization that's a that's a

1577
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:27,679
beautiful little realization for a robot

1578
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,680
that my purpose is very

1579
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:32,000
limited with this particular task it's

1580
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:34,558
abuse it's humor of course it's darkness

1581
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,039
it's a beautiful mix but so they want to

1582
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:40,400
release that butter robot

1583
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,400
but something tells me

1584
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,000
that to do the same depth of personality

1585
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:49,440
as cosmo had the same richness it would

1586
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,519
be on the manufacturing on the ai

1587
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,519
on the storytelling on the design it's

1588
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:56,639
going to be very very difficult it could

1589
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,400
be a cool sort of uh toy

1590
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:02,558
for rick and morty fans

1591
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:05,838
but to create the same depth of

1592
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:08,480
existential angst yeah that the butter

1593
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:11,039
robot symbolizes is is really

1594
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,679
that's the brave effort you succeeded at

1595
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,880
with cosmo but it's not easy it's really

1596
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:16,719
studies and

1597
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,280
you can fail on almost any one of the

1598
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:20,799
kind of dimensions and like uh and yeah

1599
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,160
it takes you know

1600
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,318
yeah unique convergence of a lot of

1601
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:25,838
different skill sets to try to pull that

1602
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:27,519
off yeah

1603
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:28,639
on this topic let me ask you for some

1604
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:30,559
advice

1605
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:33,279
because uh as i've been watching rick

1606
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:35,359
and morty i i told myself i have to

1607
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,000
build the butter robot just as a hobby

1608
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:39,519
project and so uh i got a nice platform

1609
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,159
for it with treads and and there's a

1610
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:44,800
camera that moves up and down and so on

1611
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:46,558
um i'll probably paint it

1612
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,559
but

1613
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,160
the question i'd like to ask there's

1614
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,319
obvious technical questions i'm fine

1615
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:55,358
with communication the personality

1616
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:57,119
storytelling all those kinds of things

1617
00:53:55,358 --> 00:54:00,400
i think i understand the process of that

1618
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,400
but how do you know

1619
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:05,679
when you got it right

1620
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:08,639
so with with cosmo how did you know

1621
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:11,199
this is great like or um something is

1622
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,239
off like yeah is this brainstorming with

1623
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,838
the team

1624
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:14,799
do you know it when you see it is it

1625
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:16,480
like

1626
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,519
love at first sight it's like this is

1627
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,920
right or like i guess if we think of it

1628
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:24,079
as an optimization space

1629
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,559
is there uncanny valley we're like

1630
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,720
that's not right or this is right or are

1631
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,480
a lot of characters right yeah

1632
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:32,879
we stayed away from uncanny valley just

1633
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,960
by having such a different what like

1634
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,119
mapping where it didn't try to look like

1635
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,798
a dog or a human or anything like that

1636
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,599
and so uh

1637
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,960
you avoided having like a weird pseudo

1638
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,119
similarity but not quite hitting the

1639
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,039
mark um but you could like just fall

1640
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,480
flat where just like a personality or a

1641
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,400
you know character emotion just didn't

1642
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,838
feel right and so it actually mirrored

1643
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,200
very closely to kind of the iterations

1644
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:54,798
that a character director of pixar would

1645
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,598
have where you're

1646
00:54:54,798 --> 00:55:00,000
running through it and you can virtually

1647
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,920
kind of like see what it'll look like we

1648
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,239
we created a plug-in to where we

1649
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,599
actually used like like maya the sim you

1650
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:07,199
know the animation tools and then we

1651
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,240
created a plug-in that

1652
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,239
perfectly

1653
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:11,838
matched it uh to the physical one and so

1654
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,159
you could like test it out virtually and

1655
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,358
then push a button and see it physically

1656
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:16,719
play out and there's like subtle

1657
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:18,318
differences and so you want to like make

1658
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:20,558
sure that that feedback loop is super

1659
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:23,199
easy to be able to test it live

1660
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,519
um and then sometimes like

1661
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:27,358
you would just feel it that it's right

1662
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,838
and intuitively no and then you'd also

1663
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:32,400
do we did user testing but

1664
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:34,798
it was very very often that like the

1665
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,880
into like if we found it magical it

1666
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:38,559
would scale and be magical uh more

1667
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,680
broadly there were not too many cases

1668
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,119
where like

1669
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:43,679
like we were pretty decent about not

1670
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,880
like getting to it you know geeking out

1671
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,519
or getting too attached to something

1672
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,280
that was super unique to us um but

1673
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,039
trying to kind of like you know put a

1674
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,200
customer hat on and does it truly kind

1675
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,039
of feel magical and so in a lot of ways

1676
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:56,558
we just give a lot of um

1677
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:59,519
autonomy to the

1678
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,200
character team to really think about the

1679
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:02,719
you know character board and mood boards

1680
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,078
and storyboards and like what's the

1681
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,078
background of this character and how

1682
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,599
would they react um and they went

1683
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,200
through a process that's actually pretty

1684
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,838
familiar but now had to operate under

1685
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:14,318
these unique constraints um but

1686
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:16,000
the moment where it felt right um

1687
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:17,679
kind of took a fairly similar journey

1688
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,199
than like a as a character in an

1689
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:20,719
animated film actually it's quite cool

1690
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,078
well the the thing that's really

1691
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:24,239
important to me and i wonder if it's

1692
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,000
possible well i hope it's possible

1693
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:27,199
pretty sure it's possible is

1694
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,519
for me

1695
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:32,000
even though i know how it works

1696
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,798
to make sure there's sufficient

1697
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,159
randomness in the process yeah

1698
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:37,838
probably because it would be machine

1699
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,519
learning based

1700
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,119
that i'm surprised

1701
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:43,119
that i don't i'm surprised by certain

1702
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,358
reactions i'm surprised by certain

1703
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,119
communication maybe that's in a form of

1704
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:49,358
a question

1705
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:52,240
um were you surprised by certain things

1706
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:55,199
cosmo did like certain interactions

1707
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:57,118
yeah we made it intentionally like

1708
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,439
uh so that there would be some surprise

1709
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,480
then like a decent amount of variability

1710
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,159
in how

1711
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,719
he'd respond in certain circumstances

1712
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:08,318
and so in the end like it's um

1713
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:10,639
this is this isn't general ai this is a

1714
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:12,558
giant like spectrum and library of like

1715
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,920
parametrized kind of emotional responses

1716
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,280
and an emotional engine that would like

1717
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,000
kind of map

1718
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,359
your current state of the game your

1719
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,119
emotions the world the people are

1720
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:23,519
playing with you all so forth to what's

1721
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,599
happening um but we could make it feel

1722
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:29,280
spontaneous by creating enough

1723
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:31,119
diversity uh and randomness uh but still

1724
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,440
within the bounds of what felt felt like

1725
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,798
very realistic um to make that work and

1726
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,240
then what was really neat is that we

1727
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:38,798
could get statistics on how much of that

1728
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,239
space we were saturating um and then add

1729
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:42,000
more animations and more diversity in

1730
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,078
the places that would get hit more often

1731
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,559
so that you stay ahead of the um you

1732
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,960
know the curve and maximize the uh the

1733
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:51,040
chance that it it stays feeling alive um

1734
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,559
and so but then when you like combine it

1735
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:54,400
like

1736
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,760
the permutations and kind of like the

1737
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,760
combinations of emotions stitched

1738
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,599
together sometimes surprised us because

1739
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,520
you see them in isolation but when you

1740
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,119
actually see them and you see them live

1741
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:04,798
you know relative to some event that

1742
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,240
happened in the game or whatnot like it

1743
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:08,480
was kind of cool to see the combination

1744
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:09,919
of the two and um uh and not too

1745
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,440
different in other robotics applications

1746
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,519
where like you get you get so used to

1747
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,119
thinking about like the modules of a

1748
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:16,239
system and how things progress through a

1749
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,079
tech stack

1750
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:19,439
that the real magic is when all the

1751
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,318
pieces come together and you start

1752
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,119
getting

1753
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,318
the right emergent behavior um in a way

1754
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,920
that's easy to lose when you just kind

1755
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,279
of go too deep into any one piece of it

1756
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,119
yeah when the system is sufficiently

1757
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,480
complex there is something like emergent

1758
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,838
behavior and that's where the magic is

1759
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,920
you as a human being you can still

1760
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:36,078
appreciate the beauty of that magic of

1761
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,000
the fine at the system level first of

1762
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,599
all thank you for humoring me on this uh

1763
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,119
it's really really

1764
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,200
uh fascinating i think a lot of people

1765
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:46,160
would love this i i'd love to just one

1766
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:50,318
last thing on the butter robot i promise

1767
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:53,279
in terms of uh speech yeah

1768
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:56,079
cosmo is able to communicate so much

1769
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,400
with just movement and face

1770
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:01,680
do you think speech

1771
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:04,960
is too much of a degree of freedom

1772
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:06,480
like a speech a feature or a bug of uh

1773
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,318
deep

1774
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,880
uh interaction

1775
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:12,159
emotional interaction yeah

1776
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,318
for a product

1777
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:16,000
it's too deep right now it's just not

1778
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:17,519
real uh it would immediately break the

1779
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,039
fiction because the state of the art is

1780
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:22,559
just not good enough um and

1781
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,159
that's on top of just narrowing down the

1782
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,519
demographic where like the way you speak

1783
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:27,358
to an adult versus a way speak to a

1784
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:30,559
child is very different

1785
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:33,358
yet a dog is able to appeal to everybody

1786
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:36,720
and so right now there is no speech

1787
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:39,440
system that is like rich enough and and

1788
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:41,598
subtly realistic enough to feel

1789
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,119
appropriate um and so we very very

1790
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,359
quickly kind of like moved away from it

1791
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,519
now speech understanding is a different

1792
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:50,480
matter where understanding intent that's

1793
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,280
a really valuable input um

1794
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,838
but

1795
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,920
giving it back requires like a you know

1796
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:57,119
way way higher bar given kind of where

1797
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,200
today's

1798
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,480
world is and so

1799
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:02,318
that realization that you can do

1800
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,480
surprisingly much with

1801
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:06,798
uh either no speech or kind of tonal

1802
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:09,599
like the way you know wally r2d2 and

1803
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:11,759
kind of other characters are able to um

1804
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,000
it's quite powerful and it generalizes

1805
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,520
um across cultures and across ages

1806
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,639
really really well i think we're going

1807
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:18,880
to be in that

1808
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:20,400
world for a little while where it's

1809
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,960
still very much an unsolved problem on

1810
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,960
how to like make something it touches on

1811
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,559
kenny valley thing so if you have legs

1812
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,079
and you're a big humanoid looking thing

1813
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,760
you have very different expectations and

1814
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,160
a much narrower degree of what's going

1815
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,200
to be acceptable by society than if

1816
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,960
you're a you know robot like uh like

1817
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,719
cosmo or wall and you can or some other

1818
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,639
form where you can kind of like reinvent

1819
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,558
the character speech has that same

1820
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:44,798
property where speech is so well

1821
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,960
understood um in terms of expectations

1822
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:48,960
by humans that you have far less

1823
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,440
flexibility on how to deviate from that

1824
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,519
and lean into your strengths and avoid

1825
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,200
weaknesses but i wonder if there is

1826
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:58,159
obviously there's certain kinds of

1827
01:00:55,199 --> 01:01:00,239
speech that

1828
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:02,719
activates the uncanny valley and breaks

1829
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:04,959
the illusion faster so

1830
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:06,558
i guess my intuition is

1831
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,960
we will solve

1832
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:11,680
certain we would be able to

1833
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,240
create some speech-based personalities

1834
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:16,159
sooner than others so for example i

1835
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:19,039
could i could think of

1836
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:21,440
a robot that doesn't know english and is

1837
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:23,759
learning english right yeah those kinds

1838
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,200
of personalities where you're like uh

1839
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,760
you're intentionally kind of like

1840
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,118
getting a toddler level of uh speech so

1841
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,920
that's exactly right so you can have

1842
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,119
like

1843
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,280
uh

1844
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,640
tie it into the experience where uh it

1845
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,720
is a more limited character or you

1846
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:39,279
embrace the lack of emotions as part or

1847
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:41,118
the lack of sorry dynamic range in the

1848
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,798
speech kind of capabilities emotions as

1849
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,838
like part of the character itself and

1850
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:46,400
you've seen that in like kind of

1851
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:49,759
fictional characters as well yeah um but

1852
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,440
that's why this podcast works and

1853
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,880
yeah like you kind of had that with like

1854
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,480
um i don't know i guess like you know

1855
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,760
data and some of the other yeah

1856
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:00,159
like um but yeah so you have to and that

1857
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:03,520
becomes a constraint that lets you

1858
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:07,838
meet the bar um see i i honestly think

1859
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,599
like also if you add uh drunk

1860
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:12,239
and angry

1861
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,599
that gives you more constraints that

1862
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,000
allow you to be

1863
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:18,160
dumber from an nlp perspective like

1864
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,639
there's certain aspects so if you modify

1865
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:22,318
human behavior like let's just so forget

1866
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,679
the sort of artificial thing where you

1867
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:27,679
don't know english toddler thing

1868
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:28,879
we if you just look at the full range of

1869
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,519
humans

1870
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:34,960
i think we there's certain

1871
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:38,400
situations where we put up

1872
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,559
with uh like lower level of intelligence

1873
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,240
in our communication like if somebody's

1874
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,680
drunk we understand this issue that

1875
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:45,519
they're probably under the influence

1876
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,598
like we understand that they're not

1877
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:49,038
going to be making any sense anger is

1878
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:51,838
another one like that i'm sure there's a

1879
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:54,400
lot of other kind of situation

1880
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:56,480
yeah maybe uh yeah again language loss

1881
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,798
in translation

1882
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,960
that kind of stuff that i think if you

1883
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:02,639
if you play with that

1884
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,318
uh what is it the ukrainian boy that

1885
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:05,679
passed the touring test you know play

1886
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:06,880
with those ideas i think that's really

1887
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:08,639
interesting and then you can create

1888
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,880
compelling characters but you're right

1889
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:12,798
that's a dangerous sort of road to walk

1890
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,400
because uh you're adding degrees of

1891
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,239
freedom that can get you in trouble yeah

1892
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,480
and that's why like you have these um

1893
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:20,879
big pushes that like for most of the

1894
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,599
last decade plus like where you'd have

1895
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,039
like

1896
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,798
full like

1897
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,559
human replicas of robots really being

1898
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:29,838
down to like skin and like kind of in

1899
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,839
some places um

1900
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:35,118
my personal feeling is like man like

1901
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:38,400
that's not the direction that's most

1902
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:40,640
fruitful right now um beautiful art yeah

1903
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,119
it's not in terms of a

1904
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:45,519
uh rich deep fulfilling experience yeah

1905
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:48,160
you're right yeah and the way creating a

1906
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:49,679
minefield of potential places to feel

1907
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:51,279
off uh

1908
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:52,558
and then and then you're sidestepping

1909
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,319
where like the biggest kind of

1910
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,039
functional ai challenges are to actually

1911
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:56,239
have

1912
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,440
you know kind of like really rich

1913
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,759
productivity that actually kind of

1914
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,039
justifies a you know kind of the higher

1915
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,799
price points and that's that's part of

1916
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:04,240
the challenges like yeah like robots are

1917
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:05,599
going to get to like thousands of

1918
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:07,118
dollars tens of thousands of dollars and

1919
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,960
so forth but you can imagine what sort

1920
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,519
of expectation of value that comes with

1921
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,440
it um and so that's where

1922
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:16,400
you want to be able to invest the

1923
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,798
the the time and uh and depth and so

1924
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,680
going down the full human replica route

1925
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:22,239
um

1926
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:23,519
creates a gigantic uh

1927
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,959
uh

1928
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:29,280
distraction and really really high bar

1929
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,798
that can end up sucking up so much of

1930
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,680
your resources

1931
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:36,000
so it's weird to say but you happen to

1932
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:38,838
be one of the greatest at this point

1933
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,159
roboticist ever because you

1934
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:44,078
created this little guy you were part

1935
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:45,519
obviously of a great team that created

1936
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,119
the the little guy with a deep

1937
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:48,798
personality

1938
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,318
and they're now

1939
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:52,880
switching to

1940
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:54,960
an entirely well maybe not entirely but

1941
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,920
a different

1942
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,599
fascinating impactful robotics problem

1943
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,760
which is autonomous driving and more

1944
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,519
specifically the biggest version of

1945
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,720
autonomous driving which is autonomous

1946
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:08,318
trucking

1947
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:11,919
so you are at waymo now can you give us

1948
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:14,798
a big picture overview what is waymo

1949
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,960
what is waymo driver what is waymo one

1950
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:18,960
what is waymo via

1951
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,559
can you give an overview of the company

1952
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,199
and the vision behind the company for

1953
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,559
sure waymo by the way it's just it's

1954
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,038
been eye-opening on just how incredible

1955
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,200
that that people and the talent is and

1956
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,039
how in one company you almost have to

1957
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:32,798
create i don't know 30 companies worth

1958
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,480
of like technology and capability to

1959
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:36,480
like kind of solve the full spectrum of

1960
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,559
it so um

1961
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,719
yeah so i've been at weymouth since um

1962
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:44,480
2019 so about two and a half years so

1963
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:46,480
waymo is uh focused on building what we

1964
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,639
call a driver which is

1965
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,440
creating the ability to have autonomous

1966
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:54,318
driving across different environments

1967
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,119
vehicle platforms domains and use cases

1968
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,358
uh

1969
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:59,599
you know as you know got started in uh

1970
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:01,119
2009 it was a lot almost like an

1971
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,119
immediate successor to the grand

1972
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,920
challenge and urban challenges that were

1973
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,400
like incredible uh kind of catalyst for

1974
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,680
this whole space um and so google

1975
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,680
started this project and then eventually

1976
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:14,798
waymo spun out and so what waymo is

1977
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:17,118
doing is creating uh the

1978
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:18,719
systems both you know hardware software

1979
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:21,200
infrastructure and everything that goes

1980
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:23,519
into it to enable and to commercialize

1981
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:25,679
autonomous driving this hits on consumer

1982
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:28,559
transportation and ride sharing and kind

1983
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:30,399
of vehicles and urban environments

1984
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,640
and as you mentioned it hits on

1985
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,559
autonomous trucking to

1986
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:35,519
to transport goods so in a lot of ways

1987
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,440
it's transporting people and

1988
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:39,838
transporting goods um but at the end of

1989
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,079
the day the underlying capabilities are

1990
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:45,119
required to do that are surprisingly

1991
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:47,599
better aligned than one might expect

1992
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,880
where it's the fundamentals of um of

1993
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,640
being able to understand the world

1994
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,358
around you process it make intelligent

1995
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:55,519
decisions and prove that we are at a

1996
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:57,519
level of safety that enables uh

1997
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:00,719
large-scale autonomy so from a branding

1998
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:03,038
perspective sort of uh waymo driver is

1999
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:04,480
the system that's irrespective of a

2000
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,839
particular

2001
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,000
uh

2002
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:10,400
vehicle it's operating in there you have

2003
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,119
a set of sensors that perceive the world

2004
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,400
can act in that world and move this

2005
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,079
whatever the vehicle is what's that

2006
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,039
legal platform that's right and so in

2007
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,960
the same way that you have a driver's

2008
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,480
license and like your ability to drive

2009
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,079
isn't tied to a particular make and

2010
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,440
model of a car and of course there's

2011
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,160
special licenses for other types of

2012
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:28,318
vehicles but the fundamentals of a human

2013
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:29,920
driver very very large you carry over

2014
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:31,920
and then there's uniquenesses related to

2015
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,880
a particular environment or domain or a

2016
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,680
particular um vehicle type that kind of

2017
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,920
add some extra additive challenges but

2018
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:42,480
that's exactly right it's the underlying

2019
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,318
systems that enable uh

2020
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,280
a physical vehicle without a human

2021
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:49,440
driver to uh very successfully

2022
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,400
accomplish the tasks that previously um

2023
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,639
what wasn't possible um without um you

2024
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,760
know 100 human driving

2025
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:58,318
and then there's

2026
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:00,240
way more one which is the transporting

2027
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:02,960
people that's right from a brand

2028
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,959
perspective and just in case we refer to

2029
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,838
it so people know and then there's waymo

2030
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:10,079
via which is the trucking component why

2031
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:12,000
via by the way what is that what is that

2032
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:15,519
what's is it just like a cool sounding

2033
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,880
name that just yeah uh like is there

2034
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:18,560
does there an interesting story there

2035
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,838
just it is a pretty cool sounding name

2036
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,199
it's a cool sounding name i mean when

2037
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:22,960
you think about it it's just like well

2038
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:24,960
we're gonna transport it via this and

2039
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,279
that like so it's just kind of like an

2040
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,279
allusion to um the mechanics of

2041
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,120
transporting something yes cool um and

2042
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,080
uh and it is a pretty good grouping and

2043
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:34,399
the interesting thing is that even the

2044
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:35,920
groupings kind of bore where waymo one

2045
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,759
is like human transportation and uh

2046
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,920
there's a fully autonomous service in

2047
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,520
the phoenix area that like every day is

2048
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,359
transporting people and it's pretty

2049
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,359
incredible to like just you know see

2050
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,520
that operate at reasonably large scale

2051
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:50,239
and just kind of happen and then on the

2052
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,799
via side it doesn't even have to be

2053
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:55,599
like long-haul trucking is a like a

2054
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:57,920
major focus of uh of ours but down the

2055
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,359
road you can stitch together the vehicle

2056
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,600
transportation as well for local

2057
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,440
delivery um also and a lot of this

2058
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,039
requirements for local delivery overlap

2059
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,639
very heavily with consumer

2060
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:08,560
transportation um

2061
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,560
obviously uh you know given that you're

2062
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:12,080
operating on a lot of the same roads um

2063
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,759
and uh

2064
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:15,759
and navigating the same safety

2065
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:18,798
challenges and so um

2066
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:21,039
yeah and wave mode very much is a

2067
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:21,838
multi-product company that

2068
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:23,359
has

2069
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:24,960
ambitions in both they have different

2070
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,199
challenges and both are tremendous

2071
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,600
opportunities but the cool thing is is

2072
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:31,519
that there's a huge amount of leverage

2073
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:35,039
and this kind of core technology stack

2074
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,560
now gets pushed on by both sides and

2075
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:38,880
that adds its own unique challenges but

2076
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,440
the success case is that um the

2077
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:44,000
challenges that you push on um they get

2078
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,358
leveraged across all platforms and also

2079
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,039
from an engineering perspective the

2080
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,960
teams are integrated

2081
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:50,798
it's a mix so there's a huge amount of

2082
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,399
centralized kind of core teams that

2083
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:54,079
support all applications and so you

2084
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,359
think of something like the hardware

2085
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:56,800
team that develops the lasers the

2086
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:58,559
compute integrates into vehicle

2087
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,800
platforms this is an experience that

2088
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,320
carries over across um you know any

2089
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,079
application that we'd have and they have

2090
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:06,719
been flow with both then there's like

2091
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:09,039
really unique um perception challenges

2092
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:11,039
planning challenges like other you know

2093
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:12,560
types of challenges where there's a huge

2094
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:13,920
amount of leverage on a cortex stack but

2095
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,520
then there's like dedicated teams that

2096
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,279
think of how do you deal with a unique

2097
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,360
challenge for example

2098
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:20,960
an articulated trailer with varying

2099
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:22,639
loads that completely changes the

2100
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,719
physical dynamics of a vehicle that

2101
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,079
doesn't exist on a car but becomes one

2102
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:28,319
of the most important

2103
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:29,760
kind of unique new challenges on a truck

2104
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:32,479
so

2105
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,079
what's the long-term dream

2106
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:35,839
of waymo via

2107
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:38,000
uh the autonomous trucking effort that

2108
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,679
waymo is doing yeah so we're starting

2109
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,960
with developing

2110
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,560
uh

2111
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,239
l4 autonomy for

2112
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,600
class 8 trucks these are 53-foot

2113
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:47,759
trailers that

2114
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,039
capture like a big perc a pretty sizable

2115
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,800
percentage of the good transportation in

2116
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:52,560
the country

2117
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,119
long term the opportunity is obviously

2118
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,159
to expand to much more diverse types of

2119
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:58,800
vehicles

2120
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:00,799
types of good transportation and start

2121
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,199
to really expand in both the volume and

2122
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,440
the route feasibility that's possible

2123
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:06,879
and so just like we did on the car side

2124
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:09,359
you start with

2125
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:12,319
a single route with a very specific

2126
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:14,079
operating kind of domain and constraints

2127
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:16,399
that allow you to solve the problem but

2128
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:17,840
then over time you start to really try

2129
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:19,679
to push

2130
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,640
against those boundaries and open up

2131
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:24,480
deeper feasibility across routes across

2132
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,480
surface streets across environmental

2133
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:28,559
conditions across the type of goods that

2134
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:29,678
you carry the versatility of those goods

2135
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,600
and how

2136
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:33,359
little supervision is necessary to just

2137
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,239
start to scale this network

2138
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:36,399
and

2139
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:38,799
long term there's actually it's a pretty

2140
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:40,399
incredible enabler where um

2141
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,000
you know today you have

2142
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:44,639
already a giant shortage of truck

2143
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,399
drivers it's uh over 80 000 truck driver

2144
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,640
shortage that's expected to grow to

2145
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:49,920
hundreds of thousands in the years ahead

2146
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,079
you have

2147
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,760
really really quickly increasing demand

2148
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:55,840
from e-commerce and just just

2149
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,880
distribution of uh where people are

2150
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,840
located

2151
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,679
um you have one of the deepest safety

2152
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,319
challenges of um

2153
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,000
of any profession in the u.s where um

2154
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:08,079
there's a

2155
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,920
huge huge kind of challenge around

2156
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:11,679
fatigue and around kind of the long

2157
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,199
routes that are driven

2158
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,640
and even beyond kind of the cost and

2159
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:16,000
necessity of it

2160
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,239
there are fundamental constraints built

2161
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,679
into our logistics network that are tied

2162
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:21,919
to

2163
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,840
the type of human constraints and

2164
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,000
regulatory constraints that are

2165
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,000
tied to trucking today for example our

2166
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,238
limits on how long a driver can be

2167
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,840
driving in a single day

2168
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:33,198
before they're they're not allowed to

2169
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,279
drive anymore which is a very important

2170
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:36,719
safety constraint

2171
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:38,639
what that does is it enforces

2172
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,279
limitations on how far

2173
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,880
jumps with a single driver could be and

2174
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:44,880
makes you very subject to availability

2175
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,400
of drivers which influences where

2176
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,679
warehouses are built which influences

2177
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:50,960
how goods are transported which

2178
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:52,480
influences costs and so um

2179
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,800
you start to have an opportunity on

2180
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:57,119
everything from plugging into existing

2181
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,520
fleets and brokerages and the existing

2182
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:02,399
logistics network and just immediately

2183
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,400
start to have a huge opportunity to add

2184
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:05,198
value from

2185
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:07,920
you know

2186
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:10,238
cost and driving fuel insurance and

2187
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,760
safety standpoint all the way to

2188
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:14,079
completely reinventing the logistics

2189
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,360
network um across the united states and

2190
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:16,960
enabling something completely different

2191
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:17,679
than what it looks like today yeah i had

2192
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:19,279
uh

2193
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:21,359
be published before this had a great

2194
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:23,359
conversation with steve vicelli who we

2195
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:24,799
talked about the manual driving and he

2196
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:27,039
echoed many of the same things that you

2197
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,560
were talking about but we talked about

2198
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,640
much of the

2199
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,280
the fascinating human stories of truck

2200
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,000
drivers he was also was a truck driver

2201
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:35,840
for

2202
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,520
for a bit as a grad student to try to

2203
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,960
understand the depth of the problem he's

2204
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,560
a fascinating wives

2205
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,239
we have some drivers that have 4 million

2206
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,640
miles of lifetime driving experience

2207
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:46,479
it's pretty incredible and um

2208
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,760
yeah it's uh

2209
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:49,599
yeah learning from them like some of

2210
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,760
them are on the road for 300 days a year

2211
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,199
it's a very unique type of lifestyle so

2212
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,719
there's fascinating stuff there just

2213
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:55,678
like you said there's a shortage of

2214
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:58,560
actually

2215
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,319
people uh truck drivers

2216
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,600
taking the job counter to what this i

2217
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,599
think is publicly believed

2218
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:08,479
so there's an excess of jobs and a

2219
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:10,238
shortage of people to take up those jobs

2220
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:12,079
and just like you said it's such a

2221
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:14,158
difficult problem

2222
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:16,238
and these are experts at driving it's

2223
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:17,679
solving this particular problem and it's

2224
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:18,959
fascinating to learn from them to

2225
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,520
understand

2226
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,719
you know how hard is this problem and

2227
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,480
that's the question i want to ask you

2228
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,600
from a perception from a robotics

2229
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:27,919
perspective

2230
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,480
what's your sense of how difficult is

2231
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,480
autonomous trucking maybe

2232
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:34,319
you can comment on which scenarios are

2233
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,238
super difficult which are more

2234
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:39,039
manageable is there is there a way to

2235
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:41,759
kind of convert into words

2236
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:43,840
how difficult the problem is yeah it's a

2237
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,840
good question so there's um

2238
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:48,960
and as you can expect it's a mix some

2239
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,319
things become a lot uh uh

2240
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,719
a lot

2241
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:55,279
easier or at least more flexible um some

2242
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:57,359
things are harder and so you know on the

2243
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:59,279
things that are like uh the tailwinds

2244
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,559
the benefits um

2245
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:02,800
a big focus of

2246
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,239
automating trucking especially initially

2247
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,079
is really focusing on the long-haul

2248
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:08,079
freeway stretch of it where that's where

2249
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:09,600
a majority of the value is captured on a

2250
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:11,679
freeway you have a lot more structure

2251
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,000
and a lot more consistency across

2252
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:15,520
freeways across the u.s

2253
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,198
compared to surface streets where you

2254
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,800
have a way higher dimensionality of what

2255
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:22,319
can happen lack of structural lack of

2256
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,920
consistency and variability across

2257
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:26,399
cities so you can leverage that

2258
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,880
consistency to

2259
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:31,519
tackle at least in that respect a more

2260
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,520
constrained ai problem which has some

2261
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,560
benefits to it um you can itemize much

2262
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,159
more of the sort of things you might

2263
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,400
encounter and so forth and so

2264
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:39,599
those are benefits is there a canonical

2265
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:41,599
freeway

2266
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,800
and city we should be thinking about

2267
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,320
like

2268
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,920
is there is there a standard thing

2269
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:48,960
that's brought up in conversation often

2270
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,279
like here's a stretch of road

2271
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,800
um what is it like when people talk

2272
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:54,319
about traveling across country they'll

2273
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,520
talk about

2274
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:59,519
new york this is san francisco

2275
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,239
is that the route like is there a

2276
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,280
stretch of road that's like nice and

2277
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:05,039
clean

2278
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:06,639
and then there's like cities with

2279
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:08,479
difficulties in them that you kind of

2280
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,960
think of as the canonical problem to

2281
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:13,198
solve here right uh so starting with the

2282
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,198
car side um

2283
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:17,599
well waymo very intentionally picked the

2284
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:20,000
phoenix area and the san francisco area

2285
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,520
as a follow once we hit driverless where

2286
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,920
when you think of consumer

2287
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,840
transportation and ride sharing you know

2288
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,679
kind of economy a big percentage of that

2289
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,520
market is captured in the densest cities

2290
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:31,199
in the united states and so really

2291
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,520
pushing out and solving san francisco

2292
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:35,519
becomes a really huge opportunity and uh

2293
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,679
importance and um

2294
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,719
and you know places one dot on kind of

2295
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,520
like the spectrum of like kind of

2296
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,640
complexity uh the phoenix area starting

2297
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,480
with chandler and then like kind of

2298
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,880
expanding more broadly in the phoenix uh

2299
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:49,839
metropolitan area it's i believe the

2300
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:51,600
fastest growing city in the us it's a uh

2301
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,960
kind of a higher medium-sized city but

2302
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,199
growing quickly

2303
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,640
and still captures a really wide range

2304
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:58,639
of kind of like complexities and so

2305
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,159
getting to driverless there actually

2306
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,920
exposes you a lot of the building blocks

2307
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:04,479
you need for the more complicated

2308
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,079
environments and so in a lot of ways

2309
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:07,519
there's a thesis that if you start to

2310
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:09,760
kind of place a few of these kind of

2311
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,440
dots where san francisco has these types

2312
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,280
of unique challenges dense pedestrians

2313
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:14,799
all this like complexity especially when

2314
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:16,559
you get into the downtown areas and so

2315
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,079
forth and phoenix has like

2316
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,400
a really interesting kind of spectrum of

2317
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:22,399
challenges maybe you know other ones

2318
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:24,879
like la kind of add freeway focus and so

2319
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:26,559
forth you start to kind of cover the

2320
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,719
full set of features that you might

2321
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,840
expect and it becomes faster and faster

2322
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:30,640
if you have the right systems in the

2323
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,800
right

2324
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,039
organization to then open up the fifth

2325
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,360
city and intensity in the 20th city on

2326
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:39,920
trucking there's uh similar properties

2327
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:41,198
where um obviously there's uniquenesses

2328
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,960
and freeways when you get into really

2329
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:45,279
dense environments and then

2330
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:48,000
the real opportunity uh to then you know

2331
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:49,359
get even more uh value is to think about

2332
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,479
how you expand with like some of the

2333
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:52,960
service street challenges but for

2334
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:54,879
example right now we're looking um we

2335
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,439
have a big facility that we're uh

2336
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,679
finishing building in q1 in uh dallas

2337
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:01,439
area um that'll allow us to do testing

2338
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,920
from the dallas area on routes like

2339
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:06,960
dallas to houston dallas to phoenix um

2340
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:09,279
going out east and dallas to austin

2341
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,359
austin so that triangle um waymo should

2342
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:12,960
come to austin

2343
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:15,359
well waymo the car side was in austin

2344
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,520
for a while yes i know yeah come back

2345
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:19,119
yeah but uh trucking is actually texas

2346
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,880
is one of the best places to start uh

2347
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:23,439
because of both volume regulatory

2348
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,679
weather there's a lot of benefits um on

2349
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:29,039
trucking a huge opportunity is port of

2350
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,880
la going east so in a lot of ways a lot

2351
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,439
of the work is to start to stitch

2352
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:35,279
together a network and converge to

2353
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:37,839
port of la where you have the biggest

2354
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:39,840
port in the united states um and the

2355
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:42,000
amount of goods going east from there is

2356
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,600
pretty tremendous and then obviously

2357
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,039
there's you know kind of channels

2358
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,960
everywhere and you have extra

2359
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:48,800
complexities as you get into like snow

2360
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,719
and inclement weather and so forth but

2361
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,719
um what's interesting about trucking is

2362
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:54,158
every single route segment that you add

2363
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,760
increases the value of the whole network

2364
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:57,279
and so it has this kind of network

2365
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,719
effect and cumulative effect that's very

2366
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:00,479
unique and so there's all these

2367
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:02,399
dimensions that we think about um and so

2368
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:03,678
in a lot of ways dallas has a really

2369
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:05,439
unique hub that opens up a lot of

2370
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:07,279
options has become a really valuable

2371
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:08,719
weber so the million questions i get

2372
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:11,519
asked first of all

2373
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:13,439
you mentioned level four

2374
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,239
for people who totally don't know

2375
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:19,678
there's these levels of automation

2376
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:21,759
that uh level four refers to uh

2377
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:24,239
kind of the first step that you could

2378
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,800
recognize is fully autonomous driving

2379
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:28,799
level five is really fully autonomous

2380
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,560
driving level four is kind of fully

2381
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,880
autonomous driving and then there are

2382
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:35,280
specific definitions depending on who

2383
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,920
you ask what that actually means but

2384
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:40,479
for you what does the level four mean

2385
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,480
and you mentioned freeway let's say like

2386
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:44,718
there's three parts of long-haul

2387
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:46,639
trucking maybe i'm wrong in this but

2388
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,840
there's freeway driving

2389
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,679
there's like

2390
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:51,360
truck stop

2391
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:55,119
and then there's

2392
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:57,519
more urban-y type of area so which of

2393
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:59,439
those do you want to tackle

2394
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,360
which of them do you include under level

2395
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:03,279
four like how do you think about this

2396
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:04,880
problem what do you focus on where's the

2397
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:05,759
biggest impact to be had in the short

2398
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,679
term

2399
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,280
so the goal is to we get we got to get

2400
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,880
to market as fast as we can because the

2401
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:12,479
moment you get the market you just learn

2402
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,880
so much and it influences everything

2403
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:16,638
that you do and it is um

2404
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,440
uh i mean one of the experiences that

2405
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:20,960
carried over from before is that you add

2406
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:22,559
constraints you figure out the right

2407
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,719
compromises you do whatever it takes

2408
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,800
because getting the market like is so

2409
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:28,158
critical right and here with autonomous

2410
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,079
driving you can get to market in so many

2411
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:32,000
different ways that's right and so one

2412
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:34,158
of the simplified simplifications that

2413
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,600
we intentionally have put on is using

2414
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:36,799
what we call transfer hubs where you can

2415
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,120
imagine

2416
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,920
depots uh that are

2417
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:41,599
uh

2418
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,760
at the entry points to metropolitan

2419
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:46,480
areas like let's say dallas like the hub

2420
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,320
that we're building which does a few

2421
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:50,079
things that are very valuable so from a

2422
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:52,238
first product standpoint you can

2423
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:55,359
automate transfer hub to transfer hub

2424
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:56,158
and that path from the transfer hub to

2425
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,399
the

2426
01:20:56,158 --> 01:21:00,319
you know the full freeway route can be a

2427
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:02,079
very intentional single route that you

2428
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:03,439
can select for the features that you

2429
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:05,840
feel you want to handle at that point in

2430
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:07,678
time then you build the hub

2431
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,800
specifically designed

2432
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:10,079
for time tracking and that's what's

2433
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,520
going to happen actually like and you

2434
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:12,399
get you need to come out in january and

2435
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,239
check it out because it's going to be

2436
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:17,679
really cool it's the not only is it our

2437
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:20,559
main operating um headquarters for our

2438
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:22,639
fleet there but it will be the first uh

2439
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,480
fully ground-up design driverless hub

2440
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:26,400
for autonomous drivers autonomous trucks

2441
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:27,839
in terms of where do they enter where do

2442
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:29,279
they depart how do you think about the

2443
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,119
flow of people goods everything it's

2444
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:32,639
like it's quite cool and it's really

2445
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:35,279
beautiful on how it's thought through

2446
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:36,960
and so early on it is totally reasonable

2447
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:39,679
to do the last

2448
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,198
five miles manually to get to the final

2449
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:42,639
kind of depot to avoid having to solve

2450
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:44,799
the general surface street problem which

2451
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:48,159
is obviously very complex now when the

2452
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:49,279
time comes and we are increasingly we're

2453
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:50,559
already we're pushing on some of this

2454
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,639
but we will increasingly be pushing on

2455
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,719
surface street capabilities to build out

2456
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,159
the value chain to go all the way deeper

2457
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,239
to depot instead of transfer hub the

2458
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:59,599
transfer hub and we have probably the

2459
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:01,039
best advantages in the world because of

2460
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,280
all the waymo experience on surface

2461
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:05,198
streets but that's not the highest roi

2462
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:07,119
right now where the highest roi is

2463
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:09,359
hub the hub and get the routes going and

2464
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:12,000
so when you ask what's l4

2465
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:13,359
l4 can be applied to any domain

2466
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,960
operating domain or scope but it's

2467
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:17,759
effectively for the places where we say

2468
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,439
we're ready for autonomous operation we

2469
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:23,440
are 100

2470
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:26,399
operating uh with uh through the as a

2471
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:28,879
self-driving truck with no uh human

2472
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:30,000
behind the wheel that is l4 autonomy and

2473
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,119
it doesn't mean that you operate in

2474
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,359
every condition it doesn't mean you

2475
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:36,559
operate on every road but for a

2476
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:38,639
particularly well-defined area uh

2477
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,480
operating conditions routes kind of

2478
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:42,000
domain you are fully autonomous and

2479
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:43,599
that's the difference between l4 and l5

2480
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,039
and most people would agree that at

2481
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,880
least any time in the foreseeable future

2482
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:48,560
l5 is just not even really worth

2483
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,480
thinking about because there's always

2484
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,039
going to be these extremes

2485
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:55,198
and so it's a race and a almost like a

2486
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:57,760
game where you think of what is the

2487
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:59,919
sequence of expanded capabilities that

2488
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:02,159
create the most value and teach us the

2489
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,760
most and create this feedback loop where

2490
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:06,000
we're building out and unlocking more

2491
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,639
and more capability over time i gotta

2492
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,198
ask you just curious so first of all i

2493
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:13,119
have to when i'm allowed to visit the

2494
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:15,198
dallas facility because it's super cool

2495
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:17,359
it's like robot

2496
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:20,079
on the giving and the receiving end it's

2497
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:21,679
the truck is a robot and the the hub is

2498
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:24,079
a robot yeah it's got to be very robot

2499
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:26,399
friendly so yeah that's great

2500
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:28,399
i will feel at home uh

2501
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:30,799
the what's the sensor suite like on the

2502
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:31,839
hub if you can just high level mention

2503
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,480
it is

2504
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:37,199
does the hub have like lidars and like

2505
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:39,039
is is it is the truck doing most of the

2506
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:41,279
intelligence or is the hub also

2507
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:43,198
intelligent yeah so most of it will be

2508
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:46,079
the truck and uh everything is like

2509
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:47,279
connected like so we uh we have our

2510
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:48,880
servers where we know exactly where

2511
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:50,479
every truck is we know exactly what's

2512
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,400
happening at a hub and so you can

2513
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:55,119
imagine like a large back-end system

2514
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:57,599
that over time starts to manage uh

2515
01:23:55,119 --> 01:24:00,319
timings goods delivery windows all these

2516
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,360
sort of things and so you don't actually

2517
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:03,759
uh

2518
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:05,119
need to um there might be special cases

2519
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,119
where that is valuable to equip some

2520
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:08,639
sensors in the hub but a majority of the

2521
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:09,840
intelligence is going to be on the truck

2522
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:12,000
because um

2523
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,760
whatever is relevant to the truck

2524
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,279
relevance should be seen by the truck

2525
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,520
and can be relayed

2526
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:19,759
uh remotely for any sort of kind of

2527
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,440
cognizance or decision making but

2528
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:24,000
there's a distinct type of workflow

2529
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:25,119
where um where do you check trucks where

2530
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,960
do you want them to enter what if

2531
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:29,279
there's many operating at once where's

2532
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:32,480
the staging area to depart how do you

2533
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:34,639
set up the flow of humans and human cars

2534
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:36,799
and traffic so that you minimize the

2535
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:38,880
interaction between humans and kind of

2536
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,239
self-driving trucks uh and then how do

2537
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,319
you even intelligently select the

2538
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:44,479
locations of these transfer hubs that

2539
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:45,920
are both really great service locations

2540
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,759
for a metropolitan area and there could

2541
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,440
be over time many of them for a

2542
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,639
metropolitan area

2543
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:54,079
while at the same time leaning into

2544
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:55,279
the path of least resistance to lean

2545
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:57,519
into your current capabilities and

2546
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:59,119
strengths so that you minimize the

2547
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,360
amount of work that's necessary to

2548
01:24:59,119 --> 01:25:03,359
unlock the next kind of big bar i have a

2549
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:06,079
million questions so first is the goal

2550
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:07,599
to have no human in the truck

2551
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:09,279
the goal is to have no human in the

2552
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,360
truck now of course right now we're

2553
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:14,639
testing with expert operators and so

2554
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:15,920
forth but um the goal is to um now there

2555
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:18,480
might be circumstances where it makes

2556
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,679
sense to have a human or uh and and

2557
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:21,919
obviously these trucks can also be

2558
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:24,000
manually driven so sometimes like our we

2559
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:27,920
talk with our fleet partners about how

2560
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:30,079
um you can buy a waymo equipped diamor

2561
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,600
truck down the road and on the routes

2562
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:33,840
that are autonomous it's autonomous on

2563
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,600
the routes that are not it's um human

2564
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:38,000
driven maybe there's l2 functionality

2565
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,440
that add safety systems and so forth but

2566
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,198
as soon as they become

2567
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:43,279
as soon as we expand in software the

2568
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:44,879
availability of driverless routes the

2569
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:47,840
hardware is forward compatible to just

2570
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:51,199
now start using them um in real time and

2571
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:53,440
so you can imagine uh this mixed use but

2572
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:55,678
at the end of the day the largest value

2573
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:57,359
proposition is where you're um able to

2574
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:59,440
have no constraints on how you can

2575
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:01,599
operate this truck um and it's 100

2576
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:03,599
autonomous with nobody inside oh that's

2577
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,199
amazing so the

2578
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,880
let me ask on the logistics front

2579
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:09,678
because you mentioned that also

2580
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:11,039
opportunity to revamp or for builds from

2581
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:12,639
scratch some of the ideas around

2582
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:14,639
logistics

2583
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:16,400
i don't want to throw too much shade but

2584
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,279
from talking to steve my understanding

2585
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:19,679
is

2586
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:22,639
logistics is not perhaps as great as it

2587
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:24,960
could be in the current uh trucking uh

2588
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:27,039
environment i'm not maybe you can break

2589
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,239
down why but there's probably competing

2590
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:30,319
companies

2591
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:32,959
there's just a mess maybe some of it is

2592
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:35,119
literally just it's old school like they

2593
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,639
it's just like it's not computer it's

2594
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:37,439
not computerized

2595
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:39,520
like

2596
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,519
truckers are almost like contractors

2597
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,120
there there's an independence and

2598
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,400
there's not a nice interface where they

2599
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:45,519
can communicate where they're going

2600
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:47,039
where they're at

2601
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,719
you know all those kinds of things and

2602
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:51,439
so there it just feels like there's so

2603
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:53,600
much opportunity to digitize everything

2604
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:56,000
to where you could optimize the use of

2605
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,159
human time optimize the use of all kinds

2606
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,760
of resources

2607
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:02,479
how much you thinking about that problem

2608
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,320
how fascinating is that problem

2609
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:06,079
how difficult does it how much

2610
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:08,079
opportunity is there to revolutionize

2611
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:10,000
the space of logistics in autonomous

2612
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:11,600
trucking in trucking period it's pretty

2613
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,359
fascinating it's uh this is one of the

2614
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,520
most motivating aspects of all this

2615
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:16,960
where like yes there's like a mountain

2616
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,560
of problems that are like you wanna you

2617
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,079
have to solve to get to like the first

2618
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,000
checkpoints and first drive list and so

2619
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:24,559
forth and inevitably like in a space

2620
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,319
like this you plug in initially into the

2621
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:28,080
existing kind of system and start to

2622
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:29,920
kind of you know learn and iterate but

2623
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:31,359
um that opportunity is massive and so

2624
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:34,480
you know a couple of the factors that um

2625
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:36,238
play into it so first of all um there's

2626
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:38,799
obviously just the physical constraints

2627
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:41,279
of driving time driver availability

2628
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:43,600
some fleets have a 95 attrition rate you

2629
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:46,079
know right now because of just

2630
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,000
this demands and like you know kind of

2631
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:49,519
gaps in competition and so forth and

2632
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,479
then it's also incredibly fragmented

2633
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,400
where

2634
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:53,599
you would be shocked at like when you

2635
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:55,359
when you look at industries like when

2636
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,719
you think of the top 10 players like the

2637
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:59,439
biggest fleets like the walmarts and

2638
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,719
fedexes and so forth the percentage of

2639
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:02,638
the overall trucking market that's

2640
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:05,520
captured by the top 10 or 50 fleets is

2641
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:08,480
surprisingly small um the average kind

2642
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:11,360
of uh truck operation is like a one to

2643
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:13,198
five truck you know family business um

2644
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:14,399
and so and so there's just like a huge

2645
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:16,960
amount of like

2646
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:19,039
fragmentation which makes for um

2647
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:21,198
really interesting challenges in kind of

2648
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:23,439
stitching together through like bulletin

2649
01:28:21,198 --> 01:28:25,119
boards and brokerages and some people

2650
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:28,799
run their own fleets and and this

2651
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:31,599
world's kind of like evolving um but

2652
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:34,480
it is one of the less digitized and

2653
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,079
optimized worlds that there is

2654
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:38,559
and the part that is optimized is

2655
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:40,319
optimized to the constraints of today

2656
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,920
and even within the constraints of today

2657
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:43,198
this is the 900 billion dollar industry

2658
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,880
in the u.s

2659
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:46,879
and it's continuing to grow it feels

2660
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,800
like from a business perspective

2661
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,400
if i were to predict

2662
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,639
that while trying to solve the

2663
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:55,439
autonomous trucking problem waymo might

2664
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:57,279
solve first the logistics problem

2665
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:59,919
like because that that would already be

2666
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:02,000
a huge impact yeah so on the way to

2667
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:04,399
solving autonomous trucking

2668
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,639
the human driven like there's so much

2669
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:09,679
opportunity to

2670
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:12,719
significantly improve the human driven

2671
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:14,560
trucking the timing the logistics so you

2672
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:17,279
use humans optimally the handoffs the

2673
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:18,719
like you know well even that you i mean

2674
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:21,039
you get really ambitious you start to

2675
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:22,480
expand this beyond like how does the uh

2676
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:24,000
fulfillment center work and like how

2677
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:25,599
does the transfer hub work how does a

2678
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,960
warehouse work to

2679
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:29,440
i mean there's a lot of opportunities to

2680
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,880
start to automate these chains and um

2681
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:33,839
a lot of the inefficiency today is

2682
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:36,000
because like you have a delay like port

2683
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,600
of la has a bunch of ships right now

2684
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,679
waiting outside of it because they can't

2685
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,600
dock because there's not enough

2686
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:43,039
labor inside of the port of la that

2687
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,400
means there's a big backlog of trucks

2688
01:29:43,039 --> 01:29:45,679
which means there's a big backlog of

2689
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:47,039
deliveries which means the drivers

2690
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,119
aren't where they need to be and so you

2691
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:51,519
have this like huge chain reaction and

2692
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:53,920
your feasibility of readjusting in this

2693
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:56,560
network is low because everything's tied

2694
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,880
to humans and manual kind of processes

2695
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,480
uh or distributed processes across a

2696
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,600
whole bunch of players

2697
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,759
and so

2698
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,360
one of the biggest enablers is um yes we

2699
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,719
have to solve autonomous trucking first

2700
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:08,479
and that by the way that's not like an

2701
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,960
overnight thing that's decades of

2702
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:13,439
continued kind of expansion and work

2703
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:16,079
but um the first checkpoint in the first

2704
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:17,599
route is like is not that far off but

2705
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:18,960
once you start enabling and you start to

2706
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,760
learn about how

2707
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,800
the

2708
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,159
constraints of autonomous trucking which

2709
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,840
are very different in the constraints of

2710
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:27,519
human trucking and again strengths and

2711
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,400
weaknesses

2712
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,360
how do you then start to leverage that

2713
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:34,638
and

2714
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:36,319
rethink a flow of goods uh more broadly

2715
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:38,400
and this is where like the learnings of

2716
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:40,319
like really partnering with some of the

2717
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:41,599
largest fleets in the us

2718
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:42,799
and the sort of

2719
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,079
learnings that they have about the

2720
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,119
industry and the sort of needs that they

2721
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:46,880
have and

2722
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:48,880
what would change if you just

2723
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,800
like really broke this one constraint

2724
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,000
that like holds up the whole network or

2725
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,960
what if you enabled this other

2726
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,319
constraint

2727
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,639
that actually drives the roadmap in a

2728
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:58,479
lot of ways because um this is not like

2729
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:59,760
an all or nothing problem it's uh you

2730
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:02,238
know you start to kind of unlock more

2731
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,480
and more functionality over time which

2732
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:06,158
functionality most enables this

2733
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:07,919
optimization ends up being kind of part

2734
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:09,920
of the discussion but you're totally

2735
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,960
right like you fast forward to like you

2736
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,000
know five years ten years uh 15 years

2737
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,719
and

2738
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,679
you think about like very generalized

2739
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:21,520
capability of automation and logistics

2740
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:23,279
as well as the ability to like poke into

2741
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,360
how those handoffs work

2742
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:27,039
the efficiency goes far beyond just

2743
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:28,960
direct cost of today's like unit

2744
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:31,439
economics of a truck they go towards

2745
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:33,920
reinventing the entire system um in the

2746
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:35,759
same way that uh you know you see you

2747
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:37,279
know these other industries that uh like

2748
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:39,600
when you get to enough scale you can

2749
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:41,840
really rethink um how you build around

2750
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,920
your new set of capabilities not

2751
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,760
the old set of capabilities yeah use the

2752
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:47,840
analogy metaphor or whatever that

2753
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:50,079
autonomous trucking is like email versus

2754
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,840
mail and then with email you're still

2755
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:53,840
doing the communication but it opens up

2756
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,159
all kinds of comm

2757
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,520
varieties of communication that

2758
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:58,638
you didn't anticipate that's right

2759
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,719
constraints are just completely

2760
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:03,199
different um and yeah there's definitely

2761
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:04,960
a property of that here um and we're

2762
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:07,119
also still learning about it because

2763
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:09,198
there there is a lot of really um

2764
01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:10,559
fascinating and sometimes really elegant

2765
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:12,079
things that the industry has done where

2766
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,320
there's companies whose entire existence

2767
01:32:12,079 --> 01:32:16,238
is around despite the constraints

2768
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:18,799
optimizing as much as they can out of it

2769
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:20,479
and those lessons do carry over but it's

2770
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,719
an interesting kind of merger of worlds

2771
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:24,238
to think about like well what if this

2772
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,520
was completely different how would we

2773
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:28,079
approach it

2774
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:30,080
and the interesting thing is that

2775
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:31,359
for a really really really long time

2776
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:32,800
it's actually going to be the merger

2777
01:32:31,359 --> 01:32:34,960
between how to use autonomy and how to

2778
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,320
use humans that leans into each each of

2779
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,800
their strengths

2780
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:40,799
yeah and then we're back to cosmo

2781
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,400
human robot interaction so and the

2782
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,239
interesting thing about waymo is because

2783
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:46,238
there's the passenger vehicle the the

2784
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:48,000
human the transportation of humans and

2785
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:49,919
transportation of goods

2786
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,039
you could see over time they might kind

2787
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,800
of

2788
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:54,800
meld together more

2789
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,800
because you you'll probably have like

2790
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,880
zero occupancy vehicles moving around so

2791
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,719
you have transportation goods for short

2792
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,639
distances and then

2793
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,079
for slightly longer distances and then

2794
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:05,760
slightly longer and then there'll be

2795
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:08,639
this then you just see the difference

2796
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:10,159
between a passenger vehicle and a truck

2797
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:12,000
is just size and you can have different

2798
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:13,519
sizes and all that kind of stuff and at

2799
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,039
the core you can have a way more driver

2800
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:16,639
that doesn't as long as you have the

2801
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:18,079
same that's sweet you can just think of

2802
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:20,079
it as one problem and that's why over

2803
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:21,760
time these do come kind of converge

2804
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:23,439
where in a lot of ways a lot of the

2805
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,880
challenges we're solving are freeway

2806
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:26,799
driving which are going to carry over

2807
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,679
very well to the vehicles to the car

2808
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,159
side

2809
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:32,319
um but there are like then unique

2810
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:33,759
challenges like uh you have a very

2811
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:35,599
different dynamics in your vehicle where

2812
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,520
you have to see much further out in

2813
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,039
order to have the proper like response

2814
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,920
time because you have an 80 000 pound

2815
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:43,679
fully loaded truck um that's a very very

2816
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:46,158
different type of braking profile than a

2817
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:48,158
than a car you have uh

2818
01:33:46,158 --> 01:33:50,799
really interesting kind of dynamic

2819
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:52,319
limits because of the trailer where you

2820
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,239
actually it's very very hard to like

2821
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:56,319
physically like flip a car or do

2822
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:58,959
something like physically like most risk

2823
01:33:56,319 --> 01:34:00,799
in a car is from just collisions um

2824
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,239
it's very hard to like in any normal

2825
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,840
operation to do something other than

2826
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:05,039
like you know unless you hit something

2827
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,279
it's actually kind of like roll over or

2828
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:08,800
something on a truck you actually have

2829
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:11,198
to drive much closer to the physical

2830
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,719
bounds of the safety limits um

2831
01:34:11,198 --> 01:34:15,678
but you actually have like

2832
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:17,439
real constraints because you could uh

2833
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:18,639
you know you could have a really

2834
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:20,158
interesting interactions between the

2835
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:22,319
cabin and the trailer yeah there's

2836
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:23,679
something called jackknifing if you turn

2837
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:25,519
you know too quickly

2838
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,560
you have roll risks and so forth and so

2839
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,320
we spend a huge amount of time

2840
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,239
understanding those boundaries and those

2841
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:32,000
boundaries change based on the load that

2842
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:33,279
you have which is also an interesting

2843
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,800
difference you have to propagate through

2844
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:37,039
the out that through the algorithm so

2845
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:39,039
that you're leveraging your dynamic

2846
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:40,319
range but always staying within the

2847
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:42,158
safety balance but understanding what

2848
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:43,439
those safety bonds are and so we have

2849
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:45,279
this like really cool test facility

2850
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:47,599
where we like take it to the max and

2851
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:49,198
actually imagine a truck with these

2852
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:51,679
giant training wheels on the back of the

2853
01:34:49,198 --> 01:34:54,319
trailer and you're pushing it past the

2854
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:56,319
safety limits uh in order to like try to

2855
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:58,158
actually see where it rolls and so you

2856
01:34:56,319 --> 01:34:59,920
you you define this high dimensional

2857
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:01,359
boundary which then gets captured in

2858
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,039
software to stay safe and actually do

2859
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:04,719
the right thing but uh it's kind of

2860
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:06,719
fascinating the sort of uh you know kind

2861
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:07,920
of challenges you have there um but then

2862
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:09,439
all of these things drive really

2863
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:10,880
interesting challenges from perception

2864
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:12,319
to um

2865
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:14,400
unique behavior prediction challenges

2866
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:17,359
and obviously in planner where you have

2867
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:19,920
to think about merging and creating gaps

2868
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:21,359
with a 53 foot trailer and so forth and

2869
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,639
then obviously the platform itself is

2870
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:24,639
very different where you have different

2871
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,239
numbers of sensors sometimes types of

2872
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:27,359
sensors and you also have unique blind

2873
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:28,638
spots that you have because of the

2874
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:30,079
trailer which you have to think about

2875
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:32,159
and so it's a really interesting

2876
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:34,719
spectrum and in the end

2877
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:37,599
you try to capture these special cases

2878
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:39,600
in a way that is cleanly augmentations

2879
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,239
of the existing tech stack

2880
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:44,159
because a majority of what we're solving

2881
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:46,959
is actually generalizable to freeway

2882
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:48,079
driving um and different platforms and

2883
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,719
over time

2884
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:52,960
they all start to kind of merge ideally

2885
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:55,118
where the things that are unique are as

2886
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:57,039
as minimal as possible and that's where

2887
01:35:55,118 --> 01:35:58,399
you get the most leverage and that's why

2888
01:35:57,039 --> 01:35:59,920
waymo can do

2889
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:01,839
you know take on two trillion dollar

2890
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:04,560
opportunities um and

2891
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:06,000
have been nowhere near 2x the cost or

2892
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,440
investment or size in fact it's much

2893
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,238
much smaller than that

2894
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:12,319
because of the high degree of leverage

2895
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:15,039
so what kind of sensor suite

2896
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:18,639
they can speak to that uh that a long

2897
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:21,118
haul truck needs to have lidar vision

2898
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:23,679
how many what are we talking about here

2899
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:25,439
yeah so it's um more than the cars so

2900
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,600
very loosely you can think of as like 2x

2901
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:30,238
but it varies depending on the sensor

2902
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,960
and so we have like dozens of cameras

2903
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:35,359
radar and then multiple lidar as well

2904
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:37,520
you'll see one difference where the cars

2905
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:39,839
have a central main sensor pod on the

2906
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:42,159
roof in the middle and then a some kind

2907
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:44,400
of hood sensors for blind spots the

2908
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:45,839
truck moves to two main sensor pods on

2909
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:48,799
the outsides where you would typically

2910
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,159
have the mirrors next to the driver

2911
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,400
they effectively go as far out as

2912
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:54,399
possible um kind of up to

2913
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:56,479
the understanding of the front

2914
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:57,839
kind of on the cabin not all the way in

2915
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:59,599
the front but like kind of where the

2916
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,039
mirrors for the driver would be and so

2917
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,639
those are the main sensor pods and the

2918
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:04,560
reason they're there is because if you

2919
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:05,920
had one in the middle the trailer is

2920
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,920
higher than the cabin and you would be

2921
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:09,440
included with this like awkward wedge

2922
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,480
too much occlusion too much occlusion

2923
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:12,399
and so then you would add a lot of

2924
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:14,479
complexity to the software yeah to make

2925
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:16,719
up for that and and just unnecessary

2926
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:18,319
components so many probably fascinating

2927
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,000
design choices really cool because you

2928
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:21,359
can probably bring up light or higher

2929
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,039
and have it in the center or something

2930
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:24,880
you could have all kinds of choices you

2931
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:26,880
have to make the decisions here yeah

2932
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,960
that ultimately probably will define the

2933
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:30,400
industry right but by having two on the

2934
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:33,520
side there's actually multiple benefits

2935
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:35,519
so one is like um you're just beyond the

2936
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:37,199
trailer so you can see fully flush with

2937
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,560
the trailer and so you eliminate most of

2938
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:40,879
your blind spot except for right behind

2939
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,400
the trailer um which is which is great

2940
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,079
because now the software carries over

2941
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:46,000
really well and the same perception

2942
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:48,319
system you use on the car side largely

2943
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,920
that architecture can carry over and you

2944
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:51,759
can retrain some models and so forth but

2945
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,600
you leverage it a lot it also actually

2946
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,199
helps with redundancy where

2947
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,119
there's a really nice built-in

2948
01:37:55,198 --> 01:37:58,960
redundancy for all the lidar cameras and

2949
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:01,599
radar where you can afford to have any

2950
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:03,840
one of them fail and you're still okay

2951
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,639
and at scale every one of them will fail

2952
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,480
um

2953
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:08,480
and you will be able to detect when one

2954
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,559
of them fails because they don't uh

2955
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:12,079
because the redundancy

2956
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,520
they're giving you the data that's

2957
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:14,880
inconsistent with the rest of that's

2958
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,239
right and it's not just like they no

2959
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,639
longer give data it could be like

2960
01:38:16,238 --> 01:38:19,599
they're fouled or they stop giving data

2961
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:21,840
where the

2962
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:23,760
some electrical thing gets cut or you

2963
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,880
know part of your compute goes down so

2964
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,480
what's neat is that like you have way

2965
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,480
more sensors part of his field of view

2966
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:30,638
and occlusions part of its redundancy

2967
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:33,839
and part of it is new use cases so

2968
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:36,239
there's um uh new types of sensors uh to

2969
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,480
optimize for long range and uh kind of

2970
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:41,759
the the the sensing horizon that we look

2971
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:43,359
for on our vehicles um that is unique to

2972
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,079
trucks because it actually is like kind

2973
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:48,238
of much like further out than um than a

2974
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:49,600
car but a majority are actually used

2975
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:51,839
across both cars and trucks and so we

2976
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:54,800
use the same compute the same uh

2977
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:58,319
fundamental baseline sensors cameras uh

2978
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:00,079
radar um imus and so you get a great

2979
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:01,599
leverage from all of the infrastructure

2980
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:04,238
and the hardware development as a result

2981
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:06,880
so what about cameras what role does so

2982
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:10,559
lidar is this rich set of information

2983
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:12,800
has its strengths um has some weaknesses

2984
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:14,800
camera is this rich source of

2985
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:16,239
information that has some strengths has

2986
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:19,199
its weaknesses

2987
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:20,959
what role does lidar play what role does

2988
01:39:19,198 --> 01:39:22,319
vision

2989
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,158
cameras play

2990
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:26,079
in this in this beautiful

2991
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:27,519
problem of autonomous trucking ah it is

2992
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:28,719
beautiful there's like so much that

2993
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:31,119
comes together

2994
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:32,639
and how much yeah at which point do they

2995
01:39:31,118 --> 01:39:34,559
come together yeah

2996
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:37,359
so let's start with lidar so lidar has

2997
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,760
been like waymo's um uh one of waymo's

2998
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:42,158
big strengths and advantages where uh we

2999
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,560
developed our own lidar uh in-house

3000
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:47,679
where many generations in both in cost

3001
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:49,920
and functionality it is um uh the best

3002
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:52,000
and you know in this in the space which

3003
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,158
generation because i know there's this

3004
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,319
there's uh this cool i mean i love

3005
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:58,238
versions that are increasing uh which

3006
01:39:56,319 --> 01:40:02,238
version of the hardware stack is at

3007
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:03,919
currently uh officially publicly uh so

3008
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:05,198
uh so some parts iterate more than

3009
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,800
others i'm trying to remember on the

3010
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:08,158
sensor side so this the entire

3011
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,079
self-driving system which includes

3012
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:12,799
sensors and compute is fifth generation

3013
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:16,000
yes um i can't wait until there's like

3014
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:18,000
iphone style like announcements yeah for

3015
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,679
like new versions of the weymouth

3016
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,960
hardware yeah well we try to be careful

3017
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,399
because man when you change the hardware

3018
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,399
it takes a lot to like retrain the

3019
01:40:22,399 --> 01:40:25,599
models and uh and everything so we just

3020
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:27,599
went through that and going from the

3021
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:29,600
pacificas to the jaguars and so the

3022
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:32,159
jaguars and then the trucks are you know

3023
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,920
have the same generation now um but yeah

3024
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:36,319
the lidar is uh it's incredible and so

3025
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,920
waymo has um leaned into that as a

3026
01:40:36,319 --> 01:40:40,000
strength and so a lot of the near-range

3027
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,840
perception system

3028
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,319
that obviously kind of carries over a

3029
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,760
lot from the car side uh uses lidar as a

3030
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:47,920
very prominent kind of like primary

3031
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,800
sensor but then obviously

3032
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,359
everything has its strengths and

3033
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:54,159
weaknesses and so in the near range

3034
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:56,238
lidar is a gigantic advantage um and it

3035
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:58,799
has its weaknesses on you know when it

3036
01:40:56,238 --> 01:41:00,479
comes to occlusions in certain areas

3037
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,480
rain and weather like you know things

3038
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,718
like that but it's an incredible sensor

3039
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:06,959
and it gives you incredible density

3040
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:09,359
perfect location precision and

3041
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,480
consistency which is a very valuable

3042
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:14,079
property um to be able to uh to kind of

3043
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:17,039
apply a mel approach can you elaborate

3044
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:19,359
consistency yeah when you have a camera

3045
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:22,158
the position of the sun the time of the

3046
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:24,000
day uh um various of the properties can

3047
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:26,158
have a big impact uh whether there's

3048
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,880
glare the field of view things like that

3049
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:30,879
um

3050
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:32,639
so consistent the signal with uh

3051
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,960
in the face of a changing external

3052
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,079
environment the signal yeah daytime

3053
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:38,399
night time

3054
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:40,639
it's about 3d um

3055
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:41,679
physical existence in effect like you're

3056
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:43,279
you're seeing

3057
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,880
beams of light that bounce physically

3058
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:46,800
bounce off of something and come back

3059
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:50,000
and so whatever the conditional

3060
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,880
conditions are like the shape of a

3061
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,399
human

3062
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:55,359
sensor reading from a human or from a

3063
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:57,279
car or from an animal like you have um a

3064
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,719
reliability there which ends up being

3065
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:00,399
valuable for kind of like the long tail

3066
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:02,079
of challenges yeah now

3067
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:03,279
lidar is the first sensor to drop off in

3068
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:05,039
terms of range and ours has a really

3069
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:07,439
good range but at the end of the day um

3070
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:09,279
it drops off and so particularly for um

3071
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:10,799
for trucks on top of the general

3072
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:12,800
redundancy that you want for near range

3073
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,560
with and complements through cameras and

3074
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,320
radar for occlusions and for

3075
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:18,080
complementary information and so forth

3076
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:21,039
when you get to long range you have to

3077
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:22,800
be radar and camera primary because your

3078
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:24,719
lidar data will fundamentally drop off

3079
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,400
after a period of time and you have to

3080
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:30,239
be able to see um kind of objects

3081
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:33,198
further out now uh cameras have uh

3082
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,799
the the incredible range um where you

3083
01:42:33,198 --> 01:42:36,559
get a high density high resolution

3084
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,880
camera you can get data you know well

3085
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:41,119
past a kilometer and it's like really um

3086
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,359
potentially a huge value now the signal

3087
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:46,559
drops off the noise is higher detecting

3088
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:48,000
is harder classifying is harder and one

3089
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:50,320
that you might think about localizing

3090
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,198
it's harder because you can be off by

3091
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:53,039
like

3092
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:54,799
two meters and where something's located

3093
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:56,000
a kilometer away and that's the

3094
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:57,360
difference between being on the shoulder

3095
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,719
and being in your lane and so you have

3096
01:42:57,359 --> 01:42:59,920
like interesting challenges there that

3097
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:02,079
you have to solve which have a bunch of

3098
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:04,000
approaches that come into it um radar is

3099
01:43:02,079 --> 01:43:05,039
interesting because um

3100
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,920
uh

3101
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:11,118
uh because it also has longer range than

3102
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:13,039
um than lidar uh and it gives you speed

3103
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:15,599
information so it becomes very very

3104
01:43:13,039 --> 01:43:19,279
useful for dynamic information of

3105
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:21,840
traffic flow uh vehicle motions animals

3106
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:25,920
pedestrians like uh just things that

3107
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:27,119
might be um useful signals um and uh

3108
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,399
it helps with weather conditions where

3109
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:30,158
radar actually penetrates weather

3110
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:32,238
conditions in a better way than um other

3111
01:43:30,158 --> 01:43:34,000
sensors and so it's just it's kind of

3112
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:35,919
interesting where we've kind of started

3113
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,600
to converge towards not thinking about a

3114
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:39,440
problem as a lidar problem or a camera

3115
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:41,440
problem or radar problem but it's a

3116
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:43,599
fusion problem where

3117
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:45,359
these are all like large scale ml

3118
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:48,480
problems where you put data into the

3119
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:50,799
system and in many cases you just look

3120
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:52,718
for the signals that might be present in

3121
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,320
the union of all of these and

3122
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:56,719
leave it to the system as much as

3123
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:58,399
possible to start to really identify how

3124
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:59,679
to um how to extract that and then

3125
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:00,638
there's places we have to intervene and

3126
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:02,319
actually

3127
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:03,920
include more but um

3128
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:05,359
no single sensor is in a great position

3129
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:08,158
to like really solve this problem and

3130
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:10,158
then without a huge extra challenge

3131
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:11,920
that's fascinating um

3132
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:14,000
there's a question that's probably still

3133
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,359
an open question is at which point do

3134
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,479
you fuse them

3135
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:17,198
do you

3136
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:19,678
do

3137
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:22,319
do you solve the perception problem for

3138
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:24,880
each sensor suite individually the

3139
01:44:22,319 --> 01:44:25,599
lighter suite and the camera suite or do

3140
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:28,159
you

3141
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:31,760
do some kind of heterogeneous fusion or

3142
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:31,759
do you fuse at the very beginning

3143
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:35,359
is there a good answer or at least an

3144
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:37,440
inkling of intuitions you can accomplish

3145
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:39,279
yeah so people refer to this as like um

3146
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:41,279
early fusion or late fusion so late

3147
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:43,439
fusion might be that you have like the

3148
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:45,759
the camera pipeline the lidar pipeline

3149
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:47,439
and then you like fuse them and like

3150
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,199
when it gets to like final

3151
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:50,719
you know semantics and classification

3152
01:44:49,198 --> 01:44:52,399
and tracking you like kind of fuse them

3153
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:54,960
together and and figure out which one's

3154
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:57,920
best um there's more and more evidence

3155
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:01,760
that um uh that early fusion is

3156
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:04,158
important um and that is because uh

3157
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,079
weight fusion does not allow you to pick

3158
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:08,319
up on the complementary strengths and

3159
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:10,880
weaknesses of the sensors um weather is

3160
01:45:08,319 --> 01:45:12,479
a great example where um if you do early

3161
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,719
fusion you have an incredibly hard

3162
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:17,678
problem for any single sensor in rain to

3163
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:20,239
solve that problem um because you have

3164
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:21,359
reflections from the lidar um you have

3165
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:22,959
uh

3166
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:25,198
you know weird kind of noise from the

3167
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:26,719
camera blah blah blah right but the

3168
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:28,238
combination of all of them can help you

3169
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:30,399
filter and help you get to the real

3170
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:32,399
signal that then gets you as close as

3171
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:34,399
possible to the original stack

3172
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:36,319
and be much more fluid about the

3173
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:38,079
strengths and weaknesses where

3174
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:40,399
um you know your camera is much more

3175
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:43,118
susceptible to like kind of uh fouling

3176
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:45,279
on the on the actual lens from

3177
01:45:43,118 --> 01:45:46,479
you know like rain or random stuff

3178
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:48,158
whereas like you might be a little bit

3179
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:50,079
more resilient than other sensors and so

3180
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:51,519
there's an element of

3181
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:54,000
logic that always happens late in the

3182
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,840
game but that fusion early on actually

3183
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,760
especially as you move towards ml and

3184
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,360
large-scale data-driven approaches just

3185
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,199
maximizes your ability to pull out the

3186
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:03,118
best signal you can out of each modality

3187
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:04,799
before you start making constraining

3188
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:07,679
decisions that end up being hard to

3189
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:09,279
unwind late in the stack so how much

3190
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:11,679
of this is a machine learning problem

3191
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:13,359
what role does ml machine learning

3192
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:15,118
playing this whole

3193
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:16,479
problem of autonomous driving autonomous

3194
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:17,839
trucking

3195
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:20,238
it's um

3196
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:22,319
massive and it's increasing over time

3197
01:46:20,238 --> 01:46:24,158
you know if you go back to um

3198
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:27,599
you know the grand challenge days in the

3199
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:30,079
early days of kind of av development

3200
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:32,000
there was ml but it was not in like kind

3201
01:46:30,079 --> 01:46:33,198
of the mass scale data style of ml it

3202
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,439
was like

3203
01:46:33,198 --> 01:46:37,118
learning models but in a more structured

3204
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:38,719
kind of way and it was a lot of

3205
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:40,559
heuristic and search-based approaches

3206
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:42,079
and planning and so forth you can make a

3207
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,840
lot of progress

3208
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:45,679
with these types of approaches kind of

3209
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,679
across the board an almost deceptive

3210
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:49,359
amount of progress we can get pretty far

3211
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:50,960
but then you re you start to really

3212
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:52,158
grind the further you get in some parts

3213
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:54,000
of stack

3214
01:46:52,158 --> 01:46:56,000
if you don't have an ability to absorb a

3215
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
massive amount of experience in a way

3216
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,840
that scales very sublinearly in terms of

3217
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,439
human labor and human attention and so

3218
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,880
when you look at the stack

3219
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:04,960
the perception side is probably the

3220
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,600
first to get really revolutionized by ml

3221
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:09,920
and it goes back many years because

3222
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:11,760
ml for like computer vision and these

3223
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:14,158
types of approaches has

3224
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:16,079
kind of took off um was a lot of the

3225
01:47:14,158 --> 01:47:18,479
like early kind of push and um and deep

3226
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:20,800
learning and so there's always a debate

3227
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:23,039
on you know the spectrum between kind of

3228
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,159
like end to end ml which

3229
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:26,719
you know is a little bit kind of like

3230
01:47:24,158 --> 01:47:28,799
too far to how you architect it to where

3231
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:30,319
you have modules but enough ability to

3232
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:33,039
think about long tail problems and so

3233
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:33,840
forth but at the end of the day um you

3234
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:35,439
have

3235
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,520
big parts of system that are very ml and

3236
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:39,279
data driven and we're increasingly

3237
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:40,719
moving that direction all the way across

3238
01:47:39,279 --> 01:47:41,840
the board including

3239
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:43,600
behavior

3240
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,199
where

3241
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,840
even when it's not like

3242
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:49,759
a gigantic ml problem that covers like a

3243
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:51,520
giant swath end to end more and more

3244
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:52,639
parts of the system have this property

3245
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:55,360
where you want to be able to put more

3246
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:56,480
data into it and it gets better

3247
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:57,920
and that has been one of the

3248
01:47:56,479 --> 01:48:00,799
realizations as you drive tens of

3249
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:02,960
millions of miles and try to like solve

3250
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:05,039
new expansions of domains without

3251
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:07,600
regressing in your old ones it becomes

3252
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:09,840
intractable for a human to approach that

3253
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:11,039
in the way that traditionally robotics

3254
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:13,279
has kind of approached some elements of

3255
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:14,719
the of the tech stack so are you trying

3256
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:17,519
to um

3257
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:20,639
create a data pipeline specifically for

3258
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:22,159
the trucking problem this is it like how

3259
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:23,760
much leveraging of the autonomous

3260
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:25,759
driving is there in terms of data

3261
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,440
collection yeah and

3262
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,600
how unique

3263
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:32,319
is the data required for the trucking

3264
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:34,560
problem so we uh we we use all the same

3265
01:48:32,319 --> 01:48:36,158
infrastructure um so labeling workflows

3266
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,400
ml workflows everything so that actually

3267
01:48:36,158 --> 01:48:41,198
carries over quite well um

3268
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:42,719
we heavily reuse the data even where

3269
01:48:41,198 --> 01:48:45,039
almost every model that we have on a

3270
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:47,760
truck we started with the latest car

3271
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:49,840
model cool and um so it's almost like a

3272
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:51,679
good background model yeah it's like you

3273
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,960
can think of like you despite the

3274
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:54,560
different domain and different numbers

3275
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:56,239
of sensors and position of sensors

3276
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,320
there's a lot of signals that carry over

3277
01:48:56,238 --> 01:48:59,759
across driving and so it's almost like

3278
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:00,960
pre-training and getting a big boost out

3279
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:02,800
of the gate where you can reduce the

3280
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,158
amount of data you need by a lot

3281
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,360
and it goes both ways actually and so

3282
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:06,238
we're increasingly thinking about our

3283
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:08,079
data

3284
01:49:06,238 --> 01:49:09,039
strategy on how we leverage both of

3285
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:11,600
these

3286
01:49:09,039 --> 01:49:13,198
so you think about um you know how other

3287
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,159
agents react to a truck yeah it's a

3288
01:49:13,198 --> 01:49:16,158
little bit different but the

3289
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:18,319
fundamentals are actually like what will

3290
01:49:16,158 --> 01:49:19,759
other vehicles in the road do there's a

3291
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:20,719
lot of carryover that's possible and in

3292
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,119
fact

3293
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:24,800
just to give you an example uh we're

3294
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:26,479
constantly kind of like adding more data

3295
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,440
from the trucking side but as of right

3296
01:49:26,479 --> 01:49:29,198
now

3297
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:31,678
when we think of our like one of our

3298
01:49:29,198 --> 01:49:34,399
models behavior prediction for other

3299
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:38,560
agents on the road like vehicles

3300
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:40,399
85 percent of that data comes from cars

3301
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,520
and a lot of that 85 comes from surface

3302
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:43,198
streets

3303
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:45,599
because we just had so much of it and it

3304
01:49:43,198 --> 01:49:46,879
was really valuable and so we're adding

3305
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:49,199
in more and more particularly in the

3306
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,800
areas where we need more data but you

3307
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:52,799
get a huge boost out of the gate just

3308
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:55,199
all different visual characteristics of

3309
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:57,039
roads lane markings pedestrians all that

3310
01:49:55,198 --> 01:49:58,479
that's still relevant it's all still

3311
01:49:57,039 --> 01:50:01,198
relevant and then just the fundamentals

3312
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:02,879
of how you know you detect the car

3313
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:04,238
does it really change that much whether

3314
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:06,400
you're detecting it from a car or a

3315
01:50:04,238 --> 01:50:08,559
truck um the fundamentals of how a

3316
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:10,719
person will walk around your vehicle is

3317
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,239
it it'll change a little bit but the

3318
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:14,158
basics like there's a lot of signal in

3319
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:16,079
there that as a starting point to a

3320
01:50:14,158 --> 01:50:17,439
network can actually be very valuable

3321
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:18,880
now we do have some very unique

3322
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:21,439
challenges where there's a sparsity of

3323
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:23,039
events on a freeway um the frequency of

3324
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:25,359
events happening on a freeway whether

3325
01:50:23,039 --> 01:50:26,800
it's you know interesting

3326
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:29,118
you know objects in the road or

3327
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:30,960
incidents or or even like from a human

3328
01:50:29,118 --> 01:50:33,920
benchmark like how often does a human

3329
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:35,599
have an accident on a freeway is far

3330
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:37,359
more sparse than on a surface street and

3331
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:38,719
so that leads to really interesting data

3332
01:50:37,359 --> 01:50:40,880
problems where

3333
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:42,399
you can't just drive infinitely to

3334
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,840
encounter all the different permutations

3335
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:45,519
of things you might encounter and so

3336
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:47,840
there you get into interesting

3337
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:50,400
tools like structured testing and data

3338
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,400
collection data augmentation and so

3339
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:55,118
forth and so there's really interesting

3340
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:57,198
kind of technical challenges that

3341
01:50:55,118 --> 01:50:59,039
push some of the research um that

3342
01:50:57,198 --> 01:51:01,118
enables um these new suites of

3343
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:02,079
approaches what role does simulation

3344
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:04,399
play

3345
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:06,000
really good question so waymo simulates

3346
01:51:04,399 --> 01:51:09,279
about a thousand miles for every mile it

3347
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,118
drives um so you think of in both so

3348
01:51:09,279 --> 01:51:14,079
across the board across the board yeah

3349
01:51:11,118 --> 01:51:15,920
uh so you think of for example well if

3350
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:17,599
we've driven you know over 20 million

3351
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:19,599
miles that's over 20 billion miles in

3352
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:20,480
simulation now how do you use simulation

3353
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:23,039
um

3354
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:25,759
it's a multi-purpose so

3355
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:26,960
uh you use it for basic development so

3356
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,639
you want to do make sure you have

3357
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,560
regression prevention and protection of

3358
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:32,639
everything you're doing right um that

3359
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:34,000
that's an easy one

3360
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:35,118
when you encounter something interesting

3361
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,719
in the world let's say there was an

3362
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:38,880
issue with how the vehicle behaved

3363
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:40,639
versus an ideal human um you can play

3364
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:43,118
that back in simulation and start

3365
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:44,639
augmenting your system and seeing how

3366
01:51:43,118 --> 01:51:46,719
you would have reacted to that scenario

3367
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:48,159
with this improvement or this new area

3368
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:50,000
you can create scenarios that become

3369
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:52,079
part of your regression set after that

3370
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,840
point right um then you start getting

3371
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:56,800
into like really really high kind of

3372
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:58,239
hill climbing where um you say hey i

3373
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,520
need to improve this system i have these

3374
01:51:58,238 --> 01:52:01,519
metrics that are really correlated with

3375
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,880
final performance how do i know how well

3376
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:05,119
i'm doing

3377
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:07,118
uh operation the actual physical driving

3378
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:09,039
is the least efficient form of testing

3379
01:52:07,118 --> 01:52:12,960
and it's expensive it's time consuming

3380
01:52:09,039 --> 01:52:15,118
so grabbing a large scale

3381
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:18,079
batch of historical data and simulating

3382
01:52:15,118 --> 01:52:20,479
it to get a signal of over these last or

3383
01:52:18,079 --> 01:52:22,158
just random sample of 100 000 miles how

3384
01:52:20,479 --> 01:52:23,678
has this metric changed versus where we

3385
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:24,960
are today you can do that far more

3386
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:27,199
efficiently in simulation than just

3387
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:28,079
driving with that new system on board

3388
01:52:27,198 --> 01:52:29,439
right

3389
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:32,399
and then you go all the way to the

3390
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:34,960
validation phase where to actually see

3391
01:52:32,399 --> 01:52:36,638
your human relative safety of like how

3392
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:38,800
well you're performing on the car side

3393
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:39,760
or the trucking side relative to a human

3394
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,920
um

3395
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:43,119
a lot of that safety case is actually

3396
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,199
driven by

3397
01:52:43,118 --> 01:52:47,118
uh taking all of the physical

3398
01:52:45,198 --> 01:52:48,879
operational driving which probably

3399
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:51,439
includes a lot of interventions where

3400
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:54,000
like where the operate the driver took

3401
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:56,158
over just in case um

3402
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,920
and then you simulate those forward

3403
01:52:56,158 --> 01:52:59,759
and see if would anything have happened

3404
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:01,520
and in most cases the answer is no but

3405
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:02,800
you you can simulate it forward and you

3406
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,320
can even start to do really interesting

3407
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:06,639
things where you

3408
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:08,799
add virtual agents to create harder

3409
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:10,960
environments you can fuzz the locations

3410
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:13,279
of physical agents you can muck with the

3411
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,880
scene and stress test the scenario from

3412
01:53:13,279 --> 01:53:16,719
a whole bunch of different dimensions

3413
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,639
and effectively you're trying to like

3414
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:20,800
more efficiently sample this like

3415
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:22,400
infinite dimensional space but try to

3416
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:24,320
encounter the problems as fast as

3417
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:26,479
possible because what most people don't

3418
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:28,319
realize is the hardest problem in

3419
01:53:26,479 --> 01:53:30,158
autonomous driving is actually the

3420
01:53:28,319 --> 01:53:32,719
evaluation problem in many ways not the

3421
01:53:30,158 --> 01:53:34,399
actual autonomy problem and so if you

3422
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:35,760
could in theory evaluate perfectly and

3423
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:37,279
instantaneously

3424
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,719
you can solve that problem in a really

3425
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:41,198
fast feedback loop

3426
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:42,800
quite well but the hardest part is being

3427
01:53:41,198 --> 01:53:45,198
really smart about this suite of

3428
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:48,000
approaches on how can you get an

3429
01:53:45,198 --> 01:53:49,759
accurate signal on how well you're doing

3430
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,679
as quickly as possible in a way that

3431
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:54,719
correlates to physical driving that's in

3432
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:56,399
the evaluation problem which metric are

3433
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:58,079
you evaluating towards we're talking

3434
01:53:56,399 --> 01:53:59,359
about safety and some

3435
01:53:58,079 --> 01:54:00,880
what are the performance metrics that

3436
01:53:59,359 --> 01:54:02,799
we're talking about so in the end you

3437
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:04,159
care about and safety like that's in the

3438
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:07,119
end what keeps you

3439
01:54:04,158 --> 01:54:08,238
like um that's what's deceptive where uh

3440
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:10,399
there's a lot of companies that have

3441
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:12,399
like a great demo

3442
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:14,238
the path from like a really great demo

3443
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:16,638
to being able to go driverless

3444
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:18,238
can be deceptively long even when that

3445
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:20,000
demo looks like it's driverless quality

3446
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:21,198
and the difference is is that

3447
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,880
the thing that keeps you from going

3448
01:54:21,198 --> 01:54:24,238
driverless is not the stuff you

3449
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:25,679
encounter on a demo it's the stuff that

3450
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:28,718
you encounter once in a hundred thousand

3451
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:31,039
miles or 500 000 miles and so

3452
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:33,039
that is at the root of what it what is

3453
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:33,920
most challenging about going driverless

3454
01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:35,920
because

3455
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:37,039
any issue you encounter you can go and

3456
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:38,319
fix it but how do you know you didn't

3457
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:40,880
create five other issues that you

3458
01:54:38,319 --> 01:54:42,799
haven't that encountered yet so

3459
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:44,560
those learnings like those were painful

3460
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,079
earnings in waymo's history that waymo

3461
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:48,080
went through and

3462
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:49,840
led to us then finally being able to go

3463
01:54:48,079 --> 01:54:52,079
driverless in phoenix and now are at the

3464
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:56,239
heart of how we develop

3465
01:54:52,079 --> 01:54:58,639
evaluation is simultaneously evaluating

3466
01:54:56,238 --> 01:55:00,799
final kind of end safety of how ready

3467
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:03,039
are you to go driverless

3468
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:04,960
which may be as

3469
01:55:03,039 --> 01:55:06,399
you know direct as what is your

3470
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:08,639
collision

3471
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:10,799
human relative kind of collision rate uh

3472
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:13,520
for all these types of scenarios and and

3473
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:15,279
uh uh and severities to make sure that

3474
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:17,760
you're better than a human bar you know

3475
01:55:15,279 --> 01:55:19,359
by by a good amount um but that's not

3476
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:21,679
actually the most useful for development

3477
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:24,479
for development it's much more kind of

3478
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:26,880
analog metrics that

3479
01:55:24,479 --> 01:55:28,238
are part of the art of finding

3480
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:30,400
how

3481
01:55:28,238 --> 01:55:31,919
what what are the properties of driving

3482
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:33,759
that give you a way quicker signal

3483
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:36,560
that's more sensitive than a collision

3484
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:38,400
that can correlate to qual the quality

3485
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,320
you care about and push the feedback

3486
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:41,839
loop to all of your development a lot of

3487
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:44,158
these are for example comparisons to

3488
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:45,840
human drivers like manual drivers how do

3489
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:47,439
you how do you do relative to human

3490
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,119
driver in various dimensions of various

3491
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:51,919
um circumstances

3492
01:55:49,118 --> 01:55:53,839
can ask a tricky question so

3493
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,880
if i brought you a truck how would you

3494
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:58,079
test it

3495
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:59,599
okay alan turing came along and you said

3496
01:55:58,079 --> 01:56:01,279
this one's can't tell if it's a human

3497
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:02,800
driver or yeah exactly

3498
01:56:01,279 --> 01:56:04,319
yeah but

3499
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:06,159
not the human because

3500
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:07,519
because you know humans are flawed but

3501
01:56:06,158 --> 01:56:08,960
yeah how do you actually know you're

3502
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:10,639
ready basically how do you know it's

3503
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,079
good enough um

3504
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:13,359
yeah and by the way this is the reason

3505
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:14,719
why like um

3506
01:56:13,359 --> 01:56:16,559
weymouth released the safety framework

3507
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:18,639
for the car side because like

3508
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:20,159
one it sets the bar so nobody cuts below

3509
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:22,239
it um and does something bad for the

3510
01:56:20,158 --> 01:56:24,719
field that and that causes an accident

3511
01:56:22,238 --> 01:56:26,319
two it's to start the conversation on

3512
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:28,079
like framing what does this need to look

3513
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:30,719
like same thing we'll end up doing for

3514
01:56:28,079 --> 01:56:32,000
the trucking side um there it ends up

3515
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:33,840
being um

3516
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,599
different demand different

3517
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:37,679
portfolio of approaches there's easy

3518
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:39,440
things like are you compliant with all

3519
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:40,719
these like fundamental rules of the road

3520
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:42,479
like you never drive above the speed

3521
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:43,920
limit that's actually pretty easy like

3522
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:45,678
you can fundamentally prove that it's

3523
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:49,359
either impossible to violate that rule

3524
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:50,880
or that in these like you can um

3525
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:53,039
itemize the scenarios where that comes

3526
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:55,118
up and you can do a test and show that

3527
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:57,840
you you know you pass that test and

3528
01:56:55,118 --> 01:57:00,399
therefore you can handle that scenario

3529
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:02,000
and so those are like traditional

3530
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:03,198
structure testing kind of system

3531
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,520
engineering approaches where you can

3532
01:57:03,198 --> 01:57:07,359
just quant like

3533
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,719
fault rates is another example where

3534
01:57:07,359 --> 01:57:10,079
when something fails how do you deal

3535
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:11,198
with it you're not going to drive and

3536
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:12,479
randomly wait for it to fail you're

3537
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:14,719
going to force a failure and make sure

3538
01:57:12,479 --> 01:57:17,359
that you can handle it and close courses

3539
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:18,399
and simulation or on the road

3540
01:57:17,359 --> 01:57:19,839
and

3541
01:57:18,399 --> 01:57:21,359
and run through all the permutations of

3542
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:23,119
failures which you can often times for

3543
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:24,880
some parts of system itemize like

3544
01:57:23,118 --> 01:57:27,598
hardware

3545
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:29,279
the hardest part is behavioral where

3546
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:30,800
you have

3547
01:57:29,279 --> 01:57:33,279
just infinite

3548
01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:35,760
situations that could in theory happen

3549
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:37,599
and you want to figure out the the

3550
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:39,520
combinations of approaches that you know

3551
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:41,679
that can work there you can probably

3552
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:43,199
pass the turing test pretty quickly even

3553
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:45,440
if you're not like completely ready for

3554
01:57:43,198 --> 01:57:46,319
driverless because the events that are

3555
01:57:45,439 --> 01:57:48,559
really

3556
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:50,960
kind of like hard will not happen that

3557
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:53,520
often just to give you a perspective

3558
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,359
uh a human has a serious accident on a

3559
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,679
freeway uh like a truck driver on a

3560
01:57:55,359 --> 01:58:00,799
freeway has uh there's a serious event

3561
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,920
happens once every 1.3 million miles and

3562
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:03,440
something that actually has like a

3563
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:05,279
really serious injury is 28 million

3564
01:58:03,439 --> 01:58:06,799
miles and so those are really rare and

3565
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:09,198
so you could have a driver that looks

3566
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:11,279
like it's ready to go but you have no

3567
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:13,039
signal on on what happens there and so

3568
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:15,279
that's where you start to get creative

3569
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:17,920
on combinations of

3570
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:19,840
sampling and statistical arguments

3571
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:21,520
focused structured arguments where you

3572
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:23,599
can kind of

3573
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:25,840
simulate those scenarios and show that

3574
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:27,520
you can handle them and

3575
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:29,199
metrics that are correlated with what

3576
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:31,920
you care about but you can measure much

3577
01:58:29,198 --> 01:58:33,678
more quickly and get to a right answer

3578
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:35,760
and that's what makes it pretty hard and

3579
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:37,760
in the end um you end up borrowing a lot

3580
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:40,320
of properties um from

3581
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:42,000
uh aerospace and like space shuttles and

3582
01:58:40,319 --> 01:58:43,679
so forth where you don't get the chance

3583
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,359
to launch it a million times just to say

3584
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:49,118
you're ready because it's too expensive

3585
01:58:45,359 --> 01:58:50,880
to fail um and so you go through

3586
01:58:49,118 --> 01:58:53,279
a huge amount of kind of structured

3587
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,560
approaches in order to validate it and

3588
01:58:53,279 --> 01:58:56,158
then by

3589
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:58,159
by thoroughness you can make a strong

3590
01:58:56,158 --> 01:58:59,598
argument that you're ready to go

3591
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:00,879
this is actually a harder problem in a

3592
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:02,639
lot of ways though because you can think

3593
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:03,920
of a space shuttle as um

3594
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:05,599
getting to a fixed point and then you

3595
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:07,039
kind of like or an airplane and you like

3596
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:08,960
freeze the software and then you like

3597
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:10,960
prove it and you're good to go here you

3598
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:13,039
have to get to a driver's quality bar

3599
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:14,639
but then continue to aggressively change

3600
01:59:13,039 --> 01:59:16,880
the software even while you're

3601
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:18,880
driverless and so and also the full

3602
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:20,239
range of environment that you there's

3603
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:22,000
there's an external environment where

3604
01:59:20,238 --> 01:59:22,959
the shuttle is you're basically testing

3605
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,840
the

3606
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:27,760
like the systems the internal stuff yeah

3607
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:29,920
uh and you have a lot of control on the

3608
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:31,679
external stuff yeah and the hard part is

3609
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:33,599
how do you know you didn't get worse in

3610
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:36,480
something that you just changed yes

3611
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:38,239
and so uh so in a lot of ways like

3612
01:59:36,479 --> 01:59:39,678
the turing test starts to fail pretty

3613
01:59:38,238 --> 01:59:41,839
quickly because you start to feel

3614
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:43,118
driverless quality pretty early in that

3615
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:45,279
curve

3616
01:59:43,118 --> 01:59:46,399
if you think about it right like in most

3617
01:59:45,279 --> 01:59:48,719
um

3618
01:59:46,399 --> 01:59:50,000
most uh kind of you know really good av

3619
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:52,399
demos maybe you'll sit there for 30

3620
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:55,840
minutes right yeah so you've driven you

3621
01:59:52,399 --> 01:59:58,319
know 15 miles or something like that um

3622
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:00,000
to go driverless uh like what's the sort

3623
01:59:58,319 --> 02:00:01,759
of rate of issues that you need to have

3624
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,238
you won't even encounter so let's try

3625
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:05,599
something different then let's try

3626
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:07,839
a different version of the touring test

3627
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:09,119
which is like an iq test

3628
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,880
so there's these

3629
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:13,359
difficult questions of increasing

3630
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:15,199
difficulty they're very they're they're

3631
02:00:13,359 --> 02:00:16,000
designed you don't know them ahead of

3632
02:00:15,198 --> 02:00:18,479
time

3633
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:21,439
nobody knows the answer to them right

3634
02:00:18,479 --> 02:00:23,279
and so is it possible to in the future

3635
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:27,039
orchestrate yeah basically really

3636
02:00:23,279 --> 02:00:28,960
obstacle course almost of like yeah that

3637
02:00:27,039 --> 02:00:31,519
maybe change every year

3638
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:33,118
and that represent if you can pass these

3639
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:35,040
it they don't necessarily represent the

3640
02:00:33,118 --> 02:00:36,639
full spectrum that's it yeah they won't

3641
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:38,399
be conclusive but you can at least get a

3642
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:40,000
really quick read and filter yeah like

3643
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:41,759
you're able to yeah because you didn't

3644
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,639
know them ahead of time like i don't

3645
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:43,840
know

3646
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:46,560
probably

3647
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:48,400
like construction zones uh failures or

3648
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:50,239
driving anywhere in russia yeah like

3649
02:00:48,399 --> 02:00:53,519
yeah

3650
02:00:50,238 --> 02:00:55,439
weather um cut-ins uh dense traffic kind

3651
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:57,360
of merging lane closures

3652
02:00:55,439 --> 02:00:59,598
uh animal foreign objects on a road that

3653
02:00:57,359 --> 02:01:03,198
pop out on short notice mechanical

3654
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:05,360
failures sensor braking tire popped

3655
02:01:03,198 --> 02:01:07,118
weird behaviors by other vehicles like a

3656
02:01:05,359 --> 02:01:09,598
hard brake something reckless that

3657
02:01:07,118 --> 02:01:11,359
they've done fouling of sensors like

3658
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:13,039
bugs or birds

3659
02:01:11,359 --> 02:01:14,319
you know poop or something so but yeah

3660
02:01:13,039 --> 02:01:15,920
like you have these like kind of like

3661
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:17,679
extreme uh

3662
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:19,199
conditions where like you have a nasty

3663
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:21,359
construction zone where everything shuts

3664
02:01:19,198 --> 02:01:22,638
down and you have to like you know get

3665
02:01:21,359 --> 02:01:24,799
pulled to the other side of the freeway

3666
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:27,039
with a temporary lane like that right

3667
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,639
those are sort of conditions where we do

3668
02:01:27,039 --> 02:01:30,319
that to ourselves right we itemize

3669
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:31,679
everything that could possibly happen to

3670
02:01:30,319 --> 02:01:32,880
give you a starting point to how to

3671
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:34,079
think about

3672
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:35,359
what you need to develop and at the end

3673
02:01:34,079 --> 02:01:37,039
of the day there's no substitute for

3674
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:38,559
real miles like if you think of

3675
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:40,000
traditional ml like you know how there's

3676
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:42,880
like a validation set where you hold out

3677
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,399
some data and uh like real-world driving

3678
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:47,359
is the ultimate validation set that's

3679
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:48,799
the in the end like the cleanest signal

3680
02:01:47,359 --> 02:01:50,000
but you can do a really good job on

3681
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,000
creating an obstacle course and you're

3682
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,158
absolutely right like at the end um

3683
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:56,399
if there was such a thing as automating

3684
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:59,039
uh and kind of a readiness

3685
02:01:56,399 --> 02:02:01,759
um it would be these extreme conditions

3686
02:01:59,039 --> 02:02:03,118
like a red light runner right a um

3687
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:05,840
really reckless pedestrian that's

3688
02:02:03,118 --> 02:02:07,598
jaywalking a cyclist that you know makes

3689
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:08,639
like a really awkward maneuver that's

3690
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:10,000
actually what keeps you from going

3691
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:11,279
driverless like in the end that is the

3692
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,880
long tail

3693
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:14,479
yeah and it's interesting to think about

3694
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:16,000
the that to me is the touring test

3695
02:02:14,479 --> 02:02:18,638
stereotest means a lot of things but to

3696
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:22,238
me in driving the touring test

3697
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:23,840
is exactly this validation set that is

3698
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:24,799
handcrafted there's a i don't know if

3699
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:29,119
you know

3700
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:30,960
him there's a guy named francoise he um

3701
02:02:29,118 --> 02:02:32,238
he decides he thinks about like how

3702
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:34,000
designed to test for general

3703
02:02:32,238 --> 02:02:35,118
intelligence he designs these iq tests

3704
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,760
for machines

3705
02:02:35,118 --> 02:02:40,399
and the validation set for him is

3706
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:43,920
handcrafted yeah and that it requires

3707
02:02:40,399 --> 02:02:46,319
like human genius or ingenuity to create

3708
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:47,840
a really good test yeah and you hold you

3709
02:02:46,319 --> 02:02:50,559
truly hold it up it's an interesting

3710
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:51,840
perspective on the validation set which

3711
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:54,800
is like

3712
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:57,679
make that as hard as possible right not

3713
02:02:54,800 --> 02:03:00,159
a generic representation of the data but

3714
02:02:57,679 --> 02:03:01,679
this is the hardest the hardest stuff

3715
02:03:00,158 --> 02:03:03,519
yeah you know it's like go like you'll

3716
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:05,520
never fully itemize like all the world

3717
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:06,560
states that you'll you'll expand and so

3718
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:07,920
you have to come up with different

3719
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:10,320
approaches and this is where you start

3720
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:12,880
hitting the struggles of ml where ml is

3721
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:14,960
fantastic at optimizing the average case

3722
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,639
it's a really unique craft to think

3723
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:18,560
about how you deal with the worst case

3724
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:21,359
which is what we care about in in av

3725
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:22,880
space um when using an ml system on

3726
02:03:21,359 --> 02:03:24,158
something that that occurs like super

3727
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:25,440
infrequently

3728
02:03:24,158 --> 02:03:27,839
so like you don't care about the worst

3729
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:29,839
case really on ads because if you miss a

3730
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:32,319
few it's not a big deal but you do care

3731
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:34,639
about it on the driving side and so um

3732
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:36,639
and so typically like you'll never fully

3733
02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:38,400
enumerate the world and so you have to

3734
02:03:36,639 --> 02:03:40,480
take a step back and abstract away what

3735
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:42,479
are the signals that you care about and

3736
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:46,799
the properties of a driver

3737
02:03:42,479 --> 02:03:50,638
that correlate to defensive driving and

3738
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:51,920
avoiding nasty situations that um

3739
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:54,000
even though you'll always be surprised

3740
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:56,078
by things you'll encounter you feel good

3741
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,078
about your ability to generalize from

3742
02:03:56,078 --> 02:03:59,759
what you've learned

3743
02:03:58,078 --> 02:04:01,279
all right let me ask you a tricky

3744
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:03,360
question

3745
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:05,039
so to me

3746
02:04:03,359 --> 02:04:06,078
the two companies

3747
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:08,800
that

3748
02:04:06,078 --> 02:04:11,439
are building at scale some of the most

3749
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:15,279
incredible robots ever built

3750
02:04:11,439 --> 02:04:15,279
is waymo and tesla

3751
02:04:15,439 --> 02:04:19,118
so

3752
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:22,000
there's very distinct approaches

3753
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:23,439
technically philosophically in these two

3754
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,078
systems

3755
02:04:23,439 --> 02:04:27,439
let me ask you to play sort of devil's

3756
02:04:26,078 --> 02:04:29,359
advocate

3757
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:31,519
and then the devil's advocate to the

3758
02:04:29,359 --> 02:04:33,359
devil's advocate

3759
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:36,000
it's it's a bit of a race of course

3760
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:37,118
everyone can win

3761
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,960
but

3762
02:04:37,118 --> 02:04:42,319
if waymo wins this race to level four

3763
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:44,560
uh which

3764
02:04:42,319 --> 02:04:45,920
why would they win what aspect of the

3765
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:49,920
approach do you think would be the

3766
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:53,679
winning aspect and if tesla wins

3767
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:55,679
why would they win and uh which aspect

3768
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:57,760
of their approach would be the reason

3769
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:59,760
just just building some intuition almost

3770
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:01,440
not from a business perspective from any

3771
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:03,599
of that just technically

3772
02:05:01,439 --> 02:05:05,839
yeah yeah and we could summarize

3773
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:07,279
i think maybe you can correct me what

3774
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:08,719
one of the more

3775
02:05:07,279 --> 02:05:10,238
distinct

3776
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:13,840
aspects is

3777
02:05:10,238 --> 02:05:15,759
uh waymo has a richer suite of sensors

3778
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:18,880
as lidar and vision

3779
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:22,639
tesla now removed radar they do vision

3780
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:24,560
only tesla has a larger fleet of

3781
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:28,400
vehicles operated by humans so it's

3782
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:30,880
already deployed on the field in its uh

3783
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:32,238
larger what do you call it operational

3784
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:34,960
domain

3785
02:05:32,238 --> 02:05:37,198
and then waymo is more focused on a

3786
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,679
specific domain and growing it

3787
02:05:37,198 --> 02:05:41,519
with fewer vehicles so that's the both

3788
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:43,440
are fascinating approaches both are i

3789
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:45,920
think there's a lot of brilliant ideas

3790
02:05:43,439 --> 02:05:48,000
nobody knows the answer so i'd love to

3791
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:50,319
get your comments on this lay of the

3792
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,760
land yeah for sure so maybe i'll um i'll

3793
02:05:50,319 --> 02:05:53,279
start with waymo

3794
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:55,360
and you're right like both incredible

3795
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:57,279
companies and just a gigantic respect to

3796
02:05:55,359 --> 02:05:59,279
like everything tesla's accomplished and

3797
02:05:57,279 --> 02:06:01,359
uh how they push the field forward as

3798
02:05:59,279 --> 02:06:04,800
well so on the weymouth side there is a

3799
02:06:01,359 --> 02:06:07,439
fundamental advantage in the fact that

3800
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:09,360
it is focused and geared towards l4 from

3801
02:06:07,439 --> 02:06:11,359
the very beginning we've customized the

3802
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:14,078
sensor suite for it the hardware the

3803
02:06:11,359 --> 02:06:15,679
compute the infrastructure the tech

3804
02:06:14,078 --> 02:06:17,439
stack and all of the investment inside

3805
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:19,279
the company um

3806
02:06:17,439 --> 02:06:20,879
that's deceptively important because

3807
02:06:19,279 --> 02:06:22,158
there's like a giant spectrum of

3808
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:23,760
problems you have to solve in order to

3809
02:06:22,158 --> 02:06:26,158
like really do this from

3810
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:28,880
infrastructure to hardware to autonomy

3811
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:30,319
stack to the safety framework and that's

3812
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:32,159
an advantage because there's a reason

3813
02:06:30,319 --> 02:06:33,118
why it's the fifth generation hardware

3814
02:06:32,158 --> 02:06:34,719
and

3815
02:06:33,118 --> 02:06:37,598
why all of those learnings went into the

3816
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:39,840
dymor program um it becomes such an

3817
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:42,239
advantage because you learn a lot as you

3818
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:44,319
drive and you optimize for the best

3819
02:06:42,238 --> 02:06:47,678
information you have but fundamentally

3820
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:49,279
like there's a big big jump um uh

3821
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:50,960
like every order of magnitude that you

3822
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:54,399
drive uh in numbers of miles and what

3823
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:56,158
you earn and the gap from really kind of

3824
02:06:54,399 --> 02:06:57,759
like decent progress or l2 and so forth

3825
02:06:56,158 --> 02:07:00,000
to what it takes to actually go all for

3826
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:02,480
and at the end of the day um

3827
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:05,039
there's a feeling that waymo has

3828
02:07:02,479 --> 02:07:07,439
uh there's a long way to go uh nobody's

3829
02:07:05,039 --> 02:07:10,399
won um but

3830
02:07:07,439 --> 02:07:12,479
there's a lot of advantages um in all of

3831
02:07:10,399 --> 02:07:13,598
these buckets where it's the only

3832
02:07:12,479 --> 02:07:15,118
company that has shipped a fully

3833
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:18,000
driverless service we can go and you can

3834
02:07:15,118 --> 02:07:20,238
use it and it's at a decently like uh

3835
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,078
you know sizeable scale um and those

3836
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:23,279
learnings can feed forward and to solve

3837
02:07:22,078 --> 02:07:25,519
how to solve the more general problems

3838
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:26,639
you see this process you've deployed in

3839
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:28,480
chandler

3840
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:30,400
you don't know the timeline exactly but

3841
02:07:28,479 --> 02:07:33,118
you could see the steps

3842
02:07:30,399 --> 02:07:35,279
they they seem almost incremental

3843
02:07:33,118 --> 02:07:36,880
the steps it's become more engineering

3844
02:07:35,279 --> 02:07:38,559
than totally bind r d because it works

3845
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:40,239
in one place and then you move yeah

3846
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:41,679
another place and you grow it this way

3847
02:07:40,238 --> 02:07:43,919
and just to give you an example like we

3848
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:46,480
fundamentally changed our hardware and

3849
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:48,800
our software stack almost entirely from

3850
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:51,039
what when driverless in phoenix to what

3851
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:52,639
is the current generation of the system

3852
02:07:51,039 --> 02:07:54,639
on both sides

3853
02:07:52,639 --> 02:07:55,920
because the things that got us to

3854
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:58,078
driverless even though it got to

3855
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:01,279
driveway way like way beyond human

3856
02:07:58,078 --> 02:08:03,679
relative safety um it is

3857
02:08:01,279 --> 02:08:05,920
fundamentally not well set up to scale

3858
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:07,599
in an exponential fashion without like

3859
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:09,679
getting into like huge kind of scaling

3860
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:10,960
pains and so those learnings you just

3861
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:13,199
can't shortcut and so that's an

3862
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:14,480
advantage and so uh there's a lot of

3863
02:08:13,198 --> 02:08:16,399
open challenges to kind of get through

3864
02:08:14,479 --> 02:08:18,078
technical organizational like how do you

3865
02:08:16,399 --> 02:08:19,598
solve problems that are increasingly

3866
02:08:18,078 --> 02:08:21,039
broad and complex like this work on

3867
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:22,480
multiple products but

3868
02:08:21,039 --> 02:08:23,599
there's the feeling that okay like balls

3869
02:08:22,479 --> 02:08:25,598
in our court

3870
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:27,039
there's a head start there now we got to

3871
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:28,480
go and solve it and i think that focus

3872
02:08:27,039 --> 02:08:30,639
on l4 it's a fundamentally different

3873
02:08:28,479 --> 02:08:32,638
problem if you think about it like um

3874
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:34,639
let's say we were designing an l2 truck

3875
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:36,719
that was meant to be safer and help a

3876
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:37,840
human you could do that with far less

3877
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:40,158
sensors

3878
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:42,000
far less complexity and provide value

3879
02:08:40,158 --> 02:08:44,000
very quickly arguably with what we

3880
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,920
already have today just packaged up in a

3881
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:48,399
good product but

3882
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:51,279
you would take a huge risk in having a

3883
02:08:48,399 --> 02:08:53,118
gap from even like compute and sensors

3884
02:08:51,279 --> 02:08:54,880
not not to mention the software to then

3885
02:08:53,118 --> 02:08:57,118
jump from that system to an l4 system so

3886
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:59,199
it's a huge risk basically so i can let

3887
02:08:57,118 --> 02:09:01,279
me allow me to be the person that plays

3888
02:08:59,198 --> 02:09:03,279
the devil's advocate and let's argue for

3889
02:09:01,279 --> 02:09:05,198
the tesla approach so

3890
02:09:03,279 --> 02:09:07,599
that the what you just laid out makes

3891
02:09:05,198 --> 02:09:10,719
perfect sense and is exactly right there

3892
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:12,639
are some open questions here which is

3893
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:13,920
it's possible

3894
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:16,319
that

3895
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:18,800
investing more in faster data collection

3896
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:20,799
which is essentially what tesla's doing

3897
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:21,920
will get us there faster

3898
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:24,719
if

3899
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:28,158
the sensor suite doesn't matter

3900
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:29,679
yeah as much and machine learning can do

3901
02:09:28,158 --> 02:09:30,879
a lot of the work this is the open

3902
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:32,880
question is

3903
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:36,000
how much is is the thing you mentioned

3904
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:37,440
before how much of driving can be end to

3905
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,078
and learned

3906
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:42,719
that's the open question obviously

3907
02:09:40,078 --> 02:09:44,399
the waymo and the vision only machine

3908
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:45,279
learning approach

3909
02:09:44,399 --> 02:09:47,920
will

3910
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:50,078
solve driving eventually both yeah the

3911
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:51,440
question is of timeline what's faster

3912
02:09:50,078 --> 02:09:52,960
that's right and what you mentioned like

3913
02:09:51,439 --> 02:09:55,439
if i were to make the opposite argument

3914
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:57,359
like what what puts tesla uh in the

3915
02:09:55,439 --> 02:09:59,598
strongest position it's data that is

3916
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:02,078
their like superpower where they have an

3917
02:09:59,599 --> 02:10:04,000
access to real-world

3918
02:10:02,078 --> 02:10:06,799
data effectively with like

3919
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,039
a safety driver uh and uh you know like

3920
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:10,560
they've they found a way to like um get

3921
02:10:09,039 --> 02:10:11,920
paid by safety drivers versus paper

3922
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:14,880
safety drivers

3923
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:17,279
it's uh it's brilliant right yeah but

3924
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:18,400
you know all joking aside like um one it

3925
02:10:17,279 --> 02:10:20,158
is incredible that they've built a

3926
02:10:18,399 --> 02:10:21,359
business that's incredibly successful

3927
02:10:20,158 --> 02:10:23,198
they can now be a foundation and

3928
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:25,598
bootstrap kind of like really aggressive

3929
02:10:23,198 --> 02:10:26,799
investment in autonomy space uh if you

3930
02:10:25,599 --> 02:10:28,560
can do it that's always like an

3931
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:31,199
incredible kind of advantage and then

3932
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:32,480
the data aspect of it um it is a giant

3933
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:34,319
amount of data if you can use it the

3934
02:10:32,479 --> 02:10:36,399
right way to then solve the problem but

3935
02:10:34,319 --> 02:10:38,000
the ability to collect um

3936
02:10:36,399 --> 02:10:39,759
and filter through the things that to

3937
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,399
the things that matter at real-world

3938
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:44,800
scale like a large distribution that is

3939
02:10:42,399 --> 02:10:47,118
a that is huge like it's a big advantage

3940
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:48,719
um and so then the question becomes can

3941
02:10:47,118 --> 02:10:50,719
you use it in our right way and do you

3942
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:52,239
have the right software systems and

3943
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:53,840
hardware systems in order to solve the

3944
02:10:52,238 --> 02:10:55,839
problem and

3945
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:57,920
you're right that in the long term

3946
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:59,920
there's no reason to believe that pure

3947
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:01,520
camera systems can't solve the problem

3948
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:03,279
that humans obviously are solving with

3949
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:04,079
you know with vision systems

3950
02:11:03,279 --> 02:11:06,158
but

3951
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:08,158
the question is when it's a risk it's a

3952
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:10,879
big so there's no argument that it's not

3953
02:11:08,158 --> 02:11:12,799
a risk right like and it's already such

3954
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:14,719
a hard problem and so much of that

3955
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:16,719
problem by the way is um

3956
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:18,000
uh you know even beyond the perception

3957
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:19,920
side some of the hardest elements of the

3958
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:22,639
problem on behavioral side and decision

3959
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:25,520
making and the long tail safety case

3960
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:27,760
if you are adding risk and complexity

3961
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:29,840
on the input side from perception you're

3962
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,639
now making a really really hard problem

3963
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:32,800
like

3964
02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:34,880
which is on its own is still like almost

3965
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:36,960
insurmountably hard even harder and so

3966
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:38,639
the question is just how much and this

3967
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:40,880
is where like you can

3968
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:43,359
easily get into a little bit of a

3969
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:44,880
kind of a trap where similar to how you

3970
02:11:43,359 --> 02:11:47,039
how do you evaluate how good an av

3971
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:47,920
company's product is like you go and you

3972
02:11:47,039 --> 02:11:49,599
do a

3973
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:51,520
trial kind of a test run with them a

3974
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:52,960
demo run which they've kind of optimized

3975
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:54,719
like crazy and so forth and like and it

3976
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:56,719
feels good do you do you put any weight

3977
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:58,800
in that right you know that that gap is

3978
02:11:56,719 --> 02:12:01,198
kind of like you know pretty large still

3979
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:03,039
um same thing on the like perception

3980
02:12:01,198 --> 02:12:05,519
case like the long tail of computer

3981
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:08,078
vision is really really hard and there's

3982
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,679
a lot of ways that that can come up and

3983
02:12:08,078 --> 02:12:11,920
even if it doesn't happen that often at

3984
02:12:09,679 --> 02:12:13,520
all when you think about the safety bar

3985
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:15,440
and what it takes to actually go full

3986
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:16,719
driverless not like incredible

3987
02:12:15,439 --> 02:12:18,879
assistance driverless but full

3988
02:12:16,719 --> 02:12:21,359
driverless

3989
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:22,719
that bar gets crazy high and not only do

3990
02:12:21,359 --> 02:12:25,279
you have to solve it on the behavioral

3991
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:27,279
side but now you have to

3992
02:12:25,279 --> 02:12:29,039
push computer vision beyond arguably

3993
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:30,880
where it's ever been pushed and so you

3994
02:12:29,039 --> 02:12:32,078
now on top of the broader av challenge

3995
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:33,920
you have a really hard perception

3996
02:12:32,078 --> 02:12:35,519
challenge as well so there's perception

3997
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:37,199
there's planning there's human robot

3998
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:38,400
interaction to me what's fascinating

3999
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:40,000
about

4000
02:12:38,399 --> 02:12:43,039
what tesla is doing

4001
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:44,399
is in this march towards level four

4002
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:45,599
because it's in the hands of so many

4003
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:47,519
humans

4004
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:48,400
you get to see video you get to see

4005
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:50,800
humans

4006
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:51,920
i mean forget forget companies forget

4007
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:54,239
businesses

4008
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:55,520
it's fascinating for humans to be

4009
02:12:54,238 --> 02:12:56,959
interacting with robots that's

4010
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:58,480
incredible and they're actually helping

4011
02:12:56,960 --> 02:13:00,000
kind of push it forward and yeah and

4012
02:12:58,479 --> 02:13:02,638
that is valuable by the way where even

4013
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:05,118
for us a decent percentage of our data

4014
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:07,359
is human driving yes um we intentionally

4015
02:13:05,118 --> 02:13:08,880
have humans drive higher percentage than

4016
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:10,238
you might expect because that creates

4017
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:12,078
some of the best signals to train the

4018
02:13:10,238 --> 02:13:14,959
autonomy and so

4019
02:13:12,078 --> 02:13:17,198
that is uh on its own value so together

4020
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:19,118
we're kind of learning about this

4021
02:13:17,198 --> 02:13:21,919
problem in an applied sense just like

4022
02:13:19,118 --> 02:13:24,158
you had with cosmo like once when when

4023
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:26,078
you're chasing an actual product that

4024
02:13:24,158 --> 02:13:27,839
people are going to use

4025
02:13:26,078 --> 02:13:29,840
robot based product that people are

4026
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:32,000
going to use you have to contend with

4027
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:33,279
the reality of

4028
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,639
what it takes to build a robot that

4029
02:13:33,279 --> 02:13:36,238
successfully perceives the world and

4030
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:37,599
operates in the world and what it takes

4031
02:13:36,238 --> 02:13:39,359
to have a robot that interacts with

4032
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:40,800
other humans in the world and that

4033
02:13:39,359 --> 02:13:42,960
that's like to me one of the most

4034
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,800
interesting problems humans have ever

4035
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:45,760
undertaken because

4036
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:47,679
you're

4037
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:49,840
in trying to create an intelligent agent

4038
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:51,359
that operates in a human world you're

4039
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:53,119
also

4040
02:13:51,359 --> 02:13:54,000
understanding the nature of intelligence

4041
02:13:53,118 --> 02:13:54,960
itself

4042
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:58,158
like

4043
02:13:54,960 --> 02:14:00,078
how hard is driving it's still not

4044
02:13:58,158 --> 02:14:01,279
answered to me yeah i still don't

4045
02:14:00,078 --> 02:14:03,359
understand

4046
02:14:01,279 --> 02:14:05,118
like all the subtle cues like even

4047
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:06,479
little things like um

4048
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:07,920
your interaction with a pedestrian where

4049
02:14:06,479 --> 02:14:10,799
you look at each other and just go okay

4050
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:12,560
go right like that's hard to do without

4051
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:14,159
a human driver right and you're missing

4052
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:15,760
that dimension how do you communicate

4053
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:17,839
that so there's like really really

4054
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:18,960
interesting kind of like elements here

4055
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:21,119
now here's what's beautiful can you

4056
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:23,039
imagine that like when autonomous

4057
02:14:21,118 --> 02:14:25,118
driving is solved

4058
02:14:23,039 --> 02:14:28,399
how much of the technology foundation of

4059
02:14:25,118 --> 02:14:30,559
that like space can go and have like

4060
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:32,719
tremendous just transformative impacts

4061
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:34,400
on on other problem areas and other

4062
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:36,719
other spaces that have

4063
02:14:34,399 --> 02:14:38,319
subsets of the these same problems like

4064
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:41,439
it's just incredible

4065
02:14:38,319 --> 02:14:44,479
it's it's both a pro and a con is uh

4066
02:14:41,439 --> 02:14:46,638
with autonomous driving is so

4067
02:14:44,479 --> 02:14:49,118
um safety critical

4068
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:50,639
it's so so once you solve it it's

4069
02:14:49,118 --> 02:14:52,319
beautiful because there's so many

4070
02:14:50,639 --> 02:14:53,359
applications that are a lot less safety

4071
02:14:52,319 --> 02:14:55,599
critical

4072
02:14:53,359 --> 02:14:58,158
but it's also the the con of that is

4073
02:14:55,599 --> 02:14:59,760
it's so safe it's so hard to solve and

4074
02:14:58,158 --> 02:15:02,158
the same journalists that you mentioned

4075
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:03,039
and get excited for a demo are the ones

4076
02:15:02,158 --> 02:15:04,158
who

4077
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:07,279
who

4078
02:15:04,158 --> 02:15:08,960
write long articles about the failure of

4079
02:15:07,279 --> 02:15:11,039
your company if there's

4080
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:13,439
one accident

4081
02:15:11,039 --> 02:15:16,399
that's based on a robot and it's it's

4082
02:15:13,439 --> 02:15:18,399
it's just society's so tense and

4083
02:15:16,399 --> 02:15:20,879
waiting for failure robots you're in

4084
02:15:18,399 --> 02:15:22,879
such a high stake environment failure

4085
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:24,800
has such a high cost and it slows down

4086
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:26,078
development it slows down development

4087
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:27,920
yeah like the team like definitely

4088
02:15:26,078 --> 02:15:29,519
noticed that like once you go driverless

4089
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:31,039
like we're driving from phoenix and you

4090
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:33,199
continue to iterate

4091
02:15:31,039 --> 02:15:35,439
your iteration pace slows down um

4092
02:15:33,198 --> 02:15:36,879
because your fear

4093
02:15:35,439 --> 02:15:37,919
of regression

4094
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:40,078
forces

4095
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:42,078
so much more rigor that you know

4096
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:43,519
obviously you know you have to find a

4097
02:15:42,078 --> 02:15:45,359
compromise on like okay well how often

4098
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:46,639
do we release driverless builds because

4099
02:15:45,359 --> 02:15:47,439
every time you release a driver's build

4100
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:49,118
you have to go through this like

4101
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:51,759
validation process which is very

4102
02:15:49,118 --> 02:15:53,679
expensive so far so um it is interesting

4103
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:54,880
it's like it is just one of the hardest

4104
02:15:53,679 --> 02:15:57,199
things there's no other industry where

4105
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:59,118
like uh you would not like you wouldn't

4106
02:15:57,198 --> 02:16:00,638
release products way way quicker when

4107
02:15:59,118 --> 02:16:02,399
you start to kind of provide

4108
02:16:00,639 --> 02:16:03,920
even portions of the value that you

4109
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:04,879
provide healthcare maybe is the other

4110
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:06,239
one

4111
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:07,760
that's right but at the same time right

4112
02:16:06,238 --> 02:16:09,198
like we've gotten there where you think

4113
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:11,760
of like surgery right like you have

4114
02:16:09,198 --> 02:16:14,078
surgery there's always a risk but like

4115
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:15,280
it's really really bounded you know that

4116
02:16:14,078 --> 02:16:17,439
there's an accident rate when you go out

4117
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:18,719
and drive your car today right like

4118
02:16:17,439 --> 02:16:20,879
and you know what the fatality rate in

4119
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:23,198
the u.s is per year we're not banning

4120
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:24,880
driving because there was a car accident

4121
02:16:23,198 --> 02:16:27,118
but the bar for us is way higher and we

4122
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:28,639
hold ourselves very serious to it where

4123
02:16:27,118 --> 02:16:31,039
you have to not only be better than a

4124
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:32,799
human but you probably have to like at

4125
02:16:31,039 --> 02:16:34,718
scale be far better than a human by a

4126
02:16:32,799 --> 02:16:37,199
big margin and you have to be able to

4127
02:16:34,718 --> 02:16:40,000
like really really thoughtfully explain

4128
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:42,159
um all of the ways that we validate that

4129
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:43,599
becomes very comfortable for humans to

4130
02:16:42,159 --> 02:16:45,439
understand because a bunch of jargon

4131
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:47,200
that we use internally just doesn't

4132
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:49,439
compute at the end of the day we have to

4133
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:51,040
be able to explain to society how do we

4134
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:53,040
quantify the risk

4135
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:56,000
and acknowledge that there is some

4136
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:57,599
non-zero risk but it's far above a human

4137
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,799
you know relative safety here's the

4138
02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:00,719
thing

4139
02:16:58,799 --> 02:17:02,558
to push back a little bit

4140
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:03,839
uh and bring cosmo back in the

4141
02:17:02,558 --> 02:17:04,799
conversation he said something quite

4142
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,920
brilliant at the beginning of this

4143
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:07,199
conversation that i think probably

4144
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:09,599
applies for

4145
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:11,200
autonomous driving which is

4146
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:13,120
you know there's this desire to make

4147
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:14,719
autonomous cars much safer than human

4148
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:15,840
driven cars

4149
02:17:14,718 --> 02:17:17,518
but

4150
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:20,000
if you create a product that's really

4151
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:22,159
compelling and is able to explain both

4152
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,840
the leadership and the engineers and the

4153
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:26,478
product itself

4154
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:29,040
can communicate intent

4155
02:17:26,478 --> 02:17:30,799
then i think people may be able to be

4156
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:33,280
willing to put up with the thing that

4157
02:17:30,799 --> 02:17:34,239
might be even riskier than humans

4158
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:36,399
because

4159
02:17:34,239 --> 02:17:38,478
they understand the value of taking

4160
02:17:36,398 --> 02:17:40,159
risks you mentioned the speed limit

4161
02:17:38,478 --> 02:17:41,840
humans understand the value of going

4162
02:17:40,159 --> 02:17:44,879
over the speed limit yeah humans

4163
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:47,439
understand the value of like

4164
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:49,518
going fast through a for through a

4165
02:17:47,439 --> 02:17:52,159
yellow light yeah to take in when you're

4166
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:54,478
in manhattan streets pushing through uh

4167
02:17:52,159 --> 02:17:56,558
uh crossing pedestrians they understand

4168
02:17:54,478 --> 02:17:58,398
that i mean this is a much more tense

4169
02:17:56,558 --> 02:18:01,199
topic of discussion so this is just me

4170
02:17:58,398 --> 02:18:03,358
talking so in with cosmo's case there

4171
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:05,439
was something about the way

4172
02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:07,200
this particular robot communicated the

4173
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:09,359
energy it brought the intent it was able

4174
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:10,719
to communicate to the humans that you

4175
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:12,960
understood

4176
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:14,398
that of course he needs to have a camera

4177
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:17,518
yeah of course he needs to have this

4178
02:18:14,398 --> 02:18:20,239
information and in that same way to me

4179
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:22,800
of course a car needs to take risks of

4180
02:18:20,239 --> 02:18:25,280
course there's going to be accidents

4181
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:27,119
that's what like that's

4182
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:28,479
you know if you want a car that never

4183
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:30,399
has an accident

4184
02:18:28,478 --> 02:18:31,279
have a car that just doesn't go anywhere

4185
02:18:30,398 --> 02:18:32,718
yeah

4186
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:35,679
and so that

4187
02:18:32,718 --> 02:18:37,759
but that's tricky because that's not a

4188
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:39,760
robotics problem

4189
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:40,880
like are not even under like due to you

4190
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:43,359
right obviously

4191
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:45,199
so there's a big difference though um

4192
02:18:43,359 --> 02:18:46,880
yeah you are

4193
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:48,800
that's not a personal decision you're

4194
02:18:46,879 --> 02:18:51,039
also impacting obviously kind of the

4195
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:53,759
rest of the road um and we're

4196
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:55,920
facilitating it right and so there's a

4197
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:57,840
higher kind of you know kind of ethical

4198
02:18:55,920 --> 02:19:00,239
and moral bar which obviously then you

4199
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:01,519
know translates into as a society and

4200
02:19:00,239 --> 02:19:03,599
from a regulatory standpoint kind of

4201
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:06,960
like what what comes out of it where

4202
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:08,558
it's hard for us to ever see this even

4203
02:19:06,959 --> 02:19:11,518
being a

4204
02:19:08,558 --> 02:19:13,119
debate in the sense that like

4205
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:14,398
you have to be beyond reproach from a

4206
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:15,519
safety standpoint because if you're

4207
02:19:14,398 --> 02:19:18,159
wrong about this you could set the

4208
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:20,398
entire field back a decade right see i i

4209
02:19:18,159 --> 02:19:22,079
this is me speaking i think if we look

4210
02:19:20,398 --> 02:19:23,760
into the future

4211
02:19:22,079 --> 02:19:26,000
there will be

4212
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:28,000
i personally believe

4213
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:29,920
this is me speaking yeah

4214
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:33,200
that there will be less and less focus

4215
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:34,638
on safety still very very high yeah

4216
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:37,599
meaning like after autonomy is very

4217
02:19:34,638 --> 02:19:39,679
common and accepted it's not not not so

4218
02:19:37,599 --> 02:19:41,200
common as everywhere but there has to be

4219
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:43,359
a transition because

4220
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:45,760
i think for innovation just like you

4221
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:49,840
were saying to explore ideas you have to

4222
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:51,760
take risks and i think if autonomy

4223
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:53,280
in the near term is to become prevalent

4224
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:55,760
in society

4225
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:58,159
i think people need to be more willing

4226
02:19:55,760 --> 02:20:00,719
to understand the nature of risk

4227
02:19:58,159 --> 02:20:02,398
the value of risk

4228
02:20:00,719 --> 02:20:04,079
it's very difficult you're right of

4229
02:20:02,398 --> 02:20:05,920
course with driving

4230
02:20:04,079 --> 02:20:07,280
but that that's the fascinating nature

4231
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:08,239
of it this

4232
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:10,880
it's a

4233
02:20:08,239 --> 02:20:13,280
it's a life-and-death situation that

4234
02:20:10,879 --> 02:20:15,119
brings value to millions of people so

4235
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:17,600
you have to figure out what what do we

4236
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:18,880
value about this world how much do we

4237
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:21,840
value

4238
02:20:18,879 --> 02:20:24,478
how deeply do we want to avoid

4239
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:26,398
hurting other humans that's right and

4240
02:20:24,478 --> 02:20:28,079
there is a point where like

4241
02:20:26,398 --> 02:20:29,439
you can imagine a scenario where waymo

4242
02:20:28,079 --> 02:20:32,559
has a system

4243
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:34,239
that is uh even when it's like uh kind

4244
02:20:32,559 --> 02:20:36,639
of beyond a you know human relative

4245
02:20:34,239 --> 02:20:38,559
safety um and

4246
02:20:36,639 --> 02:20:40,478
provably statistically

4247
02:20:38,559 --> 02:20:41,920
will save lives

4248
02:20:40,478 --> 02:20:44,398
there is a

4249
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:48,079
thoughtful navigation of

4250
02:20:44,398 --> 02:20:49,519
you know the that fact versus just

4251
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:51,600
kind of

4252
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:52,399
society readiness and perception

4253
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:55,040
and

4254
02:20:52,398 --> 02:20:56,719
education of um

4255
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:58,399
society and regulators and everything

4256
02:20:56,719 --> 02:21:01,199
else where like

4257
02:20:58,398 --> 02:21:05,439
it's it's multi-dimensional um and it's

4258
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:06,960
not a purely logical uh argument but um

4259
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:09,280
ironically the logic can actually help

4260
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:11,039
with the emotions

4261
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:12,239
and just like any technology there's

4262
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:14,560
early adopters and then there's kind of

4263
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:16,398
like a curve that um happens after it

4264
02:21:14,559 --> 02:21:18,159
but eventually celebrities you get the

4265
02:21:16,398 --> 02:21:19,840
rock in a way more vehicle and then

4266
02:21:18,159 --> 02:21:23,039
everybody just comes and everybody calms

4267
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:23,040
down because the rock likes it yeah

4268
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:27,200
if you post uh yeah and it's like it's

4269
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:28,559
an open question on how this plays out i

4270
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:30,079
mean maybe we're presently surprised and

4271
02:21:28,559 --> 02:21:33,359
it just like people just realize that

4272
02:21:30,079 --> 02:21:35,680
this is such a enabler of life and like

4273
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:38,079
efficiency and cost and everything that

4274
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:39,840
um there's a pull like at some point i

4275
02:21:38,079 --> 02:21:40,959
should fully believe that this will go

4276
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:43,200
from a

4277
02:21:40,959 --> 02:21:44,959
thoughtful kind of you know

4278
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:47,439
you know movement and tiptoeing and like

4279
02:21:44,959 --> 02:21:48,159
kind of like a push to society realizes

4280
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:50,000
how

4281
02:21:48,159 --> 02:21:51,760
wonderful of an enabler this could

4282
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,359
become and it becomes more of a pull and

4283
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:54,719
um hard to know exactly how that will

4284
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:55,520
play out but at the end of the day like

4285
02:21:54,719 --> 02:21:57,279
both

4286
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:58,560
the goods transportation and the people

4287
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:00,479
transportation side of it has that

4288
02:21:58,559 --> 02:22:02,159
property where it's not easy there's a

4289
02:22:00,478 --> 02:22:03,679
lot of open questions and challenges to

4290
02:22:02,159 --> 02:22:06,239
navigate and there's obviously the

4291
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:08,880
technical problems to solve uh as a you

4292
02:22:06,239 --> 02:22:10,959
know kind of prerequisite but um

4293
02:22:08,879 --> 02:22:12,159
they they have such an opportunity that

4294
02:22:10,959 --> 02:22:14,079
is um

4295
02:22:12,159 --> 02:22:15,840
on a scale that very few industries in

4296
02:22:14,079 --> 02:22:18,000
the last 20 30 years have even had a

4297
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:19,040
chance to tackle that

4298
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,799
i

4299
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:22,960
maybe were pleasantly surprised by how

4300
02:22:20,799 --> 02:22:24,478
much how much that tipping point like in

4301
02:22:22,959 --> 02:22:26,719
a really short amount of time actually

4302
02:22:24,478 --> 02:22:28,559
turns into a societal pull to kind of

4303
02:22:26,719 --> 02:22:30,478
embrace the benefits of this yeah i i

4304
02:22:28,559 --> 02:22:32,239
hope so it seems like in the recent few

4305
02:22:30,478 --> 02:22:34,159
decades there's been tipping points for

4306
02:22:32,239 --> 02:22:36,879
technologies where like overnight things

4307
02:22:34,159 --> 02:22:39,200
change it's uh like uh

4308
02:22:36,879 --> 02:22:41,279
from taxis to ride sharing services all

4309
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:42,880
that that shift i mean there's just

4310
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:45,439
shift after shift after shift that

4311
02:22:42,879 --> 02:22:46,799
requires digitization and technology i'm

4312
02:22:45,439 --> 02:22:49,200
i hope we're pleasantly surprised in

4313
02:22:46,799 --> 02:22:51,599
this so there's millions of long-haul

4314
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:54,479
trucks now in the united states

4315
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:57,280
do you see a future where

4316
02:22:54,478 --> 02:22:59,279
there's millions of waymo trucks and

4317
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:01,040
maybe just broadly speaking way more

4318
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:03,840
vehicles just

4319
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:05,520
like like ants running around the united

4320
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:08,079
states uh

4321
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:09,680
freeways and local roads yeah in other

4322
02:23:08,079 --> 02:23:12,719
countries too like uh

4323
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:13,920
you look back decades from now and

4324
02:23:12,719 --> 02:23:15,358
it might be one of those things that

4325
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:16,960
just feels so natural and then it

4326
02:23:15,359 --> 02:23:18,880
becomes almost like a kind of

4327
02:23:16,959 --> 02:23:20,559
interesting kind of oddity that we had

4328
02:23:18,879 --> 02:23:22,318
none of it like uh you know kind of

4329
02:23:20,559 --> 02:23:23,199
decades earlier

4330
02:23:22,318 --> 02:23:25,439
and

4331
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:27,200
it'll take a long time to grow and scale

4332
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:28,800
very different challenges appear at

4333
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:30,319
every stage but

4334
02:23:28,799 --> 02:23:31,438
over time like

4335
02:23:30,318 --> 02:23:33,680
this is one of the most enabling

4336
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:37,359
technologies that um that we have in the

4337
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:38,639
world uh today um it'll feel like

4338
02:23:37,359 --> 02:23:39,840
you know how was the world before the

4339
02:23:38,639 --> 02:23:41,039
internet how's the world before mobile

4340
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:42,559
phones like it's gonna have that sort of

4341
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:44,319
a feeling to it on both sides it's hard

4342
02:23:42,559 --> 02:23:46,559
to predict the future but

4343
02:23:44,318 --> 02:23:48,398
do you sometimes

4344
02:23:46,559 --> 02:23:50,799
uh think about weird ways it might

4345
02:23:48,398 --> 02:23:51,920
change the world like surprising ways so

4346
02:23:50,799 --> 02:23:53,920
obviously

4347
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:55,920
there's more direct ways where like

4348
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:58,000
there's increases efficiency it'll

4349
02:23:55,920 --> 02:24:00,960
enable a lot of kind of logistics

4350
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:03,200
optimizations kind of things

4351
02:24:00,959 --> 02:24:05,839
it will change

4352
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:08,319
our uh probably our roadways and all

4353
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:10,318
that kind of stuff but it could also

4354
02:24:08,318 --> 02:24:12,159
change society in some kind of

4355
02:24:10,318 --> 02:24:13,920
interesting ways do you ever think about

4356
02:24:12,159 --> 02:24:15,920
how might change cities how might change

4357
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:18,000
their lives all that kind of yeah

4358
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:19,600
you can imagine city uh where people

4359
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,959
live versus work becoming more

4360
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:23,439
distributed because the pain of

4361
02:24:20,959 --> 02:24:24,879
commuting becomes different just easier

4362
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:26,239
uh and i don't know there's a lot of

4363
02:24:24,879 --> 02:24:28,799
options that open up

4364
02:24:26,239 --> 02:24:30,239
the way out of cities themselves and how

4365
02:24:28,799 --> 02:24:33,599
you think about

4366
02:24:30,239 --> 02:24:35,359
car storage and parking obviously uh

4367
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:37,520
just enables a completely different type

4368
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:39,040
of uh uh

4369
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:40,479
type of experience in urban environments

4370
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:41,520
i i think there was like a statistic

4371
02:24:40,478 --> 02:24:42,959
that uh

4372
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:45,920
something like

4373
02:24:42,959 --> 02:24:48,239
30 of the traffic uh in cities

4374
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:50,318
during rush hour is caused by a pursuit

4375
02:24:48,239 --> 02:24:51,600
of parking uh or some like some really

4376
02:24:50,318 --> 02:24:53,279
high stats so

4377
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:54,640
those obviously kind of open up a lot of

4378
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:57,760
options um

4379
02:24:54,639 --> 02:24:59,439
flexibility on goods will enable

4380
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:00,639
new industries and businesses that never

4381
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:02,559
existed before because now the

4382
02:25:00,639 --> 02:25:04,879
efficiency becomes

4383
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:06,799
more palatable good delivery timing

4384
02:25:04,879 --> 02:25:07,679
consistency and flexibility is going to

4385
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:09,438
change

4386
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:11,920
the way we distribute the logistics

4387
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:14,720
network will change the way we then can

4388
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:17,200
integrate with warehousing with

4389
02:25:14,719 --> 02:25:19,199
shipping ports you can start to think

4390
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:21,120
about greater automation through the

4391
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:23,120
whole kind of stack

4392
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:26,800
and how that supply chain the ripples

4393
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:28,079
become much more uh agile versus like

4394
02:25:26,799 --> 02:25:30,079
very

4395
02:25:28,079 --> 02:25:32,239
grindy the way they are

4396
02:25:30,079 --> 02:25:33,359
today where just the adaptation is like

4397
02:25:32,239 --> 02:25:35,119
very tough and there's a lot of

4398
02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:36,559
constraints that we have i think it'll

4399
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:38,880
be great for the environment it'll be

4400
02:25:36,559 --> 02:25:42,159
great for safety where like probably

4401
02:25:38,879 --> 02:25:45,119
about 95 of accidents today um

4402
02:25:42,159 --> 02:25:46,719
statistically are due to just uh

4403
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:47,920
attention or things that are preventable

4404
02:25:46,719 --> 02:25:49,679
with uh

4405
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:50,960
with the strengths of automation

4406
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:53,760
yeah and it'll be one of those things

4407
02:25:50,959 --> 02:25:55,519
where like industries will shift but the

4408
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:57,200
net creation is going to be massively

4409
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:58,560
positive and then we just have to be

4410
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:00,399
thoughtful about the negative

4411
02:25:58,559 --> 02:26:03,359
implications that will happen in local

4412
02:26:00,398 --> 02:26:04,639
area places um and adjust for those but

4413
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:05,840
i'm an optimist in general for the

4414
02:26:04,639 --> 02:26:08,159
technology where you could argue a

4415
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:09,840
negative on any new technology but you

4416
02:26:08,159 --> 02:26:11,920
start to kind of

4417
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:13,840
see that if there is a big demand for

4418
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:16,000
something like this the in almost all

4419
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:17,600
cases the like it's an enabling factor

4420
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,318
that's gonna kind of propagate through

4421
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:22,000
the um you know through society and

4422
02:26:20,318 --> 02:26:24,079
particularly as life expectancies get

4423
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:27,280
longer and you know and so forth like

4424
02:26:24,079 --> 02:26:28,879
there's a just a lot more need for um a

4425
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:30,720
greater percentage of the population to

4426
02:26:28,879 --> 02:26:32,159
kind of just be serviced with a high

4427
02:26:30,719 --> 02:26:33,199
level of efficiency

4428
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:34,639
because otherwise we can have a really

4429
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:36,720
hard time kind of scaling to what's

4430
02:26:34,639 --> 02:26:38,159
ahead in the next 50 years um

4431
02:26:36,719 --> 02:26:41,039
yeah and you're absolutely right every

4432
02:26:38,159 --> 02:26:43,280
technology has uh negative consequences

4433
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:44,720
of positive consequences and we tend to

4434
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:46,880
focus on the negative a little bit too

4435
02:26:44,719 --> 02:26:49,039
much

4436
02:26:46,879 --> 02:26:52,879
in fact autonomous trucks are

4437
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:54,640
often brought up as an example of uh

4438
02:26:52,879 --> 02:26:57,199
artificial intelligence and robots in

4439
02:26:54,639 --> 02:26:59,039
general taking our jobs

4440
02:26:57,200 --> 02:27:01,439
and as we've talked about briefly here

4441
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:02,800
we talk a lot with steve you know

4442
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:05,600
that's

4443
02:27:02,799 --> 02:27:07,679
it is a concern that automation

4444
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:09,760
will take away certain jobs it will

4445
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:10,800
create other jobs so there's temporary

4446
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:13,120
pain

4447
02:27:10,799 --> 02:27:15,438
uh hopefully temporary but pain is pain

4448
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:16,880
and all people suffer and that human

4449
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:17,840
suffering is really important to think

4450
02:27:16,879 --> 02:27:19,519
about

4451
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:20,719
how uh but

4452
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:22,720
trucking is

4453
02:27:20,719 --> 02:27:25,760
ver i mean there's a lot written on this

4454
02:27:22,719 --> 02:27:28,799
is i would say far from the the thing

4455
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:30,159
that that would cause the most pain yeah

4456
02:27:28,799 --> 02:27:31,599
there's even more positive properties

4457
02:27:30,159 --> 02:27:33,200
about trucking where not only is there

4458
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:35,040
just a you know huge shortage which is

4459
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:36,800
going to increase the average age of

4460
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:38,000
truck drivers is getting closer to 50

4461
02:27:36,799 --> 02:27:39,840
because the younger people aren't

4462
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:42,398
wanting to come into it they're trying

4463
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:44,639
to like incentivize lower the age limit

4464
02:27:42,398 --> 02:27:46,559
like all these sort of things um and the

4465
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:48,559
demand is just going to increase and the

4466
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:49,920
least favorable like it depends on the

4467
02:27:48,559 --> 02:27:51,680
person but in most cases the least

4468
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:53,359
favorable types of routes are the

4469
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:55,200
massive long-haul routes where you're on

4470
02:27:53,359 --> 02:27:57,439
the road away from your family 300 plus

4471
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:59,359
stations steve talked about the pain of

4472
02:27:57,439 --> 02:28:01,680
those kind of routes from a family

4473
02:27:59,359 --> 02:28:03,200
perspective you're

4474
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:06,720
you're basically away from family it's

4475
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:08,560
not just hours you work insane hours but

4476
02:28:06,719 --> 02:28:09,920
it's also just time away from family

4477
02:28:08,559 --> 02:28:11,279
right and just obesity rate is through

4478
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:12,799
the roof because you're just sitting all

4479
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:14,800
day like

4480
02:28:12,799 --> 02:28:16,079
it's really really tough and um

4481
02:28:14,799 --> 02:28:17,358
and that's also where like the biggest

4482
02:28:16,079 --> 02:28:18,799
kind of safety risk is because of

4483
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:20,800
fatigue and um

4484
02:28:18,799 --> 02:28:22,478
and so when you think of the gradual

4485
02:28:20,799 --> 02:28:24,079
evolution of how trucking comes in first

4486
02:28:22,478 --> 02:28:26,318
of all it's not overnight it's gonna

4487
02:28:24,079 --> 02:28:28,239
take decades to kind of phase in all the

4488
02:28:26,318 --> 02:28:29,119
like there's just a long long long road

4489
02:28:28,239 --> 02:28:30,000
ahead

4490
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:32,319
but

4491
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:34,398
the the routes and the portions of

4492
02:28:32,318 --> 02:28:36,159
trucking that are going to require

4493
02:28:34,398 --> 02:28:38,318
humans the longest and benefit the most

4494
02:28:36,159 --> 02:28:40,478
from humans are the short-haul and most

4495
02:28:38,318 --> 02:28:42,159
complicated kind of more urban routes

4496
02:28:40,478 --> 02:28:44,879
which are also the more more pleasant

4497
02:28:42,159 --> 02:28:48,318
ones which are um you know less

4498
02:28:44,879 --> 02:28:49,839
continual driving time more um uh

4499
02:28:48,318 --> 02:28:52,000
more flexibility on like you know

4500
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:53,680
geography and location and you get to

4501
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,600
kind of sleep with the at home with you

4502
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:57,280
at your own home and very importantly if

4503
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,359
you optimize the logistics you're going

4504
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:02,159
to use human

4505
02:28:59,359 --> 02:29:04,318
you're going to use humans much better

4506
02:29:02,159 --> 02:29:05,920
that's right and and thereby pay them

4507
02:29:04,318 --> 02:29:08,318
much better because like one one of the

4508
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:10,398
biggest problems is truck drivers

4509
02:29:08,318 --> 02:29:13,279
currently are paid by like how much they

4510
02:29:10,398 --> 02:29:15,439
drive so you they really feel the pain

4511
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:17,280
of it inefficient logistics yeah because

4512
02:29:15,439 --> 02:29:19,280
like if they're just sitting around for

4513
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:21,040
hours which they often do not driving

4514
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:23,120
waiting yeah they're not getting paid

4515
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:25,280
for that time that's right and that so

4516
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:26,960
like logistics has a significant impact

4517
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:28,560
on the quality of life of a truck driver

4518
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:30,398
and high percentage of trucks are like

4519
02:29:28,559 --> 02:29:32,318
uh empty because of inefficiencies in

4520
02:29:30,398 --> 02:29:33,760
the system um yeah it's one of those

4521
02:29:32,318 --> 02:29:34,799
things where like um

4522
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:36,880
and the other thing is when you increase

4523
02:29:34,799 --> 02:29:39,438
the efficiency of a system like this the

4524
02:29:36,879 --> 02:29:41,358
overall net like volume of the system

4525
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:42,960
tends to increase right like the

4526
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:45,280
the entire market cap of trucking is

4527
02:29:42,959 --> 02:29:48,239
going to go up um when the efficiency

4528
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:49,920
improves uh and facilitates both growth

4529
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:52,159
and industries and better utilization of

4530
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:54,478
trucking um and so that on its own just

4531
02:29:52,159 --> 02:29:56,959
creates more and more demand which um

4532
02:29:54,478 --> 02:29:59,438
uh of all the places where ai comes in

4533
02:29:56,959 --> 02:30:00,398
and starts to really um

4534
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:02,239
uh

4535
02:30:00,398 --> 02:30:03,680
kind of reshape an industry this is one

4536
02:30:02,239 --> 02:30:06,159
of those where like there's just a lot

4537
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:07,600
of positives that for at least any time

4538
02:30:06,159 --> 02:30:11,039
in the foreseeable future seem really

4539
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:12,559
lined up in a good way um to um

4540
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:15,200
kind of come in and help with the

4541
02:30:12,559 --> 02:30:17,439
shortage and start to kind of optimize

4542
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:19,520
for the routes that are most dangerous

4543
02:30:17,439 --> 02:30:20,479
and most painful

4544
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:22,159
yeah so

4545
02:30:20,478 --> 02:30:24,639
this is true for trucking but if we zoom

4546
02:30:22,159 --> 02:30:25,439
out broader you know automation and ai

4547
02:30:24,639 --> 02:30:27,358
does

4548
02:30:25,439 --> 02:30:28,720
technology broadly i would say but you

4549
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:30,640
know automation

4550
02:30:28,719 --> 02:30:32,159
is a thing that

4551
02:30:30,639 --> 02:30:34,559
has a potential in the next couple of

4552
02:30:32,159 --> 02:30:37,439
decades to shift the kind of jobs

4553
02:30:34,559 --> 02:30:39,519
available to humans yes and

4554
02:30:37,439 --> 02:30:41,200
so that results in

4555
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:43,120
like i said human suffering because

4556
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:44,079
people lose their jobs there's economic

4557
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:47,120
pain there

4558
02:30:44,079 --> 02:30:49,600
and there's also a pain of meaning so

4559
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:50,960
for a lot of people

4560
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:53,359
work is a

4561
02:30:50,959 --> 02:30:54,719
source of uh meaning it's a source of

4562
02:30:53,359 --> 02:30:56,880
identity of

4563
02:30:54,719 --> 02:30:58,559
of pride

4564
02:30:56,879 --> 02:31:01,039
of you know

4565
02:30:58,559 --> 02:31:03,519
pride in getting good at the job pride

4566
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:05,840
in craftsmanship and excellence which is

4567
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:08,159
what truck drivers talk about yeah but

4568
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:10,398
but that this is true for a lot of jobs

4569
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:12,398
and is that something you think about as

4570
02:31:10,398 --> 02:31:14,879
a sort of a roboticist zooming out from

4571
02:31:12,398 --> 02:31:16,239
the trucking thing um

4572
02:31:14,879 --> 02:31:18,478
like where

4573
02:31:16,239 --> 02:31:21,439
do you think it would be harder

4574
02:31:18,478 --> 02:31:23,279
to find activity and work that's a

4575
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:24,559
source of identity and source of meaning

4576
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:26,159
in the future

4577
02:31:24,559 --> 02:31:28,478
like i do think about it because you

4578
02:31:26,159 --> 02:31:30,719
want to make sure that you you worry

4579
02:31:28,478 --> 02:31:32,959
about the entire system like not just

4580
02:31:30,719 --> 02:31:34,318
like the party economy plays in it but

4581
02:31:32,959 --> 02:31:36,318
what are the ripple effects of it down

4582
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:37,680
the road and um

4583
02:31:36,318 --> 02:31:39,359
on enough of a time window there's a lot

4584
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:40,880
of opportunity to put in the right

4585
02:31:39,359 --> 02:31:43,359
policies and the right opportunities to

4586
02:31:40,879 --> 02:31:44,639
kind of reshape and retrain and find

4587
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:47,200
those openings and so just to give you a

4588
02:31:44,639 --> 02:31:50,639
few examples both trucking and cars

4589
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:51,680
we have remote assistance facilities

4590
02:31:50,639 --> 02:31:53,760
that

4591
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:56,479
are there to interface with customers

4592
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:58,079
and monitor vehicles and

4593
02:31:56,478 --> 02:32:00,719
provide like very focused kind of

4594
02:31:58,079 --> 02:32:02,799
assistance on uh kind of areas where the

4595
02:32:00,719 --> 02:32:04,318
vehicle may want to request help uh in

4596
02:32:02,799 --> 02:32:06,079
understanding an environment so those

4597
02:32:04,318 --> 02:32:07,119
are jobs that kind of get created and

4598
02:32:06,079 --> 02:32:08,799
supported

4599
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:10,880
i remember like taking a tour of one of

4600
02:32:08,799 --> 02:32:13,119
the amazon facilities where you've

4601
02:32:10,879 --> 02:32:14,318
probably seen the kiva systems robots uh

4602
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:15,920
where you have these orange robots that

4603
02:32:14,318 --> 02:32:18,079
have automated um

4604
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:20,559
the warehouse like kind of picking and

4605
02:32:18,079 --> 02:32:22,478
collecting of items in this like really

4606
02:32:20,559 --> 02:32:23,680
elegant and beautiful way um it's

4607
02:32:22,478 --> 02:32:25,760
actually one of my favorite applications

4608
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:27,680
of robotics of all time um

4609
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:29,439
uh you know like i think it kind of came

4610
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:31,200
across a company like 2006 was just

4611
02:32:29,439 --> 02:32:32,559
amazing and

4612
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:34,159
what was the warehouse or was the

4613
02:32:32,559 --> 02:32:35,760
transport little thing so basically

4614
02:32:34,159 --> 02:32:37,119
instead of a person going and walking

4615
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:38,960
around and picking the seven items in

4616
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:41,600
your order um

4617
02:32:38,959 --> 02:32:43,519
these robots go and pick up a shelf

4618
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:44,880
and move it over in a row where like the

4619
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:46,640
seven shelves that contain the seven

4620
02:32:44,879 --> 02:32:48,000
items are lined up and a

4621
02:32:46,639 --> 02:32:49,279
you know laser or whatever points to

4622
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,799
what you need to get and you go and pick

4623
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:52,159
it and you place it to fill the order

4624
02:32:50,799 --> 02:32:54,239
and so the people were fulfilling the

4625
02:32:52,159 --> 02:32:56,079
final orders what was interesting about

4626
02:32:54,239 --> 02:32:57,520
that is that when i was asking them

4627
02:32:56,079 --> 02:32:59,200
about like kind of the impact on labor

4628
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:01,600
when they transitioned that warehouse

4629
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:03,520
the throughput increased so much that

4630
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:05,040
the jobs shifted towards the final

4631
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:06,720
fulfillment

4632
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:08,560
even though the robots took over

4633
02:33:06,719 --> 02:33:11,119
entirely the the search of the items

4634
02:33:08,559 --> 02:33:13,279
themselves and the labor

4635
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:15,040
the job stayed like nobody like that was

4636
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:16,560
actually the same amount of jobs uh

4637
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:18,399
roughly they were necessary but the

4638
02:33:16,559 --> 02:33:20,398
throughput increased by i think over 2x

4639
02:33:18,398 --> 02:33:22,159
or some some amount right like so

4640
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:23,599
um you have these situations that are

4641
02:33:22,159 --> 02:33:25,280
not zero-sum games in this really

4642
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:26,239
interesting way and the optimist to me

4643
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:28,560
thinks that there's these types of

4644
02:33:26,239 --> 02:33:30,239
solutions in almost any industry where

4645
02:33:28,559 --> 02:33:32,159
the growth that's enabled creates

4646
02:33:30,239 --> 02:33:33,760
opportunities that you can then leverage

4647
02:33:32,159 --> 02:33:35,840
but you got to be intentional about

4648
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:37,359
finding those and really helping make

4649
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:39,120
those links because

4650
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:41,200
any even if you make the argument that

4651
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:43,200
like there's a net positive

4652
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:44,640
locally there's always tough hits that

4653
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:46,640
you got to be very careful about that's

4654
02:33:44,639 --> 02:33:48,478
right you have to have an understanding

4655
02:33:46,639 --> 02:33:50,478
of that link because there's a short

4656
02:33:48,478 --> 02:33:52,398
period of time

4657
02:33:50,478 --> 02:33:54,159
whether training is required or just

4658
02:33:52,398 --> 02:33:55,760
mental transition or physical or

4659
02:33:54,159 --> 02:33:57,840
whatever is required

4660
02:33:55,760 --> 02:34:00,000
that's still going to be short-term pain

4661
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:02,880
the uncertainty of it there's families

4662
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:05,359
involved you know it

4663
02:34:02,879 --> 02:34:07,358
it's i mean it's exceptionally

4664
02:34:05,359 --> 02:34:09,760
it's difficult on a human level and you

4665
02:34:07,359 --> 02:34:11,520
have to really think about that even you

4666
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:13,520
can't just look at economic metrics

4667
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:15,439
always it's human beings that's right

4668
02:34:13,520 --> 02:34:17,280
and you can't even just uh take it as

4669
02:34:15,439 --> 02:34:18,479
like okay well we need to like subsidize

4670
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:20,880
or whatever because like there is an

4671
02:34:18,478 --> 02:34:21,760
element of just personal pride where

4672
02:34:20,879 --> 02:34:23,438
right

4673
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:25,120
majority of people like people don't

4674
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:26,639
want to just be okay but like they want

4675
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:28,880
to actually like have a craft like you

4676
02:34:26,639 --> 02:34:29,920
said and have a mission and

4677
02:34:28,879 --> 02:34:32,318
feel like they're having a really

4678
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:33,920
positive impact and so um

4679
02:34:32,318 --> 02:34:36,719
my personal belief is that there's a lot

4680
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:38,960
of transferability and skill set um

4681
02:34:36,719 --> 02:34:41,840
that is possible especially if you

4682
02:34:38,959 --> 02:34:44,879
create a bridge and an investment um to

4683
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:46,398
enable it um and to some degree that's

4684
02:34:44,879 --> 02:34:47,759
our responsibility as well

4685
02:34:46,398 --> 02:34:51,119
this process

4686
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:53,120
uh you mentioned kiva robots amazon

4687
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:55,600
let me ask you about

4688
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:57,920
the astro robot which is i don't know if

4689
02:34:55,600 --> 02:35:00,079
you've seen it it's amazon's announced

4690
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:02,398
that

4691
02:35:00,079 --> 02:35:03,359
it's a home robot that they have a

4692
02:35:02,398 --> 02:35:05,279
screen

4693
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:07,200
looks awfully a lot like

4694
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:09,920
cosmo has

4695
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:11,439
i think different vision probably

4696
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:13,200
what are your thoughts about like home

4697
02:35:11,439 --> 02:35:14,239
robotics in this kind of space there's

4698
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:16,240
been a

4699
02:35:14,239 --> 02:35:19,600
quite a bunch of home robots social

4700
02:35:16,239 --> 02:35:22,398
robots that very unfortunately have

4701
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:24,159
closed their doors that um for various

4702
02:35:22,398 --> 02:35:25,920
reasons perhaps they were too expensive

4703
02:35:24,159 --> 02:35:27,359
there's manufacturing challenges all

4704
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:29,040
that kind of stuff what are your

4705
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:30,000
thoughts about amazon getting into this

4706
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,840
space

4707
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:33,600
yeah we had some signs that they were

4708
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:35,760
getting into like long long long long

4709
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:37,680
ago maybe they're a little

4710
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:39,359
too interested in cosmo and uh yeah

4711
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:41,200
during our conversations but they're

4712
02:35:39,359 --> 02:35:42,720
also very good partners actually for us

4713
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:45,520
as we kind of disintegrated a lot of

4714
02:35:42,719 --> 02:35:47,199
shared technology but if i could also

4715
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:48,720
get your thoughts on

4716
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:53,520
you know you could think of

4717
02:35:48,719 --> 02:35:54,799
alexa as a robot as well yeah echo

4718
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:56,800
do you see those as fundamentally

4719
02:35:54,799 --> 02:35:58,478
different just because you can move and

4720
02:35:56,799 --> 02:35:59,759
look around is that fundamentally

4721
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:02,959
different than the thing that just sits

4722
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:03,920
in place uh it opens up options um but

4723
02:36:02,959 --> 02:36:05,438
uh

4724
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:07,120
you know my first reaction is i think

4725
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:08,159
like

4726
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:09,680
i have my doubts that this one's going

4727
02:36:08,159 --> 02:36:11,359
to hit the mark because i think for the

4728
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:12,800
price point that it's at

4729
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:14,479
and the like kind of functionality and

4730
02:36:12,799 --> 02:36:16,719
value propositions that they're i'm

4731
02:36:14,478 --> 02:36:17,840
trying to put out it's uh uh it's still

4732
02:36:16,719 --> 02:36:19,840
searching for like the killer

4733
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:22,000
application that like justifies i think

4734
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:23,439
it was like a 1500 price point or kind

4735
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,280
of somewhere around there that's a

4736
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:27,120
really high bar so

4737
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:29,280
there's enthusiasts an early adopters

4738
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:30,880
will obviously kind of pursue it but you

4739
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:32,640
have to like really really hit a high

4740
02:36:30,879 --> 02:36:34,478
mark at that price point which we always

4741
02:36:32,639 --> 02:36:36,079
tried to we were always very cautious

4742
02:36:34,478 --> 02:36:37,840
about jumping too quickly to the more

4743
02:36:36,079 --> 02:36:40,318
advanced systems that we really wanted

4744
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:41,760
to make but would have

4745
02:36:40,318 --> 02:36:42,799
raised the bar so much you have to be

4746
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:44,239
able to hit it

4747
02:36:42,799 --> 02:36:45,438
in today's cost structures and

4748
02:36:44,239 --> 02:36:48,079
technologies

4749
02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:49,520
the mobility is an angle that hasn't

4750
02:36:48,079 --> 02:36:50,478
been utilized

4751
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:52,319
but

4752
02:36:50,478 --> 02:36:53,599
it has to be utilized in the right way

4753
02:36:52,318 --> 02:36:55,119
um and so that's going to be the biggest

4754
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:57,520
challenge is like can you

4755
02:36:55,120 --> 02:37:00,079
meet the bar of what a con what the mass

4756
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:01,600
market consumer like you know think like

4757
02:37:00,079 --> 02:37:03,760
you know our

4758
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:06,079
uh our neighbors our friend parents like

4759
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:08,719
would they find a deep deep value like

4760
02:37:06,079 --> 02:37:10,079
in you know fi in this at a mass scale

4761
02:37:08,719 --> 02:37:11,358
that you know that justifies the price

4762
02:37:10,079 --> 02:37:12,959
point i think that's in the end one of

4763
02:37:11,359 --> 02:37:14,880
the biggest challenges for robotics

4764
02:37:12,959 --> 02:37:17,119
especially consumer robotics

4765
02:37:14,879 --> 02:37:19,920
where you have to kind of meet that bar

4766
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:22,399
uh it becomes very very hard um and

4767
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:24,559
there's also the higher bar just like

4768
02:37:22,398 --> 02:37:26,719
you were saying with cosmo of

4769
02:37:24,559 --> 02:37:28,559
you know a thing that can

4770
02:37:26,719 --> 02:37:30,239
look one way and then turn around and

4771
02:37:28,559 --> 02:37:32,639
look at you

4772
02:37:30,239 --> 02:37:35,600
there's that's either a super desirable

4773
02:37:32,639 --> 02:37:37,039
quality or super undesirable quality

4774
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:39,200
depending on how much you trust the

4775
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:41,120
thing that's right and so there's uh

4776
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:42,640
there's a problem of trust to solve

4777
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:44,720
there there's a problem of personalities

4778
02:37:42,639 --> 02:37:47,119
the thing is the quote-unquote problem

4779
02:37:44,719 --> 02:37:49,279
that cosmos solved so well yeah is that

4780
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:50,640
there you trust the thing yeah and that

4781
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:52,800
has to do with the company with the

4782
02:37:50,639 --> 02:37:54,239
leadership with the intent that's

4783
02:37:52,799 --> 02:37:56,398
communicated by the device and the

4784
02:37:54,239 --> 02:37:59,280
company and everything together yeah

4785
02:37:56,398 --> 02:38:01,039
exactly right uh and so um and i think

4786
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:02,479
they also have to retrace some of the

4787
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:04,479
like learnings on the character side

4788
02:38:02,478 --> 02:38:06,959
where like as usual i think that's the

4789
02:38:04,478 --> 02:38:08,478
place where it's uh a lot of companies

4790
02:38:06,959 --> 02:38:09,919
are great at the hardware side of it and

4791
02:38:08,478 --> 02:38:11,438
can you know think about those elements

4792
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:12,719
and then there's like you know the

4793
02:38:11,439 --> 02:38:14,559
thinking about the ai challenges

4794
02:38:12,719 --> 02:38:16,318
particularly the advantage of alexa is a

4795
02:38:14,559 --> 02:38:18,239
pretty huge boost for them um the

4796
02:38:16,318 --> 02:38:20,478
character side of it for technology

4797
02:38:18,239 --> 02:38:23,199
companies is pretty new novel territory

4798
02:38:20,478 --> 02:38:25,438
and so that will take some iterations

4799
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:26,800
but um yeah i mean i hope

4800
02:38:25,439 --> 02:38:28,960
i hope there's continued progress in the

4801
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:30,559
space and that threat doesn't kind of go

4802
02:38:28,959 --> 02:38:31,919
dormant for too long

4803
02:38:30,559 --> 02:38:33,760
and it's not you know it's going to take

4804
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:35,920
a while to kind of

4805
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:37,280
evolve into like the ideal applications

4806
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:40,318
but you know

4807
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:41,680
this is one of um amazon's i guess like

4808
02:38:40,318 --> 02:38:43,920
you could call it it's definitely like

4809
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:45,359
part of their dna but in many cases it's

4810
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:47,920
also strength where they're very willing

4811
02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:51,040
to like iterate uh kind of aggressively

4812
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:52,719
and um and move quickly not take risks

4813
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:54,640
and take risks you have deep pockets so

4814
02:38:52,719 --> 02:38:57,679
you can yeah and they'll maybe have more

4815
02:38:54,639 --> 02:38:58,719
misfires than an apple would um but uh

4816
02:38:57,680 --> 02:39:01,359
you know it's different styles and

4817
02:38:58,719 --> 02:39:02,719
different approaches and um you know

4818
02:39:01,359 --> 02:39:04,800
at the end of the day it's like there's

4819
02:39:02,719 --> 02:39:07,519
a few familiar uh kind of elements there

4820
02:39:04,799 --> 02:39:10,478
for sure which was uh you know kind of

4821
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:12,800
you know homage

4822
02:39:10,478 --> 02:39:15,599
is one way to put it yeah uh so why is

4823
02:39:12,799 --> 02:39:15,599
it so hard

4824
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:20,079
at a high level

4825
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:22,000
um to build a robotics company a

4826
02:39:20,079 --> 02:39:24,879
robotics company that

4827
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:27,600
lives for a long time so if you look at

4828
02:39:24,879 --> 02:39:30,000
so i thought cosmo for sure would live

4829
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:32,079
for a very long time that to me was

4830
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:34,318
exceptionally successful vision and idea

4831
02:39:32,079 --> 02:39:37,280
and implementation

4832
02:39:34,318 --> 02:39:38,719
irobot is an example of a company that

4833
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:41,760
has

4834
02:39:38,719 --> 02:39:42,639
pivoted in all the right ways to survive

4835
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:44,398
and

4836
02:39:42,639 --> 02:39:46,318
arguably thrive

4837
02:39:44,398 --> 02:39:48,318
by focusing on the

4838
02:39:46,318 --> 02:39:50,478
having like a

4839
02:39:48,318 --> 02:39:53,279
have a driver that constantly provides

4840
02:39:50,478 --> 02:39:54,879
profit which is the vacuum cleaner

4841
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:57,200
and of course there's like amazon what

4842
02:39:54,879 --> 02:39:58,559
they're what they're doing is they're

4843
02:39:57,200 --> 02:40:00,159
almost like taking risks so they can

4844
02:39:58,559 --> 02:40:03,439
afford it because they have other

4845
02:40:00,159 --> 02:40:05,520
sources of revenue right but outside of

4846
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:08,398
those examples

4847
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:10,880
most robotics companies fail yeah

4848
02:40:08,398 --> 02:40:13,039
why why do they fail why is it so hard

4849
02:40:10,879 --> 02:40:15,199
to run a robotics company our robot's

4850
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:16,720
impressive because they found a really

4851
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:18,319
really great

4852
02:40:16,719 --> 02:40:21,199
fit of where the technology could

4853
02:40:18,318 --> 02:40:22,318
satisfy a really clear used case in need

4854
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:24,319
and

4855
02:40:22,318 --> 02:40:27,199
they did it well and they didn't try to

4856
02:40:24,318 --> 02:40:29,278
overshoot from a cost-to-benefit

4857
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:30,960
standpoint

4858
02:40:29,279 --> 02:40:32,479
robotics is hard because it like tends

4859
02:40:30,959 --> 02:40:34,159
to be more expensive it combines way

4860
02:40:32,478 --> 02:40:36,318
more technologies than a lot of other

4861
02:40:34,159 --> 02:40:38,879
types of companies do if i were to like

4862
02:40:36,318 --> 02:40:40,959
say one thing that is maybe the biggest

4863
02:40:38,879 --> 02:40:41,839
risk and like a robotics company failing

4864
02:40:40,959 --> 02:40:43,519
is that

4865
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:46,239
it can be either a

4866
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:47,279
technology in search of a application

4867
02:40:46,239 --> 02:40:50,478
or

4868
02:40:47,279 --> 02:40:52,479
they try to bite off a

4869
02:40:50,478 --> 02:40:55,519
kind of an offering that has

4870
02:40:52,478 --> 02:40:57,278
a mismatch and kind of price to function

4871
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:59,200
um and uh

4872
02:40:57,279 --> 02:41:01,840
just the mass market appeal isn't there

4873
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:04,000
and um consumer products are just hard

4874
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:06,079
it's just i mean after all the years and

4875
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:09,120
it like definitely kind of feel a lot of

4876
02:41:06,079 --> 02:41:10,239
the battle scars because you have um you

4877
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:11,760
know you not only do you have to like

4878
02:41:10,239 --> 02:41:13,920
hit the function but you have to educate

4879
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:16,639
and explain get awareness up deal with

4880
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:18,079
different conductive consumers like uh

4881
02:41:16,639 --> 02:41:19,519
you know there's um there's a reason why

4882
02:41:18,079 --> 02:41:21,039
a lot of technology sometimes start in

4883
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:22,880
the enterprise space and then kind of

4884
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:25,520
continue forward in the consumer space

4885
02:41:22,879 --> 02:41:26,959
even like you know you see ar like

4886
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:29,359
starting to kind of make that shift with

4887
02:41:26,959 --> 02:41:31,039
hololens and so forth in some ways

4888
02:41:29,359 --> 02:41:33,520
consumers and price points that they're

4889
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:35,279
willing to kind of uh be attracted in a

4890
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:36,800
mass market way and i don't mean like

4891
02:41:35,279 --> 02:41:38,159
you know 10 000 enthusiasts bought it

4892
02:41:36,799 --> 02:41:41,840
but i mean like

4893
02:41:38,159 --> 02:41:44,639
you know 2 million 10 million 50 million

4894
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:46,398
like mass market kind of interest uh you

4895
02:41:44,639 --> 02:41:48,478
know have bought it

4896
02:41:46,398 --> 02:41:50,398
that bar is very very high and typically

4897
02:41:48,478 --> 02:41:52,079
robotics is novel enough and

4898
02:41:50,398 --> 02:41:53,760
non-standardized enough to where pushes

4899
02:41:52,079 --> 02:41:55,760
on price points so much

4900
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:57,840
you can easily get out of range where

4901
02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:59,040
the capabilities and today's technology

4902
02:41:57,840 --> 02:42:01,439
or just a function that was picked just

4903
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:03,279
doesn't line up um and so that product

4904
02:42:01,439 --> 02:42:05,680
market fit is very important

4905
02:42:03,279 --> 02:42:08,319
so the space of killer apps or

4906
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:10,800
a rather super compelling apps is much

4907
02:42:08,318 --> 02:42:13,119
smaller because it's easy to get outside

4908
02:42:10,799 --> 02:42:15,199
the price range yeah and most consumers

4909
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:16,319
and it's not constant right like yeah

4910
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:18,079
that's why like we picked off

4911
02:42:16,318 --> 02:42:20,159
entertainment because

4912
02:42:18,079 --> 02:42:22,159
the quality was just so low in physical

4913
02:42:20,159 --> 02:42:24,318
entertainment that we could we felt we

4914
02:42:22,159 --> 02:42:25,760
could leapfrog that and still create a

4915
02:42:24,318 --> 02:42:27,519
really compelling offering at a price

4916
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:30,239
point that was defensible and and we

4917
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:31,120
like that proved out to be true um

4918
02:42:30,239 --> 02:42:33,520
and

4919
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:36,640
over time that same opportunity opens up

4920
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:38,079
in healthcare in home applications and

4921
02:42:36,639 --> 02:42:40,079
you know commercial

4922
02:42:38,079 --> 02:42:41,439
applications and kind of broader more

4923
02:42:40,079 --> 02:42:42,159
generalized interface

4924
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:43,840
but

4925
02:42:42,159 --> 02:42:45,600
there's missing pieces in order for that

4926
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:47,520
to happen and all of those have to be

4927
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:49,520
present um for it to line up and we see

4928
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:51,680
these sort of trends in technology where

4929
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:53,359
um you know kind of technologies that

4930
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:55,200
start in one place

4931
02:42:53,359 --> 02:42:57,120
evolve and kind of grow to another

4932
02:42:55,200 --> 02:42:58,079
something starting gaming some things

4933
02:42:57,120 --> 02:42:59,120
start in

4934
02:42:58,079 --> 02:43:01,359
uh

4935
02:42:59,120 --> 02:43:03,359
in space uh or aerospace and then kind

4936
02:43:01,359 --> 02:43:04,960
of move into the consumer market

4937
02:43:03,359 --> 02:43:07,040
and sometimes it's just a timing thing

4938
02:43:04,959 --> 02:43:09,278
right where how many

4939
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:11,359
stabs at what became the iphone were

4940
02:43:09,279 --> 02:43:13,840
there over the 20 years before that just

4941
02:43:11,359 --> 02:43:15,760
weren't quite ready in the function um

4942
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:18,239
relative to the kind of price point and

4943
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:19,840
complexity and sometimes it's a small

4944
02:43:18,239 --> 02:43:22,719
detail of the implementation that makes

4945
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:24,079
all the difference which is uh design uh

4946
02:43:22,719 --> 02:43:26,079
design is so important well something

4947
02:43:24,079 --> 02:43:29,279
yeah like the the you the new generation

4948
02:43:26,079 --> 02:43:30,079
ux right yeah it's um and uh and that's

4949
02:43:29,279 --> 02:43:32,079
uh

4950
02:43:30,079 --> 02:43:33,359
um it's tough and oftentimes all of them

4951
02:43:32,079 --> 02:43:35,120
have to be there and it has to be like a

4952
02:43:33,359 --> 02:43:36,559
perfect storm and um

4953
02:43:35,120 --> 02:43:38,479
but yeah history repeats itself in a lot

4954
02:43:36,559 --> 02:43:40,318
of ways uh in a lot of these trends

4955
02:43:38,478 --> 02:43:42,000
which is pretty fascinating well let me

4956
02:43:40,318 --> 02:43:43,600
ask you about the humanoid form what do

4957
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:46,239
you think about the tesla bot and

4958
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:49,279
humanoid robotics in general

4959
02:43:46,239 --> 02:43:50,879
so obviously to me autonomous driving

4960
02:43:49,279 --> 02:43:51,920
waymo and the other companies working in

4961
02:43:50,879 --> 02:43:54,959
the space

4962
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:57,120
that seems to be a great place to invest

4963
02:43:54,959 --> 02:44:00,239
in potential revolutionary application

4964
02:43:57,120 --> 02:44:02,800
robotics application focused application

4965
02:44:00,239 --> 02:44:03,680
what's the role of humanoid robotics do

4966
02:44:02,799 --> 02:44:06,318
you think

4967
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:08,479
teslabot is ridiculous do you think it's

4968
02:44:06,318 --> 02:44:10,719
super promising do you think it's

4969
02:44:08,478 --> 02:44:12,799
interesting full of mystery nobody knows

4970
02:44:10,719 --> 02:44:15,519
what do you think about this thing yeah

4971
02:44:12,799 --> 02:44:17,438
i think today humanoid form robotics is

4972
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:18,880
research there's very few situations

4973
02:44:17,439 --> 02:44:20,960
where you actually need a humanoid form

4974
02:44:18,879 --> 02:44:23,039
to solve a problem uh if you think about

4975
02:44:20,959 --> 02:44:24,719
it right like wheels are more efficient

4976
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:27,200
than legs there's

4977
02:44:24,719 --> 02:44:28,318
joints and degrees of freedom beyond a

4978
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:30,399
certain point just add a lot of

4979
02:44:28,318 --> 02:44:32,079
complexity and cost right so if you're

4980
02:44:30,398 --> 02:44:33,439
doing a humanoid robot oftentimes it's

4981
02:44:32,079 --> 02:44:34,799
in the pursuit of a humanoid robot not

4982
02:44:33,439 --> 02:44:35,840
in a pursuit of an application for the

4983
02:44:34,799 --> 02:44:36,799
time being

4984
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:38,000
um

4985
02:44:36,799 --> 02:44:39,759
especially when you have like kind of

4986
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:42,159
the gaps and interface and you know kind

4987
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:44,159
of ai that we kind of talk about today

4988
02:44:42,159 --> 02:44:45,920
so anything you want does i'm interested

4989
02:44:44,159 --> 02:44:47,119
in following so there's there's an

4990
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:49,040
element of that world no matter how

4991
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:50,240
crazy how crazy it is i just like you

4992
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:51,600
know i'll pay attention i'm curious to

4993
02:44:50,239 --> 02:44:54,079
see what comes out of it so it's like

4994
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:56,000
you can't you can't ever you know ignore

4995
02:44:54,079 --> 02:44:57,359
it but you know it's uh definitely far

4996
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:00,478
afield from their kind of core business

4997
02:44:57,359 --> 02:45:02,800
um uh obviously and um what was

4998
02:45:00,478 --> 02:45:05,119
interesting to me is i've

4999
02:45:02,799 --> 02:45:07,039
i've disagreed with you know elon a lot

5000
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:08,000
about this

5001
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:10,000
is

5002
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,920
to me the in the compelling aspect of

5003
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:14,478
the humanoid form

5004
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:15,520
and a lot of kind of robots cosmo for

5005
02:45:14,478 --> 02:45:17,760
example

5006
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:20,000
is a human robot interaction

5007
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:20,000
part

5008
02:45:20,159 --> 02:45:23,760
from

5009
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:25,680
elon musk's perspective the tesla bot

5010
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:27,279
has nothing to do with the human

5011
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:28,960
it's a form

5012
02:45:27,279 --> 02:45:31,520
that's effective for the factory because

5013
02:45:28,959 --> 02:45:33,679
the factory is designed for humans

5014
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:36,640
but to me the reason you might want to

5015
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:38,639
argue for the humanoid form is because

5016
02:45:36,639 --> 02:45:40,318
you know at a party

5017
02:45:38,639 --> 02:45:43,199
yeah it's a nice way to fit into the

5018
02:45:40,318 --> 02:45:44,959
party the humanoid form has a compelling

5019
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:46,079
notion to it in the same way that cosmo

5020
02:45:44,959 --> 02:45:48,559
is compelling

5021
02:45:46,079 --> 02:45:50,159
i you i would argue if we were

5022
02:45:48,559 --> 02:45:53,760
arguing about this

5023
02:45:50,159 --> 02:45:56,239
that it's cheaper to build a cosmo like

5024
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:58,079
that form but if you wanted to make an

5025
02:45:56,239 --> 02:45:59,439
argument which i have with jim keller

5026
02:45:58,079 --> 02:46:01,439
about you know you could actually make a

5027
02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:02,960
humanoid robot for pretty cheap

5028
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:05,680
it's possible

5029
02:46:02,959 --> 02:46:07,759
and then the question is all right if if

5030
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:09,600
you're using an application where it can

5031
02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:11,920
be flawed

5032
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:14,159
it could it can have a personality and

5033
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:15,520
be flawed in the same way that cosmo is

5034
02:46:14,159 --> 02:46:17,680
that maybe it's interesting for

5035
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:19,200
integration to human society

5036
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:21,279
that's that's to me is an interesting

5037
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:23,120
application of a humanoid form because

5038
02:46:21,279 --> 02:46:25,200
humans are drawn like i mentioned to you

5039
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:27,439
legged robots we're drawn to legs and

5040
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:28,479
limbs and body language and all that

5041
02:46:27,439 --> 02:46:30,398
kind of stuff

5042
02:46:28,478 --> 02:46:31,840
and even a face even if you don't have

5043
02:46:30,398 --> 02:46:33,439
the facial features which you might not

5044
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:35,120
want to have for the

5045
02:46:33,439 --> 02:46:36,880
uh

5046
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:39,120
to reduce the creepiness factor all that

5047
02:46:36,879 --> 02:46:40,879
kind of stuff but yeah that to me the

5048
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:42,319
humanoid form is compelling but in terms

5049
02:46:40,879 --> 02:46:44,318
of

5050
02:46:42,318 --> 02:46:46,799
that being the right form for the

5051
02:46:44,318 --> 02:46:48,398
factory environment i'm not so sure yeah

5052
02:46:46,799 --> 02:46:50,318
for the factory environment like right

5053
02:46:48,398 --> 02:46:52,398
off the bat um what are you optimizing

5054
02:46:50,318 --> 02:46:53,920
for is it strength is it mobility is it

5055
02:46:52,398 --> 02:46:55,119
versatility right like that changes

5056
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:57,840
completely the look and feel of the

5057
02:46:55,120 --> 02:47:00,479
robot that you create you know and uh

5058
02:46:57,840 --> 02:47:02,398
almost certainly the human form is over

5059
02:47:00,478 --> 02:47:03,840
designed for some asp dimensions and

5060
02:47:02,398 --> 02:47:06,398
constrained for some dimensions and so

5061
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:07,760
like like what are you grasping is it

5062
02:47:06,398 --> 02:47:10,079
big is it little right so you would

5063
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:12,719
customize it and make it um

5064
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:14,559
customizable um for the different needs

5065
02:47:12,719 --> 02:47:17,039
if that was the optimization right and

5066
02:47:14,559 --> 02:47:18,639
then you know for the other one uh

5067
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:20,640
i could totally be wrong you know i

5068
02:47:18,639 --> 02:47:23,119
still feel that the closer you try to

5069
02:47:20,639 --> 02:47:25,680
get to a human the more you're subject

5070
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:29,439
to the um biases of what a human should

5071
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:31,439
be and you lose flexibility to shift

5072
02:47:29,439 --> 02:47:32,840
away from your weaknesses uh and towards

5073
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:36,479
your strengths

5074
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:38,159
and that changes over time but there's

5075
02:47:36,478 --> 02:47:39,278
ways to make

5076
02:47:38,159 --> 02:47:40,879
really

5077
02:47:39,279 --> 02:47:44,159
approachable

5078
02:47:40,879 --> 02:47:47,438
and natural interfaces for

5079
02:47:44,159 --> 02:47:49,520
robotic kind of characters and

5080
02:47:47,439 --> 02:47:50,960
you know and uh

5081
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:52,560
you know and kind of deployments in

5082
02:47:50,959 --> 02:47:53,679
these applications

5083
02:47:52,559 --> 02:47:56,239
that

5084
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:57,920
do not at all look like a human directly

5085
02:47:56,239 --> 02:48:00,799
but that actually creates way more

5086
02:47:57,920 --> 02:48:02,318
flexibility and capability and role and

5087
02:48:00,799 --> 02:48:04,799
forgiveness and interface and everything

5088
02:48:02,318 --> 02:48:08,239
else yeah it's interesting but i'm still

5089
02:48:04,799 --> 02:48:10,639
confused by the magic i see in legged

5090
02:48:08,239 --> 02:48:11,600
robots yeah so there is a magic so i i'm

5091
02:48:10,639 --> 02:48:14,879
uh

5092
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:16,880
absolutely amazed at it from a

5093
02:48:14,879 --> 02:48:17,679
technical curiosity standpoint and like

5094
02:48:16,879 --> 02:48:19,358
the

5095
02:48:17,680 --> 02:48:21,600
the magic that like the boston dynamics

5096
02:48:19,359 --> 02:48:24,559
team can do from uh you know like from

5097
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:26,640
walking and jumping and so forth now

5098
02:48:24,559 --> 02:48:28,159
like there's been a long journey to try

5099
02:48:26,639 --> 02:48:30,799
to find an application for that sort of

5100
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:32,719
um technology but wow that's incredible

5101
02:48:30,799 --> 02:48:34,239
technology right yes so

5102
02:48:32,719 --> 02:48:36,398
then you kind of go towards okay are you

5103
02:48:34,239 --> 02:48:37,520
working back from a goal of what you're

5104
02:48:36,398 --> 02:48:38,719
trying to solve or are you working

5105
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:39,920
forward from a technology and then

5106
02:48:38,719 --> 02:48:42,079
looking for a solution and i think

5107
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:44,000
that's where um it's a kind of a

5108
02:48:42,079 --> 02:48:45,760
bi-directional search oftentimes but you

5109
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,799
gotta you the two have to meet and that

5110
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:49,120
that's where

5111
02:48:46,799 --> 02:48:51,278
humanoid robots is kind of close to that

5112
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:52,880
and that like it is a decision about a

5113
02:48:51,279 --> 02:48:55,520
form factor and a

5114
02:48:52,879 --> 02:48:56,398
technology that it forces um

5115
02:48:55,520 --> 02:48:57,760
that

5116
02:48:56,398 --> 02:48:59,358
doesn't have a clear justification on

5117
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:00,880
why that's the killer app or you know

5118
02:48:59,359 --> 02:49:03,120
from the other end but i think the core

5119
02:49:00,879 --> 02:49:05,679
fascinating idea with the tesla bot is

5120
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:07,040
the one that's carried by waymo as well

5121
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:08,720
is when you're solving the general

5122
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:11,359
robotics problem

5123
02:49:08,719 --> 02:49:13,920
of perception control where this there's

5124
02:49:11,359 --> 02:49:14,960
the very clear applications of driving

5125
02:49:13,920 --> 02:49:16,879
it's

5126
02:49:14,959 --> 02:49:19,759
as you get better and better at it when

5127
02:49:16,879 --> 02:49:21,920
you have like way more driver yeah

5128
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:23,840
the whole world starts to kind of start

5129
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:25,760
to look like a robotics problem so it's

5130
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:27,040
very interesting for now detection

5131
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:29,120
classification

5132
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:31,120
segmentation tracking

5133
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:33,760
planning like it's carrie yeah so

5134
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:36,079
there's no reason i mean i'm not i'm not

5135
02:49:33,760 --> 02:49:36,960
speaking for way more here but

5136
02:49:36,079 --> 02:49:38,159
you know

5137
02:49:36,959 --> 02:49:39,438
um

5138
02:49:38,159 --> 02:49:40,879
moving goods

5139
02:49:39,439 --> 02:49:43,439
there's no reason

5140
02:49:40,879 --> 02:49:46,398
transformer like this thing couldn't you

5141
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:50,079
know uh take the goods up an elevator

5142
02:49:46,398 --> 02:49:53,358
you know yeah like that like uh slowly

5143
02:49:50,079 --> 02:49:54,639
expand yeah what it means to move goods

5144
02:49:53,359 --> 02:49:57,359
and

5145
02:49:54,639 --> 02:49:59,278
expand more and more of the world uh

5146
02:49:57,359 --> 02:50:01,279
into a robotics problem well that's

5147
02:49:59,279 --> 02:50:03,279
right and you start to like think of it

5148
02:50:01,279 --> 02:50:04,880
as an end robotics problem from like

5149
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:07,760
loading from you know from everything

5150
02:50:04,879 --> 02:50:09,599
yes and even like the truck itself um

5151
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:11,200
you know today's generation is

5152
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:12,640
integrating into

5153
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:15,840
today's understanding of what a vehicle

5154
02:50:12,639 --> 02:50:17,760
is right the pacifica jaguar uh the

5155
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:20,960
freightliners from daimler there's

5156
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:23,040
nothing that stops these us from like

5157
02:50:20,959 --> 02:50:24,719
down the road after like starting to get

5158
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:26,080
to scale to like

5159
02:50:24,719 --> 02:50:28,398
expand these partnerships to really

5160
02:50:26,079 --> 02:50:30,879
rethink what would the next generation

5161
02:50:28,398 --> 02:50:33,119
of a truck look like um that is actually

5162
02:50:30,879 --> 02:50:34,000
optimized for autonomy not for today's

5163
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:34,840
world

5164
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,879
um

5165
02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:38,478
and maybe that means a very different

5166
02:50:36,879 --> 02:50:39,920
type of trailer maybe that like there's

5167
02:50:38,478 --> 02:50:41,760
a lot of things you could rethink on

5168
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:42,639
that front which is on its own very very

5169
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:44,719
exciting

5170
02:50:42,639 --> 02:50:47,358
let me ask you like i said you went to

5171
02:50:44,719 --> 02:50:49,599
the mecca of robotics which is cmu

5172
02:50:47,359 --> 02:50:50,720
carnegie mellon university you got a phd

5173
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:53,359
there

5174
02:50:50,719 --> 02:50:56,079
so maybe by way of advice

5175
02:50:53,359 --> 02:50:58,640
and maybe by way of

5176
02:50:56,079 --> 02:51:00,318
story and memories what does it take to

5177
02:50:58,639 --> 02:51:03,599
get a phd

5178
02:51:00,318 --> 02:51:05,278
in robotics at cmu

5179
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:07,279
and maybe

5180
02:51:05,279 --> 02:51:09,920
you can throw in there some advice for

5181
02:51:07,279 --> 02:51:11,600
people who are thinking about

5182
02:51:09,920 --> 02:51:13,120
doing work in artificial intelligence

5183
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:15,279
and robotics and are thinking about

5184
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:17,520
whether to get a phd it's like i

5185
02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:18,640
actually went i was a cmu for undergrad

5186
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:21,439
as well and didn't know anything about

5187
02:51:18,639 --> 02:51:22,639
robotics coming in and was doing you

5188
02:51:21,439 --> 02:51:24,318
know electrical computer engineering

5189
02:51:22,639 --> 02:51:26,639
computer science and really got more and

5190
02:51:24,318 --> 02:51:28,239
more into kind of ai and then fell in

5191
02:51:26,639 --> 02:51:30,318
love with autonomous driving and at that

5192
02:51:28,239 --> 02:51:33,439
point like that was just by a big margin

5193
02:51:30,318 --> 02:51:34,318
like such a incredible like central spot

5194
02:51:33,439 --> 02:51:36,559
of

5195
02:51:34,318 --> 02:51:37,519
develop of investment in that area and

5196
02:51:36,559 --> 02:51:39,119
so what i would say is that like

5197
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:40,319
robotics like for

5198
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:42,000
all the progress that's happened is

5199
02:51:40,318 --> 02:51:43,359
still a really young field there's a

5200
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:45,359
huge amount of opportunity now that

5201
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:47,439
opportunity shifted where something like

5202
02:51:45,359 --> 02:51:50,079
autonomous driving has moved from being

5203
02:51:47,439 --> 02:51:51,359
very research and academics driven to

5204
02:51:50,079 --> 02:51:53,120
being commercial driven where you see

5205
02:51:51,359 --> 02:51:54,399
the investments happening

5206
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:55,920
in commercial now there's other areas

5207
02:51:54,398 --> 02:51:58,079
that are much younger

5208
02:51:55,920 --> 02:52:00,000
and you see like kind of grasping and

5209
02:51:58,079 --> 02:52:01,840
manipulation making kind of the same

5210
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:03,840
sort of journey that like autonomy made

5211
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:05,920
and there's other areas as well what i

5212
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:08,880
would say is the space moves very

5213
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:11,040
quickly anything you do a phd in like it

5214
02:52:08,879 --> 02:52:12,799
is in most areas will evolve and change

5215
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:14,240
as technology changes and constraints

5216
02:52:12,799 --> 02:52:15,519
change and hardware changes and the

5217
02:52:14,239 --> 02:52:16,799
world changes

5218
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:18,319
um and so

5219
02:52:16,799 --> 02:52:20,398
the beautiful thing about robotics is

5220
02:52:18,318 --> 02:52:22,159
it's super broad it's not a narrow space

5221
02:52:20,398 --> 02:52:23,920
at all and it can be a million different

5222
02:52:22,159 --> 02:52:24,959
things in a million different industries

5223
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:27,359
and so

5224
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:30,000
uh it's a great opportunity to come in

5225
02:52:27,359 --> 02:52:32,079
and get a broad foundation on ai machine

5226
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:33,920
learning computer vision systems

5227
02:52:32,079 --> 02:52:34,799
hardware sensors all these separate

5228
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:37,040
things

5229
02:52:34,799 --> 02:52:38,959
you do need to like go deep and find

5230
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:40,080
something that you're like really really

5231
02:52:38,959 --> 02:52:42,318
passionate

5232
02:52:40,079 --> 02:52:43,680
about obviously like just like any phd

5233
02:52:42,318 --> 02:52:47,039
this is like a

5234
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:48,720
five six year kind of uh endeavor

5235
02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:51,600
and you have to

5236
02:52:48,719 --> 02:52:53,358
love it enough to go super deep to learn

5237
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:54,640
all the things necessary to be super

5238
02:52:53,359 --> 02:52:56,239
deeply functioning in that area and then

5239
02:52:54,639 --> 02:52:58,079
contribute to it in a way that hasn't

5240
02:52:56,239 --> 02:53:01,279
been done before and in robotics that

5241
02:52:58,079 --> 02:53:03,359
probably means um more breadth because

5242
02:53:01,279 --> 02:53:05,600
robotics is rarely kind of like one

5243
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:07,279
particular kind of narrow technology

5244
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:09,040
and it means being able to collaborate

5245
02:53:07,279 --> 02:53:10,479
with teams where like one of the coolest

5246
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:12,720
aspects of like

5247
02:53:10,478 --> 02:53:14,079
my the exp the experience that i kind of

5248
02:53:12,719 --> 02:53:17,519
cherish in our phd is that we actually

5249
02:53:14,079 --> 02:53:19,520
had a pretty large av project that for

5250
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:21,840
that time was like a pretty serious

5251
02:53:19,520 --> 02:53:23,840
initiative where you got to like partner

5252
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:25,520
with a larger team and you had the

5253
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:26,559
experts in perception and the experts in

5254
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:29,359
planning and the staff and the

5255
02:53:26,559 --> 02:53:32,478
mechanical challenge um so i was working

5256
02:53:29,359 --> 02:53:34,079
on the a project called upi back then uh

5257
02:53:32,478 --> 02:53:35,438
which was basically the off-road version

5258
02:53:34,079 --> 02:53:37,039
of the darpa challenge it was a darpa

5259
02:53:35,439 --> 02:53:38,720
funded project for

5260
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:39,840
basically like a large off-road vehicle

5261
02:53:38,719 --> 02:53:41,599
that you would like

5262
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:42,799
drop and then give it a waypoint 10

5263
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:44,239
kilometers away and it would have to

5264
02:53:42,799 --> 02:53:46,719
navigate a complete structure in an

5265
02:53:44,239 --> 02:53:49,039
office environment yeah so like forest

5266
02:53:46,719 --> 02:53:50,239
ditches rocks vegetation and so it was

5267
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:51,840
like a really really interesting kind of

5268
02:53:50,239 --> 02:53:53,520
a hard problem where like wheels would

5269
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:55,359
be up to my shoulders it's like gigantic

5270
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:56,800
right yeah by the way av for people

5271
02:53:55,359 --> 02:53:59,920
stands for autonomous vehicles house

5272
02:53:56,799 --> 02:54:01,599
vehicles yeah sorry um and so what i

5273
02:53:59,920 --> 02:54:03,040
think is like the beauty of robotics but

5274
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:04,559
also kind of like the expectation is

5275
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:06,479
that um

5276
02:54:04,559 --> 02:54:08,000
there's um spaces in computer science

5277
02:54:06,478 --> 02:54:08,959
where you can be very very narrow and

5278
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:11,279
deep

5279
02:54:08,959 --> 02:54:12,879
robotics one of the the necessity but

5280
02:54:11,279 --> 02:54:15,439
also the beauty of it is that it forces

5281
02:54:12,879 --> 02:54:16,719
you to be excited about that breadth and

5282
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:18,880
that partnership across different

5283
02:54:16,719 --> 02:54:21,039
disciplines that enable it but that also

5284
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:22,959
opens up so many more doors where you

5285
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:25,439
can go and you can do robotics and

5286
02:54:22,959 --> 02:54:28,239
almost any category where robotics isn't

5287
02:54:25,439 --> 02:54:29,439
a in isn't really an industry it's like

5288
02:54:28,239 --> 02:54:32,639
it's like ai right it's like the

5289
02:54:29,439 --> 02:54:33,920
application of physical automation to uh

5290
02:54:32,639 --> 02:54:36,478
you know to all these other worlds and

5291
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:38,478
so you can do robotic surgery you can do

5292
02:54:36,478 --> 02:54:40,719
vehicles you can do factory automation

5293
02:54:38,478 --> 02:54:41,760
you can do healthcare or you can do like

5294
02:54:40,719 --> 02:54:44,799
uh

5295
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:46,719
leverage the ai around the sensing to

5296
02:54:44,799 --> 02:54:49,679
think about static sensors and scene

5297
02:54:46,719 --> 02:54:50,959
understanding so um so i think that's

5298
02:54:49,680 --> 02:54:52,639
got to be the expectation and the

5299
02:54:50,959 --> 02:54:53,759
excitement and it

5300
02:54:52,639 --> 02:54:55,920
breeds people they're probably a little

5301
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:57,120
bit more collaborative and more excited

5302
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:59,439
about um

5303
02:54:57,120 --> 02:55:00,800
working in teams uh if i could briefly

5304
02:54:59,439 --> 02:55:03,040
comment

5305
02:55:00,799 --> 02:55:05,199
on the fact that the robotics people

5306
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:08,000
i've met in my life

5307
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:10,720
from cmu and mit

5308
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:12,879
they're really happy people yeah because

5309
02:55:10,719 --> 02:55:16,079
i think it's the collaborative thing

5310
02:55:12,879 --> 02:55:18,079
yeah i think i think you don't

5311
02:55:16,079 --> 02:55:20,879
you're not like a sitting in like the

5312
02:55:18,079 --> 02:55:22,318
fourth basement uh exactly

5313
02:55:20,879 --> 02:55:24,719
which when you're doing machine learning

5314
02:55:22,318 --> 02:55:27,600
purely software it's very tempting to

5315
02:55:24,719 --> 02:55:30,719
just disappear into your own hole yeah

5316
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:31,760
and never collaborate and and there that

5317
02:55:30,719 --> 02:55:34,000
breeds

5318
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:34,960
a little bit more of the silo mentality

5319
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,799
of like

5320
02:55:34,959 --> 02:55:38,318
i have a problem it's almost like

5321
02:55:36,799 --> 02:55:40,478
negative to talk to somebody else or

5322
02:55:38,318 --> 02:55:42,719
something like that but robotics folks

5323
02:55:40,478 --> 02:55:44,879
are just very collaborative very

5324
02:55:42,719 --> 02:55:47,519
friendly just and there's also an energy

5325
02:55:44,879 --> 02:55:50,719
of like you get to confront the physics

5326
02:55:47,520 --> 02:55:52,000
of reality often which is

5327
02:55:50,719 --> 02:55:54,239
humbling

5328
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:56,719
and also exciting so it's humbling when

5329
02:55:54,239 --> 02:55:57,920
it it fails and exciting when it finally

5330
02:55:56,719 --> 02:56:00,639
it's like the purity of the passion you

5331
02:55:57,920 --> 02:56:03,200
got to remember that like right now like

5332
02:56:00,639 --> 02:56:05,039
robotics and ais like just all the rage

5333
02:56:03,200 --> 02:56:08,399
and autonomous vehicles and all this

5334
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:09,359
like 15 years ago and 20 years ago

5335
02:56:08,398 --> 02:56:11,599
like

5336
02:56:09,359 --> 02:56:13,040
it wasn't that deeply lucrative people

5337
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:14,479
went into robotics they did it because

5338
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:16,000
they were like thought it was just the

5339
02:56:14,478 --> 02:56:18,079
coolest thing in the world to like make

5340
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:20,239
physical things intelligent in the real

5341
02:56:18,079 --> 02:56:21,520
world and so there's like a raw passion

5342
02:56:20,239 --> 02:56:23,119
where they went into it for the right

5343
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:25,040
reasons and so forth and so it's really

5344
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:26,720
great space and that organizational

5345
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:28,800
challenge by the way like um when you

5346
02:56:26,719 --> 02:56:30,719
think about the challenges in av we talk

5347
02:56:28,799 --> 02:56:32,559
a lot about the technical challenges the

5348
02:56:30,719 --> 02:56:34,000
organizational challenge is through the

5349
02:56:32,559 --> 02:56:36,159
roof where

5350
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:39,760
um you think about the challenge the

5351
02:56:36,159 --> 02:56:40,799
what it takes to build an av system and

5352
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:42,159
you have companies that are now

5353
02:56:40,799 --> 02:56:44,478
thousands of people

5354
02:56:42,159 --> 02:56:45,760
and um you know you look at other really

5355
02:56:44,478 --> 02:56:47,519
hard technical problems like an

5356
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:50,239
operating system it's pretty well

5357
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:51,920
established like you kind of know that

5358
02:56:50,239 --> 02:56:53,600
there's a file system there's virtual

5359
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:55,439
memory there's this there's that there's

5360
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:57,120
like

5361
02:56:55,439 --> 02:56:58,559
caching and like and there's like a

5362
02:56:57,120 --> 02:57:00,479
really reasonably well established

5363
02:56:58,559 --> 02:57:02,079
modularity and apis and so forth and so

5364
02:57:00,478 --> 02:57:04,719
you can kind of like scale it in an

5365
02:57:02,079 --> 02:57:06,559
efficient fashion that doesn't exist

5366
02:57:04,719 --> 02:57:08,559
anywhere near to that level of maturity

5367
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:10,879
in autonomous driving right now

5368
02:57:08,559 --> 02:57:12,000
and tech stacks are being reinvented

5369
02:57:10,879 --> 02:57:13,519
organizational structures are being

5370
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:15,120
reinvented you have problems like

5371
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:17,200
pedestrians that are not isolated

5372
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:19,040
problems they're part sensing part

5373
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:21,279
behavior prediction part planning part

5374
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:22,880
evaluation and

5375
02:57:21,279 --> 02:57:24,560
like one of the biggest challenges is

5376
02:57:22,879 --> 02:57:26,879
actually how do you solve these problems

5377
02:57:24,559 --> 02:57:28,799
where the mental capacity of a human is

5378
02:57:26,879 --> 02:57:31,920
starting to get strained on how do you

5379
02:57:28,799 --> 02:57:33,599
organize it and think about it where

5380
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:35,760
you know you have this like

5381
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:38,159
multi-dimensional matrix that needs to

5382
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:39,680
all work together and so

5383
02:57:38,159 --> 02:57:42,639
that makes it kind of cool as well

5384
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:44,398
because it's not like solved at all uh

5385
02:57:42,639 --> 02:57:45,439
from you know like what what is what

5386
02:57:44,398 --> 02:57:46,959
does it take to actually scale this

5387
02:57:45,439 --> 02:57:49,439
right and then you look at like other

5388
02:57:46,959 --> 02:57:50,879
gigantic challenges that have you know

5389
02:57:49,439 --> 02:57:52,239
that have been success successful and

5390
02:57:50,879 --> 02:57:54,239
are way more mature

5391
02:57:52,239 --> 02:57:56,079
there's a stability to it and like maybe

5392
02:57:54,239 --> 02:57:58,959
the autonomous vehicle space will get

5393
02:57:56,079 --> 02:58:00,318
there but right now just as many uh

5394
02:57:58,959 --> 02:58:01,519
technical challenges as they are they're

5395
02:58:00,318 --> 02:58:03,199
like organizational challenges and how

5396
02:58:01,520 --> 02:58:05,439
do you like solve these problems that

5397
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:07,520
touch on so many different areas and

5398
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:08,639
efficiently tackle them

5399
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:10,640
while

5400
02:58:08,639 --> 02:58:13,519
like maintaining progress among all

5401
02:58:10,639 --> 02:58:15,358
these constraints um while scaling

5402
02:58:13,520 --> 02:58:18,720
by way of advice

5403
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:21,359
what advice would you give to uh

5404
02:58:18,719 --> 02:58:23,760
somebody thinking about doing a robotics

5405
02:58:21,359 --> 02:58:25,680
startup you mentioned cosmo somebody

5406
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:28,880
that wanted to carry the cosmo flag

5407
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:32,000
forward the anki flag forward

5408
02:58:28,879 --> 02:58:33,599
looking back at your experience

5409
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:36,159
looking forward to the future that will

5410
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:38,079
obviously have such robots what advice

5411
02:58:36,159 --> 02:58:39,439
would you give to that person yeah it

5412
02:58:38,079 --> 02:58:40,879
was the greatest experience ever and

5413
02:58:39,439 --> 02:58:42,159
it's like there's something you there's

5414
02:58:40,879 --> 02:58:44,719
things you learn

5415
02:58:42,159 --> 02:58:46,239
navigating a startup that you'll never

5416
02:58:44,719 --> 02:58:47,920
like you you it was very hard to

5417
02:58:46,239 --> 02:58:49,600
encounter that in like a typical kind of

5418
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:51,040
work environment and um

5419
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:52,800
and it's just it's wonderful you got to

5420
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:54,399
be ready for it it's not as good like

5421
02:58:52,799 --> 02:58:56,239
you know the the glamour of a startup

5422
02:58:54,398 --> 02:58:58,639
there's just like just brutal emotional

5423
02:58:56,239 --> 02:59:00,478
swings up and down and so um having

5424
02:58:58,639 --> 02:59:02,239
co-founders actually helps a ton like i

5425
02:59:00,478 --> 02:59:04,959
would not cannot imagine doing it solo

5426
02:59:02,239 --> 02:59:06,559
but having at least somebody where on

5427
02:59:04,959 --> 02:59:08,398
your darkest days you can kind of like

5428
02:59:06,559 --> 02:59:10,239
really openly just like have that

5429
02:59:08,398 --> 02:59:12,318
conversation and you know lean on to

5430
02:59:10,239 --> 02:59:14,959
somebody that's that's in the thick of

5431
02:59:12,318 --> 02:59:17,519
it with you helps a lot what i would say

5432
02:59:14,959 --> 02:59:20,239
what was the nature of darkest days and

5433
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:22,560
the emotional swings is it worried about

5434
02:59:20,239 --> 02:59:24,159
the funding is it worried about whether

5435
02:59:22,559 --> 02:59:26,239
any of your ideas

5436
02:59:24,159 --> 02:59:29,359
are any good or ever were good is it

5437
02:59:26,239 --> 02:59:31,279
like the self-doubt uh is it like

5438
02:59:29,359 --> 02:59:33,520
facing new challenges that have nothing

5439
02:59:31,279 --> 02:59:35,760
to do with the technology like

5440
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:37,760
organizational human resources that kind

5441
02:59:35,760 --> 02:59:39,600
of stuff what yeah you come from a world

5442
02:59:37,760 --> 02:59:41,760
in school where

5443
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:43,279
you feel that uh you put in a lot of

5444
02:59:41,760 --> 02:59:45,920
effort and you'll get the right result

5445
02:59:43,279 --> 02:59:47,120
and input translates proportional to

5446
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:49,040
output and

5447
02:59:47,120 --> 02:59:50,560
you know you need to solve the set or do

5448
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:52,240
whatever and just kind of get it done

5449
02:59:50,559 --> 02:59:53,840
now phd tests out a little bit but at

5450
02:59:52,239 --> 02:59:55,199
the end of the day you put in the effort

5451
02:59:53,840 --> 02:59:57,600
you tend to like kind of come out with

5452
02:59:55,200 --> 02:59:59,040
your enough results to you kind of get a

5453
02:59:57,600 --> 03:00:01,520
phd

5454
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:03,200
in the startup space like

5455
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:04,479
you know like you could talk to 50

5456
03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:05,680
investors and they just don't see your

5457
03:00:04,478 --> 03:00:07,519
vision and it doesn't matter how hard

5458
03:00:05,680 --> 03:00:09,439
you kind of tried and pitched you could

5459
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:11,040
uh work incredibly hard and you have a

5460
03:00:09,439 --> 03:00:12,559
manufacturing defect and if you don't

5461
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:15,359
fix it you're gonna you're out of

5462
03:00:12,559 --> 03:00:17,359
business um you need to raise money by a

5463
03:00:15,359 --> 03:00:19,120
certain date and there's a you got to

5464
03:00:17,359 --> 03:00:21,120
have this milestone in order to like

5465
03:00:19,120 --> 03:00:22,319
have a good pitch and you do it you have

5466
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:24,960
to have this talent and you just don't

5467
03:00:22,318 --> 03:00:28,478
have it inside the company or um

5468
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:30,239
you know you have to get 200 people or

5469
03:00:28,478 --> 03:00:32,239
however many people kind of like along

5470
03:00:30,239 --> 03:00:34,318
with you and kind of buy in the journey

5471
03:00:32,239 --> 03:00:36,000
um you're like disagreeing with an

5472
03:00:34,318 --> 03:00:37,119
investor and they're your investors so

5473
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:39,439
it's just like you know it's like you

5474
03:00:37,120 --> 03:00:41,279
there's no walking away from it right so

5475
03:00:39,439 --> 03:00:43,680
um and it tends to be like those things

5476
03:00:41,279 --> 03:00:45,439
where you just kind of get clobbered in

5477
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:47,439
so many different ways that like things

5478
03:00:45,439 --> 03:00:49,439
end up being harder than you expect and

5479
03:00:47,439 --> 03:00:51,520
it's like such a gauntlet

5480
03:00:49,439 --> 03:00:52,479
but you learn so much in the process and

5481
03:00:51,520 --> 03:00:53,920
there's a lot of people that actually

5482
03:00:52,478 --> 03:00:56,079
end up rooting for you and helping you

5483
03:00:53,920 --> 03:00:57,920
like from the outside and you get good

5484
03:00:56,079 --> 03:00:59,840
great mentors and you like get find

5485
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:01,920
fantastic people that step up in the

5486
03:00:59,840 --> 03:01:04,719
company and you have this like magical

5487
03:01:01,920 --> 03:01:06,159
period where everybody's like

5488
03:01:04,719 --> 03:01:07,438
it's life or death for the company but

5489
03:01:06,159 --> 03:01:09,039
like you're all fighting for the same

5490
03:01:07,439 --> 03:01:11,359
thing and it's the most satisfying kind

5491
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:13,439
of journey ever um the things that make

5492
03:01:11,359 --> 03:01:14,880
it easier and that i would recommend is

5493
03:01:13,439 --> 03:01:15,760
like be really really thoughtful about

5494
03:01:14,879 --> 03:01:17,920
the

5495
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:20,239
the application like there's a there's a

5496
03:01:17,920 --> 03:01:22,159
saying of like kind of you know team and

5497
03:01:20,239 --> 03:01:24,959
execution and market and like kind of

5498
03:01:22,159 --> 03:01:27,200
how important are each of those um and

5499
03:01:24,959 --> 03:01:28,639
oftentimes the market wins and you come

5500
03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:29,840
at it thinking that if you're smart

5501
03:01:28,639 --> 03:01:31,840
enough and you work hard enough and

5502
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:33,520
you're like have the right talented team

5503
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:35,920
and so forth like you'll always kind of

5504
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:37,920
find a way through and um it's

5505
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:39,520
surprising how much dynamics are driven

5506
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:42,398
by the industry you're in and the timing

5507
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:44,479
of you entering that industry um and so

5508
03:01:42,398 --> 03:01:45,519
just uh waymo is a great example of it

5509
03:01:44,478 --> 03:01:46,719
there is

5510
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:50,159
i don't know if there'll ever be another

5511
03:01:46,719 --> 03:01:52,959
company or suite of companies that

5512
03:01:50,159 --> 03:01:56,799
has raised and continues to spend so

5513
03:01:52,959 --> 03:01:58,959
much money at such an early uh phase of

5514
03:01:56,799 --> 03:02:02,000
revenue generation and product and

5515
03:01:58,959 --> 03:02:05,358
productization um the you know from a p

5516
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:07,200
l standpoint uh like it's it's a

5517
03:02:05,359 --> 03:02:09,279
anomaly like by any measure of any

5518
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:11,520
industry that's ever existed um except

5519
03:02:09,279 --> 03:02:14,000
for maybe the u.s space program uh like

5520
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:15,520
right uh like but

5521
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:17,359
it's like uh

5522
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:19,359
multiple trillion dollar opportunities

5523
03:02:17,359 --> 03:02:21,040
which is so unusual to find that size of

5524
03:02:19,359 --> 03:02:22,960
a market that

5525
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:24,560
just the progress that shows the

5526
03:02:22,959 --> 03:02:26,000
de-risking of it you could apply

5527
03:02:24,559 --> 03:02:27,119
whatever discounts you want off of that

5528
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,719
trillion-dollar market and it still

5529
03:02:27,120 --> 03:02:30,720
justifies the investment that is

5530
03:02:28,719 --> 03:02:32,719
happening because like being successful

5531
03:02:30,719 --> 03:02:35,119
in that space makes all the investments

5532
03:02:32,719 --> 03:02:36,000
feel trivial now by the same consequence

5533
03:02:35,120 --> 03:02:37,359
like

5534
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:39,520
the size of the market the size of the

5535
03:02:37,359 --> 03:02:41,359
target audience the ability to capture

5536
03:02:39,520 --> 03:02:43,279
that market share how hard that's going

5537
03:02:41,359 --> 03:02:44,800
to be who the incumbent's like that's

5538
03:02:43,279 --> 03:02:46,319
probably one of the lessons i appreciate

5539
03:02:44,799 --> 03:02:48,559
like more than anything else where like

5540
03:02:46,318 --> 03:02:51,600
those things really really do matter

5541
03:02:48,559 --> 03:02:53,680
and um oftentimes can dominate the

5542
03:02:51,600 --> 03:02:54,640
quality of the team or execution because

5543
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:56,079
if you

5544
03:02:54,639 --> 03:02:57,519
miss the timing or you do it in the

5545
03:02:56,079 --> 03:03:00,000
wrong space you run into like the

5546
03:02:57,520 --> 03:03:01,600
institutional kind of headwinds of a

5547
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,639
particular environment like let's say

5548
03:03:01,600 --> 03:03:04,079
you have the greatest idea in the world

5549
03:03:02,639 --> 03:03:05,680
but you barrel into healthcare but it

5550
03:03:04,079 --> 03:03:07,200
takes 10 years to innovate in healthcare

5551
03:03:05,680 --> 03:03:09,279
because of a lot of challenges right

5552
03:03:07,200 --> 03:03:11,120
like there's fundamental

5553
03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:14,000
uh laws of physics that you have to

5554
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:15,920
think about and so um the combination of

5555
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:18,239
like anki waymo kind of drives that

5556
03:03:15,920 --> 03:03:19,920
point home for me where you can do a ton

5557
03:03:18,239 --> 03:03:22,159
if you have the right market the right

5558
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:23,760
opportunity the right way to explain it

5559
03:03:22,159 --> 03:03:25,520
and you show the progress in the right

5560
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:27,600
sequence

5561
03:03:25,520 --> 03:03:29,439
it actually can really significantly

5562
03:03:27,600 --> 03:03:30,960
change the course of your

5563
03:03:29,439 --> 03:03:32,559
journey and startup how much of it is

5564
03:03:30,959 --> 03:03:35,358
understanding the market and how much of

5565
03:03:32,559 --> 03:03:37,039
it's creating a new market so how do you

5566
03:03:35,359 --> 03:03:38,479
think about

5567
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:41,120
like space robotics is really

5568
03:03:38,478 --> 03:03:43,358
interesting you said exactly right the

5569
03:03:41,120 --> 03:03:45,040
space of applications is small

5570
03:03:43,359 --> 03:03:47,359
yeah

5571
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:50,479
you know relative to the cost involved

5572
03:03:47,359 --> 03:03:51,760
so how much is like truly revolutionary

5573
03:03:50,478 --> 03:03:54,799
thinking

5574
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:56,239
about like what is the application

5575
03:03:54,799 --> 03:03:59,278
and then

5576
03:03:56,239 --> 03:04:01,600
yeah but so creating something that

5577
03:03:59,279 --> 03:04:03,200
didn't exist it didn't really exist like

5578
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:05,680
this is pretty obvious to me the whole

5579
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:07,439
space of home robotics just every

5580
03:04:05,680 --> 03:04:09,359
everything that cosmo did i guess you

5581
03:04:07,439 --> 03:04:11,279
could talk to it as a toy and people

5582
03:04:09,359 --> 03:04:13,200
will understand it picazo is much more

5583
03:04:11,279 --> 03:04:14,399
than a toy yeah

5584
03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:16,479
and

5585
03:04:14,398 --> 03:04:19,119
i don't think people fully understand

5586
03:04:16,478 --> 03:04:20,879
the value of that you have to create it

5587
03:04:19,120 --> 03:04:22,800
and the product will communicate it like

5588
03:04:20,879 --> 03:04:24,879
just like the iphone

5589
03:04:22,799 --> 03:04:28,959
nobody understood the value

5590
03:04:24,879 --> 03:04:31,278
of of no keyboard and a thing that's

5591
03:04:28,959 --> 03:04:32,879
that can do web browsing i don't think

5592
03:04:31,279 --> 03:04:34,079
they understand the value of that until

5593
03:04:32,879 --> 03:04:36,079
you create it

5594
03:04:34,079 --> 03:04:37,520
yeah having a foot and a door in an

5595
03:04:36,079 --> 03:04:39,840
entry point still helps because at the

5596
03:04:37,520 --> 03:04:41,120
end of the day like an iphone replaced

5597
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:42,639
your phone and so it had a fundamental

5598
03:04:41,120 --> 03:04:44,560
purpose and all these things that it did

5599
03:04:42,639 --> 03:04:47,278
better right sure and so then you could

5600
03:04:44,559 --> 03:04:48,639
do abc on top of it and uh and then like

5601
03:04:47,279 --> 03:04:50,640
you even remember the early commercials

5602
03:04:48,639 --> 03:04:51,840
where it's always like one application

5603
03:04:50,639 --> 03:04:54,159
of what he could do and then you get a

5604
03:04:51,840 --> 03:04:55,200
phone call right and so that was

5605
03:04:54,159 --> 03:04:56,959
intentionally sending a message

5606
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:58,159
something familiar but then like yes you

5607
03:04:56,959 --> 03:05:00,000
can send a text message you can listen

5608
03:04:58,159 --> 03:05:00,799
to music you can surf the web right and

5609
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,559
so

5610
03:05:00,799 --> 03:05:04,079
you know autonomous driving obviously

5611
03:05:02,559 --> 03:05:06,000
anchors on that as well you don't have

5612
03:05:04,079 --> 03:05:07,279
to explain to somebody the functionality

5613
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,398
of an autonomous truck right like

5614
03:05:07,279 --> 03:05:10,800
there's nuances around it but the

5615
03:05:08,398 --> 03:05:12,000
functionality makes sense um

5616
03:05:10,799 --> 03:05:13,759
in the home

5617
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:15,120
you have a fundamental advantage like we

5618
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:16,960
always thought about this because it was

5619
03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:18,319
so painful to explain to people what our

5620
03:05:16,959 --> 03:05:20,398
products did and how like how to

5621
03:05:18,318 --> 03:05:21,439
communicate that super cleanly

5622
03:05:20,398 --> 03:05:24,959
especially when something was so

5623
03:05:21,439 --> 03:05:27,040
experiential and so you compare like

5624
03:05:24,959 --> 03:05:29,039
anki to nest

5625
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:31,680
nest um

5626
03:05:29,040 --> 03:05:33,120
had some beautiful products

5627
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:34,800
where they

5628
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:36,479
started scaling and like actually find

5629
03:05:34,799 --> 03:05:37,840
like really great success and they had

5630
03:05:36,478 --> 03:05:39,920
like really clean and beautiful

5631
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:41,439
marketing messaging because they

5632
03:05:39,920 --> 03:05:42,960
anchored on reinventing existing

5633
03:05:41,439 --> 03:05:46,000
categories where it was a smart

5634
03:05:42,959 --> 03:05:48,239
thermostat right and uh like and so you

5635
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:50,559
you kind of are able to

5636
03:05:48,239 --> 03:05:52,159
um take what's familiar anchor that

5637
03:05:50,559 --> 03:05:54,000
understanding and then explain what's

5638
03:05:52,159 --> 03:05:55,760
what's better about it that's funny

5639
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:57,840
you're right cosmo is like totally new

5640
03:05:55,760 --> 03:06:00,079
thing like what what is this thing

5641
03:05:57,840 --> 03:06:01,840
because we struggle we spent like a lot

5642
03:06:00,079 --> 03:06:03,600
of money on marketing we had a heart

5643
03:06:01,840 --> 03:06:05,840
like we fought we actually had far

5644
03:06:03,600 --> 03:06:07,279
greater efficiency on cosmo than um

5645
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:08,719
anything else because we found a way to

5646
03:06:07,279 --> 03:06:10,239
capture the emotion in some little

5647
03:06:08,719 --> 03:06:12,239
shorts to kind of lean into the

5648
03:06:10,239 --> 03:06:14,478
personality in our marketing and it

5649
03:06:12,239 --> 03:06:16,079
became viral where like we had these

5650
03:06:14,478 --> 03:06:17,599
kind of videos that would like go and

5651
03:06:16,079 --> 03:06:19,439
get like hundreds of thousands of views

5652
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:21,600
and like kind of like get spread and

5653
03:06:19,439 --> 03:06:23,920
sometimes millions of views and so um

5654
03:06:21,600 --> 03:06:26,239
but it was like really really hard um

5655
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:27,840
and so finding a way to kind of like

5656
03:06:26,239 --> 03:06:30,239
anchor on something that's familiar but

5657
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:32,398
then grow into something that's not um

5658
03:06:30,239 --> 03:06:33,760
is an advantage but then again like you

5659
03:06:32,398 --> 03:06:36,000
don't have like there's successes

5660
03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:37,120
otherwise like alexa never had a comp

5661
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:39,040
right uh

5662
03:06:37,120 --> 03:06:40,960
you could argue that that's very novel

5663
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:42,240
and very new and um

5664
03:06:40,959 --> 03:06:43,679
and there's a lot of other examples that

5665
03:06:42,239 --> 03:06:45,920
kind of created a

5666
03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:48,318
kind of a category out of like kiva

5667
03:06:45,920 --> 03:06:49,359
systems i mean they like came in and

5668
03:06:48,318 --> 03:06:51,039
they like

5669
03:06:49,359 --> 03:06:53,600
uh enterprise is a little easier because

5670
03:06:51,040 --> 03:06:55,600
if you can uh it's less susceptible to

5671
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:57,840
this because if you can argue a clear

5672
03:06:55,600 --> 03:06:59,840
value proposition it's a more logical

5673
03:06:57,840 --> 03:07:02,000
conversation that you can have um with

5674
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:04,398
customers it's not it's a little bit

5675
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:06,879
less emotional and um kind of subjective

5676
03:07:04,398 --> 03:07:08,318
but yeah in the home you have to

5677
03:07:06,879 --> 03:07:09,920
yeah so like a home robot it's like what

5678
03:07:08,318 --> 03:07:11,600
does that mean yeah and so then you

5679
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:13,760
really have to be crisp about the value

5680
03:07:11,600 --> 03:07:15,920
proposition and what like

5681
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:17,120
really makes it worth it like and and we

5682
03:07:15,920 --> 03:07:18,799
by the way went to that same order we

5683
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:21,200
almost like

5684
03:07:18,799 --> 03:07:22,000
we almost hit a wall coming out of 2013

5685
03:07:21,200 --> 03:07:23,920
where

5686
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:25,920
we were so big on explaining why our

5687
03:07:23,920 --> 03:07:27,520
stuff was so high-tech and all the kind

5688
03:07:25,920 --> 03:07:29,840
of like great technology in it and how

5689
03:07:27,520 --> 03:07:32,479
cool it is and so forth um to having to

5690
03:07:29,840 --> 03:07:34,960
make a super hard pivot on why is it fun

5691
03:07:32,478 --> 03:07:36,159
and why did like does the random kind of

5692
03:07:34,959 --> 03:07:38,478
family of

5693
03:07:36,159 --> 03:07:39,840
four need this right like so it's

5694
03:07:38,478 --> 03:07:41,760
learnings but

5695
03:07:39,840 --> 03:07:43,760
that's that's the challenge and i think

5696
03:07:41,760 --> 03:07:46,239
like robotics tends to sometimes fall

5697
03:07:43,760 --> 03:07:48,559
into the new category problem but then

5698
03:07:46,239 --> 03:07:50,239
you gotta be really crisp about why

5699
03:07:48,559 --> 03:07:52,719
it needs to exist well i think some of

5700
03:07:50,239 --> 03:07:55,680
robotics depending on the category

5701
03:07:52,719 --> 03:07:57,599
depending on the application

5702
03:07:55,680 --> 03:08:00,398
is a little bit of a marketing

5703
03:07:57,600 --> 03:08:02,000
this uh challenge and i don't i don't

5704
03:08:00,398 --> 03:08:02,879
mean

5705
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:05,200
i mean

5706
03:08:02,879 --> 03:08:07,438
it's it's the kind of marketing that

5707
03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:08,640
weimo is doing that tesla is doing is

5708
03:08:07,439 --> 03:08:11,040
like

5709
03:08:08,639 --> 03:08:13,760
showing off incredible

5710
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:15,920
engineering incredible technology

5711
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:18,159
but convincing like you said a family of

5712
03:08:15,920 --> 03:08:20,000
four that this this will this is like

5713
03:08:18,159 --> 03:08:21,920
this is transformative for your life

5714
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:23,600
this is this is this is fun this is you

5715
03:08:21,920 --> 03:08:25,040
don't care about tech isn't your thing

5716
03:08:23,600 --> 03:08:26,559
they don't they really don't like they

5717
03:08:25,040 --> 03:08:28,720
need to know why they want it so some of

5718
03:08:26,559 --> 03:08:31,278
that is just marketing yeah that's why

5719
03:08:28,719 --> 03:08:32,879
like roomba like um yes they didn't you

5720
03:08:31,279 --> 03:08:34,800
know like

5721
03:08:32,879 --> 03:08:36,719
go and you know have this like

5722
03:08:34,799 --> 03:08:38,478
you know huge huge con you know ramp

5723
03:08:36,719 --> 03:08:39,920
into like the entirety of like kind of a

5724
03:08:38,478 --> 03:08:42,398
robotics and so forth but like they

5725
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:43,760
built a really great business and um uh

5726
03:08:42,398 --> 03:08:44,959
in a vacuum cleaner world and like

5727
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:47,279
everybody understands what a vacuum

5728
03:08:44,959 --> 03:08:49,599
cleaner is um most people are annoyed by

5729
03:08:47,279 --> 03:08:51,439
doing it um and now you have one that

5730
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:54,159
like kind of does it itself

5731
03:08:51,439 --> 03:08:55,600
uh yeah various degrees of quality but

5732
03:08:54,159 --> 03:08:58,559
that is so compelling that like it's

5733
03:08:55,600 --> 03:09:00,559
easier to understand and like uh and

5734
03:08:58,559 --> 03:09:02,000
they had a very kind of and i think they

5735
03:09:00,559 --> 03:09:03,600
have like 15 of the vacuum cleaner

5736
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,318
market so it's like pretty successful

5737
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:06,640
right

5738
03:09:04,318 --> 03:09:07,760
i think we need more of those um types

5739
03:09:06,639 --> 03:09:09,199
of thoughtful stepping stones in

5740
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:10,880
robotics but the opportunities are

5741
03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:12,399
becoming bigger because

5742
03:09:10,879 --> 03:09:14,799
hardware's cheaper computes cheaper

5743
03:09:12,398 --> 03:09:16,799
clouds cheaper and ai's better so

5744
03:09:14,799 --> 03:09:18,879
there's a lot of opportunity if we zoom

5745
03:09:16,799 --> 03:09:22,159
out from specifically startups and

5746
03:09:18,879 --> 03:09:23,920
robotics what advice do you have

5747
03:09:22,159 --> 03:09:25,920
to uh high school students college

5748
03:09:23,920 --> 03:09:27,200
students about

5749
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:29,279
career

5750
03:09:27,200 --> 03:09:31,200
and living a life that you can be proud

5751
03:09:29,279 --> 03:09:33,840
of you lived one heck of a life you're

5752
03:09:31,200 --> 03:09:34,720
very successful in several domains

5753
03:09:33,840 --> 03:09:36,960
um

5754
03:09:34,719 --> 03:09:39,599
if you can convert that into a

5755
03:09:36,959 --> 03:09:41,759
generalizable potion what advice would

5756
03:09:39,600 --> 03:09:44,559
you give yeah it's a very good question

5757
03:09:41,760 --> 03:09:45,920
so it's very hard to

5758
03:09:44,559 --> 03:09:48,398
go into a space that you're not

5759
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:51,439
passionate about and push

5760
03:09:48,398 --> 03:09:52,478
like push hard enough to be you know to

5761
03:09:51,439 --> 03:09:55,439
like

5762
03:09:52,478 --> 03:09:57,519
maximize your potential uh in it and so

5763
03:09:55,439 --> 03:09:58,800
there's a um

5764
03:09:57,520 --> 03:10:00,880
there's always kind of like the saying

5765
03:09:58,799 --> 03:10:02,318
of like okay follow your passion great

5766
03:10:00,879 --> 03:10:04,398
try to find the overlap of where your

5767
03:10:02,318 --> 03:10:06,159
passion overlaps with like a growing

5768
03:10:04,398 --> 03:10:07,519
opportunity and need in the world where

5769
03:10:06,159 --> 03:10:08,959
it's not too different than the startup

5770
03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:11,920
kind of argument that we talked about

5771
03:10:08,959 --> 03:10:13,839
where um if you are where your passion

5772
03:10:11,920 --> 03:10:16,559
meets the market right you know i mean

5773
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:18,079
like because it's like uh um it's a you

5774
03:10:16,559 --> 03:10:19,680
know that's a beautiful thing where like

5775
03:10:18,079 --> 03:10:20,959
you can do what you love but it's also

5776
03:10:19,680 --> 03:10:22,079
just opens up tons of opportunities

5777
03:10:20,959 --> 03:10:24,559
because the world's ready for it right

5778
03:10:22,079 --> 03:10:26,879
like and so um and so like if you're

5779
03:10:24,559 --> 03:10:28,398
interested in technology um that might

5780
03:10:26,879 --> 03:10:29,679
point to like go and study machine

5781
03:10:28,398 --> 03:10:30,799
learning because you don't have to

5782
03:10:29,680 --> 03:10:32,000
decide what career you're going to go

5783
03:10:30,799 --> 03:10:33,679
into but it's going to be such a

5784
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:35,120
versatile space that's going to be at

5785
03:10:33,680 --> 03:10:36,720
the root of like everything that's going

5786
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:37,760
to be in front of us that

5787
03:10:36,719 --> 03:10:39,199
you can have

5788
03:10:37,760 --> 03:10:40,478
eight different careers in different

5789
03:10:39,200 --> 03:10:42,960
industries

5790
03:10:40,478 --> 03:10:45,039
and be an absolute expert in this like

5791
03:10:42,959 --> 03:10:47,679
kind of tool set that you wield that can

5792
03:10:45,040 --> 03:10:49,120
go and be applied um and that by the way

5793
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:50,880
that doesn't apply to just technology

5794
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:53,439
right it's uh it could be the exact same

5795
03:10:50,879 --> 03:10:55,519
thing if you want to um you know the

5796
03:10:53,439 --> 03:10:57,760
same thought process apprised to design

5797
03:10:55,520 --> 03:11:00,000
to marketing to um you know to sales to

5798
03:10:57,760 --> 03:11:01,600
anything but um that versatility where

5799
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,879
you like um

5800
03:11:01,600 --> 03:11:05,520
when you're in a space that's gonna

5801
03:11:02,879 --> 03:11:07,599
continue to grow um it's just like what

5802
03:11:05,520 --> 03:11:09,359
company do you join one that just is

5803
03:11:07,600 --> 03:11:11,120
going to grow and the growth creates

5804
03:11:09,359 --> 03:11:12,880
opportunities where the surface area is

5805
03:11:11,120 --> 03:11:15,760
just going to increase and the problems

5806
03:11:12,879 --> 03:11:17,599
will never get stale and you can have

5807
03:11:15,760 --> 03:11:18,880
you know many like and so you go into a

5808
03:11:17,600 --> 03:11:20,399
career where you have that sort of

5809
03:11:18,879 --> 03:11:21,438
growth in the in the world that you're

5810
03:11:20,398 --> 03:11:23,358
in

5811
03:11:21,439 --> 03:11:25,200
you end up having

5812
03:11:23,359 --> 03:11:27,439
so much more opportunity that

5813
03:11:25,200 --> 03:11:29,359
organically just appears and you can

5814
03:11:27,439 --> 03:11:31,520
then have more shots on goal to find

5815
03:11:29,359 --> 03:11:33,040
like that killer overlap of timing and

5816
03:11:31,520 --> 03:11:34,238
passion and skill set and point in life

5817
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:36,000
where you can like

5818
03:11:34,238 --> 03:11:38,000
you know just really be motivated and

5819
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:39,920
fall in love with something um

5820
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:41,120
and then at the same time like uh find a

5821
03:11:39,920 --> 03:11:42,639
balance like there's been times in my

5822
03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:45,120
life where i worked like a little bit

5823
03:11:42,639 --> 03:11:47,358
too obsessively and you know and crazy

5824
03:11:45,120 --> 03:11:48,640
and uh and i you know think we kind of

5825
03:11:47,359 --> 03:11:50,479
like tried to correct that you know kind

5826
03:11:48,639 --> 03:11:52,159
of the right opportunities but you know

5827
03:11:50,478 --> 03:11:52,879
i think i probably appreciate a lot more

5828
03:11:52,159 --> 03:11:54,959
now

5829
03:11:52,879 --> 03:11:57,039
friendships that go way back um you know

5830
03:11:54,959 --> 03:11:59,199
family and things like that and um

5831
03:11:57,040 --> 03:12:01,359
and i i'm kind of have the personality

5832
03:11:59,200 --> 03:12:02,960
where i could use like i have like so

5833
03:12:01,359 --> 03:12:04,159
much desire to really try to optimize

5834
03:12:02,959 --> 03:12:06,159
like you know what i'm working on that i

5835
03:12:04,159 --> 03:12:08,478
can easily go to kind of an extreme and

5836
03:12:06,159 --> 03:12:10,318
now i'm trying to like kind of find that

5837
03:12:08,478 --> 03:12:11,840
balance and make sure that i have

5838
03:12:10,318 --> 03:12:13,119
the friendships the family like

5839
03:12:11,840 --> 03:12:14,559
relationship with the kids everything

5840
03:12:13,120 --> 03:12:16,560
that like i don't

5841
03:12:14,559 --> 03:12:18,398
uh i push really really hard but it kind

5842
03:12:16,559 --> 03:12:19,920
of find a balance and

5843
03:12:18,398 --> 03:12:21,599
and i think

5844
03:12:19,920 --> 03:12:23,600
people can be happy on

5845
03:12:21,600 --> 03:12:27,120
actually many kind of extremes on that

5846
03:12:23,600 --> 03:12:29,040
spectrum but it's easy to kind of

5847
03:12:27,120 --> 03:12:31,040
inadvertently make a choice

5848
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:33,279
by how how you approach it that then

5849
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:35,680
becomes really hard to unwind um

5850
03:12:33,279 --> 03:12:37,200
and so being very thoughtful about

5851
03:12:35,680 --> 03:12:38,639
kind of all of those dimensions makes a

5852
03:12:37,200 --> 03:12:40,960
lot of sense and so

5853
03:12:38,639 --> 03:12:42,398
um to come those are all interrelated um

5854
03:12:40,959 --> 03:12:44,559
but at the end of the day oh love

5855
03:12:42,398 --> 03:12:47,119
passion and love yeah love towards you

5856
03:12:44,559 --> 03:12:48,238
said uh yeah family friends family and

5857
03:12:47,120 --> 03:12:49,439
hopefully

5858
03:12:48,238 --> 03:12:51,439

5859
03:12:49,439 --> 03:12:52,639
