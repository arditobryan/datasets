00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,160
includes being the ufc heavyweight

00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,119
champion

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,320
and countless other accolades he also

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,278
happens to be one of the most

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,519
intelligent

11
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,800

of martial arts

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,920

quick mention of our sponsors which

17
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,000

26
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:51,359
a fan of josh barnett for a long time

27
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,039
this conversation was indeed a long time

28
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,238
coming and i'm sure we'll talk many

29
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
times again

30
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,479
for what it's worth i'm a student of

31
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,640
combat sports admire when they're done

32
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,558
at the highest level either through

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,599
masterful execution of skill

34
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:07,280
or relentless dominance of pure guts

35
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,759
for context i'm a black belt in

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,159
jiu-jitsu and have competed in wrestling

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,080
submission grappling jiu-jitsu judo

38
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,680
and even catch wrestling which is a

39
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,158
variant of submission grappling that

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,320
josh

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,320
is one of the great practitioners

42
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,919
scholars and teachers of

43
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,359
i could probably talk for hours about

44
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,000
what i've learned from my time on the

45
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,079
mat

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
but if i were to say one thing it is

47
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,438
that the mat

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,280
is honest you can't run away from

49
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,519
yourself when you step on the mat

50
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640
it reveals your fears the lies you might

51
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,798
tell yourself

52
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,920
all the delusions you might have or at

53
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,600
least i had

54
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,680
that there's anything in this world that

55
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,959
can be achieved except through blood

56
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,079
sweat and tears that honesty taken to

57
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,158
the highest levels

58
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,000
as is the case with josh creates the

59
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
most special of human beings

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,560
and definitely someone who is

61
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,078
fascinating to talk to if you enjoy this

and now here's my conversation with josh

68
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
barnett

69
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,959
who were the philosophers and

70
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,439
philosophical ideas that influenced you

71
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,039
the most

72
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,959
are we just jumping right in that's

73
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,318
we're right and we're not interested

74
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,680
no foreplay on camera all right i had an

75
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,359
interesting philosophical journey

76
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,840
at least i think it's interesting and

77
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
that was

78
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,280
i think as far as organized philosophy

79
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
or maybe uh

80
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
i think authentic's not the right word

81
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,680
but like uh

82
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,439
yeah we'll stay organized um

83
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,200
i would say that nietzsche is probably

84
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,959
one of the people with the most

85
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,318
influence on on me

86
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,920
uh but i also feel like to a degree

87
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,919
your personality and will oftentimes

88
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,079
dictate what philosophers that you can

89
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,679
you can vibe with yeah so what what what

90
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,680
ideas from nietzsche was it the

91
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,000
the ubermaj definitely the ubermensches

92
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
is huge to me because i see it as an

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
extension

94
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,280
of basically the religious concepts of

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,318
god and higher

96
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,680
ideals but just put into a different a

97
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,878
secular context

98
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,439
and the idea also that the ubermensch

99
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,639
is a striving and overcoming you know

100
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,439
something that you're always working

101
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,518
towards

102
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:24,799
that very few will ever it's not like

103
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,879
the the concept that you can just

104
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,959
make them it doesn't happen that way and

105
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,439
it's not based simply upon

106
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,080
if you were say put through a genetic

107
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,479
program

108
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,080
and and and turned into a super soldier

109
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,119
like i wouldn't that wouldn't make it

110
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,560
you know that's like the the very

111
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,158
surface level and incorrect

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
understanding what ubermensch is

113
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,079
the ubermensch is the idea of this this

114
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,120
kind of uh

115
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,159
human that that transcends all the

116
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,039
the weaker lower aspects of humans which

117
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,878
we're full of

118
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,639
but i also think that there's an element

119
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,239
in nietzsche's writing that suggests

120
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,279
that it's not something

121
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,680
you can't even be in all the time like

122
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,919
it's

123
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,040
even a temporary state because it's not

124
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,759
something that we're capable of

125
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,679
maintaining

126
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,120
it's something to strive for like a

127
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,200
morality

128
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,000
uh an image ideal a set of principles

129
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,959
that we can

130
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,399
connect to that doesn't rely on

131
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,439
otherworldly

132
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,439
kind of uh outdoor things

133
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,319
with nietzsche i feel like the concept

134
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,319
of the ubermensch

135
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,599
is something built on authenticity as

136
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
well

137
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,360
as heidegger was like dozen right so

138
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,679
when you are authentic

139
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,479
and heidegger being a follower of

140
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,439
nietzsche's

141
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,360
and highly influenced by him uh with i

142
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,199
think that the ubermensch is an example

143
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,639
of authenticity in that it isn't

144
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,240
about trying to be anything that you

145
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,040
cannot be or to go against who you

146
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,879
are but to actually understand that

147
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,720
accept that and then work with what you

148
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,159
can work with and and and

149
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,039
create from your lump of clay that is

150
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,960
you

151
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,000
because i can't become

152
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,359
certain there's certain things that are

153
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,720
just not going to happen for me because

154
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,080
it's not in my proclivity i mean i'm

155
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,400
never going gonna be you know five foot

156
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,319
tall and 120 pounds

157
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:19,359
i mean that again i guess but uh

158
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,519
um but i know

159
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,560
but as you get more in tune with who you

160
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,038
are as you start

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,439
learning more about what unique things

162
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,959
or at least what that

163
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,959
that combination that makes you that

164
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,399
gestalt part of yourself

165
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,719
what those things are and how you can

166
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,560
use them then you know you can work

167
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,479
towards being that

168
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,839
taking what that is and seeing if you

169
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,000
can

170
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,679
get to that point now the likelihood is

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,279
no maybe probably never i mean but we

172
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,280
can never achieve godhood yet

173
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,319
you know religion is is a constant you

174
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,679
know striving

175
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,839
and a look at a higher ideal concept

176
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,199
even if it's multiple gods or one god

177
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,799
it's still

178
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,600
essentially all built around this

179
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,680
concept like i i like the idea of

180
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,520
catholics original sin if you think of

181
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,199
sin not as evil but as

182
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,680
you know missing the mark the archer's

183
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,038
term where it derives or even like in

184
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,959
spanish you know without so as being

185
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,478
if you accept that you are imperfect if

186
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,560
you accept that you you need to

187
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,038
constantly strive even against yourself

188
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
because you you will figure out the best

189
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:22,240
ways at which to

190
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,840
submarine your own capabilities

191
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,519
submarine your own

192
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,038
dreams and wishes and whatever you will

193
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,399
ruin them more than anything else

194
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,800
and you will tell yourself that you

195
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,758
ruined them on purpose for a good reason

196
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,360
or you'll say that

197
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,439
you'll figure out a way to put it on

198
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,479
everything else but yourself

199
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,560
and so the idea of thinking of

200
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,318
well as i'm starting off on this whole

201
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,759
thing i got a lot of work to do

202
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,039
and that's just the way it is and i got

203
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,759
to figure out what areas those are going

204
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,079
to be

205
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,280
and so you know i thought oh yeah if i

206
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,519
think of original sin

207
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,598
actually can be that can be kind of a

208
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:57,038
clever idea but it's also

209
00:06:53,598 --> 00:07:00,000
just accepting that we're all

210
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,959
uniquely strange and unequal in our own

211
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,560
ways

212
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,719
but we have to figure out how that fits

213
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,319
in the word authenticity kind of

214
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,639
connects to all of that so

215
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,319
striving to be your authentic self means

216
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,439
figuring out exactly the shape of the

217
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,319
flaws

218
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,160
the the character of your like little

219
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,000
demons you get to play with and

220
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
around them finding a path to whatever

221
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,319
the hell uh

222
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,599
ideal versions of yourself you can carve

223
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,680
and pretending like that's

224
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,759
such a thing is even possible the other

225
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,160
idea about nietzsche is

226
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,598
on his idea of morality he presents the

227
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,720
argument that uh

228
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,399
morality is a human illusion and that uh

229
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,319
you know there's not such a thing as

230
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,478
good and evil and these are all kind of

231
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,598
constructs do you think there's such a

232
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,439
thing as a

233
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:44,719
good and evil that's connected to some

234
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,839
objective reality

235
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,120
i think that there are some i

236
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,359
actually do believe that there are some

237
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,560
universals i'm not kantian in any way

238
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,520
but i do think that there are some

239
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
universals and

240
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,959
the thing that actually brought me to

241
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
even the concept of that was jung

242
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,239
so you know jung's concept of the

243
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,119
collective unconsciousness

244
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,400
and then taking that thought and then

245
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,680
applying it to

246
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,918
looking through his history and uh

247
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,759
the most varied history you can find so

248
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,120
i would say probably religion is your

249
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,280
earliest one

250
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,439
that you can get for for written history

251
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,079
or uh

252
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,120
written examples of human behavior and

253
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,359
psychology

254
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,240
at its at the the furthest that we can

255
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,919
look into it

256
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,680
uh with you know from man's hand to

257
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,759
whatever the medium is cuneiform or

258
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,038
whatever but as you do that and then

259
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,399
let's say going from

260
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,958
mesopotamia to india to

261
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,719
you know up to and just going from all

262
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,278
these places as disparate as they may

263
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,560
seem

264
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:45,919
as many different cultures and

265
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,719
ethnicities and religions and how the

266
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,319
religions will

267
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,759
will vary quite a bit from monotheists

268
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,360
to

269
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,039
uh polytheists and so on and so forth

270
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,360
but then just seeing how there's all the

271
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,639
through lines and of course campbell

272
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,278
he did this uh much earlier than

273
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,519
me thinking about it but uh i think that

274
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:05,519
by

275
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,360
looking at things that way and starting

276
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,959
to find the threads instead of always

277
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
just looking at everything as being its

278
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,039
own compartmentalized

279
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
concept as if it only applies to this

280
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,879
time this people like

281
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,080
getting overly pomo about it is just a

282
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,799
really idiotic

283
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,200
post-modern so you think that there is

284
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,879
uh

285
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,720
just like joseph campbell there's a

286
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,480
thread that connects

287
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,879
all of these stories narratives that we

288
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,680
constructed for ourselves as we evolve

289
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:36,559
and that thread is grounded in some kind

290
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,479
of absolute ideas of maybe on the

291
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,439
morality side which is the trickiest one

292
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,278
of good and evil

293
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,600
somewhat yeah i think that a lot of this

294
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,600
stuff is just derived from a biological

295
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,200
perspective i feel like these things are

296
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,519
innate within us

297
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
do you think our innately humans are

298
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,759
good like we

299
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,360
no i don't i feel like

300
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,120
i also feel like there's an issue of

301
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,440
scale too like

302
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,320
um like nasim taleb likes to talk about

303
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
how he

304
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,600
views his the way he interacts with with

305
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,519
groups

306
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,879
in terms of scale you know what is this

307
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
thing about like at a

308
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,120
at the familia level i'm a i'm a

309
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,240
communist and then at the

310
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,639
civic level i'm a i'm a republican or

311
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,639
something

312
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,240
at this other level then it goes on at

313
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,000
the widest level he's a libertarian

314
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,600
or something of that nature you know

315
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,480
like fundamentally human interaction

316
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,040
changes

317
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,839
on scale on scale and scale and also uh

318
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,719
from

319
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,320
uh you know subjective to the

320
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,879
environment around them so and i don't

321
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,278
even mean

322
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,039
environment just in the sake of physical

323
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,559
environment uh nature right like

324
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,159
nature's constantly trying to murder you

325
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,159
well it's not really trying it's just

326
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,679
nature's being nature the universe is

327
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,799
the universe and

328
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:48,479
uh at times it takes you out it's just

329
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:50,000
not with any particular uh compunction

330
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,680
or prejudice it's just

331
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,679
oops you know sorry there's no more

332
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,039
dodos my bad

333
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,120
but don't you think the particular

334
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,199
flavor of the complexity that is the

335
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,078
human mind

336
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,879
was created like let me make an argument

337
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,679
for that

338
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,559
all people are fundamentally good okay

339
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,039
is uh

340
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,679
there's an evolutionary advantage to

341
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,958
being

342
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:15,759
to striving to uh cooperate

343
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,278
to add more love to the world of like

344
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,000
compassion empathy all that kind of

345
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,039
stuff

346
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,320
and that the very thing that created

347
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,000
the human mind was

348
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,278
this evolutionary advantage whatever the

349
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
forces behind this evolutionary

350
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,958
advantage

351
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,320
and scale yes so when we're dealing with

352
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,679
a small tribe

353
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,519
sure yeah when you meet another tribe

354
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,879
maybe there are other factors that are

355
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,200
going into that

356
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:46,399
let's say you scale up and so

357
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,399
your 150 has exceeded their 150 and

358
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,519
like you start to get to a certain point

359
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,039
where

360
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,600
um you can't really be

361
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:58,078
close enough to someone down the line of

362
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,040
some of of that next like that 150s 150

363
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,759
150

364
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,159
and they just now all of a sudden become

365
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,879
some

366
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,838
some guy whatever and when it comes to

367
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,480
some guy

368
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,519
at once it starts hitting scale i don't

369
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,920
know that it's

370
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:17,039
capable people can be

371
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:21,039
as as magnanimous to a stranger as

372
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,919
to the known if they orient themselves

373
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:23,919
to be

374
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,278
secure enough because it does come to

375
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,799
security insecurity

376
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,200
in one way or the other either brought

377
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,359
on by the unknown brought on by

378
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
an actual threat brought on by even

379
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,278
their own as we would use the word

380
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,959
insecurity in that their own insecurity

381
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,480
within their own capabilities their own

382
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,559
belief in themselves

383
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,200
all these things can change things from

384
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,479
being compassionate and what have you to

385
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,440
at least at the very least

386
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,079
maybe not evil but self-interest driven

387
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,800
to the point of

388
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:56,559
negative results for those that aren't

389
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,199
you know what i mean right

390
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,759
but another way to frame that is uh

391
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
maybe

392
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,600
it's less about scale and more about the

393
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,399
amount of resources available so

394
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,800
if we're overflowing with resources in

395
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,679
terms of

396
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:13,278
security and safety all the things

397
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,039
you've mentioned

398
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,799
if we have more than enough resources

399
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,399
then the way we treat a stranger

400
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,519
the way we position ourselves towards

401
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,799
that stranger might be

402
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,480
in a way that uh allows us to be our

403
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,919
real human selves as opposed to sort of

404
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,079
our animal self

405
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,199
and therefore it's mostly about how

406
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,078
clever can we

407
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,160
descendants of abes be in coming up with

408
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,439
all cool kinds of technologies and ways

409
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,360
to uh

410
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,040
efficiently use the resources we have

411
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,480
such that we're not constrained

412
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:48,319
and my hope is that we can

413
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,120
that human innovation will outpace

414
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,199
the growth of our the number of people

415
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,240
that are starving for resources

416
00:13:53,198 --> 00:14:01,439
yes uh i think that there's a lot of uh

417
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:03,919
rationality behind uh this argument and

418
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,440
you know in in some ways i agree and and

419
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,439
in a lot of ways i see it as

420
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,760
missing the point of of how this

421
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
experiment

422
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,679
has been playing out across time when

423
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,399
you look at uh what

424
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,198
for one it's like define resources you

425
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,240
know what is a

426
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:25,679
what is a resource of of as

427
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,720
humans uh would would define it right

428
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,278
or wealth even and so you can say

429
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,120
well you know an iphone's a resource the

430
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,838
internet's a resource

431
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,039
water obviously is a resource but if we

432
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,040
weigh them

433
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,439
what is more important to human beings

434
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:44,000
water internet or iphones

435
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,800
it's water right so if we look at

436
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,120
resources

437
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,559
if we start with what do human beings

438
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,320
need to live

439
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:55,518
i mean actually live not live here

440
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,879
in this [ __ ] fantasy creation

441
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,039
extension of our own

442
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,958
ingenuity and you know a prison of our

443
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,078
own creation and also a paradise of our

444
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,679
own creation

445
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:06,078
but this is not how human beings

446
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,638
normally live this is all built upon

447
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,879
stuff

448
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,720
on on built on concept on idea

449
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,159
and some and and some of it's built on

450
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,680
just well this is the paradigm so this

451
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,480
is what you do

452
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,519
human beings need food they need water

453
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,560
to survive

454
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,078
they need shelter from the elements and

455
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,638
they need certain skills

456
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,479
to perpetuate these things and be able

457
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,079
to pass them down so that they can

458
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,920
so these things don't become uh

459
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,519
you don't end up in this this gap where

460
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:39,599
you have to relearn things

461
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,120
because if it's lost then

462
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,199
that time before you can get it back

463
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,039
again is going to be

464
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,879
a dark ages of sorts you know or it's

465
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,360
going to be highly detrimental to

466
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,000
to your group because not knowing how to

467
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,919
fish

468
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,360
not knowing how to hunt not knowing how

469
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,799
to even

470
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,199
clean and cook the game once you have it

471
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,799
could be lethal that's fascinating to

472
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,639
think of that as a basic resource the

473
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,240
knowledge to attain the very

474
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,159
low level things of water right and

475
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,720
we'll figure it out we did it once

476
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,719
before

477
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,040
and we've done it over and over and over

478
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,480
and over again it's just costly

479
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:17,679
yes it has costs for sure um

480
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,399
but when you think of how

481
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,278
you look at the well we'll just deal

482
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,919
with

483
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,838
the first world of the west you look at

484
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,399
the the

485
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,440
the pathline the pathway of of western

486
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,919
civilization

487
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,399
and its growth and then you look at how

488
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:37,599
technology injected into it over time

489
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:40,159
you know how it magnifies uh

490
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,600
things or how pushes things at uh orders

491
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,039
of magnitude faster

492
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,639
and then the internet comes along and

493
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,639
even faster you know so you're watching

494
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,759
industrial evolution to

495
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,560
what is it the uh the capacitor and then

496
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,159
so on it goes further and further and as

497
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,599
the internet and technology

498
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,958
especially on the electronic side of

499
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:03,278
things start increasing in capability

500
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:05,838
it massively outpaces even our

501
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,480
necessity for it at times it becomes you

502
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,639
know plan

503
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,000
obsolescence happens quicker and over

504
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,319
and over and over again

505
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,038
and wealth increasing increases increase

506
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,359
increases

507
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,798
in terms of the things that we're able

508
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,479
to acquire right i mean

509
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,400
i've seen homeless people with with

510
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,599
smartphones you know so

511
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,798
we're living in the most wealth-laden

512
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:31,199
luxury laden age of

513
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:33,679
all of humanity yet what happens when

514
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,240
we see calamity or people go on hard

515
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,559
time what are

516
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
they the things that they value you know

517
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,079
what what is what do people go to an

518
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,599
argument about the cost of things that

519
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:45,038
are luxury items generally

520
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,879
and not necessity items you know we get

521
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:50,240
into fights about

522
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,480
um you know things that are

523
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
at the end of the day not necessities to

524
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,120
us you know people are so concerned

525
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,919
about

526
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,599
netflix and the internet and personally

527
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,200
i'm very concerned about the internet

528
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,558
because i look at it as

529
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,960
my own little personal library of

530
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,240
alexandria in my pocket

531
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,640
that's what i love about it and the

532
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
ability to have a tool as effective as

533
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,400
it is even though i'm in a constant

534
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,038
battle to not let that tool

535
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,759
become a vice or to become something

536
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,879
that

537
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:21,919
that actually brings me to a lower state

538
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,840
but we will the question is over the are

539
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,720
we willing to murder each other over

540
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,038
netflix

541
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,558
versus murder each other over water

542
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,599
we're willing to murder each other over

543
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,519
water

544
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,199
that's a given right but that's our

545
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,879
animalistic cells of death well it's

546
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,400
also a necessity for

547
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,720
it's animalistic but it's also either

548
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,320
you do it or you don't right like unless

549
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,600
somebody's willing to share that water

550
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:46,879
or if that water is of such a limited

551
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,519
uh uh capability or such a limited

552
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,559
amount

553
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,319
then you will have to murder to have

554
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,119
that one netflix the argument is the

555
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,480
higher

556
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,439
we get up to this hierarchy of what we

557
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,480
consider

558
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,679
in los angeles resources yes we were

559
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,599
less willing to be

560
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,360
to commit violence we are less willing

561
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,639
to commit violence the oh i would say

562
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,918
over netflix but we are willing to

563
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,840
commit violence over netflix over

564
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,600
everything associated with netflix over

565
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,879
televisions over sneakers

566
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:18,319
over over um you know i mean

567
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,520
when we look at a good i mean the

568
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,439
majority of

569
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,960
the stuff that came with the riots i

570
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,558
mean it was

571
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,079
use car dealerships uh targets

572
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,678
i mean and then you look it's like whoa

573
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,480
okay what are people

574
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,440
what do they got what are they so hell

575
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,279
bent to get

576
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,640
out of this whole thing i'm even talking

577
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,918
about the ideological elements or

578
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
anything like that just like okay

579
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,919
something's going on boom looting

580
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:41,678
whatever

581
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,600
yeah we you know what what are you going

582
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,440
to loot yeah you know you'll have aoc

583
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,240
say oh people needing bread

584
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
like i didn't see a single loaf of bread

585
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,480
you know i saw

586
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,879
television poetry you know but

587
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,960
to me it is poetry in a sense because

588
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,760
you get to see

589
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,000
who we how we actually are operating you

590
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,158
know

591
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,519
what are where what is becoming first

592
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,280
principles to most people but

593
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,960
wait but you could also argue though

594
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,558
those rides were more like the madness

595
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
of crowds which is oh it's definitely a

596
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,558
lot

597
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,558
more than just that i'm just saying that

598
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,119
given a chance it's like okay

599
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,759
boom the the lights are off the grid is

600
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,558
down

601
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,480
we've we've hacked into the whole system

602
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,839
turned into an 80s movie and

603
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,599
you have the ability to go get a hold of

604
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,519
whatever it is that you think is most

605
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,678
important and what do we do

606
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,679
and i say we as in you know including

607
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,080
all of us we grab a tv

608
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,600
we we attack it we we break into a

609
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,480
sneaker store on melrose we do

610
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,599
it's just like uh we still giant cause

611
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,839
statues

612
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,038
or the value of that is completely

613
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,119
market driven

614
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,640
like it's just a piece of polypropylene

615
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,639
or whatever butyl

616
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,960
and you know it's cool you know i'm a

617
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,960
big fan of art uh but uh

618
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,079
it's like you know i can't eat that and

619
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,440
at the end of the day man

620
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,798
you're sitting there with your with your

621
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,200
like what'd you do today honey what'd

622
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,359

you know man we were able to you know oh

624
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,439
i got this

625
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,119
i got this designer art statue

626
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,279
are you gonna go well you can't really

627
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,639
sell it on the on like the art markets

628
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,960
where people are really gonna pay for it

629
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,559
so

630
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
are you gonna become an underground art

631
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,558
dealer with your one piece of cause

632
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,159
art one interesting thing you just said

633
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:22,240
before i forget it you mentioned the

634
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:24,960
library of alexandria and your phone

635
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,240
well your phone but also just thinking

636
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,759
of your little world

637
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,279
that you're creating for yourself on the

638
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,200
internet that's a really powerful way to

639
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,158
actually phrase it one of the things

640
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,000
that uh

641
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,440
you've been on joe rogan several times

642
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,798
although everybody always comes to me oh

643
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,480
that was so great i didn't know

644
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,079
you you're on you've on joe rogan i go

645
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,000
this is like my fifth time dude

646
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,119
i've been a fan of yours for a long time

647
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,599
from

648
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,279
uh from other avenues this is a long

649
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,839
time coming actually everybody you have

650
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,960
no idea like how many times through

651
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,639
uh messaging and missing each other

652
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,400
over the years this is ridiculous this

653
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,159
is a long time coming you don't

654
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,080
realize how special this is for us this

655
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,679
is a well i'm also star struck we'll

656
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,319
talk about this but you symbolize

657
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,519
something

658
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,200
very important to me through my journey

659
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,639
through wrestling through jiu jitsu

660
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,279
through judo through

661
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
to street fighting through just combat

662
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,879
there's uh

663
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,599
you're the in some sense the devil on my

664
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,880
shoulder

665
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:21,918
of like of violence in a good in the in

666
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,919
in uh the devil gets a bad rap

667
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,240
does he does get a bad rap i i realize

668
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,080
you know sitting encased in in ice down

669
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,679
at that low-ass level you know

670
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,759
yeah but you know the angel side is more

671
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,400
like the athletic the sport the science

672
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,158
the tech

673
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,440
the the technical the chess side of

674
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,840
things so uh

675
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,600
but on the library alexander let me ask

676
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:44,879
uh

677
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:46,158
because you're on joe rogan it does make

678
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,600
me really sad

679
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,200
and i realize that i'm just probably

680
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:52,240
being romantic that

681
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,440
his most of his library of

682
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,480
interviews that were on youtube have not

683
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,640
been taken down

684
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,720
because he went to spotify and that was

685
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,880
the first i'm probably an idiot but it

686
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,480
was the first time i realized

687
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,320
that this knowledge that we've been

688
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,640
building up on the internet

689
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,639
doesn't necessarily last forever no it

690
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
doesn't unless you preserve it i mean

691
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,679
it's like all things if

692
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,359
if you do not preserve them if you do

693
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,400
not make uh

694
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,918
efforts um you know so many of my it

695
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,159
just really brings the minor off the

696
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,679
top of my head all my so many friends of

697
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,320
of mine that are jewish

698
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,280
uh you know they're they're basically

699
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:31,038
secular

700
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:32,720
but yet through even the secular

701
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,960
aspect of just keeping the traditions

702
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,480
alive it's like well you could always

703
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,319
pick a book and read out about read

704
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,360
about it clearly

705
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:43,839
it's called the torah but um

706
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,798
if you don't put these things into

707
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:49,278
action if you don't make them a part of

708
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,558
your consciousness maybe even on the

709
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,519
subconsciousness just by

710
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,480
through through repetition they will die

711
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,038
they will become

712
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,240
simply something that exists somewhere

713
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:59,919
until you

714
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,919
find it again and carl gotch used to say

715
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,919
something um

716
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,679
he would say that i don't invent moves i

717
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,360
just rediscover them

718
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:13,200
but yet gotch and billy robinson also

719
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:15,678
would understand that you

720
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,640
if someone's not carrying the torch

721
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,080
it'll go out

722
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,080
now that doesn't mean fire can't be

723
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,918
rekindled it just means that it that

724
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,240
torch no longer

725
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,200
is lighting the way on on this knowledge

726
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,640
and so it's

727
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,640
it's important to be

728
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,678
an individual even on on an individual

729
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:36,079
level to be a repository for

730
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,120
for aspects of knowledge you mentioned

731
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,879
gotch

732
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:44,558
you uh consider yourself

733
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,480
a catch uh wrestler

734
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:47,918
so i've mentioned to you offline that i

735
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,798
competed in a couple of catch wrestling

736
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,759
tournaments

737
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,839
uh can we go wikipedia level at the very

738
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,319
basic you're the exactly right person to

739
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,199
ask

740
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,480
what is catch wrestling and what are its

741
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,840
defining principles

742
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,558
i would say the easiest way for us to

743
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,678
talk about

744
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:07,839
and give uh

745
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,159
an overview of what catch is in the

746
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,639
simplest terms is

747
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,679
think of collegiate wrestling with

748
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,000
submissions

749
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,759
that is essentially what catch is and

750
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,919
it's not surprising because collegiate

751
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:22,400
wrestling is actually derived from

752
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,960
catch's catch can it's just that over

753
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,080
time

754
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,880
certain aspects were were

755
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,399
removed from the competition structure

756
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,200
so that they became

757
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,519
null elements things that were discarded

758
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,080
but

759
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:40,639
it's funny that you can take high level

760
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,278
amateur collegiate types and you can

761
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,080
show them

762
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,919
a move and then add a little bit to it

763
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,720
and go oh well hey that was just like

764
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,759
what we already do here but except oh i

765
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,440
didn't know you could take it all the

766
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,879
way to this point or

767
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,240
you know things of that nature

768
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,080
especially when it comes to professional

769
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,038
wrestling like uh teaching people like

770
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:58,960
no that that

771
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,558
i know you're just using this for in a

772
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,000
show but this is actually a real move

773
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,079
and here's how it really feels

774
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,440
and so collegiate wrestling and

775
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,038
wrestling in general for people who are

776
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,798
not aware is basically

777
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,480
two people started on their feet and

778
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:11,679
that's a score

779
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,079
that they're trying to take each other

780
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,159
down and they have to um

781
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,278
they score points along the way you can

782
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,320
end matches by

783
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:23,359
pinning them for example on their back

784
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:26,639
i think one way to describe wrestling

785
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,839
is uh it's very much about figuring out

786
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,159
ways to establish

787
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:34,798
control and leverage in these kind of uh

788
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,559
tie ups or there's different styles

789
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,079
where you can do more from a distance to

790
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,440
where it's more about the timing and all

791
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,158
that kind of stuff

792
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,759
ultimately it's an art of like both

793
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,278
upper body and lower body and you could

794
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,240
choose the different puzzles that you

795
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,440
solved there

796
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,200
you could be attacking the head the arms

797
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,558
you could be attacking the legs

798
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,558
there's also part of collegiate

799
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,038
wrestling that's on the ground

800
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,000
that has more uh what's called like a

801
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:59,679
referee's position

802
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,679
right the referee's position where

803
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,559
you're on uh your hands and knees

804
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,759
basically and so uh do you do you

805
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:07,839
understand what that's supposed to

806
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,400
simulate why is that one of the standard

807
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,519
positions

808
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,200
it's one of the standard positions

809
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,400
because one it's one of the easiest ways

810
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,278
to actually get up

811
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,919
um but two it's because you cannot be on

812
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:17,119
your back

813
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,278
if you're on your back you're getting

814
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:22,398
pinned and

815
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:26,319
the back exposure or being pinned is

816
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:29,439
pretty much the universal wrestling

817
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:32,480
thing one taking the guy from their feet

818
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,919
to the floor and two

819
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,038
pinning them as you go from like was it

820
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:42,399
uh cornish wrestling

821
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:45,679
turkish oil wrestling mongolian sumo

822
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,398
uh indian um well they'll call it

823
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,440
pelhani

824
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:53,678
it's also called kushti um

825
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:57,360
jujitsu judo so many of them is

826
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,798
like there's a usambo even if it doesn't

827
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,759
end the match it's still like one of the

828
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,519
most important

829
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:06,000
aspects of the competition itself across

830
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,720
oh so every style and this is where

831
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,880
submission

832
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,839
like catch wrestling or uh submission

833
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,960
wrestling

834
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:15,119
or jiu jitsu feels different which

835
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,000
it seems like for most wrestling for a

836
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,558
lot of wrestling

837
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,679
the dominance is the is the goal

838
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:26,000
as opposed to submission which

839
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,679
i guess those are two are related but

840
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,519
dominating the position so that's what

841
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,720
pinning is it's almost like

842
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:35,278
breaking your opponent

843
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,798
like breaking uh through all of their

844
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,319
defenses to where they're completely

845
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,759
defenseless and you could do anything

846
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,359
with them that you want maybe

847
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,440
that's a wikipedia definition of

848
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,879
dominance i don't know

849
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,720
and then yeah i mean it sounds very much

850
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,399
like a chain to a radiator yeah

851
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,319
yeah yeah this uh there's a threat that

852
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,439
connects all right

853
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,798
but submission feels different i mean

854
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,880
it is actually different when you think

855
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,319
about it across the landscape

856
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,240
i don't think radically different but

857
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,319
distill slightly different and that

858
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,278
um if you think of wrestling as being

859
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,480
derived from

860
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,599
from from combat right so well it is

861
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,640
combat sports but

862
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,398
more more lethal combat getting somebody

863
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,240
off their feet and onto their back

864
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:17,678
is about as lethal a place for the

865
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,038
person on bottom to be

866
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,559
in general i mean i i don't

867
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,240
don't come at me with your talks about

868
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,398
your [ __ ] worm guards

869
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,519
and blah blah blah and whatever spider

870
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,959
bear

871
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,639
okay get out of here with that this is

872
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,200
we're not talking about you

873
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,080
in this highly uh regimented sporting

874
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,720
environment

875
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,678
we're talking about general you know all

876
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,159
the body hair

877
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:44,880
none of the waxing human beings so um

878
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,760
getting someone on their back okay

879
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,960
they're how

880
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,640
you as you're trying to get up you're

881
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,440
getting hit with a rock or stabbed or

882
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,559
what have you

883
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,720
set on fire who knows

884
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,599
generally these conflicts are not just

885
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,720
isolated to

886
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:00,719
one on one you it's if it's four on two

887
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,960
your your your your buddy that was with

888
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,240
you back to back now he's on his back

889
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,480
what do you think now it's going to be

890
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,120
one-on-one well three go on one

891
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,798
so and then you go you elevate this to

892
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,479
to armored combat right

893
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,839
and it's boom put them on the ground oh

894
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,839
crap it's hard to get up well while

895
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,759
you're struggling to get up stab

896
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,119
you know that's where jiu jitsu's uh

897
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,720
concepts come from with all their

898
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,199
leveraging and off balancing is

899
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,558
oh man if i end up in this situation in

900
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,480
tight close quarters combat

901
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,639
yes we could fight it out with swords

902
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,200
and knives and what have you but

903
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,759
it's way easier if the first thing i can

904
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,200
do is foot sweep you on your back

905
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,440
and then pull my knife and just go and

906
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,278
stick is there a thread

907
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,480
that connects all of these different

908
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,679
arts from

909
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,079
not just arts but from the very base

910
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,679
violence of war just like you said that

911
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:51,038
there's no rules

912
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,919
to the very regimented uh

913
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,679
ibajf i do jiu jitsu tournaments and

914
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,360
just you kind of laid out some of it but

915
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,320
can you go all the way to the

916
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,038
so when you you start off with absolute

917
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,278
skills

918
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,079
in the sense of absolute offense and

919
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,720
defense

920
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,199
in the taking or preserving of life

921
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,640
right

922
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,038
full-on at its at its purest

923
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,320
form of self defense and

924
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:18,240
self-preservation

925
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:19,759
okay and then you extrapolate part of

926
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,440
that in that

927
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:26,240
all animals train in violence

928
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,759
all play usually degenerates into some

929
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,240
sort of soft violence

930
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,038
so be it cats when they're kittens and

931
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,120
puppies and

932
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,319
all that everything learns how to kill

933
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:38,000
how to fight

934
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,038
um not that you know just that that dumb

935
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,519
alpha

936
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:42,879
meme stuff where the idea is that oh by

937
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,319
being alpha that means you run around

938
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,960
like basically just being a bully in a

939
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,240
[ __ ]

940
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,558
no actually alpha wolves spend

941
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,599
very little time fighting because if you

942
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,079
were actually

943
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,199
alpha you don't get into fights there's

944
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,639
no need to

945
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,120
um and if you are probably getting into

946
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,399
any

947
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,239
large amount of fights it's probably

948
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,079
because you're being shitty at being an

949
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,519
alpha and now people are tired of you

950
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,519
being in charge um and yet

951
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,440
in the animal world and it would be the

952
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,599
same for human beings at that

953
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,278
that that base beginning level of

954
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,398
violence

955
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,119
there's a big risk so i know that we

956
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,079
live in this

957
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,558
place with health care and where or you

958
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,918
might be

959
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:25,759
in a place with nationalized health

960
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,480
whatever right there's there's there's

961
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,000
band-aids

962
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,038
there's there's uh uh uh penicillin

963
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,079
there's all that kind of stuff but

964
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:38,879
that's not the normal way of things

965
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,519
you know yeah there's a channel that

966
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,840
just

967
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,120
hurts me every time i i used to follow

968
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:44,480
and i had to unfollow it because it was

969
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:45,678
too painful for me as a human being

970
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,120
called nature is metal

971
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,120
oh yes on instagram it was uh sobering

972
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,918
and then it was like this is too sober

973
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,398
that's very sobering so in there the

974
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,759
risk

975
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:59,518
is at its highest level there the damage

976
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:04,319
you take

977
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:07,679
the winner walks away hurt getting lame

978
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,918
when you need every aspect of your

979
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,278
physical and athletic faculties to

980
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,360
survive because

981
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,640
it isn't going to be the the this isn't

982
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,439
the first and it's definitely not going

983
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,159
to be the last

984
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,000
especially if you're the slowest one you

985
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,200
know it's a is it was it uh

986
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,759
is a lyric from a clutch song

987
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,650
uh don't go for the fat ones just go for

988
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,720
the slow ones

989
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:32,080
[Laughter]

990
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,440
oh man but that the universal truth of

991
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,240
the way nature works it's not cruel it's

992
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,320
just the way it is

993
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,278
yeah i mean watch uh animals get into

994
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,519
fights on

995
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,200
on any of these sort of documentary

996
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,000
stuff you'll see

997
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,159
an intense short and then dispersal like

998
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,679
you'll see as soon as one feels like uh

999
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,519
things have switched just enough

1000
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,679
boom the bear or whatever it is takes

1001
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,359
off it's like i'm not i'm done with this

1002
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,038
because if you can get out of there with

1003
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,959
just some scars and what have you

1004
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:02,798
okay you lose an eye no it's not as good

1005
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,240
uh you really get hurt bad and get

1006
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,639
infected you're done

1007
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,239
yeah you know so it there's a serious

1008
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,559
risk to be

1009
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,319
um that can come with these sort of

1010
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:15,679
things yet

1011
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,039
i believe that we are inherently

1012
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,679
born for at least aspects of and use of

1013
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,039
violence

1014
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,878
and so at the end of the day we need

1015
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,559
these things not just to

1016
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,719
not just survive each other but they're

1017
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:32,078
they're a part of being able to

1018
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:34,000
hunt and other things but uh so violence

1019
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,399
is a part of human nature violence is

1020
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
a is like it's an absolute it is in

1021
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,078
every person it is a part of every

1022
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,398
interaction it isn't part of every

1023
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,839

topic i have um a friend of mine now

1048
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,400
uh a fellow russian uh ukrainian

1049
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,358
uh michael malus oh yeah i'm familiar

1050
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,680
with michael melons

1051
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:38,559
i watched a little bit of your guys's uh

1052
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,118
conversation

1053
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:41,679
so this is really good to ask you

1054
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,800
because

1055
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:47,118
uh i like how he's in the white suit and

1056
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,519
and you're in the white and black but he

1057
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,200
he lives in new york city

1058
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:55,838
he is uh espouses ideas of monarchism

1059
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,039
and his idea and this is different than

1060
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:00,239
um

1061
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,838
sort of the iron rand set of ideas

1062
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,838
that there's a line between sort of

1063
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,880
capitalism that's backed by the state

1064
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:11,599
and just pure anarchism and

1065
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:16,559
his idea that violence won't take over

1066
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:18,880
in an anarchism is one that feels to me

1067
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,639
not grounded in reality i may be agree i

1068
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,680
may be wrong so is there some

1069
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,159
so uh the idea with pure capitalism

1070
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,879
is that you mean laissez-faire

1071
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:31,118
completely deregulated yeah yeah well

1072
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,160
what it will agree it'll end up in one

1073
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,640
it'll end up in

1074
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,519
if if you're anti-globalist it's gonna

1075
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,639
be that

1076
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:41,920
it's gonna be globalist 100 because

1077
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,799
it has no con pure capitalism has no

1078
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,639
consideration

1079
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,920
for uh has no consideration for your

1080
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,319
your native users

1081
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,079
or of any sort like it does it doesn't

1082
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,119
matter and but the idea of governments

1083
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,039
is that the land

1084
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,240
little piece of land geographically

1085
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,000
you're born on

1086
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,439
means you're going to stick to whatever

1087
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,320
founding documents

1088
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,920
created that little land so anarchism is

1089
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,440
against that

1090
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,880
and the argument is you should be able

1091
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,920
to choose which ideas you live with

1092
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,480
and the concern there is nobody

1093
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,838
uh this geographical land the

1094
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,599
governments

1095
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,039
that organize on that land will not

1096
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,119
do not need to protect you from the

1097
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,880
violence and my sense is there does need

1098
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,079
to be an army there does need to be

1099
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,640
police

1100
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,920
that help what however the form that

1101
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,039
police takes but

1102
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,838
there needs to be a more centralized not

1103
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,239
completely centralized but more

1104
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,960
centralized

1105
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,879
safety net of to protect you from the

1106
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,599
violence scale again right so

1107
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,720
if you want to have your anarchist

1108
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,079
utopia

1109
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:51,358
well we'll call it utah your anarchist

1110
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,760
creation here at certain scale i'm sure

1111
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:54,799
it's

1112
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,320
doable you know um

1113
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,880
but as it scales as the scale increases

1114
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,838
it's completely untenable and a state

1115
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,800
will emerge

1116
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:06,639
a state will always you because even

1117
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,160
people always think of states as as like

1118
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,598
people rubbing their hands and smoking

1119
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,358
cigars and back rooms

1120
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,640
and just out of nowhere coming around

1121
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,559
just like oh we're going to create this

1122
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:16,319
big centralized thing and just so we can

1123
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:17,759
tell everybody what to do and we can be

1124
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,838
in charge

1125
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,960
i mean i know that there are people like

1126
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,559
that that exist

1127
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,960
that they would like to do things of

1128
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:28,000
that nature and that they see

1129
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,639
the use of power as

1130
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,079
something to be used more for their

1131
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,799
their personal gains

1132
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,000
over first which again self-interest in

1133
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,560
human beings

1134
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,039
but um uh but eventually a state people

1135
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,159
want us they want something to go like

1136
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,599
okay

1137
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,279
who's taking care of this and who's

1138
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,920
taking care of that and who and how do

1139
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,160
we create

1140
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,240
some sort of uh some sort of uh

1141
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,319
protocol for this like okay well when

1142
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,159
it's not bob when is it susie when is it

1143
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,000
whatever i mean like how do we

1144
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,519
you know it's got to get done if we want

1145
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,239
this thing to become bigger if we want

1146
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,719
our

1147
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,838
all of our plumbing to work right if we

1148
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,439
want it's just i'm sorry

1149
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:10,559
a state's going to happen a state is

1150
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,079
also when you think about it

1151
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,799
it's supposed to have consideration to

1152
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,839
tribe right so if people think that

1153
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,760
we're not tribes

1154
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:18,880
well you're not you're not really

1155
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,160
thinking very deeply

1156
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,200
we're all tribes of a sort and uh

1157
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,759
everybody likes to use the word

1158
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:28,879
tribalism in this idea of of this uh

1159
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,880
antagonistic concept but and while sure

1160
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,079
tribalism can be antagonistic tribalism

1161
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,320
can also be

1162
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,000
uh a positive thing or i could just say

1163
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,320
it just seems to be a natural thing

1164
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
people you know they create their their

1165
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,599
groups of one sort or another

1166
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,519
and so when you have

1167
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,119
well when you think about where when

1168
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,599
nation states really started to become a

1169
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,200
thing

1170
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,640
uh and i don't mean even the more modern

1171
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:54,639
looking variants that we could think

1172
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:56,559
back of and say the 19th century or

1173
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:57,759
something like that right

1174
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,440
even older than that i mean you think

1175
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,280
the assyrians didn't have a state of

1176
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,280
some sort of course they did

1177
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,760
um they how do you increase your your

1178
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,440
your your empire if you don't actually

1179
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,599
have a place to start from

1180
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,358
a ruler so you're saying like naturally

1181
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,119
when you start talking thinking about

1182
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:16,239
scale of humans

1183
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,280
naturally states emerge

1184
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,598
and so can we try to make an argument

1185
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,280
for

1186
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:27,280
anarchism which is okay

1187
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,079
okay so uh

1188
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,200
anarchy in a sense is in opposition to

1189
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,200
the

1190
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:35,439
unhelpful unproductive inefficient

1191
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:38,318
bureaucracies that eventually

1192
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,880
the states lead to yes and that's what

1193
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:42,960
we can see

1194
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:46,079
i mean i would say less anarchy let more

1195
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:51,199
study james burnham you know

1196
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,200
uh or well

1197
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,440
any anybody that wants to talk about the

1198
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,800
the managerial problem and the matter

1199
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,559
so you you have a sense i hope

1200
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,560
maybe let's think like what is the path

1201
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,759
forward with the

1202
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,519
inefficient state is it revolution or

1203
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,960
is it to work within the system to

1204
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:10,960
constantly improve it

1205
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,000
man i don't know that one i mean my

1206
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,920
general sense

1207
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,199
uh and maybe this is the nietzschean

1208
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,318
part of me is that

1209
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:20,719
yeah it'll it would take maybe not even

1210
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,318
just maybe not even defining uh it

1211
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,279
specifically as revolution maybe it

1212
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,480
would just take

1213
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,800
just total calamity to to get people to

1214
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,440
stop

1215
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,359
being shitty to not stop being a lesser

1216
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,599
version of themselves to stop

1217
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:37,358
thinking more about uh things from

1218
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,599
you know the paradigm that we exist in

1219
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:40,799
now where we're giving so much value to

1220
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,680
stuff that isn't really all that

1221
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,079
valuable

1222
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,960
you know where we're so concerned about

1223
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,318
likes

1224
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,639
and i don't just mean like whether we

1225
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,400
get them or not but that

1226
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,519
oh man maybe we should take this off of

1227
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,039
our platform because this is too

1228
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,800
destabilizing to people and it's like

1229
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:58,400
because once you exceed dunbar's number

1230
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,960
i think it's actually without having the

1231
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,318
right

1232
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,280
faculties which would need to be

1233
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:05,199
developed

1234
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,040
because this is dealing with this is

1235
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:10,078
dealing with tech that brings

1236
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:13,759
things ways of approaching being

1237
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,800
that we are not naturally

1238
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,280
programmed to be able uh to handle

1239
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,000
appropriately so and i think it's even

1240
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,400
even

1241
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,760
even more it's even more detrimental to

1242
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,720
women than men

1243
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,839
because i think uh women have a more

1244
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:32,318
natural proclivity towards

1245
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:35,440
um uh group association

1246
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:38,800
and and and more group

1247
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,318
oriented thinking and patterning and

1248
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,480
now and with also coupled with

1249
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:49,519
seemingly more sensitivity towards

1250
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,000
towards human uh states

1251
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:53,358
so i feel like women like the classic

1252
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,639
idea is like oh you know women are

1253
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:55,838
psychic you know i have a sixth sense

1254
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,879
and what have you and i think that's

1255
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,880
just a

1256
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,599
uh a way of

1257
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,599
uh simplifying what i think is that

1258
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,838
women may be more in tune with

1259
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,960
picking up on the unsaid like they might

1260
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,599
be better at seeing

1261
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,720
physical cues uh inflection and tone

1262
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,400
like different like they may

1263
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:17,759
be far more sensitive to these things

1264
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,280
which to me would make sense because

1265
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,119
dealing with

1266
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,760
children that can't uh communicate

1267
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,680
uh so so generally more understanding

1268
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,560
and all the full form right now okay

1269
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:31,838
now whether it be a woman or a man but

1270
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,639
especially

1271
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,078
with even the social uh push on this

1272
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:37,279
concept of empathy

1273
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,280
which of course it gets to the point

1274
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,000
where it loses any meaning anymore like

1275
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,079
people use the word

1276
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,159
empathy absolutely incorrectly all the

1277
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,039
time and they don't even understand

1278
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,480
what you're really asking of people but

1279
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,159
let's just take it as

1280
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,838
as we're using empathy in the correct

1281
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,159
sense and you're taking on

1282
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,279
the emotional content of the thing

1283
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,440
itself

1284
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,119
now you open that up to thousands of

1285
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,679
people maybe hundreds of thousands of

1286
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,079
people

1287
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,358
all across the world that you will never

1288
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,560
meet that you will never know that

1289
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:06,960
you're not even getting an

1290
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,078
actual true representation most of the

1291
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,960
time of who these people

1292
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,480
are you're you're meeting persona and

1293
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,599
some of these personas

1294
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:19,838
are even deliberately created

1295
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:22,400
to elicit a response inauthentically

1296
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:24,159
are you referring to bots or uh could be

1297
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,920
bots or actual people

1298
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,838
bots are one thing but i mean there are

1299
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,800
literal people out there that will

1300
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,119
create something create uh gofundmes for

1301
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,560
for

1302
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,480
tragedies that never didn't really or

1303
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,440
events that didn't happen or

1304
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,199
any number of things okay i mean burn

1305
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,400
their own house down and then say you

1306
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:41,838
know we were attacked

1307
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,160
and then it comes down you did it to

1308
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,519
yourself because you wanted money and

1309
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,000
empathy and this that and

1310
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,480
you wanted all this this emotional

1311
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,880
wealth let's say this emotional uh

1312
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,119
coin as well as actual if possible you

1313
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,519
wanted to leverage it in some way

1314
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,160
that's not the majority of people but i

1315
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,679
would say

1316
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:05,118
a good amount of folks are thinking well

1317
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:07,118
if i post this photo um

1318
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,280
and i put this little blurb in there i

1319
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,400
bet i can get this much cachet out of it

1320
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,920
in this sense

1321
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,838
and i'm not even and this isn't just a

1322
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,559
reference to like butt picks and stuff

1323
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:16,719
like that

1324
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,239
because clearly obviously people

1325
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:21,519
understand that that

1326
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:23,679
uh our inborn uh sexual nature

1327
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,880
is easy to manipulate i mean that's

1328
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,719
pretty

1329
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,318
pretty obvious but you're you're saying

1330
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:29,358
this kind of new medium of communication

1331
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,199
on social media is

1332
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,920
uh is is unnatural and it preys on us

1333
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,759
and so as

1334
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:41,200
you you want this you know you look at

1335
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,640
you look at an anarchist kind of mindset

1336
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,159
right and so you're just like

1337
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:46,719
there's no there there is no overarching

1338
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:50,399
state

1339
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:53,598
to to create any kind of

1340
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,599
uh structure right and so if you have

1341
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,318
that unfettered capitalism aspect with

1342
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,599
it

1343
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,000
and before i say anything particularly

1344
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,559
damning

1345
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,838
about unfettered capitalism uh i'm a

1346
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,400
massive capitalist

1347
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,000
because i view capitalism essentially as

1348
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,680
what it boils down to

1349
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,280
i get these arguments people too they

1350
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:13,039
they start giving me all these extra

1351
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,040
definitions about capitalism like no

1352
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,400
no this is obviously some sort of theory

1353
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,079
you're taking from other [ __ ] but that

1354
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,039
doesn't describe capitalism capitalism

1355
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,318
is

1356
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,719
the ability for us to create

1357
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,239
whatever we want you know create our

1358
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:28,399
thoughts ideas

1359
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,598
physical things and trade them freely

1360
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,720
amongst each other uh

1361
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,880
in ways that we find um

1362
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,318
acceptable right you know i'm not even

1363
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,960
using the word fair

1364
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:39,759
because i might think it's fair to me

1365
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,358
you might think

1366
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,200
huh well i mean that was actually i

1367
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:44,480
think he what he thought was unfair to

1368
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,960
him and it's more fair to me

1369
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,519
and someone a third observer goes oh man

1370
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,119
you should

1371
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,239
you should not have paid that for that

1372
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,000
you should have paid this and it's like

1373
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,559
well you know what it works for me

1374
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,079
without sufficiently acceptable you you

1375
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,119
both agreed to the transaction

1376
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,800
correct and uh you know but but

1377
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,240
also at the at the root of that is

1378
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,640
freedom right and

1379
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,078
as far as i can tell i've been banging

1380
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,879
this around in my head

1381
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,240
it's like for every one unit of freedom

1382
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,280
you need two units of

1383
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,318
accountability and if you don't have

1384
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,599
that

1385
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:17,599
what you end up with is

1386
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,039
human self-interest we're not even going

1387
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,760
to get into evil human self-interest

1388
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,880
sabotaging other things even not in a

1389
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,040
sense to be malicious

1390
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,119
okay so in terms of uh let's let's put

1391
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,239
this as mathematically speaking

1392
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,559
i love this so anarchism is more like

1393
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,239
two units of freedom and one unit of

1394
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,599
accountability or maybe zero units of

1395
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,039
accountability possibly i mean the

1396
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,720
anarchists tend to think like no

1397
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:44,800
everyone will be accountable

1398
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:45,919
[ __ ] they will when have you seen this

1399
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,119
happen in real life

1400
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,800
you know i mean people aren't even

1401
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,838
accountable in their revolutions after

1402
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,599
that time so

1403
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:56,318
uh you aren't looking at

1404
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,200
the way people really are it's like marx

1405
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:58,719
is like

1406
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,558
yeah the people are like this they're

1407
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,959
like that look at how capitalism does it

1408
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,680
i mean

1409
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,679
he of course assigns a lot of really

1410
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,318
ridiculous economic principles and

1411
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:08,879
practice

1412
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,838
uh but and also assumes that everybody

1413
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,920
you know who

1414
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:13,838
makes any profit from anything is

1415
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,599
somehow stealing it and you know

1416
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:17,119
really assigns a negative moral aspect

1417
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,039
to them and then it's like oh yeah but

1418
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,400
then eventually communism will happen

1419
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:21,199
ever no one will act that way anymore

1420
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,559
and you're like whoa

1421
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,318
hold on you just said that people are

1422
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,359
all are you saying it's

1423
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,880
all due to capitalism or it's is it

1424
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,440
innate it's just

1425
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,838
it's a fundamental misunderstanding of

1426
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,039
and it's like

1427
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:37,440
hey look at you

1428
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,400
you're like a notorious like

1429
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,920
anti-semitic

1430
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,920
angry like uh just

1431
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,000
absolute curmudgeon of a human being who

1432
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,639
seems to be really not all that fun to

1433
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,719
be around

1434
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,400
marx yeah and then it's just like so you

1435
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,799
have to think like if if there was

1436
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,519
one billion marxists in the world how

1437
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,559
would they behave

1438
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,199
it would be absolute they would hate

1439
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,559
each other

1440
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:02,399
so bad and you know this isn't for me to

1441
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,079
even poison the well on marx is like oh

1442
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,519
his personality sucks like there's lots

1443
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,599
of people whose personality sucks

1444
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,119
that doesn't mean they can't make i

1445
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,960
don't know that his name

1446
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,240
what you know what somebody argues he's

1447
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,599
just a he's a loner

1448
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,078
i mean i don't know his personality

1449
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,519
sucked at all let me walk that back and

1450
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,920
that he was human

1451
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,800
saying his personality sucked he was

1452
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,838
sometimes

1453
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:27,359
contradictory irrational sometimes

1454
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:30,880
he was uh quite sexist

1455
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:34,078
despite the emails i've gotten that uh

1456
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,720
that that's that told me that

1457
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,240
uh that there's this people was written

1458
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,639
to me that uh nietzsche has been

1459
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:44,159
unfairly labeled as sexist

1460
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:45,838
in his discussion about women i'm pretty

1461
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:46,719
sure there's a bunch of documents where

1462
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:51,199
he's just

1463
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:53,358
like he's just a bitter guy

1464
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:54,239
i i will agree with you and marx is as

1465
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:57,598
bitter as they come

1466
00:49:54,239 --> 00:50:00,639
to but um you know what bitterness

1467
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:03,599
in and of itself doesn't make like

1468
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:03,920
wha why i hate marxism comes from you

1469
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,599
know

1470
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,159
the the whole the entirety of the thing

1471
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,680
and but the dismissal of humanity but

1472
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,759
i'm not going to

1473
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:19,039
say that marxism or practical man

1474
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,720
you can find any forbidden book and

1475
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:22,719
it could have something good in it it's

1476
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,239
colonel's a good idea yeah and like

1477
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,799
at the end of the day you know marx is a

1478
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:28,879
human being he's got a nice beard

1479
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,240
he does he had a hell of a beard yeah a

1480
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,680
decent portrait i mean he looks like the

1481
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:32,879
kind of guy like

1482
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,399
i wouldn't want to meet him in a dark

1483
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,119
alley but thankfully i don't think he

1484
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,119
was much of a fighter

1485
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:40,719
but in any case i mean not the

1486
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,720
anarchists are are

1487
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:47,439
they're more hot for like uh max sterner

1488
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,039
people like to think that uh nietzsche

1489
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,358
borrowed a lot from sterner and

1490
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,199
my argument is one you don't have any

1491
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:56,239
real evidence for that and two

1492
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:59,199
[ __ ] you know i mean

1493
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:01,039
anybody could i i the fact that they

1494
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:04,639
have some overlapping thoughts

1495
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:06,800
doesn't make it uh lifted not to mention

1496
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,558
go read a lot more philosophy and see

1497
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,079
how there's so many different things

1498
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,440
oh this guy said it in uh 1722

1499
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,839
well and then this guy says that again

1500
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,760
in 1922. does that mean he read the

1501
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:21,199
other guy's stuff not necessarily i mean

1502
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,440
he's working from the same type of human

1503
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:24,239
physiological construct as anybody else

1504
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,599
like

1505
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:27,199
of course it's possible this guy could

1506
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,160
think the same thing we we think a lot

1507
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,639
of the same things

1508
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,480
to be perfectly honest i mean reading

1509
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:33,440
the hagakure going back to philosophy

1510
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,119
books

1511
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,119
this was really impactful on me as a

1512
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,480
younger adult because

1513
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,039
here's a book written in the 19th

1514
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,599
century about someone who lived through

1515
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,279
the 19th and 18th century at times as a

1516
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,838
samurai now a monk

1517
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,720
and his objections to society at the

1518
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,558
time

1519
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,759
the same objections one was having to

1520
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,480
society

1521
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,079
as i was reading it like the same human

1522
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,119
behaviors the same

1523
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:03,359
uh impetus for action

1524
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,280
that he found a problem

1525
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:07,119
like well that's the same that's the

1526
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,359
same [ __ ] now

1527
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,680
like we're not and this is the thing and

1528
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:14,400
then i'm reading more religion i go oh

1529
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,199
we're no different than anyone who wrote

1530
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,599
the torah

1531
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,759
or older we are the same thing with the

1532
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,920
same problems with the same

1533
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,680
uh psychological issues the same human

1534
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,920
behaviors like these things are not

1535
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,000
different yeah and we haven't changed

1536
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,280
growing set of tools though to

1537
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,719
to kill each other with or to

1538
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,480
communicate together and all that kind

1539
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,159
of stuff but underlying it

1540
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,519
there's a human nature well we're also

1541
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:36,558
trying to understand that human nature i

1542
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,318
think we've

1543
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,920
just like you said learning how to fish

1544
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:41,358
acquired more and more knowledge about

1545
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,079
that human nature

1546
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,759
uh but it's been a very slow journey

1547
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,480
it's slower than people realize

1548
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,880
yes in terms of understanding uh human

1549
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,280
nature

1550
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,559
let me ask in terms of egoism to be

1551
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,640
curious

1552
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:59,599
uh to get your sons about ayn rand

1553
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,799
and um her whole idea of virtue of like

1554
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,880
selfishness sure

1555
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,640
and her because you mentioned that

1556
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,358
everybody has

1557
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:09,039
a kernel of truth there there's

1558
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:10,159
potential for a colonel truth to be

1559
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:13,119
discovered in

1560
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:16,078
anything for example i've been recently

1561
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,880
reading mineconf

1562
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,839
you know what that's the thing even

1563
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,800
there's something

1564
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,920
in there's probably things in mineconf

1565
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,240
that are

1566
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,559
not the surface level read if you get

1567
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:29,358
all hung up on on all probably all his

1568
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,880
crap about

1569
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:34,400
uh you know his anger anger at jews and

1570
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,079
this and that all this crap it's like

1571
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,680
okay yeah that that's right on the

1572
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,400
surface

1573
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,318
try to get below that try to see you

1574
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,240
know how is he how is he creating the

1575
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:44,960
jews as a cope somehow like how is he

1576
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:47,039
using why

1577
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,039
why are they his his scapegoat and i

1578
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:51,358
mean scapegoat in the

1579
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:52,239
so randy gerard's uh concept of the

1580
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:54,719
scapegoat i mean

1581
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,598
in that sense whereas uh you know hitler

1582
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:58,159
uses

1583
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,880
it wants to make the the jews the

1584
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:01,118
scapegoat

1585
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,920
for world war one yeah i mean for me the

1586
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,720
starting point

1587
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,559
similar with ann rand is uh like

1588
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:08,639
mineconf is not a good

1589
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,599
place to search not just because

1590
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,318
hitler's evil

1591
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,359
but it's just not full of ideas no it is

1592
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:16,000
not

1593
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:17,039
it has its significance due to a lot of

1594
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,280
historically speaking

1595
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,400
but the starting point for me with

1596
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,240
hitler is like

1597
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,920
to acknowledge that he's human and

1598
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:27,439
to at least consider the possibility

1599
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,240
that any one of us could have been

1600
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,960
hitler

1601
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:32,000
so like that not that peterson kind of

1602
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,800
concept also

1603
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,639
um jonathan height has a thing about uh

1604
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,640
the difference between

1605
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:40,480
hate and disgust mechanisms and things

1606
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,199
like that and so he used he

1607
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,599
goes into the looking at uh hitler and

1608
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,519
his

1609
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,280
through his his diary entries and

1610
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,440
journals and stuff like that to look

1611
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,359
uh and see it more as the the discuss

1612
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,400
mechanism then also try and see like if

1613
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,679
there's any

1614
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,559
evolutionary biological uh attachment to

1615
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,279
this whatever

1616
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,079
i mean you're right he is a human being

1617
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:06,240
any of us

1618
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:07,920
are we're all human beings it's not that

1619
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,078
probably jarring for people to think but

1620
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,039
we're

1621
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,798
we're all i guess supposed potentially

1622
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:17,039
capable of just being in

1623
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:19,039
and all these evil people in the world

1624
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,920
think they're doing it for the sake

1625
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,719
of good yeah which makes them the most

1626
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,559
dangerous

1627
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:26,399
and there's some there's differences in

1628
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,400
levels of insane

1629
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,400
i think hitler was way more insane than

1630
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,039
stalin i think stalin legitimately

1631
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,720
thought he was

1632
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:38,239
being doing good i would say that's

1633
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:41,279
probably true stalin it was just

1634
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,719
outright brutal like yeah he had he had

1635
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,839
his five-year plan he had all those

1636
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:45,838
other things uh

1637
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:47,039
he's just had a much lower value for

1638
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:49,119
human life yes

1639
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:51,358
and so he was willing to take make

1640
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,798
decisions about what he actually

1641
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:57,519
as a as a good executive of

1642
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,280
which he was of managing different uh

1643
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:01,679
bureaucracies and so on

1644
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,559
he was willing to make decisions that

1645
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:06,798
resulted in

1646
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:10,079
mass human suffering where hitler was

1647
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:12,318
it seems like to me what much moodier so

1648
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,119
allowed emotions and moves to make his

1649
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:17,759
decisions we also have to consider

1650
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,798
the different trajectories and how where

1651
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,000
and when they were making their

1652
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:22,000
decisions and i mean

1653
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,358
not by time specifically but you know

1654
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,199
hitler engaged into this

1655
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:30,480
this conflict across multiple continents

1656
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:33,838
and then that everything that comes with

1657
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:37,358
basically fighting the whole world

1658
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:40,558
stalin had his conflict and then

1659
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,598
he really mostly compartmentalized the

1660
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,519
rest of it

1661
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,119
so he was dealing with his own internal

1662
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,318
instead of dealing with the internal and

1663
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,400
the external

1664
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:49,838
so if stalin was put under a world war

1665
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,000
scenario i don't know maybe he would

1666
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:54,400
have eventually lost his marbles too

1667
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,719
yeah i'm not sure that you that's you're

1668
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,720
right the hunger for power

1669
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,558
was more internalized for stalin he

1670
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,000
wanted to control the land that already

1671
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,680
existed as opposed to wanting to

1672
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,039
colonize other lands he was

1673
00:57:03,679 --> 00:57:11,838
as nationalistic as hitler but uh

1674
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:14,239
and was as capable and willing for

1675
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:15,199
violent conflict as hitler for than the

1676
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,239
aims of

1677
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:21,439
the state but

1678
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:24,479
he he he centered and

1679
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,798
internalized prior to then

1680
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,880
externalizing and moving outwards

1681
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:30,079
whereas even maybe prior to him there

1682
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,400
was an interest to

1683
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,760
continually push communism in an

1684
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,440
aggressive sense following on the

1685
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,839
momentum from the

1686
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:42,079
the 1918 revolution and

1687
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:44,798
that the halting of that uh

1688
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,240
through various aspects i guess in

1689
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:48,239
germany part of that was

1690
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,679
the the national socialist like they

1691
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:51,039
they came up and then they were the

1692
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:52,798
other ones to fight the communists and

1693
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:54,079
so you had the two totalitarians going

1694
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:55,920
after it

1695
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,839
but then in the rest of the world that

1696
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,880
was not dealing with

1697
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,798
um totalitarian aspects

1698
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,720
it was just it wasn't going to stick

1699
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:06,079
especially in the west and other places

1700
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,558
but

1701
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,720
stalin see just you know casually

1702
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,240
thinking it seemed like stalin

1703
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:14,159
decided to go all right well we're not

1704
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,239
gonna go just start launching right into

1705
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,598
more conflicts here we're gonna these

1706
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:19,598
dudes are going down so

1707
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,960
that's cool for us because they hate us

1708
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:24,318
and we hate them

1709
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,880
um but now we're gonna we're gonna focus

1710
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:28,639
internally and then we're gonna work on

1711
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,400
growing at a slower rate and picking our

1712
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:31,519
battles a bit more specifically and of

1713
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,440
course there's

1714
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:35,199
you know you can get to the even this is

1715
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,960
after stalin but yeah you got the

1716
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:37,759
besmanov type stuff talking about

1717
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,199
subversion

1718
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,520
in in cultural aspects yeah i mean

1719
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:43,439
there's

1720
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,280
this fascinating dynamics to propaganda

1721
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,119
throughout that that's

1722
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,319
that's a whole nother colonel yeah do

1723
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,318
you think

1724
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:52,558
hitler could have been stopped one of

1725
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:56,159
the things that's kind of fascinating to

1726
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:58,798
look at is how many nations

1727
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:59,199
both journalists and nations wanted

1728
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:01,199
almost

1729
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,480
crave to take hitler's word that he

1730
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:05,679
wanted peace

1731
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,480
until it was too late they almost wanted

1732
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:09,039
to be

1733
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,079
deluded themselves i mean the same is

1734
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:12,480
true with

1735
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,920
this stalin uh people wanted to take

1736
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,440
stalin at his word for

1737
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,519
they'll delude themselves yeah that way

1738
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,838
we will do we we will delude ourselves

1739
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:21,679
over any number of things

1740
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:24,159
and until even after the fact where the

1741
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,639
history just says hey [ __ ] face

1742
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:28,000
you know you you cannot supplement your

1743
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:31,279
pseudo-reality onto

1744
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,280
actual reality here anymore but yet

1745
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,280
we deal with people in pseudo-realities

1746
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,160
constantly it i mean it

1747
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,599
we will always find a way to to change

1748
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:41,199
reality to suit our

1749
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,039
needs well the nature of truth now

1750
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:45,759
there's now multiple actual truths it's

1751
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:47,199
kind of fascinating there's multiple

1752
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,280
versions of history that people are

1753
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:51,439
telling you know the the version

1754
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,680
the version of the the the great

1755
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,639
patriotic war in russia the world war ii

1756
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:57,039
and russia

1757
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:58,318
is very different today under putin than

1758
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:01,119
the version that we're

1759
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:02,239
learning on uh in the united states and

1760
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,079
then different than the version in

1761
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,798
europe in the united states

1762
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,599
uh the the hero of the war is the united

1763
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,719
states

1764
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:13,200
in europe there's a much more sad and

1765
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:14,159
solemn story of suffering and so on sure

1766
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,358
and in russia

1767
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,558
it's the great patriotic war yes it was

1768
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:23,279
a unifier

1769
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:26,400
of a sense and it i mean

1770
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:29,119
yeah i mean you can't argue that

1771
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,599
war and conflict that and or are just

1772
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,880
even

1773
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,838
um reducing that to stressors agitation

1774
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,400
suffering

1775
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,000
doesn't um create human motivation you

1776
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,400
know we started this off you brought up

1777
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,280
frankel and i'm like yeah frankel's dope

1778
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:46,240
answers for meaning uh maslow's great

1779
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,640
and and i talked to you about how i

1780
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:52,078
started to think like man

1781
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:54,879
do the ability for human beings to to

1782
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,200
to live and or potentially flourish in

1783
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,079
the

1784
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,838
worst environments you can think of is

1785
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,960
pretty incredible in and of itself

1786
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:06,159
and that it's a crazy thought

1787
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:09,280
to think that without frankel

1788
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:10,078
and maslow ending up in concentration

1789
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,440
camps

1790
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:16,079
do they write some of the most important

1791
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,440
books on philosophy in the 20th century

1792
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,880
and that's

1793
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,720
insane on a lot of different levels but

1794
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,039
suffering is a creative force i mean i

1795
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:28,239
don't do you think we'll always have war

1796
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:28,798
yes we will always have war in some form

1797
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:31,919
or another

1798
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:34,239
we we need quote unquote

1799
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,960
air quotes for those just listening uh

1800
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:37,358
war

1801
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,440
to survive we need war to flourish we

1802
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,400
need at least can you explain the quote

1803
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,838
of the air quotes

1804
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,838
well because uh take

1805
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,199
take take take wars as violence no

1806
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,240
violence so like so we're talking quotes

1807
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:52,159
because uh well

1808
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:53,519
you know what us getting on the mat or

1809
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:54,480
just getting on these hardwood floors

1810
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:57,599
and wrestling around

1811
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,599
yeah is not literal war it's war

1812
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,720
of a sort you know work you know it is

1813
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,720
it is a deluded

1814
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:04,480
form of war american football is a

1815
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:06,879
diluted form of war all this these are

1816
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,159
diluted forms of war tennis is a deluded

1817
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,358
form of war

1818
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:12,879
um and i think the

1819
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:15,038
one of the best explanations i ever got

1820
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,720
from this and another person very

1821
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:20,480
uh impactful on my life and outlook and

1822
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:23,118
thinking about things cormac mccarthy

1823
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:26,318
and so in blood meridian there's this

1824
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:28,160
fantastic speech about war given by the

1825
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:28,798
judge which there's a ton of fantastic

1826
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:31,199
speeches

1827
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,639
on things given by the judge yeah all

1828
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,719
that existing creation without my

1829
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:37,358
knowledge does so without my consent

1830
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:37,919
okay that's pretty heavy that's that's

1831
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:39,358
hard

1832
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,920
dory can you break that up can you say

1833
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,239
it again uh all things that exist

1834
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,838
and creation all things that exist

1835
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:49,358
without my knowledge do so without my

1836
01:02:46,838 --> 01:02:52,078
consent

1837
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:52,880
what does that mean well i think from

1838
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,559
the judge's

1839
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,400
perspective it's like well i didn't

1840
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,680
consent to to that bird

1841
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,798
or that dog or this building or all this

1842
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,480
like all of this

1843
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:04,400
you know i didn't create it so it's done

1844
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,679
so without my consent and if it's up to

1845
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,838
my consent

1846
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:09,440
well i'll design it how i want to

1847
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:11,119
there's a another similar

1848
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,519
uh look into how the judge is in that

1849
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,280
book is he would

1850
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:20,000
study everything everywhere he went

1851
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,680
and so he's collected this group of

1852
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,960
nerdy wells from all over

1853
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:27,919
to go on these hunts uh

1854
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,760
against uh certain tribes in in the

1855
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,119
southwest

1856
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,319
and getting paid by the us government

1857
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:37,358
the mexican government so

1858
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:38,639
he's on these indian hunts and

1859
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:41,358
yet they're going to all these different

1860
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:43,199
places and

1861
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:44,480
they would stay the night in a cave

1862
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:46,000
somewhere and he would find cave

1863
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,159
paintings he would write them all down

1864
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,280
or he would find old pieces there's an

1865
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:51,920
example of him

1866
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,400
the narrator uh explaining how watching

1867
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,240
the judge

1868
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,519
and how he drawing everything he's got

1869
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:58,798
his notebook just full

1870
01:03:55,519 --> 01:04:01,920
of things drawings and writings

1871
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:03,519
and how he found like a piece of armor

1872
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,798
from a conquistador or something way

1873
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:06,480
back in the day of spanish armor and he

1874
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:09,679
draws it into his his book

1875
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,798
and then crushes it so that so

1876
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:14,480
the reason we'll always have war in this

1877
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:17,440
society is because there's this

1878
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,480
struggle of amongst people that want to

1879
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,880
be the designers

1880
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,838
there's there's that but it's i'm just

1881
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,000
saying that uh

1882
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,199
he's got this whole quote on war like

1883
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,798
war is about is

1884
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:30,558
is play war is a game and the difference

1885
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:33,759
is is that what's at stake

1886
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:34,319
so all things are a game of some sort

1887
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,839
and some

1888
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:37,199
you're putting up for it or what you're

1889
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:38,480
willing to put up for it determines

1890
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:42,000
whether or not you're going to

1891
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,838
participate or not and you know all

1892
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,039
aspects of

1893
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:48,480
any game is war and it's just

1894
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,319
what is at stake you know if it's your

1895
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,039
life it's a different story if it's just

1896
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:53,279
a coin

1897
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,200
it's another thing a nice way to put it

1898
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,720
is uh humans

1899
01:04:55,199 --> 01:05:02,558
play a game in this kind of pursuit of

1900
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:03,838
uh creating whatever the hell the reason

1901
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,680
is that we keep creating cooler and

1902
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:08,480
cooler things

1903
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:10,159
that that it seems to be the result of a

1904
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,280
game that would naturally play it would

1905
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:13,279
naturally crave

1906
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,559
i don't know i mean that's been the

1907
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,079
struggle of philosophy

1908
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,240
it's to understand what is the

1909
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,079
underlying force of all that is it the

1910
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:22,000
will to power is it i think will to

1911
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,839
power is a really great way of

1912
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,519
of describing it do you want to be the

1913
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:27,279
winner of the game

1914
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:29,119
no not just nah i don't look at wilt

1915
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,960
powers being the winner of the game

1916
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,240
well i mean if we're going to get

1917
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,358
philosophical yes you want to be the

1918
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:35,519
winner of the game

1919
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:37,279
what does winning the game define how

1920
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:38,318
you win everybody's going to define that

1921
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,760
win differently

1922
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:41,519
you know you could define the win in the

1923
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,839
most base level like oh i got all the

1924
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:45,838
things

1925
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:48,480
well if you got all those things without

1926
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:49,838
the the needing component of fulfillment

1927
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,358
then you're going to be a very unhappy

1928
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:53,199
person with a whole lot of things

1929
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:54,719
there's a self-referential aspect to

1930
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,798
where to me

1931
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:58,480
the winner of the game is defined by the

1932
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:02,079
people playing the game

1933
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:05,119
so if i'm playing a game

1934
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:06,559
i want to win in the sense that most of

1935
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,798
the other people who are playing the

1936
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:11,359
game will say yeah that guy won

1937
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,199
by their by our collective definition if

1938
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:14,719
i just come up listen i'm sort of

1939
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:17,439
if i come out that's a lot of that's a

1940
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:20,239
lot of weight on the external on you

1941
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,960
right but that's that's how games seem

1942
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:23,679
to work

1943
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,679
somewhat so i'm already a winner in my

1944
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:28,798
life by defining my own different

1945
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:29,838
success i'm i'm basically the best

1946
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,880
person in the world

1947
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:35,119
at doing uh uh me at being lex

1948
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,960
yeah so like and now i'm really happy

1949
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,798
with that that's that's the source of uh

1950
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,440
well i mean think about it games are

1951
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:42,400
also iterated right so you you start off

1952
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,639
with your game

1953
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,559
yeah and then your game with your

1954
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:47,920
immediates and then the game further

1955
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,119
than that the game further than that and

1956
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,760
then the game today and the game

1957
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,920
tomorrow

1958
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,039
and the game next week and so it never

1959
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,480
ends and

1960
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,119
if you try to keep thinking about it

1961
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,639
that way no wonder people go crazy but

1962
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:00,240
we we don't want to think about things

1963
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,759
that way we don't want to think about

1964
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:03,598
uh being towards death we don't want to

1965
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:06,000
think about um

1966
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,519
whether or not i'm going anywhere after

1967
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,559
this other than in the ground or what

1968
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,038
have you like

1969
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:12,880
you know all of these games are sense

1970
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,960
some distraction this is where we

1971
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,318
kind of but i mean it's violence is that

1972
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,760
um we

1973
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:22,639
need to let this out and so

1974
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,039
it is of our kids need a wrestle and

1975
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,400
play

1976
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,640
just like animals need to wrestle and

1977
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,720
play we need to have forms of

1978
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:29,679
competition we need to have ways to to

1979
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:32,879
test ourselves

1980
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:35,038
to create uh when

1981
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,720
uh what is it uh when at peace a man of

1982
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,599
war makes war with himself

1983
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:41,439
and so we need to be able to competently

1984
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,280
go at war with ourselves and go at war

1985
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,240
with our neighbor and go at war with our

1986
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,720
neighbor's neighbor

1987
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:47,679
in a way that is repeatable at the very

1988
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:49,759
least

1989
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:51,759
so one one way of saying that there will

1990
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,520
always be war i mean that's my

1991
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:57,440
hopeful view is that most of the work

1992
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:57,838
conducted in the future will be like you

1993
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,400
said

1994
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:01,279
the man must go to war with himself that

1995
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,480
would be great

1996
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:06,319
that that's that's what to me love is

1997
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,679
is like focusing on yourself and your

1998
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:10,480
own improvement

1999
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:11,279
and your own creativity and towards

2000
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,318
others

2001
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:17,920
feeling uh sort of emphasizing

2002
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:19,838
cooperative behavior and compassion and

2003
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,640
would be great empathy it would be great

2004
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,079
but i mean you can have

2005
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,319
well i'll put it to you this way if you

2006
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:29,519
have

2007
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:32,560
uh a whole community of randians

2008
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:36,080
and a whole community of ancoms

2009
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:38,880
and they could all like uh

2010
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:40,719
i don't know uh toast of london on

2011
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,759
netflix and they love netflix and they

2012
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:45,039
love the internet

2013
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:47,119
and they love uh

2014
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:48,560
picking apart moncomp with you they love

2015
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:51,039
like they like all these

2016
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,080
things even the esoteric that they can

2017
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:55,600
they can they can get on

2018
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:58,079
with but at the at the fundamental route

2019
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,759
they cannot help but go to war because

2020
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:01,838
they are literally oil and water

2021
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,960
no the perceived but they would the

2022
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:06,158
various

2023
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:08,158
labels they assigned to themselves would

2024
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:09,679
need to dissipate well this is really

2025
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,358
well then you would have to stop being

2026
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,520
whatever it is that you took on as your

2027
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:16,000
ideological or religious

2028
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,279
point right yeah i mean i there's some

2029
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,158
days i'm uh

2030
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,920
and calm some days i'm an end caps and

2031
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:24,479
uh

2032
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:26,560
whatever the uh an arctic uh naked

2033
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,318
capital i mean there's it depends on the

2034
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,319
the hour the minute of the day you're

2035
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,719
constantly changing moods and embracing

2036
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:34,239
that

2037
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:36,158
flow the change of opinions of ideas

2038
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:37,599
as there's some days like i'm actually

2039
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,119
cognizant of the fact because i've been

2040
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,480
not getting my sleep

2041
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:44,158
and after i get some sleep i see i'm so

2042
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,559
much more optimistic about the world

2043
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:48,960
the less and less sleep i get the more

2044
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:52,080
sad cynical i guess you can see that

2045
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,640
up and down i don't even let my well

2046
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:54,880
okay

2047
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,239
i try not to let and most days it's

2048
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,760
never a problem

2049
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:02,079
any sort of like uh what are the kids

2050
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:06,320
call it now black-pilled way of thinking

2051
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:10,079
be my my my over my the umbrella which i

2052
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:11,840
hang under so we actually uh to drag us

2053
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:14,840
back

2054
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:17,840
can we talk about carl gotch and cat

2055
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,840
tressley

2056
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,600
uh is he the greatest catch wrestler i

2057
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:27,520
don't know if he was the greatest

2058
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,800
catch wrestler ever i don't i don't i

2059
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:34,400
mean he's one of them for a myriad of

2060
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:38,320
carl gotch uh billy robinson

2061
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:41,198
uh gotcha robinson's trainer billy riley

2062
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:41,439
um so who are these figures and what do

2063
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:43,439
they

2064
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:44,479
mean he's one of the greatest catch

2065
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,919
wrestlers ever

2066
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,479
because he's responsible for brazilian

2067
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:51,199
jiu jitsu right along with gustav gracie

2068
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:53,119
okay there's a bunch of things i'd like

2069
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:56,238
to say here but one of the things

2070
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:59,359
that catch wrestling seem to espouse as

2071
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:02,079
a principle is that of violence i i just

2072
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:04,319
the the termites i competed at uh the

2073
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:06,238
unfortunate thing and we'll probably

2074
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:08,000
hopefully talk about a little bit they

2075
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:09,599
were disorganized

2076
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,039
and the level of competition was pretty

2077
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,840
low people really sucked

2078
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:15,198
pretty typical is that typical okay well

2079
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,640
it's it's i mean think about

2080
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:22,000
um you know local run-of-the-mill

2081
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:24,960
yes uh jiu-jitsu tournament versus ibjf

2082
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,439
created you know a vast difference so so

2083
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,079
i

2084
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,439
you know but there is a to me as a human

2085
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:31,760
being

2086
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:33,359
that like intellectually philosophically

2087
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,360
it was more interesting to go to catch

2088
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:38,158
wrestling tournament it seemed

2089
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:39,759
more real and honest because of the way

2090
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:42,799
they communicate about violence

2091
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:45,119
i love aggression it is it is often

2092
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,960
uh more honest i think that who is that

2093
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:48,000
from does that originate from gosh and

2094
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,520
then

2095
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,359
well i mean it originates from all

2096
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,970
wrestling in that uh

2097
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:55,359
even wait wait chalice not a

2098
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:58,880
[Music]

2099
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:59,599
not a classically considered catch

2100
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,159
wrestler

2101
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,880
yet the reason why he has the world

2102
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:05,519
record for

2103
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,760
most amount of world champions pinned or

2104
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,640
the record for pins in the ncaa

2105
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:12,239
is because well of course the idea is to

2106
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,560
put you on your back and opinion but

2107
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:13,839
you're

2108
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,560
there's no way you're gonna let me do

2109
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,440
that uh so

2110
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,320
how do i make it so that you want me to

2111
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:21,839
pin you well

2112
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,158
it's by you put them in excruciating

2113
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:27,199
pain yeah so

2114
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:29,519
at the end of the day you're both there

2115
01:12:27,198 --> 01:12:30,238
you both want to win neither one wants

2116
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,640
to allow

2117
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:34,799
anything to the other yeah so how do i

2118
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,760
how do i get you

2119
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,520
to lose to me i make it so unbearable

2120
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,280
for you that you decide losing is better

2121
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,880
than staying so those are two those two

2122
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,279
are so fascinating because

2123
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,400
so coming from russia i don't know if

2124
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,599
that's where i got it

2125
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:50,079
or if it's just my own predisposition is

2126
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,760
i always

2127
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:55,679
love the there's two ways to get you to

2128
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,400
want to pin yourself

2129
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:00,000
one is to making it so painful not to

2130
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:00,879
pin yourself that you pin yourself or

2131
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,279
whatever

2132
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,960
and the other is it's sort of like uh

2133
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:07,759
bruce lee water flows

2134
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,560
make it so easy to pin yourself so it's

2135
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,400
technique

2136
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:14,719
it's like the elegance the ease of

2137
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:14,719
movement this is the uh satia brothers

2138
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,960
uh like the just

2139
01:13:22,609 --> 01:13:25,719
[Music]

2140
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,279
russians are quite truthful

2141
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,279
about things uh especially when it comes

2142
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,198
to something like combat they just

2143
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:42,639
this is how it is yeah and this is how

2144
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:45,039
it's going to be it's honest

2145
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,440
yes and honesty is what i really like

2146
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:48,719
about uh catch wrestling because i find

2147
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:50,158
that we

2148
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,399
given any opportunity for us to be

2149
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:53,679
dishonest for any number of reasons

2150
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:56,319
we're gonna

2151
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,039
especially if it's a dishonesty towards

2152
01:13:56,319 --> 01:13:58,639
a positive

2153
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:00,238
right like oh well you know it's all

2154
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,320
technique and it's all this and it's the

2155
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:05,599
gentle art and blah

2156
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:06,479
bro i have rolled with 80cc world

2157
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,840
champions

2158
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:10,879
you know some of the best you have ever

2159
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,480
heard of varying a lot of gentleness

2160
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,000
when it comes to like oh yeah they

2161
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:16,959
wanted to sweep you and you said

2162
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,479
no and then you did said no again yeah

2163
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,119
and then you said no and attacked their

2164
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:21,599
leg

2165
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:22,158
yeah it ceases to be all that gentle

2166
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,000
because

2167
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:25,839
at the end of the day these dudes are

2168
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,359
strong as hell they're flexible they're

2169
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,279
all i mean they're

2170
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:31,119
the difference between the athleticism

2171
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:34,319
and and the

2172
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:35,039
the ability to actually win is a pretty

2173
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:37,359
wide gap

2174
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:39,279
the athleticism shows up but then

2175
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:41,839
there's all that other extra

2176
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:42,399
and part of that is meanness and and

2177
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,279
pain

2178
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:47,439
and uh getting what you need out of it

2179
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:48,880
but see there is a philosophical

2180
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:50,719
difference in the way it's thought

2181
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,239
because

2182
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,399
i think some of it is just they just in

2183
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:56,079
denial like oh people will

2184
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:57,439
they like to people like to espouse a

2185
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:58,880
lot of things as theory

2186
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:00,399
and then it's like okay let me watch

2187
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,920
when they're oh you're not doing

2188
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:03,759
anything about what you said right now

2189
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,158
in fact you're doing the opposite you're

2190
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,360
you're

2191
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:09,839
literally hurting that guy because you

2192
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:11,519
your [ __ ] ain't working in the way that

2193
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,560
you'd like it to so you're having to use

2194
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,760
strength you're having

2195
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,960
one of my favorites like oh you're using

2196
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,159
too much strength and it's like well

2197
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,158
hold on

2198
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:19,679
do we want people not to use strength at

2199
01:15:18,158 --> 01:15:21,119
this point to understand more of

2200
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,560
mechanics

2201
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,399
or are you trying to tell people if they

2202
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,320
use strength at all

2203
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:27,439
uh that they're somehow bad at what they

2204
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:28,719
do because you know

2205
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,559
it's not my fault you're not stronger

2206
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:33,279
than me i'm speaking to something else

2207
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,320
that's uh that's i tend to think what it

2208
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,479
comes down to is like

2209
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:37,679
strength is fine until you beat me with

2210
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:39,599
it

2211
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,119
then it sucks okay so strength is

2212
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,039
another thing

2213
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:44,479
i'm speaking i'm thinking about more

2214
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:46,960
like anger

2215
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:48,718
oh sure okay so like a lot of angry guys

2216
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:51,600
in jiu jitsu i know that

2217
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,960
really okay okay but let's talk about

2218
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,520
let's talk about they're only human the

2219
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,600
highest

2220
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,800
level of competition there's a book

2221
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,880
called wrestling tough

2222
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,360
yeah this is a really good book there's

2223
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:03,840
i've encountered in my life a few

2224
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,359
uh especially in wrestling people who

2225
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,039
really tried to find

2226
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:10,158
a way to use anger to get really angry

2227
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:12,560
at their opponent

2228
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:13,279
not like stupid anger but just like

2229
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,039
intense

2230
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:19,439
pointed uh anger uh

2231
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:20,079
distilled into something uh that you can

2232
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:22,479
use yeah

2233
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:23,679
fuel and like i remember the story i

2234
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:24,639
don't know where i read it might be

2235
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,199
wrestling tough

2236
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,159
where a person was imagining that their

2237
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:30,799
opponent

2238
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,559
just raped their mother raped their uh

2239
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,400
girlfriend or something like that to

2240
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,000
to create this like method acting thing

2241
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:38,079
in their head to be like

2242
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,119
to to snap them out of this polite

2243
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:42,719
interaction of

2244
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:43,198
the usual like athletic convention and

2245
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,399
like

2246
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:50,399
you know really design of necessity

2247
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:53,679
so my anecdote for this was

2248
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:54,399
i was sitting with uh backstage before a

2249
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,800
fight

2250
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:58,719
not my fight and i'm i'm working with

2251
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,719
this guy and this dude is

2252
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,800
this is a this is the world champion guy

2253
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:08,158
uh and he competed at the highest levels

2254
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,159
uh and he he looks at me and he goes

2255
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:12,799
you know you ever get nervous before

2256
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:15,439
fights i looked at him and i went

2257
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,480
no i don't and he just looks at me he's

2258
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:18,319
like [ __ ] man

2259
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:19,678
i'm sorry you know how do you do it man

2260
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:21,359
well you know i wish i could be like you

2261
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,119
and i said you know what

2262
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:24,799
that doesn't mean that what i'm doing is

2263
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:27,279
better it's just what

2264
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:29,360
is necessary for me it's the way i am

2265
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:30,800
and i told him

2266
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:32,719
so this anecdote goes into another

2267
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,880
anecdote this is a family guy episode i

2268
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,880
guess

2269
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:40,880
where some uh another famous high-level

2270
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:43,679
guy told me about

2271
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,640
this experience with a world champion

2272
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,000
boxer

2273
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,560
in japan and this guy would get insanely

2274
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,800
nervous

2275
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,880
and worked up and anxious before his

2276
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,880
matches and he hated it and hated it and

2277
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,480
hated it and so he wanted to

2278
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,480
get rid of that feeling so he went to a

2279
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:01,599
hypnotist for a bunch of sessions

2280
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:02,959
and managed to and he goes in and the

2281
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,280
next fight he

2282
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,158
cools a cucumber and doesn't perform and

2283
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:08,639
loses

2284
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:09,920
and so what i said going back to

2285
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,440
anecdote one

2286
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:14,319
was uh you know whatever is necessary

2287
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,119
for you

2288
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:17,599
to get yourself in the best state of

2289
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:19,760
being

2290
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:22,239
right now to compete whatever that may

2291
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,159
be it could be

2292
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:26,079
absolute stress and fear it could be

2293
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,639
anger it could be calmness it could be

2294
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:28,880
whatever

2295
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,800
but there is a so brilliant but there is

2296
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,719
a a

2297
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,239
there's a state at which you need to be

2298
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,158
in to do your best

2299
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:38,639
and use the individual you have to find

2300
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:41,679
that can you comment on

2301
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,640
uh uh tyson mike tyson oh yeah that

2302
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,800
thing

2303
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,840
so first so he uh there's two things i

2304
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,560
wanna so he's a

2305
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,159
in terms of fear there's a clip there i

2306
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,840
think from a documentary where he talks

2307
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,399
about he is

2308
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,840
like fully afraid as he walks up to the

2309
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:57,599
ring and as he gets closer and closer

2310
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,760
and closer he gets more confident

2311
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,960
until he gets in and then he's a god or

2312
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,480
something like that

2313
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:08,399
that coupled with his statement on joe

2314
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:11,039
rogan that he gets aroused uh

2315
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:12,639
at the possibility of true like of

2316
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:15,039
hurting somebody in the ring

2317
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,480
so like he gets aroused at the violence

2318
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:19,279
yeah uh

2319
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:21,519
i like it because it's coupled to your

2320
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:25,359
basically statement that we need to own

2321
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:28,800
to find our own unique way of

2322
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:30,319
existing at our top level of performance

2323
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,239
and that perhaps is mike tyson but do

2324
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:34,238
you think there's something more deeply

2325
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:35,839
universal to the

2326
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:37,359
mike tyson speaking to the fact that

2327
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:37,679
he's aroused that the possibility of

2328
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:39,439
that

2329
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:41,760
i do actually uh although i don't think

2330
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:43,039
that it always equates to arousal

2331
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,039
for people in fact i would say in

2332
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:46,640
general it doesn't yes uh

2333
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:48,640
i can say i've never had a boner in the

2334
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,079
ring in fact of anything you know old

2335
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,679
combat [ __ ] is like

2336
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:53,439
we're not hanging around we're leaving

2337
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,480
we're going up yeah we're taking off

2338
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:56,319
yeah we don't want anything to do with

2339
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:57,678
this yes you have fun come back to us

2340
01:19:56,319 --> 01:20:00,960
when you have something

2341
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:04,800
warmer softer smells better yeah but

2342
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:07,359
the power the feeling of aliveness

2343
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,639
yeah i could see it it being you know

2344
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:10,559
back to the even the concept of the

2345
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,400
ubermensch i feel like

2346
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,080
the states the highest states of being

2347
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:16,399
i've ever been in were in

2348
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:18,158
the midst of conflict i felt like that

2349
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:19,920
was the times those are the those are

2350
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:22,879
the moments in my life where i felt like

2351
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,920
i was at the highest level of being as a

2352
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,039
human

2353
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,760
in existence but yet even being in that

2354
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:30,238
state

2355
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,840
was not it was not something that you

2356
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:33,119
could interact with people that weren't

2357
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,560
in that state with you like they

2358
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:36,319
wouldn't get it you would almost seem

2359
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:39,600
and to be that way all the time

2360
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:41,359
either a might drive you mad or b is

2361
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,120
you're not you're something that's

2362
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:44,079
untenable to the rest of society like

2363
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:46,000
you can't

2364
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,519
function with everybody else it will not

2365
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,039
work it's just like you said with the

2366
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,719
ubermensch it's like it's

2367
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:52,800
perhaps that ideal is not something you

2368
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,520
can hold for long that's the the very

2369
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,279
nature of it

2370
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,040
yeah well there was an example in the

2371
01:20:55,279 --> 01:21:00,719
spoke zarathustra about

2372
01:20:57,039 --> 01:21:04,319
a snake being down the person's throat

2373
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:06,000
and biting it and then having this

2374
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:09,439
maniacal laughter

2375
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:12,800
erupting and you know to me it was

2376
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:14,559
at least i read it as yeah okay there's

2377
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,600
this insane

2378
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:20,239
moment that isn't forever but that it is

2379
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,440
life and death and it is and and the

2380
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:23,678
overcoming it

2381
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:24,559
is the thing that all of a sudden gives

2382
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,719
you

2383
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,840
that tapping into the your your highest

2384
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:32,000
state right this is

2385
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:32,960
you know man is uh a chasm a tightrope

2386
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,158
between

2387
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,960
uh man and ubermensch well i i don't

2388
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:40,479
want to leave

2389
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:42,719
your thought about uh we'll just

2390
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:44,399
we'll call those things flourishes to to

2391
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:47,760
the aspect of

2392
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:48,399
uh tyson's uh interpretation or or his

2393
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,960
his

2394
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:52,079
his expression of his feelings in combat

2395
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,840
and

2396
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:55,679
so i gave this antidote to the guy and i

2397
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,199
just you know at my first anecdote

2398
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:59,199
to that athlete i was working with and i

2399
01:21:57,198 --> 01:22:00,879
said you know this isn't there isn't a

2400
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:02,719
superior way in this sense

2401
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,560
there is the way that works for you that

2402
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,600
may be something you can implement to

2403
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,199
other people

2404
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,960
if you find that person because we all

2405
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:09,678
have different personalities and and to

2406
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,600
me that's a

2407
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,359
that is that's an absolute i don't want

2408
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,679
to no don't come at me

2409
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:16,799
with all your other [ __ ] the social

2410
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:19,039
sciences crap no

2411
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,320
we have distinct personalities that that

2412
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:22,079
personality that that

2413
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:24,238
who you really are and this you know

2414
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:25,198
again heidegger dozen like being

2415
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:26,879
authentic if you're

2416
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:29,119
if you're authentic with who you are

2417
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,440
goods and bads you will know how to

2418
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:34,000
create what that is and for me

2419
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:35,678
violence and fighting and conflict was

2420
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,639
something that always felt

2421
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:41,199
normal to me and i don't mean normal and

2422
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:42,880
like i grew up in a war zone or a

2423
01:22:41,198 --> 01:22:44,960
abusive household or something like that

2424
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,199
i just meant that i was a kid who was

2425
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,198
very

2426
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:52,639
joyful and inquisitive

2427
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:54,719
and spent a lot of time around older

2428
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:58,079
people of all things uh

2429
01:22:54,719 --> 01:23:00,000
and also while i don't think i have much

2430
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:02,000
capability towards engineering my mom

2431
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,238
said that one of the first things

2432
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,079
as like a little baby when she put me in

2433
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:08,238
my sister's old crib

2434
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:09,840
instead of my sister who just milled

2435
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:11,198
about and was fine with it all

2436
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,960
the first thing i did was i completely

2437
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:14,399
deconstructed it i didn't break it i

2438
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,000
figured out how to pull it apart

2439
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:17,759
curiosity about the world and yet that

2440
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,560
wasn't in conflict with the idea of

2441
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:22,000
violence

2442
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,320
no not at all and so being a very joyful

2443
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,800
and

2444
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:25,359
nice kid but you know kids are kids and

2445
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,400
and

2446
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:31,439
if if kids can find that you

2447
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:34,559
respond maybe more easily

2448
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:36,238
to agitation they will agitate you

2449
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,679
and if you should stand out in some way

2450
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:41,359
by being taller or bigger

2451
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:43,359
or something or caring especially

2452
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:44,880
they will agitate you they don't really

2453
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:46,559
fully understand it either and so i

2454
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,199
don't i don't hold anything against like

2455
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,719
any of the kids

2456
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:49,919
used to pick on me or whatever

2457
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,480
especially at the youngest stage just

2458
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:54,079
like

2459
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:56,879
man they don't know [ __ ] either so um

2460
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:57,760
but once that line was pushed for me it

2461
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,480
was

2462
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,679
oh well i was i was being cool now

2463
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:03,678
you're being uncool

2464
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,960
yeah well then that gives me license for

2465
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,639
everything and so

2466
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:09,198
boom we would just go at it or kids that

2467
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:12,560
would try to initiate a fight

2468
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:14,719
okay and being in that moment of just

2469
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,360
going going to town with someone else it

2470
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:20,158
just felt like

2471
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:21,119
this is this is i belong here yeah it

2472
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:23,839
was it was never

2473
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:25,198
a problem for me like the in fact if

2474
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,679
anything the

2475
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:28,799
over what i had to understand was well

2476
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,480
not only did i

2477
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,159
learn the hard way that it doesn't

2478
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:33,439
matter

2479
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:36,000
at the end of the day it doesn't really

2480
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:39,359
matter what anybody else does

2481
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,760
if your response and violence

2482
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:42,639
even to their violence if you're the

2483
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,679
winner

2484
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:49,359
is often going to be penalized severely

2485
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:51,679
you know society state apparatus

2486
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:53,599
they don't want any of that they want to

2487
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:54,319
be the only arbiter of violence in the

2488
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,280
world

2489
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:58,079
always but i learned a very difficult

2490
01:24:57,279 --> 01:25:00,079
lesson with that

2491
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:01,439
and it was really impactful in a

2492
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:03,840
negative way on me but

2493
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:05,198
also i had to learn on an individual

2494
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,079
sense

2495
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:09,198
to you need to manage violence too

2496
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:12,319
because

2497
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:15,039
hey if someone attacks you or

2498
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:16,799
starts a fight with you and you go at it

2499
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:19,600
okay beating him up is one thing

2500
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,119
you know um you know trying to grab a

2501
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,320
handful of broken glass from the street

2502
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:25,439
and throw it in their face

2503
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:29,439
maybe that's a bit much at seven

2504
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:31,839
so you need to learn what what level

2505
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:32,638
is necessary and you need to learn what

2506
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,279
comes with

2507
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:37,199
with all what's the responsibility of

2508
01:25:35,279 --> 01:25:37,519
when you enact violence i mean you take

2509
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:39,119
on

2510
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,560
something when you you have a

2511
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:43,119
responsibility for that

2512
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,480
this is a extension of your actions um

2513
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:47,119
so

2514
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:47,599
uh but as i got older and especially as

2515
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:52,000
i found

2516
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:54,800
sports and then combat sports

2517
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,920
now this was a place for me to flourish

2518
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,039
and

2519
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:01,359
to the point where i was more myself

2520
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:04,079
in that space than i was outside of it

2521
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:06,079
until time enough where i could learn to

2522
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:08,319
to get this back together again and i

2523
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:10,000
never say that i

2524
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:11,439
that i'll merge the two or anything like

2525
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,359
that no all

2526
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:20,158
what happened my my uh

2527
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:24,158
um my journey uh from adolescence on to

2528
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:25,920
uh to manhood a huge portion of it

2529
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:28,079
besides the normal finding yourself

2530
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,800
whatever whatever actually what it was

2531
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:32,880
was

2532
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:35,039
re getting back to who i always was

2533
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,480
getting that curious kid the kind kid

2534
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:38,319
getting back to the guy

2535
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:39,519
that i should have been allowed to

2536
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:43,359
become instead of

2537
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:46,159
what happened under the pressures of

2538
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:47,359
other things yeah and uh the attempt for

2539
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:51,039
society

2540
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:53,519
and and certain people within

2541
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,560
you know managerial positions to to

2542
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,960
compress

2543
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,320
what that was into something that they

2544
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,840
found more suitable yeah but those

2545
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:01,039
pressures allow you to discover this

2546
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,600
little world

2547
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:04,158
forbidden world in many ways of violence

2548
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,480
then

2549
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:07,279
you could explore through sport you can

2550
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,238
explore it

2551
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:11,279
and uh it's more socially acceptable to

2552
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:13,119
explore at this sport

2553
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:14,559
for sure and even but even then there's

2554
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:19,359
like uh

2555
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:22,800
at times it's socially unacceptable so i

2556
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,920
beat sam schilt i'm he cut my right

2557
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,840
eyebrow

2558
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,840
i cut him and busted his nose and he's

2559
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,239
bleeding all over me as i have an arm

2560
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,600
bar

2561
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:34,718
on top i'm getting you know it's raining

2562
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,679
quote some slayer from a lacerated some

2563
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,840
shield

2564
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,520
bleeding in his horror creating my

2565
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,639
structures now i shall reign in blood

2566
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,000
but uh

2567
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:47,840
i win the fight

2568
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,359
armbar nasty one i get on my feet and

2569
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:52,239
the first thing i do is i

2570
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:52,639
wipe all the blood off onto my hands and

2571
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:56,799
i

2572
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:59,520
lick it and i do my thing and

2573
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,960
all the mma journalists freaked out dana

2574
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,360
white's like man i don't know about that

2575
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,639
you know

2576
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:04,799
you know we don't want him doing

2577
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:08,639
everybody had this huge problem

2578
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:10,320
and then some folks would even contend

2579
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,079
oh you know look you're trying to do

2580
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:13,599
like no no this isn't planned this isn't

2581
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:15,519
i don't think of these things this isn't

2582
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,800
this is how i really feel this is who i

2583
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:20,239
really am

2584
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:22,400
and you know it was even kind of comical

2585
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:24,158
after the fact you know and bj penn was

2586
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:25,920
on the very card with me

2587
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:28,158
watching him at some point in his career

2588
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,760
all of a sudden win fights and then

2589
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:30,879
and do this licking the glove thing and

2590
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,159
everyone thinks it's the coolest thing

2591
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:36,719
ever and i'm like hey

2592
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:39,920
[ __ ] faces i did this in 2002

2593
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:41,520
or 1 2001 and bj penn actually back then

2594
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,158
was like dude you're a badass you're a

2595
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,960
killer

2596
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:46,559
you know where did that come from

2597
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,960
because that seems like a deeply human

2598
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,039
moment

2599
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,960
i could say i could just be you know

2600
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:54,158
goofy about it call it orgy stick

2601
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:57,359
to the line back to mike tyson yeah but

2602
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:58,158
tyson but uh no no it isn't it's beyond

2603
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:01,359
that

2604
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:02,960
uh is it pretty good

2605
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:04,880
there's pretty decent orgasms in my life

2606
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,560
at this point i'm 43. so but no

2607
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,880
none have ever compared to that like i

2608
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,600
said it is a feeling of highest being to

2609
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,480
me

2610
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:14,719
and i see ubermensch moment this is this

2611
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:17,839
is where i feel like

2612
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:21,439
the restrictions of general existence

2613
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:24,480
in society are gone and i get to

2614
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:25,279
fully live uh in a state that feels more

2615
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:27,039
meaningful

2616
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:30,158
of the most meaning you know i think of

2617
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:33,039
it as life and death and

2618
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:33,920
i it's just it is the way i'm built and

2619
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:36,319
i don't have

2620
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,399
i've never had any problem applying

2621
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:39,840
violence like it doesn't i

2622
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:41,279
i don't know where it comes from or how

2623
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,600
you would define it or whatever if you

2624
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:44,479
want to

2625
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,039
stick me under in a psychologist's chair

2626
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:47,439
but

2627
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:48,319
like i don't there's a part of me that

2628
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:50,079
can just like i

2629
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:51,439
know if i'm gonna apply i can apply

2630
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:53,920
violence to any level

2631
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:54,799
and be okay with it and it doesn't i

2632
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,920
don't lose sleep

2633
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:01,440
it doesn't bother me it's not a problem

2634
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:03,600
it's it was me learning how to fully

2635
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:06,638
understand

2636
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,159
violence humans and and the broader

2637
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:10,400
perspective that allowed me to think

2638
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:12,079
about things and like well

2639
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:14,000
what am i what what do i really want to

2640
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:15,039
accomplish with my actions in the world

2641
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,760
just on a whole

2642
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:20,000
you know not compartmentalizing uh my

2643
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:23,119
sporting career even

2644
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,840
when i get in the ring i i don't have

2645
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:25,599
any mercy

2646
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,679
generally and if i do it's because i

2647
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:31,120
make a a really

2648
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:33,679
deliberate attempt to be

2649
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:35,039
in a state where i can have mercy if i

2650
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:37,279
just go in there to fight

2651
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:38,880
with everything i got there is zero

2652
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:40,000
natural state there's nothing there's

2653
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,719
nothing that will hold me back

2654
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,198
other than the referee and that's that

2655
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:45,840
you know i

2656
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:46,559
i know i agreed to to be allowed to do

2657
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:50,400
and not to do

2658
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:53,360
but but within that no and i expect

2659
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:55,198
it to be done to me but in terms of

2660
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:58,799
values in terms of seeing

2661
01:30:55,198 --> 01:31:03,519
what to me violence is uh is just

2662
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:06,000
yet another canvas that humans can uh

2663
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,000
paint beautifully on clearly i mean uh

2664
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,119
we have venerated the violent

2665
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,279
uh there are communists that venerate

2666
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:14,960
the violent on their behalf there are

2667
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:16,079
national socialists that venerate the

2668
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,840
violent there

2669
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:19,119
and then if you remove it from an

2670
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:22,079
ideological perspective

2671
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:23,519
we venerate the violent uh when they're

2672
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:26,800
a hero

2673
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:28,560
we venerate the violent in our religion

2674
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,000
well i mean i guess some people venerate

2675
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:33,199
the violence of of

2676
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:36,399
yahweh and sodom and gomorrah right so

2677
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:38,799
or do we say jehovah i don't know

2678
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:40,399
is there you've already mentioned one

2679
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,520
but is there a fight

2680
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:46,079
where you've achieved the highest

2681
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:48,320
of heights for your own personal being

2682
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:50,479
just when you look within yourself

2683
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:52,000
that you're the proudest of or maybe was

2684
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:53,359
your most beautiful creation is this

2685
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,920
something that stands out there there

2686
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:55,759
are a few

2687
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,760
actually uh fighting semi shield and a

2688
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,000
rematch uh well the first one was pretty

2689
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,960
good

2690
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,520
too uh but the rematch was i i was

2691
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,079
suffering

2692
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,560
i had suffered early prior the week

2693
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:07,920
prior

2694
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:10,960
to uh food poisoning and so

2695
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:15,039
while my abs are looking all right

2696
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:18,239
i in the ring didn't have

2697
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:21,198
the power that i expected to and i was

2698
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:22,799
struggling in ways in some of the

2699
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:23,119
grappling for the submission stuff that

2700
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,679
i

2701
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:27,039
hadn't accounted for just exhaustion or

2702
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:29,039
mental exhaustion no

2703
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:30,960
i mean like just physical this i wasn't

2704
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:32,000
back up to a hundred percent in terms of

2705
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:35,679
just power output

2706
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,760
and semi was well he's always

2707
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:41,840
seven foot tall but this time he was the

2708
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,840
first time i fought him he was too

2709
01:32:42,079 --> 01:32:46,639
or 257 or 260 something something like

2710
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:48,880
that this time he was like 290.

2711
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:50,159
and so he was a significantly bigger cat

2712
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:53,679
and he he was

2713
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:57,839
he's a big dude and i just remember

2714
01:32:53,679 --> 01:33:00,079
being in up against the ropes with him

2715
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,679
changing levels trying to take him down

2716
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:03,760
and he's fighting he's hipping

2717
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:05,119
and i just thought in my head there's no

2718
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,800
[ __ ] way i'm going to lose this fight

2719
01:33:05,119 --> 01:33:07,119
there's no way you are not going to beat

2720
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,199
me

2721
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:10,960
is not going to happen and i arm barred

2722
01:33:09,198 --> 01:33:13,119
him the other arm

2723
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,319
even the fact he's like i really want to

2724
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:15,760
get you for that i want to get that

2725
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:16,639
match back and then you [ __ ] got my

2726
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,119
other arm dick

2727
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:20,000
i'm like dude i still love you though

2728
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:22,399
yeah you know and that's

2729
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,840
but the whole time you're like so this

2730
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:26,960
has to do the

2731
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,719
the dichotomy of your feeling your worst

2732
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:30,158
and having to overcome you're like

2733
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:30,480
literally mentally telling yourself

2734
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:31,920
there's

2735
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:33,839
no way there's no [ __ ] way i'm gonna

2736
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:35,279
lose this fight and then there's even my

2737
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,719
last bare knuckle match

2738
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:38,479
and getting in the ring and fighting

2739
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:42,158
bare knuckle uh

2740
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:45,359
boxing for the first time um and just

2741
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:47,759
thinking just being in a great state

2742
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:48,799
and just just looking so forward to

2743
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,520
seeing

2744
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,800
i mean i called someone and i was

2745
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,000
talking to them the night before and i

2746
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,000
said yeah well

2747
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,920
i i want you know i video called you

2748
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,719
because this face might not look like

2749
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,399
this

2750
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:02,239
when i see you next and they're just

2751
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:04,638
like uh

2752
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:05,359
oh okay that's not just like empty trash

2753
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,920
talk that's

2754
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:10,000
no that's like a clarity of mind and the

2755
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,199
seriousness about it i i know i might

2756
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,520
die i'm

2757
01:34:11,198 --> 01:34:14,638
most pretty high chance of of being

2758
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,960
deformed some way

2759
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,760
so but [ __ ] it i don't really are you do

2760
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,198
you think about

2761
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:23,840
are you accepting your own death yes 100

2762
01:34:21,198 --> 01:34:24,879
yeah i in fact and that's in a strange

2763
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,760
way that's partially what

2764
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:28,319
makes it so elevated in terms of my my

2765
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:33,360
sense of

2766
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:36,960
feeling by being able to

2767
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:41,039
have death at my side it feels good

2768
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:42,800
and to be there and to think that

2769
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:44,319
this could be the one like why not you

2770
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:47,279
know i'm not

2771
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:49,118
a religious person at all even though i

2772
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:50,960
very much have to seem seems to bang on

2773
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:52,559
the drama about the usefulness or the

2774
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,679
understanding the usefulness of religion

2775
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,960
for people

2776
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:58,800
um but you know if if

2777
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,239
if i got to do something then yeah put

2778
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,679
me in valhalla man i don't want to be

2779
01:35:00,238 --> 01:35:03,359
anywhere else nothing else seems like a

2780
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:05,600
good place for me to be i want to

2781
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:07,599
i want to fight all day long and feast

2782
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:10,079
all night you know it sounds great

2783
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,199
i saw you uh throw your hat into the

2784
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:14,399
ring of vader

2785
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:16,638
emiliano yes he got cloved i guess i

2786
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:16,879
hope he i hope he overcomes it and comes

2787
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:18,560
out

2788
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,480
just as good if not better epic would

2789
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,560
that did i understand correctly

2790
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:24,000
that might be his last fight yes that's

2791
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,520
my understanding

2792
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,319
and it would be epic as hell and it

2793
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,639
would be epic as hell because

2794
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:32,880
the the person that i want to give my

2795
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:36,239
most to is a person that i respect

2796
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:38,239
especially at this this long uh

2797
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:39,678
this long this this this long career of

2798
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:42,879
mine and getting at this this

2799
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:44,560
this twilight years like

2800
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,639
and that's the thing about even this

2801
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:49,039
going in there with the aspect of being

2802
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:51,359
with death and all that is that

2803
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:52,800
when that person is in there they are my

2804
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:55,039
brother with me in this

2805
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,159
and that so when you give me your best

2806
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:58,238
even if i

2807
01:35:56,158 --> 01:35:59,279
even if i win dominant fashion but if

2808
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:01,118
you show up

2809
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:03,118
and you're as authentic and being here

2810
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:04,559
as i am then then i love you and i'm

2811
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:05,679
glad for you to be here and we're in

2812
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,800
this together and

2813
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:09,679
and at this point you know your loss or

2814
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,960
my

2815
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:14,399
or whatever is no less deserving of

2816
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,639
veneration than the wind

2817
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:17,920
like we're here in this and so to be in

2818
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:21,199
the ring with fiora

2819
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,399
and to venerate him in win or defeat

2820
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:27,919
to be in there with with someone

2821
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:27,920
like that is to me

2822
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:34,959
it's so rare so it's incredible how

2823
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:38,320
the ultimate violence is coupled with

2824
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:41,359
like love or respect and it's like

2825
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:45,279
it's it's weird how this is uh how

2826
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:49,279
the competition in this violent form

2827
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:51,679
is also a uh veneration of

2828
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:53,118
just the human connection it's also the

2829
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:56,319
removal i feel like it's the

2830
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:58,238
purest purest ways purest on

2831
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:00,319
most honest places of person can exist

2832
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:01,359
uh that line and fight club you don't

2833
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:03,439
know really who you are until you've

2834
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:06,000
been in a fight i mean believe that

2835
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:06,879
and i i've seen so many examples of

2836
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,840
people trying to

2837
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:11,039
portray themselves as one thing and then

2838
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,840
in the ring

2839
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:15,198
you see who they really are or even when

2840
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,840
they're trying to persuade themselves as

2841
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:19,198
one thing

2842
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:21,119
and they're winning the crowd

2843
01:37:19,198 --> 01:37:22,319
at times will see who they really are

2844
01:37:21,118 --> 01:37:24,158
and still hate them

2845
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:25,359
you know it's like but i said all the

2846
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:28,479
good things

2847
01:37:25,359 --> 01:37:30,319
yeah bro don't work that way yeah but

2848
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:31,279
speaking of fedor if we take you out of

2849
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:33,198
the picture

2850
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:34,319
who are the greatest mixed martial arts

2851
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:38,079
fighters of all time

2852
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:41,039
uh i i feel you out of the picture

2853
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:43,359
as a cop-out to some degree i feel like

2854
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:46,319
we need a little bit more time

2855
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:47,198
you know so to to see how how this

2856
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:48,399
unfolds

2857
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:50,719
because you've got to compare a lot of

2858
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:53,198
things and i ah

2859
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:54,000
did i did i i think i'm like sanctuary i

2860
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:55,198
did an interview

2861
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,639
i don't know about centuries but that

2862
01:37:55,198 --> 01:37:58,479
would help if we can keep accurate

2863
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:01,600
records and not allow

2864
01:37:58,479 --> 01:38:03,279
uh too much uh bias to to fall into too

2865
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,639
much profit

2866
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:10,559
right yeah but um i made an

2867
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:13,440
argument uh i was in a i get a

2868
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:15,039
it was it was a interview with an mma

2869
01:38:13,439 --> 01:38:16,238
outlet of some sort and i can't recall

2870
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:19,198
who it was

2871
01:38:16,238 --> 01:38:19,678
but oh it was an argument about will the

2872
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:22,799
winner

2873
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:25,359
of cain velasquez versus

2874
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,199
stephen yochik be the greatest mma

2875
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:30,319
heavyweight of all time and i said

2876
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:32,399
[ __ ] no way oh no it was cormier

2877
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:33,359
and miocic that's what it was i said

2878
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:35,920
absolutely not

2879
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:37,198
not even close and i said these guys

2880
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,000
need a bit more time

2881
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:41,279
to see how things go and also how things

2882
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,198
go for some of their opponents and like

2883
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:44,399
there's more factors than just this one

2884
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:46,479
fight it really is

2885
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:47,519
and i go and when you want to weigh

2886
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:49,439
these people

2887
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,199
even if let's say we'll bring aleister

2888
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:52,719
or uh yeah aleister over him into the

2889
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:55,919
end of the equation

2890
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:59,198
okay you judge him on what you know now

2891
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:02,880
what he's done for you lately okay right

2892
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:04,879
which is a very myopic way of doing it

2893
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,920
what has he done over his career k1

2894
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:09,279
champion

2895
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:13,199
uh he was a champion in uh

2896
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:15,599
uh dream um he strike force

2897
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:17,519
blah blah blah his overall record the

2898
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,280
entirety of all the different opponents

2899
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:23,040
he's fought and i just sit back and i go

2900
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:28,639
i okay he's not the ufc champ

2901
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:31,760
but his accolades his merits

2902
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:35,359
in some ways actually stand up

2903
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:37,840
higher than cormier's and mjojk is

2904
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:40,799
so what about the moments do you give

2905
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:42,960
much value to the special

2906
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,880
moments like the highest heights you

2907
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:47,198
rise to not in terms of records

2908
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,639
or the strikes landed but just creating

2909
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:50,719
a magical moment in

2910
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:52,159
in a in a fight it doesn't have to be

2911
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:54,960
even a championship fight

2912
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:56,479
but just you know conor mcgregor is an

2913
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,239
example of somebody who creates a

2914
01:39:56,479 --> 01:39:58,959
narrative who gets a story he creates a

2915
01:39:58,238 --> 01:40:00,959
drama

2916
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,319
and the special magic happens even if

2917
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,719
it's like not

2918
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:05,359
myth is greater than reality and that is

2919
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:07,520
always the case

2920
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:08,559
but do you and so i understand that so

2921
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:11,520
very much and

2922
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,800
it takes an [ __ ] like me to to poo

2923
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:14,639
poo on your myth

2924
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,840
they at least get you at the end of the

2925
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,400
day you're not going to abandon your

2926
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:20,480
myth

2927
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:23,118
but um perhaps temper it with

2928
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:24,000
the facts and logic but uh so you're not

2929
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:26,399
a fan of myth

2930
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
no i'm an absolute massive fan of myth

2931
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:31,198
but you prefer facts and logic

2932
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:33,118
it's like when i i know i mean i like

2933
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:35,678
saying facts and logic because people

2934
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:37,599
i also i am not a materialist in that

2935
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:39,279
sense i don't think that materialism can

2936
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,800
solve for everything it's not enough

2937
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:42,880
it's not it's not robust enough i'm

2938
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:45,520
sorry if facts and logic and or

2939
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,560
uh reason as the enlightenment scholars

2940
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:49,679
all thought

2941
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:52,159
including marx was enough for people

2942
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:52,960
then we would never we wouldn't have any

2943
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:54,799
religions

2944
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:56,319
yeah we wouldn't have like there would

2945
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,920
be no we wouldn't have narratives and

2946
01:40:56,319 --> 01:40:59,840
myths and all this kind of stuff

2947
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:01,279
it would not it just i'm sorry there is

2948
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,840
no there's nothing

2949
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:04,639
about history that supports the idea

2950
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:07,520
that

2951
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:08,400
rationality will over will overcome all

2952
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,080
there's something about

2953
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:12,638
ben shapiro's facts don't care about

2954
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:15,600
your feelings that feels to be mis

2955
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:17,600
fields be missing something fundamental

2956
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:20,239
about human nature it's not

2957
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:21,360
clear to me exactly what is missing to

2958
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:24,559
give all

2959
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:26,399
oh oh ben uh a fair shake

2960
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,320
yeah and uh you know i don't know ben

2961
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:29,198
shapiro i don't really listen to ben

2962
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:32,399
shapiro not

2963
01:41:29,198 --> 01:41:34,158
against ben shapiro um i don't i'm not

2964
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:34,879
here to say anything particularly bad

2965
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:37,359
about him

2966
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:38,239
um although i will say at one time tom

2967
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:40,319
arnold was

2968
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:42,000
seemingly trying to pick an actionable

2969
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:45,118
fight with ben shapiro

2970
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,118
in the ring or somewhere yeah and i just

2971
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:48,880
and i actually responded like and i

2972
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:50,799
tried to get him to clarify i said hey

2973
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:52,400
are you saying that you want to fight

2974
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,600
ben shapiro that you're looking to

2975
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:54,879
actually because i was waiting for him

2976
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,520
to say something and then i'd be like

2977
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:57,279
okay

2978
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,400
well it's one thing to want to get into

2979
01:41:57,279 --> 01:41:58,800
a fight with someone it's another thing

2980
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:02,238
to go

2981
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:04,560
pick on a little tiny you know guy

2982
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:06,079
like ben who's much smaller than you and

2983
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,840
doesn't train or whatever but you know

2984
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:09,679
if it's not me i can find someone your

2985
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:11,840
size and you can go fight him

2986
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:13,359
you know don't be a basically don't be a

2987
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,679
bully piece of [ __ ]

2988
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:17,679
yeah you know which by the way tom

2989
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:19,679
arnold you are a mental [ __ ] you are

2990
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:21,520
never going to be able to

2991
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:23,118
compete even with ben shapiro in an

2992
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,800
argument on any level

2993
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:26,238
about anything oh intellectual argument

2994
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:28,239
yeah an intellectual argument you could

2995
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:31,359
scr maybe you can scream louder than him

2996
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:34,559
but whatever but but nevertheless

2997
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:36,559
in the discussion of greatness in

2998
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:38,000
fighting i think you you need to all

2999
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,600
right numbers you need

3000
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,800
the numbers the numbers and there's the

3001
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:45,440
magic there is some context also in that

3002
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,960
where did aleister overing fight oh we

3003
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:48,399
found pride where you could soccer kick

3004
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,600
people and stomp their heads and this

3005
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:52,079
and that and so the the

3006
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:53,280
the the game environment is actually

3007
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:55,039
different too

3008
01:42:53,279 --> 01:42:56,479
so more uncertainty there's more chaos

3009
01:42:55,039 --> 01:42:58,719
and pride there's more

3010
01:42:56,479 --> 01:43:00,479
go back a little further and go like

3011
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:03,118
what about the guys that used to like

3012
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:04,559
dan severn fought bare knuckle head

3013
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:06,158
butts the whole nine

3014
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,679
beat down seven right i did beat dan

3015
01:43:06,158 --> 01:43:08,079
severan that was that was killing an

3016
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:09,760
idol

3017
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:11,118
so to speak although i didn't really

3018
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,560
kill him because i still love him

3019
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:14,158
you know he's still in i mean he's still

3020
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:17,039
responsible for

3021
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:17,839
inspiration along this whole pathway you

3022
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:20,479
know it's it's

3023
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:22,170
meaning meeting your god and then

3024
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:23,439
putting a knife in it i guess

3025
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:26,239
[Laughter]

3026
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:27,599
uh realizing they're human and then

3027
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:30,000
bringing them down to your level

3028
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:31,840
exactly but also there's a there's a

3029
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,600
huge misconception there and that is

3030
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,760
that i could bring maybe i could bring

3031
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:37,199
dan severan down to my level

3032
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,679
but i couldn't bring his mustache down

3033
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:40,479
to my level oh it is it is of mythic

3034
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:43,600
proportions

3035
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:44,479
and uh greater than yours your facial

3036
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:47,119
hair is greater than yours

3037
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:49,359
my facial hair is is is is creating its

3038
01:43:47,118 --> 01:43:52,719
own legacy but it is not dan severn

3039
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:55,279
mustache level or no don fry mustache so

3040
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:57,760
don fry mustache dance ever mustache

3041
01:43:55,279 --> 01:44:00,399
you know now you have like shia versus

3042
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,400
sunni like

3043
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:05,520
you think there will be a karl marx uh

3044
01:44:03,439 --> 01:44:07,279
like painting of josh barnett one day

3045
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:09,760
with the beard and is that is that

3046
01:44:07,279 --> 01:44:13,599
basically i hope so i'll i will actually

3047
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:16,880
comb my hair unlike marks but uh um

3048
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:18,719
chaos is uh has a charm to it it does

3049
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,800
it does i mean uh we all thought doc

3050
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,198
brown in back to the future was was

3051
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,719
quite

3052
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:24,638
charming so yeah you have to throw that

3053
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:26,319
into the calculation where they fought

3054
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:27,679
yes this is and the rules that they

3055
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:28,158
fought under you know some guy like

3056
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:32,319
eager of

3057
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:33,519
changing won a 32-man tournament or

3058
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:38,559
something like that i go

3059
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:41,280
okay uh stipa and daniel cormier are

3060
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,000
awesome and they may they will they will

3061
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:45,039
for sure

3062
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:47,279
be uh revered as

3063
01:44:45,039 --> 01:44:48,479
when they're as for their careers 100

3064
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:50,559
percent

3065
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:52,959
can you say that they're particularly

3066
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:54,159
even better overall than eager of

3067
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,679
changing

3068
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:57,198
maybe one of them could have beat them

3069
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:58,639
maybe maybe one of them wouldn't have

3070
01:44:57,198 --> 01:45:00,479
you know maybe maybe here would have

3071
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:01,920
[ __ ] got him with the knuckles

3072
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:03,279
right away well maybe if they fought him

3073
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,319
in pride they wouldn't have won maybe if

3074
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:05,920
they fought him

3075
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:07,599
bare knuckle they wouldn't won i don't

3076
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,800
know and there's something about the cat

3077
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:11,039
like do you put

3078
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,079
boys gracie in the top ten you know

3079
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:15,600
there's some

3080
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:18,880
top ten of all time in terms of

3081
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:20,079
competitors is capable um

3082
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,239
i don't know i'd have to think about

3083
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:26,000
that maybe not but i because

3084
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:28,638
tracy as like pyramid level like wow

3085
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,639
dude what a what an amazing man oh yeah

3086
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:31,760
he's so important absolutely incredibly

3087
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:34,639
important

3088
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,440
but there's something about stepping

3089
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,679
into

3090
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:39,359
uh like fighting another human being

3091
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:40,480
under all the uncertainty that the early

3092
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:42,960
ufc's had

3093
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:44,079
i mean you don't know yup what is going

3094
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:47,520
to happen and

3095
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:49,760
couple that with not much money yep

3096
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,440
all of it yes so that the purity of it

3097
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,600
too there's something about money

3098
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:54,799
i mean that i guess [ __ ] for that yes

3099
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:57,199
world but that

3100
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:58,079
ruins the purity of the violence yeah

3101
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:01,839
people

3102
01:45:58,079 --> 01:46:01,840
given the opportunity for

3103
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:06,319
yeah yeah well the bigger things get the

3104
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:07,920
more i love the fact that that

3105
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:10,238
fighting has opened up to such a degree

3106
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:14,000
that the

3107
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:16,238
career business side of it because i i

3108
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
absolutely distinctly separate the two

3109
01:46:16,238 --> 01:46:19,359
the business side of it has

3110
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,520
opened up to give me far more

3111
01:46:19,359 --> 01:46:23,198
possibilities open way more doors for me

3112
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:27,760
than i ever intended it to

3113
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:29,839
uh whereas the

3114
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:30,880
p the athlete side of things has if

3115
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:34,800
anything just gotten

3116
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:37,520
substantially worse i would say and uh

3117
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:38,320
some of this can be some of this is due

3118
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:41,679
to

3119
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:44,799
all the the nature of all games

3120
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:47,679
will be learned will be gamed

3121
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,199
uh without even the rules being broken

3122
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:51,359
and once that's figured out

3123
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:53,599
you need to make an adjustment no

3124
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:56,000
adjustments have been made

3125
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:58,400
so the game just appears to be the same

3126
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,359
game over and over and over and over and

3127
01:46:58,399 --> 01:47:02,079
over again

3128
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:03,759
on espn plus on whatever on whatever on

3129
01:47:02,079 --> 01:47:04,559
whatever it doesn't really matter which

3130
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:07,600
night you watch

3131
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:10,880
it's the same game constantly and

3132
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:12,159
that's not because the the the athletes

3133
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:15,359
are worse or better

3134
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:16,879
it's because they have had that game uh

3135
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:18,319
structure long enough that they figured

3136
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:20,319
out

3137
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:21,759
what do you do to be to be the most

3138
01:47:20,319 --> 01:47:23,118
successful at it what is the highest

3139
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,560
percentage way of approaching it

3140
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:26,079
essentially even if you're not thinking

3141
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,880
of percentages

3142
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:30,399
what would the if we take a step back

3143
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:31,679
it's really fascinating to think about

3144
01:47:30,399 --> 01:47:33,599
the early ufc's

3145
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:35,679
did you fight dan severan in the ufc i

3146
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,199
found him in super brawl

3147
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:38,960
so that was the early early days you're

3148
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:43,359
undefeated

3149
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:46,399
uh what were those early days let's say

3150
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:48,839
of mixed martial arts like give

3151
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:51,839
let me tell you the day of high

3152
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:51,840
adventure

3153
01:47:54,479 --> 01:47:58,238
yeah it is it was so much fun and it

3154
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:01,679
made you feel

3155
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:04,799
absolutely like you were a part of uh

3156
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:07,760
a novel a comic book i mean

3157
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,800
i i would love to transcribe my

3158
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,560
experiences

3159
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:12,880
as what i consider a second generation

3160
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:16,840
mma athlete

3161
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:20,480
except i'm way too

3162
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:23,679
sensitive uh to anybody's

3163
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:24,879
personal any things that are not not

3164
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:26,719
even to

3165
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:28,400
you know i'm not a gossipy person i

3166
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:29,760
really do believe that like small people

3167
01:48:28,399 --> 01:48:32,799
talk about others

3168
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:35,600
big people talk about ideas so

3169
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:36,079
um but there's some stories that just

3170
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,679
can't

3171
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:39,359
you can't tell without telling the whole

3172
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:42,480
story and there are

3173
01:48:39,359 --> 01:48:43,279
so many amazing stories that could be

3174
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:44,799
told

3175
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:47,679
people being at their best people being

3176
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:49,679
at their worst yeah the whole the whole

3177
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:51,679
gospel is there something you could

3178
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:55,279
speak to the chaos of the time

3179
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:57,760
oh 100 like okay so we at amc

3180
01:48:55,279 --> 01:49:00,559
got uh connected to somebody that was

3181
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:03,920
throwing an event in nampa idaho and we

3182
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:07,280
all piled into this and matt humes

3183
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:08,399
uh subaru wagon and we jammed out and we

3184
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:11,599
left kirkland

3185
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:15,839
and we headed over to idaho only to

3186
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:17,920
find out that there was

3187
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:20,239
nothing really put in place it was

3188
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:23,279
absolute

3189
01:49:20,238 --> 01:49:24,479
disrepair and chaos there

3190
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:26,639
they didn't have a ring they didn't have

3191
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:30,879
this i it was

3192
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:32,880
such a [ __ ] adventure but we were

3193
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,719
like well you know there's hardly

3194
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:36,159
anywhere to fight

3195
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:38,000
it's tough to find these opportunities

3196
01:49:36,158 --> 01:49:41,759
so okay well

3197
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:42,238
how about this whoever is here to fight

3198
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,480
and

3199
01:49:42,238 --> 01:49:46,638
is willing all right well since there's

3200
01:49:44,479 --> 01:49:48,399
no venue there's no this whatever

3201
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:50,319
we all got gloves we got mouthpieces

3202
01:49:48,399 --> 01:49:53,759
we'll just go to the park

3203
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:55,359
still get paid yeah and so

3204
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:57,280
folks were kind of like i don't know

3205
01:49:55,359 --> 01:50:00,559
about that the guy i was gonna fight

3206
01:49:57,279 --> 01:50:02,079
was he finally figured that they finally

3207
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,000
he finally gets information on who i

3208
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:05,359
actually am and i was undefeated at the

3209
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,198
time and

3210
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:11,039
i think i had fought superbrawl 13

3211
01:50:09,198 --> 01:50:13,759
already won that tournament and so he's

3212
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:15,198
like yeah i had no clue

3213
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,039
i'm so glad we didn't fight you would

3214
01:50:15,198 --> 01:50:18,399
have murdered me this is you know what a

3215
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:20,719
setup

3216
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:22,000
and eventually matt had to had to

3217
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:23,439
strong-arm the guy and

3218
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,359

3219
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:27,039
all get and drive back

3220
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:28,880
and because he his whole position was

3221
01:50:27,039 --> 01:50:30,238
well there ain't no [ __ ] way we drove

3222
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:33,679

well that fight didn't go exactly as how

3248
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:33,440
i wanted it to

3249
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:34,480
so i gotta find a way to get more

3250
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:37,359
experience

3251
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:38,158
i would literally fight people in uh the

3252
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:41,118

01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:42,319

01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:45,118
wrestling team

3256
01:51:43,118 --> 01:51:46,639
i would find anyone doing martial arts

3257
01:51:45,118 --> 01:51:47,118

3258
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:49,679

01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:07,679
and then it was

3267
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:10,000
you know getting a girlfriend yeah i

3268
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:12,880
just you know path least resistance

3269
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,238
i think it might be useful for us to uh

01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:15,440
get some advice from you

3271
01:52:14,238 --> 01:52:17,839
yeah all right because you've

3272
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:20,960
accomplished for

3273
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:23,039
the journey of a martial artist first

3274
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:24,800
if you've accomplished some of the

3275
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:27,118
greatest accolades there is in the sport

3276
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:30,320
if somebody who's starting out now

3277
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:31,759
or like early on in their journey what

3278
01:52:30,319 --> 01:52:35,198
advice would you give

3279
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:38,639
on how to become a martial artist

3280
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:41,678
a catch wrestler a fighter uh

3281
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:43,440
well i mean really what it comes down to

3282
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:45,599
is do it because you love it

3283
01:52:43,439 --> 01:52:47,279
do it for that reason and that reason

3284
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:50,000
alone uh

3285
01:52:47,279 --> 01:52:50,880
most people that get into this and

3286
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,279
attempt to make

3287
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:53,920
any sort of professional inroads with it

3288
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:56,800
you are

3289
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:58,399
not going to be the world champion uh

3290
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,039
you probably will never even fight for a

3291
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:01,679
belt

3292
01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:03,279
and you're probably not going to net

3293
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:06,399
make money at this

3294
01:53:03,279 --> 01:53:08,158
so don't do it for those reasons do it

3295
01:53:06,399 --> 01:53:09,598
for the reason of the passion

3296
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:11,519
do it for the reason to be the absolute

3297
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:13,840
best that you can be

3298
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:15,760
whatever that ends up being you might at

3299
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:18,159
best only be

3300
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,440
mediocre but you won't even be mediocre

3301
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:20,238
if you don't do it like you really mean

3302
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:23,359
it

3303
01:53:20,238 --> 01:53:24,319
so compassion look where's the kernel of

3304
01:53:23,359 --> 01:53:25,839
the passion

3305
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:27,519
would you say is it in the learning

3306
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:29,119
process itself the improvement

3307
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:30,400
i think it really depends on the person

3308
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:31,439
right i mean there's some people that

3309
01:53:30,399 --> 01:53:34,399
really love the

3310
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:35,198
the the fact of they feel like they're

3311
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:37,279
growing

3312
01:53:35,198 --> 01:53:40,238
right so well to power you know you're

3313
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:43,439
growing growing stronger growing better

3314
01:53:40,238 --> 01:53:44,638
you know the idea of of eliminating

3315
01:53:43,439 --> 01:53:48,158
weakness

3316
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:50,880
so uh twitch i'll quickly define

3317
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:51,198
weaknesses as like things that weaken

3318
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:54,159
you

3319
01:53:51,198 --> 01:53:55,519
not like being physically weak sure you

3320
01:53:54,158 --> 01:53:56,960
could call that weakness but maybe

3321
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,599
you're not meant to be a super strong

3322
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:01,359
guy

3323
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:03,039
but choosing to be weak is really

3324
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:04,559
a different story other than just like

3325
01:54:03,039 --> 01:54:08,560
we're all

3326
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:10,480
uh deficient in some way or another so

3327
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,920
that's neither here nor there it's a

3328
01:54:10,479 --> 01:54:12,959
matter of what you decide to do with it

3329
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,520
and that's an infinite strength and

3330
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,800
weakness

3331
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:17,040
at least the way i look at it like

3332
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,679
strength is choosing regardless of the

3333
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:20,560
difficulty

3334
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:22,319
to make improvements to strength is even

3335
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:23,119
choosing to acknowledge that you you do

3336
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:26,559
lack

3337
01:54:23,118 --> 01:54:29,198
and accept it and then make a decision

3338
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:29,840
what to do with it um yeah but there's

3339
01:54:29,198 --> 01:54:31,118
also

3340
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:32,480
there's a bunch of stuff that just like

3341
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:32,960
you said it's what you're drawn to

3342
01:54:32,479 --> 01:54:36,319
there's an

3343
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:38,239
honesty to just grappling that it seems

3344
01:54:36,319 --> 01:54:40,079
more real than anything else you can do

3345
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:41,519
sure well that's the that's where the

3346
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:42,238
passion of love can come yeah i mean

3347
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:44,000
it's

3348
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:45,519
being in an environment hopefully that

3349
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,479
is as true as possible

3350
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:50,719
uh would be would be a starter so it's

3351
01:54:48,479 --> 01:54:53,919
hard to be uh

3352
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:55,359
a [ __ ] person when you're literally

3353
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,599
trying to tear each other's arms off

3354
01:54:55,359 --> 01:54:59,359
yeah you know you really sort of see who

3355
01:54:57,599 --> 01:54:59,920
somebody is uh i also feel like you

3356
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:01,598
really

3357
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,960
really get to see somebody who there are

3358
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:05,279
a couple instances where you really see

3359
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:09,198
who people are

3360
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:09,198
on the mats and in the bedroom so

3361
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:15,440
even the aspect of self

3362
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,439
betterment

3363
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,198
growth along a path i mean hell that's

3364
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:24,238
part of the

3365
01:55:21,198 --> 01:55:26,638
the the device of capture for

3366
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:27,359
martial arts as a business give you a

3367
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:29,840
belt

3368
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:32,559
put a stripe on your belt each each of

3369
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:35,440
these iterations cost 20 bucks

3370
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:36,320
so but there's a benefit to that too i i

3371
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:38,960
really enjoyed

3372
01:55:36,319 --> 01:55:41,198
the progression of belts sure is it um

3373
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:42,480
you know a bit of his ocd or whatever

3374
01:55:41,198 --> 01:55:44,559
but you're enjoying

3375
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:46,000
the recognition of your growth when you

3376
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:48,400
feel when you're made to

3377
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,719
feel when i think genuinely you do earn

3378
01:55:48,399 --> 01:55:52,719
it yeah i agree i process it i agree

3379
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:54,880
i actually it makes complete sense to me

3380
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:58,000
it just it's anything that is

3381
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:58,480
is has a goodness in its purity can also

3382
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,920
have

3383
01:55:58,479 --> 01:56:04,319
a detriment in its perversion so

3384
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,920
and there's a value to competition i've

3385
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:07,599
gotten some [ __ ] in the past for saying

3386
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:11,199
this i've gotten the most

3387
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:14,319
value in giving everything uh

3388
01:56:11,198 --> 01:56:17,839
i have to try to win and

3389
01:56:14,319 --> 01:56:19,679
and lose so like i've gotten i remember

3390
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:23,119
most of the matches i've lost

3391
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:25,039
and i think that's what i've gotten the

3392
01:56:23,118 --> 01:56:26,399
most from the sport is losing

3393
01:56:25,039 --> 01:56:29,840
think about it i mean if you really

3394
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:29,839
think about it um

3395
01:56:30,479 --> 01:56:34,000
what what makes you want to actually in

3396
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:37,439
detail

3397
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,880
go over what happened oh it's the time

3398
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:40,559
when you didn't get what you wanted

3399
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:43,359
yeah it's a time when you gave it

3400
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:46,239
everything you had and you came up short

3401
01:56:43,359 --> 01:56:47,679
or failed miserably okay so unless you

3402
01:56:46,238 --> 01:56:49,279
feel embarrassed in some way

3403
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:51,920
right and so that's usually the only

3404
01:56:49,279 --> 01:56:53,599
time people again calamity

3405
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:55,279
is the impetus for them to actually turn

3406
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:57,119
around and go who the [ __ ]

3407
01:56:55,279 --> 01:56:59,439
am i what am i doing and why am i doing

3408
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:03,118
it yeah instead of naturally going

3409
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:04,719
hmm okay well i won why

3410
01:57:03,118 --> 01:57:06,880
what was it the cause and so i think

3411
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:10,719
part of my success is that

3412
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:14,719
when i win i'm brutal when i lose

3413
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:18,158
i'm brutal and there is no in-between so

3414
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:21,198
i remember losing

3415
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:23,279
uh the rematch against

3416
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:24,879
noguera and i still feel like it was a

3417
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:26,399
[ __ ] call like i feel like i won

3418
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:30,000
that fight but

3419
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:31,759
my my opinion is that and this even came

3420
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,800
up so one of the coaches in the back was

3421
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,719
like

3422
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:36,239
oh you did great you know don't feel bad

3423
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:38,319
you know blah blah blah blah and i go no

3424
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:39,759
[ __ ] that i didn't finish him i allowed

3425
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:41,759
the referees to make a judge

3426
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,800
a decision that i think is incorrect and

3427
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:44,480
bad but that

3428
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:46,079
came because i didn't take him out you

3429
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:48,238
know [ __ ] that no

3430
01:57:46,079 --> 01:57:49,679
no he won he's going to get more money

3431
01:57:48,238 --> 01:57:50,158
he's going to get more recognition blah

3432
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:52,399
blah blah

3433
01:57:50,158 --> 01:57:53,359
blah blah i accept all this and i don't

3434
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:56,238
and it's not okay

3435
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:57,839
and i need to if i when i get a chance

3436
01:57:56,238 --> 01:58:00,158
to fight him again i got to figure out a

3437
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,840
way to like take this guy out

3438
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:03,359
i want to say forever i'm not trying to

3439
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:06,319
put him six feet underground well

3440
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:07,519
when i fight yes i am but yeah but but

3441
01:58:06,319 --> 01:58:09,118
the point being

3442
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:10,639
i need to find a way to like this is

3443
01:58:09,118 --> 01:58:12,479
definitive

3444
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:14,079
you don't get to say [ __ ] about it

3445
01:58:12,479 --> 01:58:14,959
because i'm the only one who can stand

3446
01:58:14,079 --> 01:58:16,719
right now

3447
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:18,399
that's the way it's got to be anything

3448
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:21,118
less than that is

3449
01:58:18,399 --> 01:58:21,598
not good enough and even if i achieve

3450
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:23,920
that

3451
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:25,119
then i gotta figure out okay it's not a

3452
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,800
given

3453
01:58:25,118 --> 01:58:28,719
how did i get to this point how did i

3454
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:31,679
make that happen

3455
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:32,399
was it simply been uh because of his own

3456
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:36,158
mistakes

3457
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:38,559
or was it because of my my my successful

3458
01:58:36,158 --> 01:58:40,319
action so it's always self-critical

3459
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:43,440
always constantly

3460
01:58:40,319 --> 01:58:45,039
you uh love movies i read this somewhere

3461
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:46,559
yeah you mentioned blade runner as a

3462
01:58:45,039 --> 01:58:48,960
favorite number one of all time

3463
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,400
the final cut that's my go-to so you

3464
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:52,239
would say

3465
01:58:50,399 --> 01:58:54,158
uh blade runner is the greatest movie of

3466
01:58:52,238 --> 01:58:55,519
all time it's one of the greatest movies

3467
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:59,519
of all time

3468
01:58:55,520 --> 01:59:01,679
what's in the top nice top five uh

3469
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:03,040
blade runner final cut this is the

3470
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:06,800
original blade runner

3471
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:09,840
and i used to own on tape the original

3472
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:11,920
vhs cut yeah and uh

3473
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:14,880
and i had the director's cut on dvd why

3474
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:16,880
blade runner by the way

3475
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,159
as a kid i just thought it was so cool

3476
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:20,239
there was something about really spoke

3477
01:59:18,158 --> 01:59:22,238
to me the whole cyberpunk landscapes and

3478
01:59:20,238 --> 01:59:25,198
uh you know this guy

3479
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:26,238
chasing down rogue uh androids

3480
01:59:25,198 --> 01:59:30,559
replicants

3481
01:59:26,238 --> 01:59:33,359
and is it just the entire cyberpunk

3482
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:34,239
universe it's just robots as well no

3483
01:59:33,359 --> 01:59:35,839
it's it's

3484
01:59:34,238 --> 01:59:38,319
i mean the cyberpunk universe is part of

3485
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:41,440
it uh on the on the surface i have a

3486
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:41,920
i've always tended towards dark subject

3487
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:44,719
matter

3488
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:45,440
uh like things that are of the dark so

3489
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:46,960
to speak

3490
01:59:45,439 --> 01:59:49,279
are things that i've always been

3491
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:49,840
gravitated towards i think maybe part of

3492
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:53,039
it is that

3493
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:56,079
the things that are darker are more

3494
01:59:53,039 --> 02:00:00,079
accepting and

3495
01:59:56,079 --> 02:00:01,840
more upfront with death

3496
02:00:00,079 --> 02:00:03,840
and perhaps i think that maybe that is

3497
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,319
what was uh yeah somehow more honest

3498
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,520
perhaps

3499
02:00:04,319 --> 02:00:10,238
and there's also the aspect of uh

3500
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:12,719
rebelliousness usually like there was uh

3501
02:00:10,238 --> 02:00:15,439
i was never one to

3502
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:16,399
want to just do what somebody told me to

3503
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:19,678
do

3504
02:00:16,399 --> 02:00:22,960
you know um i'm not sitting around

3505
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:24,480
trying to always be such a radical

3506
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:27,118
individual that i can't

3507
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:28,399
take orders no in fact i'm more than

3508
02:00:27,118 --> 02:00:31,598
willing to take orders

3509
02:00:28,399 --> 02:00:34,000
from somebody that i feel is competent

3510
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:35,679
and has merit and reason behind what

3511
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,079
they're doing and makes like okay yeah

3512
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:38,239
yeah

3513
02:00:36,079 --> 02:00:40,158
i'm 100 for not only what can i take

3514
02:00:38,238 --> 02:00:42,079
orders i will help you achieve whatever

3515
02:00:40,158 --> 02:00:45,759
it is if i think it's worthwhile

3516
02:00:42,079 --> 02:00:49,279
um even at my own expense

3517
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:51,920
but uh to get to that point is a rarity

3518
02:00:49,279 --> 02:00:53,599
like it's not not a given and so you can

3519
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:55,118
even imagine like being a grade school

3520
02:00:53,599 --> 02:00:56,159
teacher and this kid doesn't respect you

3521
02:00:55,118 --> 02:00:57,679
and he doesn't really think you're that

3522
02:00:56,158 --> 02:00:59,920
smart

3523
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:01,920
they don't really appreciate that but um

3524
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:03,679
so cyberpunk is number one what else

3525
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,359
cyberpunk is kind of number one it's an

3526
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:07,118
environment i love but at the same time

3527
02:01:05,359 --> 02:01:08,079
conan the barbarian by john millions is

3528
02:01:07,118 --> 02:01:12,639
one of my favorite

3529
02:01:08,079 --> 02:01:14,960
films of all time uh and

3530
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:17,039
you know that's such a pure film in a

3531
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:21,198
way like the motivations are pure

3532
02:01:17,039 --> 02:01:25,439
they're very easy to follow but

3533
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:28,319
not lacking in depth you know it's not

3534
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:29,039
it's not just explosions and and teal

3535
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:31,840
and orange

3536
02:01:29,039 --> 02:01:32,800
it's uh it's it's more on the human

3537
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:36,000
condition

3538
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:38,159
and i love it and it's shot incredibly

3539
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,118
well it's got an incredible soundtrack

3540
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:40,479
yeah i

3541
02:01:39,118 --> 02:01:42,319
[ __ ] love it but with blade runner

3542
02:01:40,479 --> 02:01:43,198
also in a deeper sense you know again

3543
02:01:42,319 --> 02:01:44,799
the human condition

3544
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:47,439
you know you start seeing like what what

3545
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:50,560
is what is being what is being human

3546
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:51,839
you know how does this relate to well if

3547
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,719
you can make it and you can tell it what

3548
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:55,360
to do

3549
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:56,399
at what point is it like you should or

3550
02:01:55,359 --> 02:01:58,079
you shouldn't

3551
02:01:56,399 --> 02:01:59,759
you know why do you get to determine

3552
02:01:58,079 --> 02:02:00,158
what's alive and what's not what's a

3553
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:01,760
life

3554
02:02:00,158 --> 02:02:04,719
that should be allowed to live and what

3555
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:07,760
isn't and

3556
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:09,118
what would be the strain of being roy

3557
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:12,159
batty

3558
02:02:09,118 --> 02:02:16,158
and seeing all these incredible moments

3559
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:18,399
that with his passing will no longer

3560
02:02:16,158 --> 02:02:20,158
exist especially if he hasn't had a

3561
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:22,158
chance to

3562
02:02:20,158 --> 02:02:23,839
put that flame into another torch so to

3563
02:02:22,158 --> 02:02:25,359
speak if he hasn't written them down if

3564
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:28,239
he hasn't passed them down

3565
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:28,238
to somebody else

3566
02:02:28,639 --> 02:02:32,159
gone like tears in the rain like tears

3567
02:02:30,639 --> 02:02:34,000
in the rain that scene is incredible

3568
02:02:32,158 --> 02:02:35,759
uh yeah i mean but it's funny because

3569
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
those two universes are very different

3570
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:40,079
than the barbarian and cyberpunk because

3571
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,279
they're that makes me curious about

3572
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:45,279
what else might be in the list uh

3573
02:02:43,279 --> 02:02:47,599
well let me think it's a pretty do you

3574
02:02:45,279 --> 02:02:49,599
like that

3575
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:50,719
no no i mean i'm sure the god i've never

3576
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:52,719
actually even watched the whole

3577
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:53,599
godfather no but also like uh was it a

3578
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:55,359
casino

3579
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:57,039
good fellas good phil is a good movie

3580
02:02:55,359 --> 02:02:58,960
but no that's not in my top

3581
02:02:57,039 --> 02:03:00,238
it's a good flick uh but it doesn't

3582
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:02,719
really do it for me

3583
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:04,799
uh i if people really want to get into

3584
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:06,399
this a little more i did make a hundred

3585
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,400
a list of a hundred hundred of my

3586
02:03:06,399 --> 02:03:08,879
favorite movies on my facebook fan page

3587
02:03:08,399 --> 02:03:12,079
nice

3588
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:14,079
uh but uh do you remember like

3589
02:03:12,079 --> 02:03:15,840
oh yeah like blazing saddles is on there

3590
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:19,359
right to the lost ark

3591
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:23,119
um valhalla rising by

3592
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:26,839
nicholas from winding refin uh maniac by

3593
02:03:23,118 --> 02:03:29,598
uh william lustig it's a

3594
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:32,400
1980 gnarly

3595
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:33,119
video nasty horror movie about a serial

3596
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:36,158
killer

3597
02:03:33,118 --> 02:03:39,839
uh who murders women and

3598
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:42,399
scalps them uh and it's gnarly as hell

3599
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:44,639
and very brutal and very bleak and very

3600
02:03:42,399 --> 02:03:44,638
uh

3601
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,079
i mean it's the kind of thing that like

3602
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:49,199
a lot of people would have a real hard

3603
02:03:48,078 --> 02:03:52,479
time watching

3604
02:03:49,198 --> 02:03:52,960
but uh one again i like things that are

3605
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:55,759
dark

3606
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:57,599
but two i thought the performances were

3607
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:58,400
fantastic in this film and they really

3608
02:03:57,599 --> 02:03:59,920
got out

3609
02:03:58,399 --> 02:04:02,399
the i think what the underlying thing

3610
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:04,000
was and it was you know it was a guy who

3611
02:04:02,399 --> 02:04:05,920
was

3612
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,840
basically just like run amok by the

3613
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:11,199
overbearing mother uh union

3614
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:13,199
archetype and it she was she imparted

3615
02:04:11,198 --> 02:04:16,638
her insanity into him

3616
02:04:13,198 --> 02:04:17,678
and he but yet there is this aspect you

3617
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:19,520
could see of him of him

3618
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:20,960
wanting to try and actually be able to

3619
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:24,480
be in the world

3620
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:28,239
and have love and have

3621
02:04:24,479 --> 02:04:31,519
a feminine companionship

3622
02:04:28,238 --> 02:04:34,559
to go with with his masculine aspect

3623
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:36,320
but he had no way of understanding how

3624
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:37,920
to really make that happen

3625
02:04:36,319 --> 02:04:40,158
and he had a complete negative

3626
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:43,039
connotation to the feminine

3627
02:04:40,158 --> 02:04:44,319
so his struggle with and there's a

3628
02:04:43,039 --> 02:04:47,519
little

3629
02:04:44,319 --> 02:04:50,639
part in the in the movie where he

3630
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:51,679
somehow comes across this model or

3631
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:54,960
something

3632
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:56,399
and they actually he starts to feel like

3633
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:58,639
maybe he might be able to actually have

3634
02:04:56,399 --> 02:05:01,519
a relationship with somebody

3635
02:04:58,639 --> 02:05:04,078
and it goes somewhere but uh yeah even

3636
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:05,599
the elijah wood remake i felt was

3637
02:05:04,078 --> 02:05:07,198
really well done and captured most of

3638
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:08,639
the essence of what the movie was about

3639
02:05:07,198 --> 02:05:11,359
but i still feel like the

3640
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:12,400
original by william lustig uh is the

3641
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:15,679
best

3642
02:05:12,399 --> 02:05:17,759
what's the greatest uh love

3643
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:20,078
movie of all time i just love movie of

3644
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:22,000
all time it's like something more loves

3645
02:05:20,078 --> 02:05:23,840
i mean i suppose love underlies most of

3646
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,399
these movies especially

3647
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:27,760
i mean hell takashi mikey's films are

3648
02:05:26,399 --> 02:05:30,158
all about family

3649
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:31,039
of all things as bonkers as those movies

3650
02:05:30,158 --> 02:05:33,679
are they

3651
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:34,479
the general theme is family almost

3652
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:37,599
entirely

3653
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:39,279
in all of his films uh yeah there's

3654
02:05:37,599 --> 02:05:40,800
there's very i mean even you can argue

3655
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:45,279
later on yeah there's this

3656
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:45,279
every love film of all time uh

3657
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:49,199
that's intro i mean is excalibur a film

3658
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:52,800
about love

3659
02:05:49,198 --> 02:05:56,319
uh what's this called about king arthur

3660
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:59,119
his caliber is about uh arthur becoming

3661
02:05:56,319 --> 02:06:01,439
king of the britons and his love of his

3662
02:05:59,118 --> 02:06:04,078
his country and his love of guinevere

3663
02:06:01,439 --> 02:06:06,399
but eventually yeah it becomes more of

3664
02:06:04,078 --> 02:06:06,399
about

3665
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:14,719
the the necessity for the king to love

3666
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:17,198
to to hold hold excalibur

3667
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:18,480
to stay to realize that while if you're

3668
02:06:17,198 --> 02:06:20,000
the king

3669
02:06:18,479 --> 02:06:22,718
you can love your wife and you can love

3670
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:25,760
your best friend and they

3671
02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:28,078
may [ __ ] each other behind your back

3672
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:29,679
and as they fall in love too but at the

3673
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:31,359
end of the day you're responsible your

3674
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:33,359
your love has to be to the to

3675
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:34,960
the country and everyone else first and

3676
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:38,559
not your own personal

3677
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:39,920
uh wants which you know

3678
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:42,400
well it made a much more interesting

3679
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:46,719

on top one of the upper echelon movies

3694
02:07:10,319 --> 02:07:15,279
on my list

3695
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:18,238
derived from a book by called

3696
02:07:15,279 --> 02:07:18,238

illustrator he did donald westlake wrote

3700
02:07:26,319 --> 02:07:29,359
so darwin cooked is does an amazing

3701
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:31,520
comic book

3702
02:07:29,359 --> 02:07:33,679
send up of darwin cook's novels and they

3703
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:36,719
are [ __ ] incredible

3704
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:38,000
so anyways but uh the point blank with

3705
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:41,599
lee marvin

3706
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:45,118
uh you know it's a man driven by

3707
02:07:41,599 --> 02:07:47,679
purpose revenge but also by like really

3708
02:07:45,118 --> 02:07:49,198
pure motivations he wants his money he

3709
02:07:47,679 --> 02:07:52,319
was he was betrayed

3710
02:07:49,198 --> 02:07:53,678
he and he wants his his cash

3711
02:07:52,319 --> 02:07:56,238
because this is what he agreed to do the

3712
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:57,520
thing for and this is which also is part

3713
02:07:56,238 --> 02:07:58,399
of the reason why i like no country for

3714
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:00,239
old men so much

3715
02:07:58,399 --> 02:08:02,000
which i felt was a great great great

3716
02:08:00,238 --> 02:08:03,678
movie even better book

3717
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,118
but uh i remember talking to my friend

3718
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:08,399
and i go you know

3719
02:08:05,118 --> 02:08:09,759
anton [ __ ] is the most pure human

3720
02:08:08,399 --> 02:08:12,960
being in that whole book

3721
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:14,880
well that guy's the villain i go is he

3722
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:17,599
evil

3723
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:19,199
he's the one he lies to no one he does

3724
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:21,520
everything he says he will do

3725
02:08:19,198 --> 02:08:23,598
he always follows his word and on the

3726
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:24,719
rare occasion he he allows fate to make

3727
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:26,639
a decision

3728
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:28,158
as he figures like well whatever all led

3729
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:30,880
us to hear will will

3730
02:08:28,158 --> 02:08:33,118
will lead us one way or the other and if

3731
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:34,560
we're at this crossroads what

3732
02:08:33,118 --> 02:08:36,319
how is there any better or worse way

3733
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:38,320
than to do it over a coin flip

3734
02:08:36,319 --> 02:08:39,359
and so that whole scene where the guy is

3735
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:41,359
going

3736
02:08:39,359 --> 02:08:42,960
well what am i putting up and he goes

3737
02:08:41,359 --> 02:08:45,839
everything you've been putting it up

3738
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:47,840
every day of your life and that's true

3739
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:50,719
everything we do is a

3740
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:51,119
as a decision as a calling as a choice

3741
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:53,359
and

3742
02:08:51,118 --> 02:08:54,960
it toward and then it bumped me out they

3743
02:08:53,359 --> 02:08:56,880
they

3744
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:58,239
reduced the last interaction between

3745
02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:01,118
[ __ ] and

3746
02:08:58,238 --> 02:09:01,919
uh what's his face's wife and he finally

3747
02:09:01,118 --> 02:09:03,439
finds her

3748
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:05,440
and she's like you don't have to do this

3749
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:07,198
i mean she's he's like yes yes i do

3750
02:09:05,439 --> 02:09:08,479
this is the way it is you can think that

3751
02:09:07,198 --> 02:09:09,678
your life could have turned out any

3752
02:09:08,479 --> 02:09:10,799
sort of ways you could have done this

3753
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:12,158
you could have done that but the reality

3754
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:14,079
is this is the way your life is that's

3755
02:09:12,158 --> 02:09:16,000
the way it was always going to be

3756
02:09:14,078 --> 02:09:18,479
you know the fact that i'm here is the

3757
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,639
end of it and that's that

3758
02:09:18,479 --> 02:09:22,158
yeah it's funny if you're honest this is

3759
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:22,800
what dark movies reveal that the

3760
02:09:22,158 --> 02:09:26,879
villains

3761
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:29,119
are the the purest of humans

3762
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:30,159
and uh can teach us the most like

3763
02:09:29,118 --> 02:09:32,399
profound lessons

3764
02:09:30,158 --> 02:09:33,359
and that's the certain example of it

3765
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:35,759
what do you think

3766
02:09:33,359 --> 02:09:37,679
the big ridiculous last philosophical

3767
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:39,119
question what do you think is the

3768
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:41,920
the meaning of this whole thing we got

3769
02:09:39,118 --> 02:09:43,839
going on of life and existence on earth

3770
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:45,520
from your individual perspective but the

3771
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:50,560
entirety of the human species

3772
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:51,190
life uh the universe and everything yeah

3773
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:56,400
