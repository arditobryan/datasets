1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,318
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,200
rodney brooks one of the greatest

3
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,638
roboticists in history he led the

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,440
computer science and artificial

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,839
intelligence laboratory at mit then

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,559
co-founded irobot which is one of the

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,278
most successful robotics companies ever

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,960
then he co-founded rethink robotics that

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,839
created some amazing collaborative

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,278
robots like baxter and sawyer

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,839
finally he co-founded robust.ai

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,399
whose mission is to teach robots common

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,600
sense which is a lot harder than it

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,759
sounds

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,160

our sponsors in the description

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,039
as a side note let me say that rodney is

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,280
someone i've looked up to for many years

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,439
in my now over two decade journey in

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,960
robotics because

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:53,920
one he's a legit great engineer of real

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,439
world systems and two he's not afraid to

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,879
state controversial opinions that

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,358
challenge the way we see the ai world

25
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,839
but of course while i agree with him on

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,519
some of his critical views of ai i don't

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,200
agree with some others

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,640
and he's fully supportive of such

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,880
disagreement

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,439
nobody ever built anything great by

31
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,359
being fully agreeable

32
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,519
there's always respect and love behind

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,159
our interactions and when a conversation

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,319
is recorded like it was for this podcast

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,920
i think a little bit of disagreement

36
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,399
is fun

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,118
this is the lex friedman podcast and

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,520
here is my conversation with rodney

39
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:31,519
brooks

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,640
what is the most amazing or beautiful

41
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,599
robot that you've ever had the chance to

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
work with

43
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,798
i think it was domo

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,640
which was made by one of my grad

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,759
students aaron ed singer

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,519
it now sits in daniela roose's office uh

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,759
director of sea sale

48
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,759
and it was just a beautiful robot and

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,159
aaron was really clever

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,599
he didn't give me a budget ahead of time

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,320
he didn't tell me what he was going to

52
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,478
do

53
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:02,158
he just started spending money he spent

54
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:04,399
a lot of money he and jeff webber who um

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,240
as a mechanical engineer who

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,159
aaron insisted he bring with him when he

57
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,478
became a grad student built this

58
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,479
beautiful gorgeous robot domo which is a

59
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,840
upper torso humanoid

60
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:19,280
two two arms uh

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,159
with things three fingered hands um

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,759
and

63
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:25,039
face eyeballs um all uh not the not the

64
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,759
eyeballs but everything else series

65
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,039
elastic actuators uh you can interact

66
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,359
with it um

67
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,959
cable driven all the motors are inside

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,280
and it's just

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,878
gorgeous the eyeballs are actuated too

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,800
or no oh yeah the eyeballs are actuated

71
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:41,280
with cameras and you know so it had a

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,680
visual attention mechanism you know wow

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
looking when people came in and looking

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,319
in their face and

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,080
talking with them

76
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,000
why was it amazing

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,599
the beauty of it you said you said what

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
was the most beauty what is the most

79
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,598
beautiful it's just mechanically

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,599
gorgeous as as everything aaron builds

81
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,399
has always been mechanically gorgeous

82
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:02,158
it's just exquisite in the detail

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
we're talking about mechanically like

84
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,439
literally the amount of actuators

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,360
the actuators the cables he

86
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,000
anodizes different parts different

87
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,760
colors and it's just

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,759
looks like a work of art what about the

89
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,639
face is that do you find the face

90
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,000
beautiful in robots um when you make a

91
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,759
robot

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,080
it's making a promise for how well it

93
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,679
will be able to interact so i always

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,159
encourage my students

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,640
not to over promise you know even with

96
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,639
its essence like the thing it presents

97
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,719
it should not over promise yeah so i the

98
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,639
the joke i make which i think you'll get

99
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,560
is if your robot looks like albert

100
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,878
einstein it should be as smart as albert

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,400
einstein so

102
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,079
the only thing in in

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,120
domo's face is

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,719
the eyeballs um and because that's all

105
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,959
it can do it can look at you and pay

106
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,639
attention um and

107
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,479
so there is no

108
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,958
it's not like one of those

109
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,798
um japanese robots that looks exactly

110
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,438
like a person at all

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,719
but see the thing is us humans and dogs

112
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,120
too

113
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,680
don't just use eyes for it as

114
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,039
attentional mechanisms they also use it

115
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,200
to communicate it's part of the

116
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,878
communication like a dog can look at you

117
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,958
look at another thing and look back at

118
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,879
you and that designates that we're going

119
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,759
to be looking at that thing yeah or

120
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,879
intent you know in on on both baxter and

121
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,319
sawyer at rethink robotics they had a

122
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,918
screen with you know graphic eyes so it

123
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,839
wasn't actually where the cameras were

124
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,758
pointing but it

125
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,079
the the eyes would look in the direction

126
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,000
it was about to move its arm so people

127
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,478
in the factory nearby were not surprised

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,560
by its motions because it gave that

129
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,240
intent away

130
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,399
before we talk about baxter which i

131
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,160
think is a beautiful robot

132
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,279
let's go back to the beginning when did

133
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,600
you first

134
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,959
fall in love with robotics we're talking

135
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,280
about beauty and love to open the

136
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,599
conversation this is great

137
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,478
i've got these i was born in the end of

138
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,439
1954 and i grew up in adelaide south

139
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:04,560
australia and i have these two books

140
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,639
that are dated 1961

141
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,280
so i'm guessing my mother found them in

142
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,600
a store in 62 or 63.

143
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,758
how and why wonder books um

144
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,919
how am i on the book of electricity

145
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,560
and how i won the book of

146
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,799
giant brains and robots

147
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,800
and

148
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,198
i learned how to build circuits you know

149
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,280
when i was eight or nine simple circuits

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,280
and i and i read you know learned the

151
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,038
binary system and

152
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,638
um saw all these

153
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,839
drawings mostly uh of robots and um then

154
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,879
i tried to build them for the rest of my

155
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,599
childhood wait

156
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,439
61 you said this was when the two books

157
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,919
i've still got the at home what what

158
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,240
does the robot mean in that context no

159
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,399
they they were some of the robots that

160
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,800
they had were

161
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,599
arms you know big arms to move nuclear

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,680
material around but they had pictures of

163
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,560
welding robots that looked like humans

164
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,918
under the sea welding stuff underwater

165
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,199
um so they weren't real robots uh but

166
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,198
they were you know what people were

167
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,879
thinking about for robots

168
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
what were you thinking about were you

169
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,918
thinking about humanoids were you

170
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,240
thinking about arms with fingers were

171
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,560
you thinking about faces or cars no

172
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,280
actually to be honest i realized my

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,160
limitation on building mechanical stuff

174
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,559
so i just built um the brains

175
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,000
mostly i out of

176
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,000
different technologies as i got older

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,079
i built a

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,319
learning system which

179
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,240
was chemical based and i had this ice

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,919
cube tray each

181
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
well was a cell

182
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,719
and by applying voltage to the two

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,120
electrodes it would build up a copper

184
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,479
bridge so over time it would it would

185
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,280
learn

186
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:52,000
a simple network um so i could teach it

187
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:54,478
stuff and that was

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,079
mostly things were driven by my budget

189
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,719
and nails as electrodes and a an ice

190
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,639
cream i mean an ice cube tray was was

191
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,880
about my budget at that stage later i

192
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,879
managed to buy transistors and then i

193
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,680
could build gates and flip-flops and

194
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,879
stuff so so one one of your first robots

195
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,400
was an ice cube tray yeah

196
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,719
and it was very cerebral because it

197
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,439
learned to add

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,520
very nice uh well

199
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,478
just a decade or so before in 1950 alan

200
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,159
turing

201
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,478
wrote the paper that formulated the

202
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,680
touring test and he opened that paper

203
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,279
with the question

204
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,400
can machines

205
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,399
think

206
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,839
so let me ask you this question can

207
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,159
machines

208
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,918
think can your ice cube tray

209
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,479
one day think

210
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,159
um certainly machines can think because

211
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,800
i believe you're a machine and i'm a

212
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,560
machine and i believe we both think um i

213
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,639
think it's a big fear i think any other

214
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,478
philosophical position is sort of a

215
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,400
little ludicrous what does think mean if

216
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,199
if it's not something that we do

217
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:00,239
um and we and we are machines

218
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,160
so yes machines can but do we have a

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,879
clue how to build such machines that's a

220
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,879
very different question are we capable

221
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,479
of building such machines uh you know

222
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,160
are we smart enough we think we're smart

223
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,000
enough to do anything but

224
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,240
maybe we're not maybe you know we're

225
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,319
just not bad enough to build

226
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,400
stuff like us the kind of computer that

227
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,080
uh alan turing was thinking about do you

228
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,918
think there is something

229
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,839
fundamentally

230
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,839
uh or significantly different between

231
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,560
the computer between our ears the the

232
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,799
biological computer that humans use

233
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,519
and uh the computer that he was thinking

234
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,639
about from a from a sort of high level

235
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,038
philosophical yeah i believe it uh

236
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,479
that's very wrong in fact i'm

237
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,120
halfway through a

238
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,320
i think it'll be about a 480 page book

239
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,399
um

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,080
titled the working title is not even

241
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,000
wrong

242
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,278
and if i may i'll tell you a bit about

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,759
that book

244
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,399
so there's two two well three thrusts to

245
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,278
it

246
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,200
um

247
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,519
one is the history of computation what

248
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,278
we call computation it goes all the way

249
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,000
back to uh uh

250
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:07,679
some manuscripts in latin from 1614 and

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,600
1620 by napier and kepler through

252
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:15,120
babbage and lovelace and then

253
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,000
turing's 1936 paper uh is you know where

254
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,320
what we think of as the invention of of

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,799
of modern computation

256
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,080
and that paper by the way did not set

257
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,719
out to

258
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,759
you know invent computation it set out

259
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,800
to uh negatively answer one of uh

260
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,559
hilbert's three later set of problems he

261
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,599
called it um

262
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,518
as an effective way of of of getting

263
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
answers and and hilbert

264
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,320
hilbert really worked with rewriting

265
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,440
rules as did um

266
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,040
um

267
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,839
a church who also at the same time a

268
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:54,480
month earlier insuring disproved

269
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,519
hilbert's one of these three hypotheses

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,480
the other two had been already been

271
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,839
disproved by godel so turing set out to

272
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,000
disprove it because that's it's always

273
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,920
easier to disprove these things than to

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,320
prove that there is an answer and um

275
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,120
so he needed um

276
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,879
and it really came from his his uh

277
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,120
professor well as an undergrad at

278
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,039
cambridge who said who turned it into is

279
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,278
there a mechanical process so he wanted

280
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,480
to have a show a mechanical process that

281
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,879
could

282
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,440
calculate numbers

283
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,919
because that was a mechanical process

284
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,079
that people used to generate tables they

285
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,078
were called computers the people at the

286
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,239
time and they followed a set of rules

287
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,078
where they had paper and they would

288
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,039
write numbers down and based on the

289
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:41,519
numbers that keep writing other numbers

290
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,519
and they would produce

291
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,639
numbers for these tables engineering

292
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
tables

293
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,759
that the more the more iterations they

294
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,278
did the more significant digits came out

295
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,078
and so turing

296
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,399
in that paper set out to

297
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:59,278
define what sort of machine could do

298
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,720
that mechanical machine

299
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,639
where it could produce an arbitrary

300
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,440
number of digits

301
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:10,958
in the same way a human computer did

302
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,440
and he came up with a very simple

303
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,000
set of constraints where there was an

304
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,000
infinite supply of paper this is the

305
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,320
tape of the turing machine

306
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,320
and each turing machine had a

307
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
set of it came with a set of

308
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,560
instructions that

309
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,480
as a person could do with pencil and

310
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,958
paper write down things on the tape and

311
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,079
erase them and put new things there

312
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,838
and

313
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:37,519
he was able to show that that system was

314
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,640
not able to do something that hilbert

315
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,959
hypothesized so he disproved it but he

316
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,759
had to show this was this this system

317
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,439
was

318
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,278
good enough to do

319
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,079
whatever could be done but couldn't do

320
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:52,320
this other thing yeah and there he said

321
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,638
and he says in the paper i don't have

322
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,839
any real arguments for this but based on

323
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,159
intuition

324
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,639
so that's how he defined computation

325
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:04,639
and then if you look over the next from

326
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:07,600
1936 up until really around 1975

327
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,159
you see people struggling with

328
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,120
is this really what computation is and

329
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,240
so marvin minsky very well known in ai

330
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,560
but also

331
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,480
a fantastic mathematician

332
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,638
uh in his book finite and infinite

333
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,360
machines from the mid 60s which is a

334
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,519
beautiful beautiful mathematical book

335
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,278
um says says at the start of the book

336
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,200
well what is computation turing says

337
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,720
it's this and yeah i sort of think it's

338
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,480
that it doesn't really matter whether

339
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
stuff's made of wood or plastic it's

340
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,079
just you know that relatively cheap

341
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,159
stuff can do this stuff and so yeah

342
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:44,000
seems like computation

343
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,958
and donald knuth uh in his first volume

344
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,440
of his

345
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,518
you know art of computer programming

346
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,399
in around 1968

347
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,639
says well what's computation

348
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,879
it's this stuff like turing says that a

349
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,879
person could do each step without too

350
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,799
much trouble

351
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,278
and so one of his examples of what would

352
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,639
be too much trouble was

353
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,480
a step which required knowing whether

354
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,240
fermat's last theorem was true or not

355
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
because it was not known at the time and

356
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,600
that's too much trouble for a person to

357
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,120
do as a step

358
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,720
and um

359
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,720
hop craft and allman

360
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,800
sort of said a similar thing

361
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,759
later that year and by nineteen seventy

362
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,519
five

363
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,559
in the a ho up crop the norman book

364
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,320
they're saying

365
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,638
well you know we don't really know what

366
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,278
computation is but intuition says this

367
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,560
is sort of about right and this is what

368
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,759
it is

369
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,399
that's computation it's a sort of

370
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,879
agreed-upon thing which happens to be

371
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,198
really easy to implement in silicon and

372
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,039
then we had moore's law which took off

373
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,000
and it's been an incredibly powerful

374
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,759
tool

375
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,240
i certainly wouldn't argue with that the

376
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,958
version we have a computation incredibly

377
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,879
powerful can we just take a pause so

378
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,638
what we're talking about is there's an

379
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,958
infinite tape with some simple rules on

380
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,399
how to write and on that tape and that's

381
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,838
that's what we're kind of thinking about

382
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,320
this is computation yeah and it's

383
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,959
modeled after humans how humans do stuff

384
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,240
and

385
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,719
i think it's a

386
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,959
curing says in the 36 paper one of the

387
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,040
critical facts here is that a human has

388
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,559
a limited amount of memory

389
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,278
so that's what we're going to put onto

390
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,879
our

391
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,879
mechanical computers so

392
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,399
so you know unlike mass

393
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,399
unlike mass or charge or yeah it's not

394
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,120
it's it's not given by the universe it

395
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,078
was

396
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,078
this is what we're going to call

397
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,198
computation yeah and then it has this

398
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,638
really

399
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,639
you know it had this really good

400
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,039
implementation which has completely

401
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,680
changed our technological world that's

402
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,679
computation

403
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,958
second part of the book

404
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,559
i uh or argument in the book i have this

405
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,759
two by two matrix

406
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,679
with

407
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,919
um science

408
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,958
in the top row engineering in the bottom

409
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,159
row

410
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,838
left column is intelligence right column

411
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,679
is

412
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,880
life so in the bottom row the

413
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,519
engineering there's artificial

414
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,078
intelligence and there's artificial life

415
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,360
in the top row there's neuroscience

416
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:11,120
and abiogenesis how does living matter

417
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,959
turn in how does non-living matter

418
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,078
become living better yes four

419
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,159
disciplines these four disciplines all

420
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,000
um

421
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:23,039
came into the current form in the period

422
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
1945 to 1965.

423
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,120
um

424
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,440
that's interesting there was

425
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,039
neuroscience before but it wasn't

426
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,720
effective neuroscience it was you know

427
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,799
these ganglia and there's electrical

428
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,680
charges but no one knew knows what to do

429
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,198
with it

430
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:36,319
and furthermore

431
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,000
there were a lot of players who are

432
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,199
common across them

433
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,278
i've

434
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,359
identified common players except for

435
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,439
artificial intelligence and habiogenesis

436
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,360
i don't have but for any other pair i

437
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,360
can point to people who work them and a

438
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,480
whole bunch of them by the way we're at

439
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,759
the research lab for electronics at mit

440
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,839
um where uh warren mcculloch uh held

441
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,519
held held forth

442
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:05,360
and in fact mcculloch pitts um letven

443
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,879
and maturana wrote the first paper on

444
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,360
functional neuroscience called what the

445
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,360
frog's eye tells the frog's brain where

446
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,919
instead of it just being this bunch of

447
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,278
nerves they sort of showed what

448
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,919
different

449
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:20,639
anatomical components were doing and

450
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,360
telling other anatomical components

451
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,519
and

452
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,519
you know generating behavior in the

453
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,159
front would you put them as basically

454
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,159
the fathers or the one of the early

455
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,120
pioneers of what are now called

456
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:36,559
artificial neural networks

457
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,919
yeah i mean mcculloch and pitts

458
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,719
pitts was

459
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:43,759
much younger than him in 1943 had

460
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,720
written a paper inspired by bertrand

461
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,440
russell

462
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,120
on

463
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,360
a calculus for the ideas imminent in

464
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,919
neural systems

465
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,278
where they had tried to without any real

466
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,000
proof

467
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,000
they had tried to give a formalism for

468
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,799
neurons

469
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,119
basically in terms of logic and gates or

470
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:05,918
gates and not gates with with no

471
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,918
real

472
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,439
evidence that that was what was going on

473
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,280
but they they talked about it and that

474
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,360
that was picked up by minsky for his

475
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,838
1953

476
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,399
uh dissertation on which was a was a

477
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,119
neural network we would call it today

478
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,439
it was picked up by um

479
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,038
john von neumann when he was designing

480
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,919
the edvac computer in 1945 he talked

481
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,679
about its components being neurons

482
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,038
based on and in references he's only got

483
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,600
three references and one of them is the

484
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,759
mcculloch pitts paper

485
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,599
so all these people and then the ai

486
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,839
people and the artificial live people

487
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,599
which was john von neumann originally it

488
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,439
was like overlap because you know

489
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,000
they're all going around the same time

490
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,759
and three of these four disciplines turn

491
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,079
to computation as their primary metaphor

492
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,960
so i i've got a couple of chapters in

493
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:59,119
the book one is titled wait

494
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,919
computers are people because that's

495
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,399
where our computers came from yeah

496
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,759
and you know from people who are

497
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,120
computing stuff and then i've got

498
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,519
another chapter

499
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,599
wait people are computers which is about

500
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:15,119
computational neuroscience yes so

501
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:17,918
there's this whole circle here and that

502
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:20,319
competition is it and you know i have

503
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,320
talked to to people about well maybe

504
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:27,038
it's not computation that goes on in the

505
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,038
head of course it is yeah okay well

506
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,519
when elon musk's rocket goes up is it

507
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,960
computing

508
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,079
is that how it gets into orbit by

509
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,279
computing

510
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,519
but we've got this idea if you want to

511
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,839
build an ai system you write a computer

512
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:43,359
program

513
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:45,599
yeah in a sense so the word computation

514
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,240
very quickly starts doing a lot of work

515
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,639
that it was not initially intended to to

516
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,640
do it's the second saying if you talk

517
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,400
about the universe as essentially

518
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,080
performing a computation yeah right

519
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,280
wolfram does this he turns it into

520
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,439
computation

521
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,759
you don't turn rockets into computation

522
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,919
yeah by the way when you say computation

523
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,759
in our conversation do you tend to think

524
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,480
of computation narrowly in the way

525
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,480
touring thought of computation

526
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,079
it's it's gotten very

527
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,360
okay

528
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,720
you know

529
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,678
squishy yeah squishy okay

530
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,640
um

531
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,320
but

532
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,240
computation in the way turing thinks

533
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,279
about it and the way most people think

534
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,440
about it

535
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:29,918
actually fits very well with

536
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,160
thinking like a hunter-gatherer

537
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,080
there are places and there can be stuff

538
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,000
in places and the stuff in places can

539
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,599
change and it stays there until someone

540
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,440
changes it

541
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,399
and it's this

542
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,038
metaphor of place and container which

543
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,080
you know is a combination of our

544
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,200
place cells in our hippocampus and uh

545
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,159
cortex

546
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,519
but this is this is how we use metaphors

547
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,160
for mostly to think about and when we

548
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,240
get outside of our metaphor range we

549
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,880
have to invent tools which we can sort

550
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,200
of

551
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,919
switch on to you so calculus is an

552
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,720
example of a tool it can do stuff that

553
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,559
our raw reasoning can't do and we've got

554
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,519
conventions of when you can use it or

555
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:11,599
not

556
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,240
but sometimes um

557
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,639
you know people try to all the time we

558
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,880
always try to get physical metaphors for

559
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,038
things which is why

560
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,720
quantum mechanics has been such a

561
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,400
problem for a hundred years because it's

562
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,319
a particle no it's a wave it's got to be

563
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,080
something we understand and i say no

564
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,319
it's some weird mathematical logic

565
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,678
that's different from those but we want

566
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,639
that metaphor

567
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,559
well you know i i suspect that that you

568
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,559
know 100 years or 200 years from now

569
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,000
neither quantum mechanics nor nor dark

570
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,359
matter will be talked about in the same

571
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,319
terms you know in the same way that um

572
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,119
lodges theory eventually went away

573
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,359
because

574
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,000
it just wasn't an adequate explanatory

575
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,959
metaphor you know that metaphor was the

576
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,200
stuff

577
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,759
there is stuff in

578
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,120
the burning the burning is in the matter

579
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,359
because it turns out the burning was

580
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,759
outside the matter it was the oxygen

581
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,479
so our desire for metaphor and combined

582
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:09,119
with our limited cognitive capabilities

583
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,960
gets us into trouble that's my argument

584
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,558
in this book now and people say well

585
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
what is it then and i say well i wish i

586
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,879
knew that i tried to talk about that but

587
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,200
i you know give some ideas but so so

588
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,600
this is the three things computation is

589
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,640
sort of a particular thing we use

590
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,839
um

591
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,000
uh

592
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,359
oh can i tell you one beautiful thing

593
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,359
one yes

594
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,199
so you know i used an example of a thing

595
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,678
that's different from computation you

596
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,080
hit a drum and it vibrates and there are

597
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,280
some some stationary points on the drum

598
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,720
surface you know because the waves are

599
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,798
going up and down the stationary points

600
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,720
now

601
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,879
you could compute them

602
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,038
to arbitrary position

603
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,720
um but the drum just knows them the drum

604
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,720
doesn't have to compute

605
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,798
what was the very first computer program

606
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,240
ever written by ada lovelace

607
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:57,918
to compute bernoulli numbers and

608
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,159
bernoulli numbers are exactly what you

609
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,960
need to find those stable points in the

610
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,000
drum's surface wow anyway and there was

611
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,000
a bug in her program

612
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,918
the arguments to divide were reversed in

613
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,079
one place

614
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,200
and it still worked well she never got

615
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,798
to run it they never built the

616
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,159
analytical engine she wrote the program

617
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,158
without without it you know

618
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,079
uh so so computation computation is sort

619
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,120
of you know a thing that's

620
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:28,720
become dominant as a metaphor but yeah

621
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,599
is it the right metaphor

622
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,400
um

623
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,079
all three of these four fields adopted

624
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,200
computation and

625
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,720
you know the

626
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,279
a lot of it swirls around warren

627
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,759
mcculloch and his all his students and

628
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,200
he funded a lot of people

629
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,200
um

630
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,880
and uh

631
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,880
and and our human metaphors our

632
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,000
limitations to human thinking will play

633
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,640
into this

634
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,720
the

635
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
three themes of the book

636
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,480
so i have a little to say about

637
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,359
computation

638
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,038
so

639
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,639
uh

640
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,000
so you're saying that there is a gap

641
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,840
between the computer or the the the

642
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,919
machine that performs computation

643
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:12,158
and this machine

644
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,880
that appears to have consciousness

645
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,799
and intelligence yeah can we um that

646
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,880
piece of meat in your head piece of meat

647
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:21,200
and maybe it's not just the meat in your

648
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,200
head it's the rest of you too i mean you

649
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,000
have you have you actually have a neural

650
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,200
system in your gut um i tend to also

651
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,720
believe

652
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,480
not believe but

653
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,759
we're now dancing around things we don't

654
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,640
know but

655
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,558
i tend to believe other humans are

656
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,880
important

657
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,278
like so we're almost like

658
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,880
i i just don't think we would ever have

659
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,880
achieved the level of intelligence we

660
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
have with other humans

661
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,960
i'm not saying so confidently but i have

662
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,520
an intuition that some of the

663
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,400
intelligence is in the interaction yeah

664
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,639
and and i think you know i think it it

665
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,038
seems to be very likely again we you

666
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,840
know this is speculation but

667
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,839
we our species and probably um

668
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,480
probably in the end those to some extent

669
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,480
because you can find uh old bones where

670
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,839
they seem to be counting on them by

671
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,798
putting notches

672
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,359
um that when the in the neanderthals are

673
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,599
done we are able to put um

674
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,439
some of our stuff outside our body into

675
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,399
the world and then other people can

676
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,320
share it

677
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,759
and then we get these tools that become

678
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,200
shared tools and so there's a whole

679
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,919
coupling that

680
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,200
would not occur in you know

681
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,200
the single

682
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,840
deep learning network which was fed you

683
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,038
know all of literature or something

684
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,599
yeah the the the neural network can't um

685
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,839
step outside of itself but is there

686
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,480
is there some um

687
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:47,599
can we explore this dark room

688
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,200
a little bit and try to get at something

689
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,839
what what is the magic where does the

690
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,679
magic come from in the human brain that

691
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,119
creates the mind

692
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,640
what's your sense

693
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,038
as scientists

694
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,720
that try to understand it and try to

695
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:05,599
build it what are the directions that

696
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,079
if followed might be productive is it

697
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,639
creative interactive robots

698
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,158
is it creating large deep neural

699
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,400
networks that

700
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,159
do like self-supervised learning and

701
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,840
just like we'll we'll

702
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,520
we'll discover that when you make

703
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,678
something large enough some interesting

704
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,599
things will emerge is it through physics

705
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,559
and chemistry biology like artificial

706
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:29,119
life angle like we'll sneak up in this

707
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,480
four quadrant matrix that you mentioned

708
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,079
is there anything

709
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,759
you're you're most if you had to bet all

710
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,519
your money

711
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:36,879
financial advice i wouldn't

712
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,519
okay so

713
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,039
every intelligence we know and includes

714
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,079
you know animal intelligence dog

715
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,079
intelligence you know

716
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,240
octopus intelligence which is very

717
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,000
different sort of architecture from from

718
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,519
us

719
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,200
all the intelligences we know

720
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,278
perceive the world

721
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,360
in some way

722
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,558
and then have action

723
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,278
in the world

724
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:05,359
but they're able to

725
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:09,359
perceive objects

726
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:11,439
in a way which is actually pretty damn

727
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,959
for not phenomenal

728
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,320
and surprising

729
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,840
you know we tend to think you know that

730
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,839
that that uh

731
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:23,599
the box over here between us which is a

732
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:25,199
sound box i think is a blue box but

733
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,759
blueness

734
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,600
is something that we construct with with

735
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,000
um

736
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,319
color constancy it's not a it's not a

737
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,079
it's not the blueness is not a direct

738
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,158
function of the

739
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,399
photons we're receiving it's actually

740
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,840
context you know which is why

741
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,038
um

742
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,158
you can turn

743
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:46,240
you know

744
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,278
maybe seen the examples where

745
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,200
um

746
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:52,640
someone turns a stop sign into a

747
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,159
some other sort of sign by just putting

748
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,600
a couple of marks on them and the deep

749
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,159
learning system gets it wrong everyone

750
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,519
says but the stop sign is red you know

751
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,960
why is it why is it think it's the other

752
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,960
sort of science because redness is not

753
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,558
intrinsic in just the photons it's

754
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,159
actually a construction of an

755
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,960
understanding of the whole world and the

756
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,480
relationship between objects to get

757
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,360
color constancy

758
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,679
um but our tendency in order that we get

759
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:17,519
an archive paper really quickly is you

760
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,038
just show a lot of data and give the

761
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,398
labels and hope it figures it out but

762
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,440
it's not figuring it out in the same way

763
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:25,359
we do we have a very complex perceptual

764
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,200
understanding of the world dogs have a

765
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,439
very different perceptual understanding

766
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,679
based on smell they go smell smell a

767
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,880
post they can tell

768
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,480
how many

769
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,320
you know different dogs have visited in

770
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,759
the last 10 hours and how long ago

771
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,759
there's all sorts of stuff that we just

772
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,440
don't perceive about the world and just

773
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,798
taking a single snapshot is not

774
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,120
perceiving about the world it's not

775
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:48,398
seeing that the registration between us

776
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,319
and the object

777
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,959
and registration is a

778
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:57,119
a philosophical concept brian cantwell

779
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,200
smith talks about a lot very difficult

780
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,079
squirmy thing to understand

781
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,919
but i think none of our systems do that

782
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,839
we've always talked about nai about the

783
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,120
symbol grounding problem how our symbols

784
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,079
that we talk about are grounded in the

785
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,678
world

786
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,759
and when deep learning came along and

787
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,480
started labeling images people said ah

788
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,480
the grounding problem has been solved no

789
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,319
the labeling problem was solved with

790
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,558
some percentage accuracy which is

791
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,240
different from the grounding problem

792
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,558
so you uh

793
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,599
there's uh you agree with hans marvik

794
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,000
and

795
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,558
what's called the marvex paradox

796
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,079
that highlights this counterintuitive

797
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,000
notion that

798
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,439
reasoning

799
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,200
is easy

800
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,440
but perception

801
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,798
and mobility are hard

802
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,240
yeah we shared an office when um when i

803
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,639
was working on computer vision and he

804
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,558
was working on his first mobile robot

805
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,240
what was those conversations like they

806
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,480
were great

807
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,480
so do you still kind of maybe you can

808
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,159
elaborate and do you still believe this

809
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,079
kind of notion that

810
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,000
perception is really uh hard and like

811
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,079
can you make sense of why we humans have

812
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,240
this poor intuition about what's hard

813
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,639
and not well well let me let me give us

814
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,640
sort of a

815
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,240
an another another story sure

816
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:18,480
if you go back to you know the original

817
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:21,599
um you know teams working on ai um

818
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,839
from the late 50s into the 60s you know

819
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:28,240
and you go to the ai lab at mit

820
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:30,319
um who was it that was doing that was a

821
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,440
bunch of really smart kids who got into

822
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:33,359
mit

823
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,360
and they were intelligent

824
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,519
so what's intelligence about well the

825
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,959
stuff they were good at playing chess

826
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,119
doing integrals

827
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,440
that was that was hard stuff

828
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,678
yeah but you know a baby could see stuff

829
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,880
that wasn't that wasn't intelligent

830
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,080
anyone could do that that's not

831
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,399
intelligence

832
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:52,879
and so it you know this there was this

833
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,798
intuition that the hard stuff is the

834
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,799
things they were good at

835
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,240
and the easy stuff was the stuff that

836
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,839
everyone could do

837
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,880
yeah and maybe i'm overplaying it a

838
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,278
little bit but i think there's an

839
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,360
element of that yeah i mean there

840
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,839
i don't know how much truth there is to

841
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,359
uh like chess for

842
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,918
example has was for the longest time

843
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,839
seen as the highest um

844
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,720
level of intellect

845
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:16,558
right

846
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,240
until we got computer so we're better at

847
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:19,678
it than people and then

848
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,519
we realized you know if you go back to

849
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,000
the 90s you'll see you know the stories

850
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,720
in the press around when when

851
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,398
kasparov was beaten by deep blue oh this

852
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,440
is the end of all sorts of things

853
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:31,599
computers are going to be able to do

854
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,000
anything from now on and we saw exactly

855
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:37,278
the same stories with alpha zero the

856
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,038
go playing program yeah

857
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:41,200
but still to me

858
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,200
reasoning is a special thing

859
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,120
and perhaps no way we actually we're

860
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,960
really bad at reasoning we just use

861
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,759
these analogies based on our how to

862
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,360
gather intuitions but why is that not

863
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:54,158
don't you think the ability to construct

864
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:56,398
metaphor is a really powerful thing oh

865
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,919
yeah it is stories it is that's it's the

866
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:59,439
constructing the metaphor and

867
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,278
registering that yeah something

868
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,960
complicated

869
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,798
is not what we're doing with

870
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,240
with vision too and

871
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,558
we're telling our stories we're

872
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,679
constructing good models of the world

873
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:14,000
yeah yeah but but um

874
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,159
i think we we jumped between what we're

875
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,599
capable of and how we're doing it right

876
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,360
there there was a little confusion that

877
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,678
went on um

878
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,519
uh as we were telling each other stories

879
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,600
yes exactly

880
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,519
trying to dilute each other no i i just

881
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:30,158
think uh i'm not exactly so i'm trying

882
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,278
to pull apart this marvex paradox

883
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,960
i don't view it as a paradox

884
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:37,038
what did evolution what did evolution

885
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,558
spend its time on yes it spent its time

886
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,038
on getting us to perceive and move in

887
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,599
the world that was you know 600 million

888
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,519
years as multi-cell creatures doing that

889
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,278
and then it was you know relatively

890
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,319
recent that we that we you know were

891
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,440
able to

892
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:54,158
um hunt or or gather or you know even

893
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,720
even animals hunting that's much more

894
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:00,640
recent and then and then anything that

895
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,640
we you know speech uh language those

896
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,200
things are you know a couple of hundred

897
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,399
thousand years probably if if if that

898
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,519
long and then agriculture 10 000 years

899
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:11,518
you know

900
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,278
all that stuff was built on top of those

901
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,839
earlier things which took a long time to

902
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,398
develop so if you then look at the

903
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,918
engineering of these things so

904
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:23,839
building it into robots

905
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,799
what's the hardest part of robotics do

906
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,639
you think

907
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,839
as uh through the decades that you

908
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,840
worked on robots

909
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,240
in the context of what we're talking

910
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,240
about vision you know perception

911
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,880
the actual sort of the

912
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,240
the biomechanics of movement

913
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,559
i'm kind of drawing parallels here

914
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,240
between humans and machines always like

915
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,918
uh what do you think is the hardest part

916
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,359
of robotics

917
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:52,720
i sort of think all of them

918
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:54,639
there are no easy parts to do well um

919
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,278
we we sort of go reductionist and we

920
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,519
reduce it to if only we had all the

921
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,159
location of all the points in 3d yeah

922
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,480
things would be great

923
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,240
you know if only we had labels on the on

924
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,880
the images you know

925
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,720
things would be great but you know as as

926
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,480
we see that's not good enough

927
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,399
some deeper

928
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,640
understanding but if you if i came to

929
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:20,079
you and i could solve

930
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,679
one category of problems in robotics

931
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,599
uh instantly

932
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,480
what would give you uh the greatest

933
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,240
pleasure

934
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,640
[Laughter]

935
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,558
i mean is it uh

936
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,640
you know you you look at robots that

937
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:35,440
manipulate objects

938
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,038
uh

939
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,840
what's hard about that

940
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:42,640
you know is it uh the perception

941
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:45,278
is it the uh the reasoning about the

942
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,880
world like common sense reasoning

943
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:48,640
is it the actual

944
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,559
building a robot that's able to interact

945
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,880
with the world

946
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,639
is it like human aspects of a robot

947
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,480
that's interacting with humans and that

948
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,360
that game theory of how they work well

949
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,038
together well let's talk about

950
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,038
manipulation for a second because i had

951
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,158
this really blinding

952
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,480
moment

953
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,640
uh uh you know i'm a grandfather so

954
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,679
grandfather's had blinding moments yes

955
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,480
just a

956
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,398
three or four miles from here

957
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,440
last year my

958
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:18,239
16 month old grandson was in his new

959
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,280
house first time right

960
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,358
first time in this house and he'd never

961
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,839
been able to get to a window before but

962
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,838
this had some low windows and he goes up

963
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,398
to this window with a handle on it that

964
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:32,878
he's never seen before and he's got one

965
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,960
hand pushing the window and the other

966
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:36,960
hand turning the handle to open the

967
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,000
window

968
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,159
he he knew he two different hands

969
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,159
two different things he knew how to how

970
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,240
to put together yeah

971
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,838
and he's 16 months old and there you are

972
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,838
watching an awesome

973
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:56,398
in an environment environment he'd never

974
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,320
seen before mechanism how did he do that

975
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:00,719
yes that's a good question how did he do

976
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,880
that that's why

977
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,039
it's like okay like you could see the

978
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,400
the leap of genius from using one hand

979
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,759
to perform a task to combining

980
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,440
doing i mean first of all in

981
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,200
manipulation that's really difficult

982
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,920
it's like two hands

983
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,358
both necessary to complete the action

984
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,119
and completely different and he'd never

985
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:21,119
seen a window open before

986
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,719
but in third somehow handle opened

987
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,639
something yeah there may have been a lot

988
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,399
of

989
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,759
slightly different failure cases that

990
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,519
you didn't see

991
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,599
yeah not with a window but with other

992
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,719
objects of turning and twisting in

993
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,240
handles

994
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,519
you know there's a there's a great

995
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:41,118
counter to

996
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,039
um you know

997
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,240
reinforced reinforcement learning will

998
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,079
just give you know the robot um

999
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,239
or you give the robot plenty of time to

1000
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,359
try everything yes actually

1001
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:55,118
can i tell a little side story here

1002
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,679
so i'm in um

1003
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,480
deep mind in london

1004
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,639
is

1005
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,320
three four years ago where

1006
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,279
um you know there's a big google

1007
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,640
building

1008
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,000
and then you go inside and you go

1009
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,358
through there's more security and then

1010
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,358
you get to deep mind where the other

1011
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:10,719
google employees can't go yeah and i'm

1012
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,400
in a

1013
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,319
i'm in a conference room bayer

1014
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,039
conference room with some of the people

1015
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,119
and

1016
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,400
they tell me about their reinforcement

1017
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,320
learning experiment with uh robots um

1018
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,480
um which um

1019
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,119
are just trying stuff out and they're my

1020
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,880
robots they're they're sawyers that we

1021
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,240
sold them um

1022
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,640
uh and they really like them because

1023
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,559
sawyers are compliant and can sense

1024
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,960
forces so they don't break when it's

1025
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,480
bashing into walls they they stop and

1026
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,240
they do stuff

1027
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,320
and you know so you just let the robot

1028
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,919
do stuff and eventually it figures stuff

1029
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,440
out by the way so

1030
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,240
we're talking about robot manipulation

1031
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,200
so robot arms and so on yeah so he's a

1032
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:53,679
robot yeah um just to go what's sawyer

1033
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,439
so here's a robot arm that my company

1034
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,639
rethink robotics yeah built thank you

1035
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,358
for the context

1036
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,960
sorry okay cool so we're indeed mine

1037
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,719
and the you know it's in the next room

1038
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,559
these robots are just bashing around to

1039
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:06,799
try and use reinforcement learning to

1040
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,799
learn how to act and can i go see them

1041
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,800
oh no they're secret they're all my

1042
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,119
robots they're a secret

1043
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,079
that's hilarious okay anyway the point

1044
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,920
is you know this idea that you just let

1045
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,240
uh reinforcement learning figure

1046
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,680
everything out is so counter to how a

1047
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,879
kid does stuff

1048
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,199
so

1049
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,039
again story about my grandson i gave him

1050
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,639
this this uh

1051
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,960
box that had lots of different lock

1052
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,799
mechanisms he didn't randomly you know

1053
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,960
when he was 18 months old he didn't

1054
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,680
randomly try to touch every surface or

1055
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,920
push everything he found he could see

1056
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,399
what where the mechanism was and he

1057
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,559
started exploring the mechanism for each

1058
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,960
of these different lock mechanisms

1059
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:50,239
and there was reinforcement no doubt of

1060
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,639
some sort going on there but he applied

1061
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,559
a pre-filter which cut down the search

1062
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,519
space dramatically

1063
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:57,679
i i

1064
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,679
i wonder to what level we're able to

1065
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,358
introspect what's going on

1066
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,440
because what's also possible is you have

1067
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,119
something like reinforcement learning

1068
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,960
going on in the mind in the space of

1069
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,280
imagination so like you have a good

1070
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,358
model of the world you're predicting and

1071
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,800
you may be running those tens of

1072
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:15,759
thousands of like

1073
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,359
loops but you're like as a human you're

1074
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,599
just looking at yourself trying to tell

1075
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:22,719
a story of what happened and it might

1076
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,559
seem simple but maybe there's a lot of

1077
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,399
computation going on

1078
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,639
whatever it is but there's also a

1079
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,519
mechanism that's being built up it's not

1080
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,759
just

1081
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,599
random search

1082
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,119
mechanism prunes it

1083
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:40,000
dramatically yeah that that pruning

1084
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,760
uh that pruning stuff but it doesn't

1085
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,920
it's possible that that's

1086
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,520
so you don't think that's akin to a

1087
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,599
neural network inside of reinforcement

1088
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:50,000
learning algorithm

1089
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,800
is it possible

1090
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,480
it's

1091
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,280
yeah until it's possible i uh but but i

1092
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,199
you know

1093
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,920
um

1094
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,039
i

1095
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,400
i i'll be incredibly surprised if that

1096
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,639
happens i'll also be incredibly

1097
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,240
surprised that you know after all the

1098
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,799
decades that i've been doing this where

1099
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,078
every every few years someone thinks now

1100
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,599
we've got it

1101
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,640
now we've got it

1102
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,640
you know

1103
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,759
four or five years ago i was saying i

1104
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:16,719
don't think we've got it yet and

1105
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,359
everyone was saying no you don't

1106
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,480
understand how powerful hey i had people

1107
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:21,838
tell me you don't understand how

1108
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,400
powerful it is

1109
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:28,400
um i you know i i i sort of had a a

1110
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,480
a track record of what the world had

1111
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,119
done to think well this is no different

1112
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,719
from before oh we have bigger computers

1113
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,000
we had bigger computers in the 90s and

1114
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:40,000
we could do more ship stuff

1115
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,920
but okay so let me let me let me push

1116
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,838
back because i i'm i'm generally sort of

1117
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,240
optimistic and tried to find the beauty

1118
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:46,239
in things

1119
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,679
i think there's a lot of uh

1120
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,000
surprising and beautiful things that

1121
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:56,480
neural networks this new generation of

1122
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,719
deep learning revolution has revealed to

1123
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,559
me it has continually been very

1124
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,439
surprising the kind of things it's able

1125
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,199
to do now generalizing that over saying

1126
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,400
like this we've solved intelligence

1127
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,199
that's another

1128
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,720
uh big leap but is there something

1129
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,719
surprising and beautiful to you about

1130
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:14,399
neural networks that where actually you

1131
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:18,000
set back and said

1132
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,000
i i did not expect this

1133
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,680
oh i think i think their performance

1134
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,440
their performance on imagenet was

1135
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:28,318
shocking the computer vision those early

1136
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,639
days was just very like wow okay

1137
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,400
that doesn't mean that they're solving

1138
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,559
everything in computer vision

1139
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,800
we need to solve or in

1140
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,159
vision for robots what about alpha zero

1141
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,680
and self-play mechanisms and

1142
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:42,399
reinforcement learning isn't that yeah

1143
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,078
that was all in in donald mickey's 1961

1144
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,079
paper um

1145
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,560
everything that was there which

1146
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,480
introduced reinforcement learning um no

1147
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,639
but come on so no you're talking about

1148
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,358
the actual techniques but isn't it

1149
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:58,719
surprising to you the level it's able to

1150
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:01,920
achieve with no human supervision

1151
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:01,919
of chess play like

1152
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:08,560
to me there's a big big difference maybe

1153
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,680
blue and maybe what that's saying

1154
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,119
is how overblown our view of ourselves

1155
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,719
is

1156
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:20,160
you know we that chest is easy

1157
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:23,078
yeah i mean i i

1158
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,679
i came across this

1159
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:28,079
1946 report

1160
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,519
that um and i'd seen this as a kid in

1161
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,880
one of those books that my mother had

1162
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:35,759
given me actually

1163
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,680
um 1946 report which pitted uh

1164
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,680
someone with an abacus against an

1165
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,559
electronic calculator

1166
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:45,519
and he beat the electronic calculator

1167
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,358
you know so there at that point was well

1168
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,358
humans are still better than

1169
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:52,159
machines are calculating are you

1170
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:53,759
surprised today that a machine can you

1171
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,000
know do a billion floating point

1172
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,319
operations a second and you know you're

1173
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,519
you're puzzling for for minutes through

1174
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:00,960
one

1175
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,679
so you know

1176
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,599
i i am i mean i i don't know but i am

1177
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,279
certainly surprised

1178
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,400
there's something

1179
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,400
uh to me different about learning

1180
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
so system that's able to learn learning

1181
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,039
now see now you get into one of the

1182
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,920
deadly sins

1183
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,039
because

1184
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,720
of using terms uh overly broadly yeah i

1185
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,559
mean there's so many different forms of

1186
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,000
learning yeah and so many different

1187
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,239
forms you know i learned my way around

1188
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,559
the city i learned to play chess i

1189
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,239
learnt latin um i learned to ride a

1190
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,799
bicycle all of those are

1191
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,000
you know are very different capabilities

1192
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,440
yeah and

1193
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,079
if someone

1194
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,159
you know has a

1195
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,400
in you know in the old days people would

1196
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,318
write a paper about learning something

1197
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,160
now the corporate

1198
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,759
press office puts out a press release

1199
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:52,000
about how

1200
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,880
company x has

1201
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,119
has

1202
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,880
is leading the world because they have a

1203
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,880
system that can

1204
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,079
yeah but here's the thing okay so what

1205
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,838
is learning

1206
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,440
what i'm referring to there's many

1207
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:05,759
things but

1208
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,559
a suitcase would it's a suitcase word

1209
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,079
but

1210
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,078
loosely

1211
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,760
there's a dumb system

1212
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,680
and over time

1213
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,680
it becomes smart

1214
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,199
well it becomes less dumb at the thing

1215
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:19,919
that it's doing yeah smart is a

1216
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:21,598
different mass is a loaded word yes less

1217
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,519
less dominant thing is again it gets

1218
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,400
better performance under some measure

1219
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:28,800
yeah and some set of conditions at that

1220
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,240
thing and and most of these learning

1221
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,119
algorithms

1222
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:33,358
um

1223
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,079
uh learning systems

1224
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:38,000
fail when you change the conditions just

1225
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,200
a little bit in a way that humans don't

1226
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
so right i was at deepmind

1227
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:44,239
um

1228
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,079
the alphago had just come out

1229
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,639
and i said what would have happened if

1230
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,680
you'd given a 21 by 21 board instead of

1231
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,279
a 19 by 19 board they said fail totally

1232
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,639
but a human player would actually you

1233
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,760
know well

1234
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,199
would actually have to play again and

1235
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,920
actually funny enough if you look at

1236
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,519
deepmind's work uh since then

1237
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,480
uh they are pers

1238
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,759
uh

1239
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,519
they're presenting a lot of algorithms

1240
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,359
that would do uh

1241
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,280
that would do well at the at the bigger

1242
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,679
board so they're slowly expanding this

1243
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,079
generalization i mean to me there's a

1244
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,639
core element there i think it is very

1245
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,920
surprising to me that even in a

1246
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:21,838
constrained game of chess or go

1247
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,119
that through self-play by a system

1248
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:26,000
playing itself

1249
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,640
that can it can achieve

1250
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,119
super human level performance

1251
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,799
through learning alone so like okay so

1252
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,400
so you know you you don't find them as

1253
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,200
you did it in search of that you didn't

1254
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,079
you didn't like it when i referred to

1255
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:42,000
donald mickey's 1961 paper

1256
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,560
there in the second

1257
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,960
part of it it came a year later they had

1258
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,960
self-play on an electronic computer

1259
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,760
at

1260
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,440
it's tic-tac-toe okay

1261
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,520
but it learned to play tic-tac-toe

1262
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,960
through self-play that's not and i've

1263
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:56,639
learned to play optimally what i'm

1264
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,159
saying is

1265
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,559
uh i

1266
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:03,440
okay i have a little bit of a bias but

1267
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:05,519
i i find ideas beautiful but only when

1268
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,679
they actually

1269
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,599
realize the promise that's another level

1270
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,199
of beauty like for example

1271
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,960
uh what the

1272
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:14,799
bezos and elon musk are doing with

1273
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,358
rockets we've had rockets for a long

1274
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,960
time but doing reusable cheap rockets

1275
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:20,318
it's very impressive

1276
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,960
in the same way

1277
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:26,239
i okay yeah i would have not predicted

1278
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,400
first of all when i was uh

1279
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:30,239
started and fell in love with ai

1280
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,639
the game of go was seemed to be

1281
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,799
impossible to solve okay so i thought

1282
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,799
maybe you know i

1283
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,200
maybe it'd be possible to maybe have big

1284
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,119
leaps in a moore's law style of way in

1285
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,559
computation i'll be able to solve it but

1286
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,960
i would never have guessed that you

1287
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:49,440
could learn your way

1288
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,440
however

1289
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,559
i mean

1290
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,000
in the narrow sense of learning learn

1291
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,920
your way to

1292
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
to to beat the best people in the world

1293
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,760
at the game of go without human

1294
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,800
supervision not studying the game of

1295
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,040
experts

1296
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,280
but okay so so that's just

1297
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,800
using a different learning technique yes

1298
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,280
arthur samuel

1299
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,200
in the early 60s and he was the first

1300
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,079
person to use machine learning

1301
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:16,159
got had a program that could beat the

1302
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,560
world champion at checkers

1303
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,799
now yes so and that at the time was

1304
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:23,119
considered amazing by the way arthur

1305
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,800
samuel had some fantastic advantages

1306
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,760
yeah do you want to hear arthur samuel's

1307
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,079
advantage

1308
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,400
two things one he was at the 1956 um ai

1309
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,079
conference i knew arthur later in life

1310
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,000
he was at stanford when i was scratching

1311
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,599
there he wore a tie and a jacket every

1312
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,880
day the rest of us didn't

1313
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,039
um he's a

1314
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:46,318
delightful man delightful man um

1315
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:48,719
it turns out claude shannon in a 1950

1316
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,159
scientific american article

1317
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,078
uh outlined

1318
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,719
on chess playing outline the learning

1319
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,839
mechanism that arthur samuel used

1320
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,439
and they had met in 1956. i assume there

1321
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:00,559
was some communication but i don't know

1322
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,240
that for sure

1323
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,719
but arthur samuel

1324
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,879
had been a vacuum tube engineer on

1325
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:09,039
getting reliability of vacuum tubes and

1326
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,960
then had overseen

1327
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,358
the first transistorized computers at

1328
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,280
ibm and in those days

1329
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:18,159
before you shipped a computer you ran it

1330
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,200
for a week to see to get early failures

1331
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:24,318
so he had this whole farm of computers

1332
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:26,879
running random code

1333
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:29,119
for hours and hours

1334
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,440
a week for each computer we had a whole

1335
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,039
bunch of them so he ran his chess

1336
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,679
learning program

1337
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:39,679
with self play

1338
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:42,000
on on ibm's production line he had more

1339
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:43,919
computation available to him than anyone

1340
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,079
else in the world and then he was able

1341
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,079
to produce a chess playing program i

1342
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,920
mean a checkers playing program that

1343
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:53,359
could beat the world champion

1344
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,599
so that's amazing the question is

1345
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:58,000
what i mean surprised i don't just mean

1346
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,519
it's nice to have that accomplishment

1347
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,800
is there is

1348
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,358
a stepping

1349
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,160
towards something that feels

1350
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:05,598
uh

1351
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,279
more intelligent

1352
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,119
than before yeah and the question is

1353
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,400
that's in your view of the world okay

1354
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,240
well let me then

1355
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,639
it doesn't mean i'm wrong

1356
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,799
no no it doesn't

1357
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,199
so the question is if we keep taking

1358
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,640
steps like that how far that takes us

1359
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,399
are we going to build a better

1360
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,960
recommender systems are we going to

1361
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,039
build better robots or will we solve

1362
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,159
intelligence so

1363
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:31,519
you know i'm putting my bet on

1364
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,480
um

1365
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,639
but still missing a whole lot a lot um

1366
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,599
and and why would i say that well in

1367
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:41,519
these games they're all um you know 100

1368
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,800
information games

1369
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,079
but again but

1370
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:48,400
each of these systems is a very uh short

1371
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,359
description of the current state

1372
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,440
um

1373
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,000
which is different from registering and

1374
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,480
perception in the world okay which gets

1375
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,760
back to my rfx paradox i'm definitely

1376
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,760
not saying that uh

1377
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,359
chess is somehow harder than uh

1378
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,400
perception

1379
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,719
or

1380
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,559
any kind of even any kind of robotics in

1381
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,799
the physical world i i definitely think

1382
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,200
is is way harder than the game of chess

1383
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,200
so i was always much more impressed by

1384
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,480
like the workings of the human mind

1385
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:18,480
that's incredible the human mind is

1386
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,280
incredible i've i believe that from the

1387
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,960
very beginning i want to be a

1388
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,000
psychiatrist for the longest time i

1389
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,358
always thought that's way more

1390
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,679
incredible in the game of chess i think

1391
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:27,679
the game of chess is uh

1392
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,759
i love the olympics it's just another

1393
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:32,078
example of us humans picking a task and

1394
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,839
then agreeing that a million humans will

1395
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,318
dedicate their whole life to that task

1396
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:39,039
and that's the cool thing that the human

1397
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:40,960
mind is able to focus on one task and

1398
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:43,358
then compete against each other and

1399
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,480
achieve like weirdly incredible levels

1400
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:46,318
of performance

1401
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,880
that's the aspect of chess that's super

1402
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,558
cool not that chess in itself uh is

1403
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,559
really difficult it's it's it's like the

1404
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,800
framazlast theorem is not in itself to

1405
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,400
me that interesting the fact that uh

1406
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,920
thousands of people have been struggling

1407
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,920
to solve that particular problem is

1408
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,519
fascinating so can i tell you my disease

1409
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,200
in this way sure

1410
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,039
which actually is closer to what you're

1411
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,598
saying so as a child you know i was

1412
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,358
building various i called them computers

1413
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,359
they weren't general purpose computers

1414
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,039
ice cube tray the ice cube tray was one

1415
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,279
but i built other machines and what i

1416
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:17,519
like to build was machines that could

1417
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,680
beat adults at a game and they couldn't

1418
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:22,480
they adults couldn't beat my machine

1419
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:25,358
yeah so you were like uh that's powerful

1420
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,400
like that's uh that's a way to rebel

1421
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:29,279
yeah i i by the way um

1422
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,039
did you

1423
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,440
when was the first time you built

1424
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,440
something that outperformed you do you

1425
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,200
remember like well

1426
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,679
i knew how it worked i was probably nine

1427
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:42,000
years old and i built a thing that

1428
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:43,199
it was a game where you you take turns

1429
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,519
in taking

1430
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:47,118
matches from a pile and

1431
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:48,400
either the one who takes the last one or

1432
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,480
the one who doesn't take the last one

1433
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,519
wins i forget and so it was pretty easy

1434
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,440
to build that out of wires and nails and

1435
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,639
little coils that were like plugging in

1436
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,880
the number and a few light bulbs

1437
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:03,358
um the one the one i was prouder of i

1438
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,039
was 12 when i built a

1439
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,440
a thing out of old

1440
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:11,440
telephone switchboard switches that

1441
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,519
could uh always uh win at tic-tac-toe

1442
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,838
and that was a much harder circuit

1443
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,318
to design but again it was just

1444
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:21,039
it was no active components it was just

1445
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:23,358
three position switches empty x

1446
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,558
zero

1447
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:27,039
and um

1448
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:29,599
and nine of them and and a light bulb

1449
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:31,358
one which which move it wanted next and

1450
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,920
then yeah the human would go and move

1451
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:36,400
that see there's magic in that creation

1452
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,838
yeah yeah i tend to uh i tend to see

1453
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,960
magic in robots that

1454
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:45,199
like i i also think that intelligence is

1455
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,519
uh is a little bit overrated i think we

1456
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:49,118
can have deep connections with robots

1457
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,599
very soon

1458
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:54,480
and well we'll come back to connections

1459
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,880
robot sure but but i do want to say

1460
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,960
i i don't i i think people too many

1461
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,519
people make the mistake of seeing that

1462
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,000
magic and thinking well we'll just

1463
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:06,000
continue you know but each each one of

1464
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,318
those is a hard-fought battle for the

1465
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,318
next step the next step yes i mean the

1466
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:11,920
open question here is and this is why

1467
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:15,119
i'm playing devil's advocate but i often

1468
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,480
do when i read your blog post in my mind

1469
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:20,079
because i have like this eternal

1470
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,440
optimism is it's not clear to me

1471
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,280
so i don't do what obviously the

1472
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,920
journalists do or they give into the

1473
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,280
hype but it's not obvious to me how many

1474
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,280
steps away we are from

1475
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,640
from uh

1476
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,240
truly

1477
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,199
transformational

1478
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:39,039
understanding of what it means um

1479
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,199
to build intelligence systems like or

1480
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,800
how to build intelligence systems

1481
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,399
i'm also aware of the whole history of

1482
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,280
artificial intelligence which is where

1483
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,960
your deep grounding of this is

1484
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:53,119
is there's been an optimism for decades

1485
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,280
and that optimism just like reading old

1486
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,160
optimism is absurd because people were

1487
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,920
like

1488
00:52:56,159 --> 00:53:00,159
this is they were saying things are

1489
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,440
trivial for decades since the 60s

1490
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,879
they're saying everything is true

1491
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,480
computer vision is trivial but

1492
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,640
i think my mind is

1493
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,880
working crisply enough to where i mean

1494
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:12,400
we can dig into if if you want i'm

1495
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,000
really surprised by

1496
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,838
the things deepmind has done i don't

1497
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,639
think they're so they're

1498
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:18,000
yet

1499
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:19,598
um

1500
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,199
close to solving intelligence but i'm

1501
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:25,599
not sure it's not 10 to 10 years away

1502
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:28,078
what i'm referring to is interesting to

1503
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,440
see when the engineering

1504
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,839
um

1505
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,920
it takes that idea to scale

1506
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:35,599
and this and the idea what and no it

1507
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,639
fools people

1508
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,559
okay honestly rodney if it was you me

1509
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:42,639
and demis inside a room forget the press

1510
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,880
forget all those things just as a

1511
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:47,519
scientist as a roboticist you know that

1512
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,880
wasn't surprising to you that at scale

1513
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,838
so we're talking about very large now

1514
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,920
okay okay let's pick one that's the most

1515
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:54,838
surprising to you okay please don't yell

1516
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,400
at me

1517
00:53:54,838 --> 00:53:58,239
gpt3

1518
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,838
okay

1519
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:00,879
i was honestly gonna bring that out okay

1520
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,920
thank you

1521
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:07,680
alpha zero alpha go alpha go zero alpha

1522
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:10,559
zero and then alpha fold one and two

1523
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,719
so are any do any of these kind of have

1524
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,559
this core of uh

1525
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,078
no forget usefulness or application or

1526
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,960
so on which you could argue for alpha

1527
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:21,280
fold like as a scientist

1528
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,480
was doors surprising to you that it

1529
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,480
worked

1530
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,079
as well as it did

1531
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,000
okay so if we're going to make the

1532
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,119
distinction between

1533
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,199
surprise and usefulness and and and

1534
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,079
i'll i have to explain

1535
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:38,318
this i would say alpha fold

1536
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,318
and

1537
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:41,599
one of the problems at the moment with

1538
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,358
alpha fold is

1539
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,640
you know it gets a lot of them right

1540
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:47,119
which is a surprise to me because

1541
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,838
they're a really complex thing uh but

1542
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,798
you don't know which ones it gets right

1543
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:52,798
which

1544
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,000
then is a bit of a problem now they've

1545
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:55,358
come out with a reason you mean the

1546
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,199
structure of the protein it gets a lot

1547
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,598
of those right yeah it's a it's

1548
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:01,279
surprising right yeah it's been a really

1549
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,280
hard problem so that was a surprise how

1550
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,599
many it gets right

1551
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,040
so far the usefulness is limited because

1552
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,160
you don't know which ones are right or

1553
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,519
not and now they've come out with a

1554
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,920
thing in the last few weeks which is

1555
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:16,159
trying to get a useful tool out of it

1556
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,318
and they may well do it um in that sense

1557
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,598
the least alpha fold is different

1558
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:21,920
because your

1559
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,079
alpha fold two is different

1560
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,838
because now it's producing data sets

1561
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,519
that are actually uh

1562
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:29,039
you know potentially revolutionizing

1563
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:31,280
computational biology like they will

1564
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,639
actually help a lot of people

1565
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,720
but you would say

1566
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:37,039
uh potentially revolutionizing we don't

1567
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:39,358
know yet but yeah that's true yeah but

1568
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:41,440
they're you know but i i i got you i

1569
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:44,639
mean this is okay so you know what this

1570
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,838
is gonna be so fun so let's go

1571
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:50,159
right into it speaking of robots that

1572
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:52,798
operate in the real world

1573
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:54,558
let's talk about self-driving cars

1574
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:55,519
oh

1575
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,920
okay

1576
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:59,679
because you do you have built robotics

1577
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,920
companies you're one of the greatest

1578
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:02,879
roboticists in history and that's not in

1579
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,680
space

1580
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,039
just in the space of ideas we would also

1581
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:08,318
probably talk about that but in the

1582
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:11,119
actual

1583
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:13,440
building and execution of businesses

1584
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,640
that make robots that are useful for

1585
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,838
people and that actually work in the

1586
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:17,838
real world and make money

1587
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:23,279
you also sometimes are critical

1588
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,118
of mr elon musk or less more

1589
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,040
specifically focused on this particular

1590
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,358
technology which is autopilot inside

1591
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:30,639
teslas

1592
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:33,119
what are your thoughts about tesla

1593
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,318
autopilot or more generally vision-based

1594
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:38,000
machine learning approach to

1595
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:40,639
semi-autonomous driving

1596
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,159
uh these are robots they're being used

1597
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:43,679
in the real world by hundreds of

1598
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:45,838
thousands of people

1599
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:45,838
and

1600
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,000
if you want to go there i can go there

1601
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,798
but that's not too much which there is

1602
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,199
let's say they're on par safety wise as

1603
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:59,119
humans currently meaning

1604
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:01,838
human alone versus human plus robot okay

1605
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,880
so first let me say i really like the

1606
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:06,239
car i came here in here today which is

1607
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,960
um a

1608
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:12,798
2021 um

1609
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:16,240
model uh mercedes e450

1610
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:18,079
i am impressed by the um

1611
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:20,639
machine vision

1612
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,839
sonar other things i'm impressed by what

1613
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:25,440
it can do i'm really impressed um

1614
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:28,960
with

1615
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:31,519
many aspects of it and and i'm

1616
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,000
um it's able to stay in lane is it uh oh

1617
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:34,960
yeah it does it does the lane stuff um

1618
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,599
it uh

1619
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,838
you know it's it's looking up on either

1620
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,920
side of me it's telling me about nearby

1621
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:43,920
cars or blind spots and so on yeah when

1622
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,838
i when i when i'm when i'm

1623
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,639
going in close to something in the park

1624
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:51,759
i get this beautiful gorgeous top-down

1625
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:54,798
view of the world i am impressed

1626
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,359
up the wazoo of how you know

1627
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:59,119
registered and metrical so it's like

1628
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:00,880
multiple cameras and it's all right

1629
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,119
together to produce the 360 view kind of

1630
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,119
360 view you know synthesized as though

1631
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,559
it's above the car and it is

1632
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,400
unbelievable

1633
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,240
i got this car in january it's the

1634
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,358
longest i've ever owned a car without

1635
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:16,798
digging it um so it's better than me

1636
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:19,279
for me and it together uh better so i'm

1637
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:23,838
not saying technology's um

1638
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,839
uh bad or not useful

1639
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,200
but here's my point yes

1640
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,440
it's

1641
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,239
it's a replay of the same movie

1642
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,159
okay

1643
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:37,358
so maybe you've seen me ask this

1644
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:40,318
question before but um

1645
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:40,318
when um

1646
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,838
when when did the first car go over 55

1647
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:47,440
miles an hour

1648
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:50,000
for over

1649
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,880
um

1650
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,880
over 10 miles

1651
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,720
on a public freeway with other traffic

1652
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,119
around driving completely autonomously

1653
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:01,519
when did that happen

1654
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,880
was it cmu in the 80s or something it

1655
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:06,880
was a long time ago it was actually in

1656
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,440
1987. in in munich um munich uh at the

1657
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,559
bundesvar yeah um

1658
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,798
so they they had it running in 1987.

1659
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:15,920
when do you think and elon has said he's

1660
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:17,280
going to do this

1661
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,720
when do you think we'll have the first

1662
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:23,200
car drive coast to coast in the us

1663
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:26,000
hands off the wheel hands off the wheel

1664
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:27,358
feet off the pedals coast to coast

1665
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,798
as far as i know a few people have

1666
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:32,318
claimed to do it 1995. that was comedy i

1667
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:35,039
didn't know about oh that was the code

1668
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,880
yeah uh they didn't claim did they claim

1669
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,239
a hundred percent not a hundred percent

1670
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,760
not a hundred percent but

1671
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:42,000
and then there's a few marketing people

1672
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,839
who have claimed 100 percent since but

1673
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,798
my point is that

1674
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:49,119
you know i i what i see happening again

1675
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:51,358
is someone sees a demo

1676
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,280
and they over generalize and say we must

1677
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,119
be almost there well we've been we've

1678
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,359
been working on it for 35 years because

1679
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,200
that's demos but this is going to take

1680
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:01,920
us back the same conversation with alpha

1681
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:04,000
zero are you not

1682
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,400
okay i'll just say what i am

1683
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,719
because i thought okay when i first

1684
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,559
started interacting with the

1685
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:11,679
with the mobile eye implementation tesla

1686
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,400
autopilot

1687
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:14,239
i've

1688
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,000
driven a lot of car you know i have been

1689
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:17,358
in the google self-driving car since the

1690
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,639
beginning

1691
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,199
um

1692
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:23,519
i thought there was no way before i sat

1693
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,879
and used mobileye i thought they're just

1694
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,559
knowing computer vision i thought

1695
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,480
there's no way it could work as well as

1696
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:31,280
it was working so

1697
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,318
my model of the limits of computer

1698
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,680
vision

1699
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:35,279
uh was

1700
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,519
was way more limited than the actual

1701
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,119
implementation of mobile eye i was so

1702
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:41,440
that's one example i was really

1703
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,400
surprised i was like wow that was that

1704
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,240
was incredible

1705
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:48,318
the second surprise came

1706
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:50,719
when tesla threw away mobileye

1707
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:52,239
and started from scratch

1708
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:53,919
uh i thought there's no way they can

1709
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:55,439
catch up to mobile eye i thought what

1710
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,880
mobile i was doing was kind of

1711
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,559
incredible like the amount of work and

1712
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,798
the annotation yeah well mobile i was

1713
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,720
started by amazon structure and and used

1714
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:05,119
a lot of traditional you know

1715
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:07,519
hard-fought computer vision techniques

1716
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:10,480
but they also did a lot of good sort of

1717
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:11,679
uh like non-research stuff like actual

1718
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,920
like

1719
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:16,078
uh just good like what you do to make a

1720
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,519
successful product right scaled all that

1721
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,039
kind of stuff and so i was very

1722
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,119
surprised when they from scratch were

1723
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:22,639
able to catch up to that

1724
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,760
uh that's very impressive and i've

1725
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:25,358
talked to a lot of engineers though i

1726
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,160
was involved this is

1727
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:30,880
that was impressive uh and

1728
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:32,239
the recent progress especially under um

1729
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,838
well with the involvement of andre

1730
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:35,679
kupathi

1731
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:38,078
the what they were

1732
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:40,000
what they're doing with the data engine

1733
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:42,240
which is converting into the driving

1734
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,920
task into these multiple tasks and then

1735
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:46,159
doing this edge case discovery when

1736
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,240
they're pulling back like the level of

1737
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:50,639
engineering

1738
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:53,039
made me rethink what's possible i don't

1739
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:54,558
i still you know um

1740
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,079
i don't know to that intensity but i

1741
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,240
always thought it was very difficult to

1742
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,480
solve anton was driving with all the

1743
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:02,399
sensors with all the computation i just

1744
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,079
thought it was a very difficult problem

1745
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,400
but i've been

1746
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:08,240
continuously surprised

1747
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,240
how much you can engineer first of all

1748
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:11,279
the data acquisition problem because i

1749
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:12,639
thought

1750
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,480
you know just because i worked with a

1751
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:15,598
lot of car companies

1752
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,798
and

1753
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,798
they're

1754
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:20,639
they're so a little

1755
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:22,639
a little bit old school to where i

1756
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,879
didn't think they could do this at scale

1757
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:27,358
like aws style

1758
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,599
data collection so when tesla was able

1759
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:31,358
to do that

1760
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,119
i started to think okay so what are the

1761
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:34,798
limits of this

1762
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,880
i still believe

1763
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:39,119
that um

1764
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,039
driver like sensing and the interaction

1765
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,798
with the driver and like studying the

1766
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:45,200
human factors psychology problem is

1767
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,960
essential it's it's always going to be

1768
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:48,480
there

1769
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,240
it's always going to be there even with

1770
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,119
fully autonomous driving

1771
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:56,239
but i've been surprised what is the

1772
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:58,240
limit especially of vision based alone

1773
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:01,038
how far that can take us

1774
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:02,479
um so that's my level is a surprise

1775
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:06,079
now

1776
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,920
okay uh can can you explain

1777
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:09,599
in the same way you said like alpha zero

1778
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,079
that's a homework problem that scaled

1779
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,880
large in his chest like who cares go

1780
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:17,359
with here's actual people using an

1781
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,760
actual car and driving many of them

1782
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:21,838
drive more than half their miles

1783
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,799
using the system right

1784
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:25,279
so and

1785
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:27,440
yeah they're doing well with with pure

1786
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,400
vision without your vision yeah and you

1787
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,280
know

1788
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:34,400
and now no radar which is i suspect that

1789
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,319
can't go all the way and one reason is

1790
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,079
without without new cameras that have a

1791
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:40,239
dynamic range closer to the human eye

1792
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,318
because human eye has incredible dynamic

1793
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:45,838
range and we make use of that dynamic

1794
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:48,639
range in its uh 11 orders of magnitude

1795
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,480
or some crazy number like that

1796
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:53,679
the cameras don't have that which is why

1797
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,920
you see the the the the bad cases where

1798
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:56,558
the sun on a white thing and the blinds

1799
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,079
are

1800
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,079
in a way it wouldn't apply in the person

1801
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,358
i think there's

1802
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,239
a bunch of things

1803
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:08,960
to think about before you say this is so

1804
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:10,558
good it's just gonna work

1805
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,159
okay

1806
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,160
um

1807
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:16,480
and i'll come at it from multiple angles

1808
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:17,759
and i know you've got a lot of time yeah

1809
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,318
okay let's

1810
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,319
have thought about these things yeah i

1811
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:24,838
know you've been writing a lot of great

1812
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:27,838
blog posts about it for a while before

1813
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:29,440
tesla had autopilot right so you've been

1814
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:31,279
thinking about autonomous driving for a

1815
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,039
while from every angle

1816
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,680
so so a few things

1817
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,440
you know in the us um i think that the

1818
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:39,279
the death rate from

1819
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,798
motor vehicle accidents

1820
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,000
is about 35

1821
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:44,480
000

1822
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,480
a year

1823
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,119
which is an outrageous number

1824
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:52,079
not outrageous compared to covert deaths

1825
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,760
but you know there is no rationality

1826
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,318
and that's part of the thing people have

1827
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,480
said engineers say to me well if we cut

1828
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:00,639
down the number of deaths by 10 by

1829
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,639
having autonomous driving that's going

1830
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:03,759
to be great everyone will love it

1831
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,000
and

1832
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,079
my prediction is

1833
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,079
that if autonomous vehicles kill more

1834
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:12,798
than 10 people a year they'll be

1835
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,960
screaming and hollering even though 35

1836
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:16,719
000 people a year have been killed by

1837
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,318
human drivers

1838
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:20,639
it's not rational

1839
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:24,159
it's a different set of expectations

1840
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,159
and that will probably continue

1841
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:30,318
so there's that aspect of it

1842
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,318
the other aspect of it is that

1843
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:36,960
when we introduce new technology

1844
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,880
we often change the rules of the game

1845
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,960
so when we introduced

1846
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,920
cars

1847
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,318
first

1848
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,639
you know into our daily lives we

1849
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:49,038
completely rebuilt our cities and we

1850
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:51,440
changed all the laws yeah jaywalking was

1851
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,440
not an offense

1852
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,039
that was pushed by the car company so

1853
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,639
that people would stay off the road so

1854
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,319
there wouldn't be deaths from

1855
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,239
pedestrians getting hit

1856
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:02,880
we completely changed the structure of

1857
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:05,598
our cities and had these foul smelling

1858
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,519
things you know everywhere around us and

1859
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,838
you know and now you see pushback in

1860
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:11,519
cities like barcelona is really trying

1861
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:12,719
to exclude cars

1862
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:14,318
etc

1863
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,279
um

1864
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:16,798
so

1865
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,280
i think that

1866
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:20,719
to get to self-driving

1867
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,559
we will

1868
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:24,000
um

1869
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,920
large adoption

1870
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,119
it's not going to be just take the

1871
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,960
current situation take out the driver

1872
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:34,079
and put the same car doing the same

1873
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,599
stuff because the end case is too many

1874
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,160
um

1875
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:39,359
here's an interesting question

1876
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,318
how many

1877
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:42,318
fully autonomous

1878
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,920
train systems do we have in the us

1879
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,920
i mean do you count them as fully

1880
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,680
autonomous i don't know because they're

1881
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,519
usually as a driver but they're kind of

1882
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,078
autonomous right no well

1883
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:57,838
let's get rid of the driver

1884
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,000
okay i don't know

1885
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,358
it's either 15 or 16. most most of them

1886
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,559
are in airports

1887
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:06,558
okay um there's a few that go about five

1888
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,160
two that go about five kilometers out of

1889
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,440
airports yeah

1890
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,798
um

1891
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,639
uh

1892
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:15,519
when do when is the first

1893
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:17,519
fully autonomous train system for mass

1894
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:20,000
transit expected to operate fully

1895
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:23,519
autonomously

1896
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,039
with no driver uh in the u.s city

1897
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:29,358
it's expected to operate in 2017

1898
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:32,319
in honolulu

1899
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:33,598
it's delayed but they will get there but

1900
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:35,759
by the way it was originally going to be

1901
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,119
autonomous uh here in the bay area i

1902
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,799
mean they're all

1903
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,920
very close to fully autonomous right

1904
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:41,920
yeah but

1905
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,159
getting the clues is the thing and i

1906
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:47,119
have i have i've often gone on a fully

1907
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:49,519
autonomous train in japan um one that

1908
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:51,519
goes uh out to that fake island in the

1909
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:52,639
middle of tokyo bay i forget the name of

1910
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:53,440
the

1911
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:55,118
and

1912
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,358
and what do you what do you see when you

1913
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,838
look at that what do you see when you go

1914
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:01,119
to a fully autonomous train in a in a in

1915
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:03,358
a

1916
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:07,039
um an airport

1917
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:09,358
it's not like regular trains there's

1918
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,760
at every station there's a double set of

1919
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:15,119
doors um so that there's the door of the

1920
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:18,000
train and this door off the the um

1921
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:20,640
off the the platform yeah um

1922
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,119
and it's really visible in this japanese

1923
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,719
one because it goes out in in amongst

1924
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:26,559
buildings

1925
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:28,880
the whole track is built so that people

1926
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,039
can't climb onto it yeah

1927
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,480
so there's engineering that then makes

1928
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:35,198
the system safe and makes them

1929
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:37,439
acceptable i think we'll see

1930
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:40,559
similar sorts of things happen

1931
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:41,678
in the u.s what surprised me

1932
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,520
i thought

1933
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,199
wrongly

1934
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,560
that we would have

1935
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:52,719
special purpose lanes on 101

1936
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:55,920
in the bay area the the leftmost lane

1937
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:58,319
so that it would be normal for

1938
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,239
teslas or other cars to move into that

1939
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:03,279
lane and then say okay now it's

1940
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,718
autonomous and have that dedicated lane

1941
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,480
i was expecting

1942
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,838
movement to that you know five years ago

1943
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,158
i was expecting we'd have a lot more

1944
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:11,439
movement towards that we haven't and it

1945
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:13,599
may be because

1946
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,198
tesla's been over promising by saying

1947
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,759
this you know calling their system fully

1948
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:21,119
self-driving um i think they may have

1949
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:22,479
been gotten there quicker by

1950
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:25,838
collaborating

1951
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:28,079
to change the infrastructure

1952
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:29,198
this is one of the problems

1953
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:31,359
with

1954
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:33,439
long-haul trucking

1955
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,719
being autonomous i think it makes sense

1956
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:37,759
on freeways

1957
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:39,838
at night for the trucks to go

1958
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:41,679
autonomously um

1959
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:43,119
but then is that how to get onto and off

1960
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,199
of the freeway what sort of

1961
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:47,119
infrastructure do you need for that

1962
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,399
um do you need to have the human in

1963
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:50,798
there to do that

1964
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:52,798
or can you get rid of the human so i

1965
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:54,479
think there's ways to get there but it's

1966
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:56,000
an infrastructure

1967
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:59,279
argument

1968
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,640
because the long tail of cases

1969
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:02,960
is very long

1970
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:06,159
and the acceptance of it will not be at

1971
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,439
the same level as human drivers

1972
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:09,839
so i'm

1973
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:12,559
i'm with you still and i was with you

1974
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:15,600
for a long time but i am surprised how

1975
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,520
how well how many edge cases

1976
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,120
of machine learning and vision based

1977
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,880
methods can cover

1978
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:23,519
this this is what i'm trying to get get

1979
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,520
at is um

1980
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,159
i think there's something fundamentally

1981
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:30,158
different with vision based methods and

1982
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:31,920
tesla autopilot and any company that's

1983
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:33,599
trying to do the same

1984
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,760
okay well i'm not i'm not going to argue

1985
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,679
with you because you know i

1986
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,560
i

1987
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:43,279
was speculating yes but i

1988
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,840
you know my gut feeling tells me

1989
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:45,840
it's going to be

1990
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:50,479
things will things will speed up when

1991
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:51,839
there is engineering of the environment

1992
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,198
because that's what happened with every

1993
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,719
other technology

1994
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:56,960
i'm a bit i don't know about you but i'm

1995
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,520
a bit cynical that

1996
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,039
infrastructure which relies on on

1997
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,640
government

1998
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:04,800
to help out

1999
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,880
in these cases um

2000
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,199
if you just look at infrastructure in

2001
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,440
all domains it's just a government

2002
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:14,000
always drags behind on infrastructure

2003
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:16,639
there's like there's so many just well

2004
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,479
in this country in the future sorry yes

2005
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,000
in the in this country and and of course

2006
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:22,000
there's many many countries that are

2007
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,359
actually much worse on infrastructure oh

2008
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,960
yes there's nothing many are much worse

2009
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:26,960
and there's some that you know like

2010
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,960
high-speed rail the

2011
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,198
other countries have done much better i

2012
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,439
guess uh my question is like

2013
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:35,759
which is at the core what i was trying

2014
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:39,039
to think through here and ask is like

2015
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,360
how hard is the driving problem

2016
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:42,800
as it currently stands so you mentioned

2017
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:44,238
like we don't want to just take the

2018
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,400
human out and duplicate whatever the

2019
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:48,799
human was doing but if we were to try to

2020
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:48,799
do that

2021
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,440
what

2022
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,360
how hard is that problem

2023
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:57,599
because i used to think is way harder

2024
01:11:55,359 --> 01:12:00,559
like i i used to think it's uh

2025
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:02,960
with vision alone it it it would be

2026
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:05,120
three decades four decades okay so i i

2027
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,198
don't know the answer to this thing i'm

2028
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:11,119
about to pose

2029
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:13,678
but i do notice that on highway 280 here

2030
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:15,039
in the bay area which largely has

2031
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,840
concrete

2032
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:19,760
surface rather than blacktop surface

2033
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,520
the white lines that are painted there

2034
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,719
now have black boundaries around them

2035
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,000
and

2036
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,319
my

2037
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,238
lane drift system in my car would not

2038
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:31,920
work without those black boundaries

2039
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:33,919
interesting so i don't know whether

2040
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,719
they've started doing it to help the

2041
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,560
lane drift whether it is an instance of

2042
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,679
infrastructure

2043
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,760
following the technology but but it

2044
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,119
my car would not perform as well without

2045
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,360
that change in the way they paint the

2046
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:48,559
line unfortunately really good lane

2047
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,399
keeping

2048
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,199
is not as valuable

2049
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:53,359
like

2050
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:55,519
it's orders of magnitude more valuable

2051
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:58,079
to have a fully autonomous system like

2052
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,760
yeah but but for me

2053
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:02,559
lane keeping is really helpful because

2054
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,880
i'm busy at it but you wouldn't pay

2055
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,679
10 times like

2056
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,679
um

2057
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:10,719
the problem is there's not financial

2058
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:13,359
like it doesn't make sense to to to uh

2059
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,800
revamp the infrastructure to make lane

2060
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:16,399
keeping easier

2061
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,320
it does make sense to prevent the

2062
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:20,639
infrastructure if you have a large fleet

2063
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:22,799
of autonomous vehicles now you change

2064
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,600
what it means to own cars you change the

2065
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,760
nature of transportation i mean but that

2066
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,079
that for that you need

2067
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,640
uh autonomous vehicles let me ask you

2068
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:36,399
about waymo then i've gotten a bunch of

2069
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:38,320
chances to to ride in in a waymo um

2070
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:39,599
self-driving car and they're

2071
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:42,399
i don't know if you'd call them

2072
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,079
self-driving but well i mean i i wrote

2073
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:47,198
in one before they were called waymo

2074
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:50,079
yeah still at x so there's currently

2075
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:51,599
this was a big another surprising leap i

2076
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,279
didn't think it would happen which is

2077
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,520
they have no driver

2078
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:57,519
currently yeah in chandler in chandler

2079
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,520
arizona and i think they're thinking of

2080
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,280
doing that in austin as well but they're

2081
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,600
they're expanding

2082
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:07,119
although although you know and i i do an

2083
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:09,600
annual uh checkup on this so as of late

2084
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:11,198
last year they were aiming for hundreds

2085
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,480
of rides

2086
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:14,960
a week

2087
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:17,599
not thousands and

2088
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:19,198
um there is still no one in the car but

2089
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:23,360
there's certainly uh

2090
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:24,960
um safety uh people in the loop and it's

2091
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:27,439
not clear how many you know what the

2092
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,960
ratio of cars to safety people is

2093
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:31,279
i it wasn't

2094
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,800
uh obviously they're not 100 transparent

2095
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:34,479
about this no none of them are 100

2096
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,760
transfers

2097
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:37,839
but i'd

2098
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,199
at least the way they're

2099
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,600
i don't want to make definitely but

2100
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:42,799
they're saying there's no tele operation

2101
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,039
um

2102
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,760
like they're i mean

2103
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:50,158
okay and and and that sort of fits with

2104
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,880
with um youtube videos i've seen of

2105
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:56,719
people being trapped in the car yeah um

2106
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:58,560
by a red cone on the on the street and

2107
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:01,359
they do they do have rescue vehicles

2108
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,120
that come yeah and then a person gets in

2109
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:05,759
and drives it yeah

2110
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:08,640
but isn't it incredible to you

2111
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:12,079
it was to me to get in a car with no

2112
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,560
driver and watch the steering wheel turn

2113
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:16,399
like for somebody who has been studying

2114
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,320
at least certainly the human side of

2115
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:20,559
autonomous vehicles for many years and

2116
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:22,000
you've been doing it for way longer like

2117
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,440
it was incredible to me that this was

2118
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,119
actually could happen i don't care if

2119
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:28,238
that scale is a hundred cars this is not

2120
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:30,640
a demo this is not this is me as a

2121
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:33,039
regular the argument i have is that

2122
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,280
people make interpolations from that

2123
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:36,399
interpolation that you know it's here

2124
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,479
it's done

2125
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:41,039
um you know it's just you know we've

2126
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:43,359
solved that no we haven't yet

2127
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:44,640
and and that's my argument okay so i'd

2128
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:47,198
like to go to

2129
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:49,039
you uh you keep a list of predictions

2130
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:50,960
on your amazing blog post it'd be fun to

2131
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:52,399
go through them but before then let me

2132
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,039
ask you about this

2133
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:55,039
you have um

2134
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,440
you have a

2135
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:03,640
harshness to you sometimes in your

2136
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:03,639
criticisms of what is

2137
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:10,880
and so like because people extrapolate

2138
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:13,520
like you said and they they kind of buy

2139
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:17,039
into the hype and then they

2140
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:19,280
they kind of start to think that um

2141
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:21,119
uh the technology is way better than it

2142
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:22,399
is but

2143
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,279
let me ask you maybe a difficult

2144
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,879
question

2145
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:27,039
sure

2146
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,880
do you think if you look at history of

2147
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,119
progress

2148
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:33,359
don't you think to achieve the quote

2149
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,640
impossible you have to believe that it's

2150
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:38,559
possible

2151
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:39,840
absolutely yeah like his his his his

2152
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,000
two great runs

2153
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,920
great unbelievable

2154
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,920
1903

2155
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,079
first human

2156
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,640
um power human uh

2157
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:54,000
you know heavier than their flight yeah

2158
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:56,880
1969 we land on the moon that's 66 years

2159
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,719
i'm 66 years old in my lifetime that

2160
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,560
span of my lifetime

2161
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:03,600
barely get you know flying i don't know

2162
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,440
what it was 50 feet or the length of the

2163
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,360
first flight or something to landing on

2164
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:08,158
the moon

2165
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:10,639
unbelievable

2166
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,158
fantastic but that requires by the way

2167
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,520
one of the wright brothers

2168
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:15,759
both of them but one of them didn't

2169
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,800
believe it's even possible like a year

2170
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,000
before

2171
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,239
right so

2172
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,880
like not just possible soon but like

2173
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:24,319
yeah ever so so so you know how

2174
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,400
important is it to believe and be

2175
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:29,119
optimistic is what i guess oh yeah it is

2176
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:32,319
important it's when it goes crazy when

2177
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:34,559
when i you know you said what was the

2178
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:37,519
word you used for my bad harshness

2179
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,520
harshness yes

2180
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:46,000
i just get so frustrated yes when when

2181
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:48,238
people make these leaps

2182
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,319
and tell me that i'm that i don't

2183
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:53,039
understand right i

2184
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,158
you know yeah

2185
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:55,198
there's

2186
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:57,839
just from

2187
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:59,198
irobot which i was co-founder of yeah i

2188
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,880
don't know the exact numbers now because

2189
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:02,639
i haven't it's 10 years since i stepped

2190
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,159
off the board but i believe it's well

2191
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,480
over 30 million

2192
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:07,759
robots cleaning houses from that one

2193
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:10,319
company and now there's lots of other

2194
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,079
companies yesterday

2195
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,279
was that a crazy idea that we had to

2196
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:15,039
believe

2197
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:17,519
uh

2198
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:20,800
in 2002 when we released it

2199
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,520
yeah that was we we had we had uh you

2200
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,119
know

2201
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,199
believed that it could be done let me

2202
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:27,679
ask you about this so irobot one of the

2203
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:29,198
greatest robotics companies ever

2204
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,039
in terms of manufacturing

2205
01:18:29,198 --> 01:18:32,639
creating a robot that actually works in

2206
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,319
the real world probably the greatest

2207
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,119
robotics company ever

2208
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:38,158
you're the co-founder of it

2209
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:41,039
um

2210
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:43,119
if if the rodney

2211
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:44,640
brooks of today talked to the rodney of

2212
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:46,559
back then

2213
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,079
what would you tell him because i have a

2214
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,880
sense that

2215
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:53,359
would you pet him on the back and say

2216
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:55,440
what you're doing is going to fail

2217
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:57,519
but go at it anyway

2218
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:59,919
that's what i'm referring to is with the

2219
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,920
harshness you've accomplished

2220
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,440
an incredible thing there one of several

2221
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,199
things we'll talk about

2222
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:06,639
what like that's what i'm trying to get

2223
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:09,198
at that line

2224
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,360
no it's it's when

2225
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:13,119
my harshness is reserved for people who

2226
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,519
are not doing it

2227
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:17,198
who claim it's just well this shows that

2228
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,000
it's just gonna happen but here here's

2229
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:21,439
the thing

2230
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,840
this shows but you have that harshness

2231
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:26,319
for elon too

2232
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,440
and no no it's a different harshness no

2233
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:28,960
it's it's a

2234
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:31,359
different um

2235
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,960
argument with yuan you know i

2236
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:37,679
i think spacex is an amazing company on

2237
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,079
the other hand you know i in one of my

2238
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:43,039
blog posts i said what's easy and what's

2239
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:44,719
hard i said space x

2240
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:46,399
vertical landing rockets it had been

2241
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:48,719
done before

2242
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:52,399
grid fins have been done since the 60s

2243
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:52,399
every soyuz has them um

2244
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,679
reusable space

2245
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,920
dcx reused those rockets that landed

2246
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:02,158
vertically

2247
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,440
there's a whole insurance industry in

2248
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:05,359
place for

2249
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:07,279
rocket launchers so all sorts of

2250
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:08,799
infrastructure

2251
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:11,119
that

2252
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,880
was doable it took a great entrepreneur

2253
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:15,519
a great personal

2254
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,039
expense he almost drove himself you know

2255
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,320
bankrupt doing it

2256
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:21,760
um a great belief to do it

2257
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:24,399
whereas

2258
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,079
hyperloop

2259
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:27,679
there's a whole bunch more stuff that's

2260
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:30,158
never been thought about never been

2261
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:32,880
demonstrated so my estimation is

2262
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:33,920
hyperloop is a long lot long a lot

2263
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,400
further off

2264
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,239
and and if i've got a criticism of of of

2265
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:39,679
elon it's that he doesn't make

2266
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:41,519
distinctions

2267
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:43,279
between

2268
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,679
when the technology's

2269
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:46,960
coming along and ready and then he'll go

2270
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:49,039
off and and

2271
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:50,880
mouth off about other things which then

2272
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:51,679
people go and compete about and try and

2273
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,440
do

2274
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,239
and

2275
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:56,960
so

2276
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:58,799
this is where i um i i understand what

2277
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,880
you're saying i tend to draw a different

2278
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,000
distinction i

2279
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,760
i have

2280
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
a similar kind of harshness towards

2281
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,039
people who are not telling the truth

2282
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,880
who are

2283
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:11,198
basically fabricating stuff to make

2284
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,960
money or to well he believes what he

2285
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:15,198
says i just think to me that's a very

2286
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,920
important difference yeah i'm not

2287
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:19,279
because i think uh in order to fly

2288
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,880
in order to get to the moon you have to

2289
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:24,800
believe um even when uh most people tell

2290
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,359
you you're wrong and most likely you're

2291
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,880
wrong but sometimes you're right i mean

2292
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:30,960
that's the same thing i have with tesla

2293
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:33,119
autopilot i i think that's an

2294
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,319
interesting one i was especially when i

2295
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:37,920
was you know um at mit and just the

2296
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:39,920
entire human factors in the robotics

2297
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,520
community were very negative towards

2298
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:45,039
elon it was very interesting for me to

2299
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,800
observe colleagues at mit

2300
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:48,399
i wasn't sure what to make of that that

2301
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,320
was very upsetting to me

2302
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:51,920
because i understood where that where

2303
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:53,679
that's coming from

2304
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,359
and i agreed with them and i kind of

2305
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:57,920
almost felt the same thing in the

2306
01:21:55,359 --> 01:21:59,039
beginning until i kind of opened my eyes

2307
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,480
and and

2308
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:02,639
realized there's a lot of interesting

2309
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:03,519
ideas here there might be over hype you

2310
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:05,840
know

2311
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,840
if if you focus yourself on the idea

2312
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,440
that

2313
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,880
you shouldn't call a system full

2314
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:12,960
self-driving

2315
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,880
when it's obviously not

2316
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,679
autonomous fully autonomous

2317
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,279
you're going to miss the magic oh

2318
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:21,520
yeah you are going to miss the magic but

2319
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:23,039
at the same time there are people who

2320
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,360
buy it

2321
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:29,198
literally pay money for it yeah and take

2322
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:30,960
those words as given so it's that's uh

2323
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:31,919
but i haven't so

2324
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,600
that i

2325
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,840
take words as given as one thing i

2326
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,000
haven't actually seen people that use

2327
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,319
autopilot that believe that the behavior

2328
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,600
is really important like the actual

2329
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:45,279
action so like this is like to push back

2330
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,880
on the very thing that you're frustrated

2331
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:48,079
about which is like journalists in

2332
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,880
general people

2333
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:51,198
uh

2334
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,480
buying all the hype and going on

2335
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:54,960
in the same way

2336
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:57,039
i think there's a lot of hype about

2337
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,719
the the negatives of this too that

2338
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:01,359
people are buying without using people

2339
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:03,119
used the way this is what this was this

2340
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:05,359
opened my eyes actually

2341
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:06,880
the way people use the product is very

2342
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:08,479
different than the way

2343
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,000
they talk about it this is true with

2344
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:12,319
robotics with everything everybody has

2345
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,800
dreams of how a particular product might

2346
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:16,719
be used or so on this and then when it

2347
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,800
meets reality there's a lot of fear of

2348
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:20,319
robotics for example that robots are

2349
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,079
somehow dangerous and all those kinds of

2350
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,000
things but when you actually have robots

2351
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,920
in your life whether it's in the factory

2352
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,359
or in the home making your life better

2353
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,520
that's going to be

2354
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:31,359
that's way different your perceptions of

2355
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,159
it are going to be way different and so

2356
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:34,479
my

2357
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,839
just tension was was like here's an

2358
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:37,039
innovator

2359
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,159
um

2360
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:42,238
uh like uh

2361
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:43,679
uh what is it sorry super cruise from

2362
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:45,039
cadillac was super interesting too

2363
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:47,199
that's a really interesting system

2364
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:48,719
there's we should like be excited by

2365
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:50,079
those innovations okay so let me can i

2366
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:51,520
tell you something that's really annoyed

2367
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:53,920
me recently

2368
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,480
it's really annoyed me that

2369
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:59,199
the press and friends of mine on

2370
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:01,279
facebook are going these billionaires

2371
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:02,799
and their space games you know why are

2372
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:04,719
they doing that yeah that's been very

2373
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:08,000
frustrating really pisses me off i i

2374
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:10,880
must say i i applaud that yeah i applaud

2375
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,238
it yeah it's the taking

2376
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,400
and not necessarily the people who are

2377
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:16,479
doing the things but

2378
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:17,599
you know like that i keep having to push

2379
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:20,638
back against

2380
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:24,000
unrealistic expectations when

2381
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:25,920
these things can become real yeah i

2382
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,679
this was interesting ana because there's

2383
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,199
been a particular focus for me is

2384
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,800
autonomous driving

2385
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:33,839
elon's prediction of when certain

2386
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,840
milestones would be hit

2387
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:39,439
there's several things to be said there

2388
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:40,800
that i always i thought about because

2389
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,839
whenever you said them it was obvious

2390
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,679
that's not going to me as a person that

2391
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,039
kind of

2392
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,600
not inside

2393
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:50,960
the system it was obvious it's unlikely

2394
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,679
to hit those

2395
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:56,319
there's two comments i want to make one

2396
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:59,279
he legitimately believes it

2397
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:01,198
and two much more importantly

2398
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:03,039
i think

2399
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:05,599
that

2400
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:07,679
having ambitious deadlines drives people

2401
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,440
to do the best work of their life even

2402
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:11,119
when the odds of those deadlines are

2403
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:12,879
very um

2404
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:14,079
to a point and i'm not killed i'm not

2405
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,920
talking about anyone yeah i'm just

2406
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:17,519
saying so there's a line there right you

2407
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,319
have to have a line because

2408
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:22,430
you over extend and it's

2409
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:23,679
it's demoralizing yeah

2410
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:25,199
[Music]

2411
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:26,880
but i will say that there's an

2412
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:28,879
additional thing here

2413
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,239
that those words

2414
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,279
also

2415
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:33,439
um

2416
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:36,479
drive the stock market

2417
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:38,879
yeah and you know we have because of the

2418
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:40,479
way that rich people in the past have

2419
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,840
manipulated

2420
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:43,678
the rubes

2421
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,239
through investment we have

2422
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:48,239
um um we have

2423
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:50,399
developed laws about what you know what

2424
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:52,479
you're allowed to say and yeah i promise

2425
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:54,158
and you know there's an area here which

2426
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:56,479
is

2427
01:25:54,158 --> 01:26:00,158
i i i tend to be

2428
01:25:56,479 --> 01:26:01,599
maybe i'm naive but i i tend to believe

2429
01:26:00,158 --> 01:26:03,679
uh that

2430
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,440
like engineers innovators people like

2431
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:07,440
that they're not

2432
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:09,119
they're my they don't think like that

2433
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:10,559
like manipulating the price at the stock

2434
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:12,960
price but

2435
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:15,199
it's possible that i'm uh i'm certain

2436
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:18,000
it's possible that i'm wrong

2437
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:20,559
i it's a very cynical view of the world

2438
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,359
because i don't i think most people that

2439
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:25,840
run companies and build like especially

2440
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:28,158
original founders

2441
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,319
they um yeah i'm not saying that's the

2442
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:32,399
intent i'm saying it's a eventually it's

2443
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:34,479
kind of you uh yeah

2444
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,079
you you fall into that kind of a

2445
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:37,039
behavior pattern i don't know i i tend

2446
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:38,238
to

2447
01:26:37,039 --> 01:26:40,719
i wasn't saying i wasn't saying it's

2448
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:43,039
falling into that intent it's just a

2449
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:45,600
you also have to protect investors in

2450
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:47,519
this in this market yeah

2451
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,920
okay so you have first of all you have

2452
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,480
an amazing blog that people should check

2453
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:54,639
out but you also have this in that blog

2454
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:56,399
a set of predictions

2455
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,760
it's such a cool idea i don't know how

2456
01:26:56,399 --> 01:27:00,359
long ago you started like three four

2457
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:04,079
years ago it was um january 1st

2458
01:27:00,359 --> 01:27:05,839
2018 18. yeah and i made these

2459
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:07,920
predictions and i said that every

2460
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,520
january 1st i was going to check back on

2461
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,920
how my predictions would be that's such

2462
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,159
a great orthodontics for 32 years

2463
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,440
oh you said 32 years i said 32 years

2464
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:18,559
because it's still that'll be january

2465
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:22,599
1st 2050 yeah i'll be

2466
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,600
i will just turn 95

2467
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,039
um

2468
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,840
you know so

2469
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,760
and so people know that your predictions

2470
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,600
at least for now are in the space of

2471
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,880
artificial intelligence yeah i didn't

2472
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,079
say i was going to make new predictions

2473
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,440
i was just going to measure this set of

2474
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:39,359
predictions that i made because yeah it

2475
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:40,799
was sort of i was sort of annoyed that

2476
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:42,960
everyone could make predictions they

2477
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,880
didn't come true and everyone forgot so

2478
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,880
i should hold myself to a high standard

2479
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,199
yeah but also just putting years and

2480
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,359
like date rangers on things it's a good

2481
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:53,439
thought exercise yeah like and like

2482
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:54,719
reasoning your thoughts out and so the

2483
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:56,719
topics are

2484
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:59,439
uh artificial intelligence autonomous

2485
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,880
vehicles and space yeah

2486
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:02,638
um

2487
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,400
i was wondering if we could just go

2488
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,079
through some that stand out maybe from

2489
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:08,238
memory i can just mention to you some

2490
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:09,840
let's talk about self-driving cars like

2491
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:12,399
some predictions that you're

2492
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:15,520
particularly proud of or are

2493
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:19,599
particularly interesting uh from flying

2494
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:22,480
cars to the the other element here is

2495
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,079
like how widespread the location

2496
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:25,919
where the deployment of the autonomous

2497
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:27,679
vehicles is

2498
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,960
and there's also just a few fun ones is

2499
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:32,000
there something that jumps to mind that

2500
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,679
you remember from the predictions

2501
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,439
well i did i think i did put in there

2502
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:38,719
that there would be a

2503
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:40,399
dedicated self-driving lane on 101 by

2504
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:42,880
some year and i think i was over

2505
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:44,638
optimistic on that one yeah actually

2506
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,719
yeah i actually do remember that but you

2507
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:48,639
uh i think you were mentioning like

2508
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:50,480
difficulties in different cities

2509
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:52,159
yeah yeah so

2510
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:54,158
cambridge massachusetts i think was an

2511
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:56,158
example yeah like in cambridge port you

2512
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:57,679
know yeah i lived in cambridge port for

2513
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:00,079
a number of years and

2514
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:01,760
you know the roads are narrow and

2515
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:03,679
getting getting anywhere as a human

2516
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,840
driver is incredibly frustrating when

2517
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:07,840
you start to put and people drive the

2518
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,079
wrong way on one-way streets there it's

2519
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,760
just

2520
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:14,079
your prediction was

2521
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,920
driverless taxi services operating on

2522
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:17,519
all streets in cambridgeport

2523
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,880
massachusetts

2524
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,040
in uh

2525
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,119
2035.

2526
01:29:21,039 --> 01:29:25,119
yeah and

2527
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:27,359
that may have been too optimistic you

2528
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:29,840
think so you know i've gotten a little

2529
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:31,759
more pessimistic since i made these

2530
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,400
internally on some of these things so

2531
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:37,119
what uh

2532
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:40,559
can you put a year to a major milestone

2533
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:42,319
of deployment of a taxi service

2534
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:44,080
in um

2535
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:46,479
in a few major cities like something

2536
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:50,399
where you feel like yeah so autonomous

2537
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:54,479
vehicles are here so let's let's take um

2538
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:57,599
the grid streets of san francisco north

2539
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:59,919
of market okay okay

2540
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,920
um

2541
01:30:00,158 --> 01:30:02,879
relatively benign

2542
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:06,319
um

2543
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,679
uh environment the streets are wide

2544
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:09,039
the major

2545
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:12,158
problem is

2546
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:15,600
delivery trucks stopping everywhere

2547
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:20,158
which made things more complicated

2548
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:23,199
a taxi system there with um

2549
01:30:20,158 --> 01:30:24,879
somewhat designated pickup and drop-offs

2550
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:27,839
unlike with uber and lyft where you can

2551
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:30,800
sort of get to any place and the drivers

2552
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:33,520
will figure out how to

2553
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,840
get in there um

2554
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:39,760
we're still a few years away i you know

2555
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:41,679
i live in that area so i see

2556
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,639
you know the self-driving car companies

2557
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,359
cars

2558
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,319
multiple multiple ones every day i'll

2559
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:49,319
say

2560
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:49,319
cruise

2561
01:30:51,039 --> 01:30:54,880
zooks less often

2562
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,719
way more all the time

2563
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,639
different and different ones come and go

2564
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:00,560
and there's always a driver

2565
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,400
there's always a driver at the moment

2566
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:04,000
although i have noticed

2567
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:06,158
that um

2568
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,880
sometimes the driver does not have the

2569
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:11,439
authority to take over without talking

2570
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:14,880
to the home office because they will sit

2571
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:16,960
there waiting for a long time

2572
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:20,400
and clearly something's going on where

2573
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:23,600
the home office is making a decision um

2574
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:24,719
so they're you know and and so you can

2575
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,520
see whether they've got their hands on

2576
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:29,920
the wheel or not and and it's the

2577
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,360
incident resolution time that tells you

2578
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:33,199
gives you some clues

2579
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:35,198
so what year do you think what's your

2580
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:36,638
intuition what date range are you

2581
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:39,678
currently thinking

2582
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:40,560
san francisco would be autonomous

2583
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,158
uh

2584
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:45,440
taxi service from

2585
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:47,759
any point a to any point b without a

2586
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:49,439
driver

2587
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,600
are you are you still

2588
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:53,039
are you thinking uh 10 years from now 20

2589
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,520
years from now 30 years from now

2590
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:57,198
certainly not 10 years from now

2591
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,520
it's going to be longer if you're

2592
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:00,479
allowed to go south of market way longer

2593
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,120
um

2594
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:04,238
and unless it's re-engineering of course

2595
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:05,679
roads

2596
01:32:04,238 --> 01:32:08,638
by the way what's the biggest challenge

2597
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:10,960
you can mention a few is that the the is

2598
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:12,960
it the delivery trucks is it the edge

2599
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:14,480
case is the computer perception

2600
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,920
uh well

2601
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:18,000
here's a case that i saw outside my

2602
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:20,000
house a few weeks ago

2603
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:23,920
um about 8 pm on a friday night it was

2604
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,920
getting dark it was before the solstice

2605
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:27,678
it was a

2606
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:29,920
cruise vehicle come down the hill uh

2607
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:30,880
turned right um

2608
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,480
and

2609
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,480
stopped dead

2610
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:36,399
covering the crosswalk why did it stop

2611
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:39,359
dead because there was a

2612
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:40,960
human just two feet from it

2613
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:42,880
now i just glanced i knew what was

2614
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:45,198
happening the human

2615
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:47,600
was it was a woman was at the door of

2616
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:48,879
her car trying to unlock it with one of

2617
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:50,560
those things that yeah you know when you

2618
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,679
don't have a key yes

2619
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,639
that car

2620
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:54,480
thought

2621
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:56,880
oh she could jump out in front of me any

2622
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:58,399
second yeah as a human i could tell no

2623
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:00,239
she's not going to jump out she's busy

2624
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:01,759
trying to unlock her she's lost her keys

2625
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:04,319
she's trying to get in the car

2626
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:08,800
and it it stayed there for

2627
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:10,799
until i got bored um yeah

2628
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,880
and so the the human driver in there did

2629
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:15,199
not take over

2630
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:17,679
but here's the kicker to me

2631
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:19,599
a guy comes down the hill

2632
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,840
with a stroller i assume there's a baby

2633
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,560
in there

2634
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,960
and

2635
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,719
now the crosswalk's blocked by this

2636
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,079
cruise vehicle

2637
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,158
what's he going to do

2638
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:32,800
cleverly i think he decided not to go in

2639
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:32,799
front of the car

2640
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:36,880
he went but he had to go behind it he

2641
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,079
had to get off the crosswalk out into

2642
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,400
the intersection

2643
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:42,238
to push his baby around this car which

2644
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:43,679
was stopped there and no human driver

2645
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:45,839
would have stopped there for that length

2646
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,880
of time um they would have gotten out of

2647
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,840
the way

2648
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,520
and that's another one of

2649
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,639
my pet peeves

2650
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,120
that

2651
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:57,119
safety has been compromised

2652
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:59,279
for individuals who didn't sign up for

2653
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:00,479
having this happen in their

2654
01:33:59,279 --> 01:34:01,759
neighborhood

2655
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:04,559
yeah but

2656
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:06,560
now you can say that's an edge case but

2657
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:09,199
yeah well i'm in general

2658
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:12,080
not a fan which

2659
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:14,638
of uh anecdotal evidence for stuff like

2660
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:16,079
this is one of my biggest problems

2661
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,359
with the discussion of autonomous

2662
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:19,679
vehicles in general people that

2663
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:22,000
criticize them or support them by using

2664
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:24,319
cases okay uh uh aren't using anything

2665
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,760
so so let me but i got you you know you

2666
01:34:24,319 --> 01:34:27,359
know your question is when is it going

2667
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,800
to happen in san francisco i say not

2668
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:30,479
soon but now it's going to be one of

2669
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,440
them but when where it is going to

2670
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:33,839
happen

2671
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:33,839
is in

2672
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:38,238
limited domains

2673
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:39,920
campuses of various sorts

2674
01:34:38,238 --> 01:34:42,479
gated communities

2675
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,679
where the other drivers

2676
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:46,000
are

2677
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:47,440
are not arbitrary people

2678
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,679
they're people who know about these

2679
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:50,719
things they you know it's been warned

2680
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:54,639
about them

2681
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:57,760
and at velocities where it's always safe

2682
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:59,520
to stop dead yeah um you can't do that

2683
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:02,079
on the freeway that i think we're going

2684
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:05,280
to start to see

2685
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:06,719
and they may not be shaped like

2686
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:08,719
you know current cars they may be you

2687
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:10,319
know things like you know may mobility

2688
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:12,639
has those

2689
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:14,000
things and various companies have these

2690
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:15,760
yeah i wonder if that's a compelling

2691
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,198
experience to me it's always important

2692
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,600
it's not just about automation it's

2693
01:35:17,198 --> 01:35:21,359
about creating a product that like

2694
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,840
that makes your it's not just cheaper

2695
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:24,799
but it makes your this fun to ride one

2696
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,800
of the most

2697
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,400
one of the least fun things is for a car

2698
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,560
that stops

2699
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:32,719
and like waits there's something deeply

2700
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,920
frustrating for us humans

2701
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:36,960
for the rest of the world to take

2702
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:38,880
advantage of us as we wait but

2703
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,840
um

2704
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:44,560
think about uh you know not you as the

2705
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:45,600
customer but someone who's in their

2706
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,400
80s

2707
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,639
in an uh you know a retirement village

2708
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:51,920
whose kids have said you're not driving

2709
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,440
anymore

2710
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,039
and this gives you the freedom to go to

2711
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:56,719
the market more that's a hugely

2712
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:59,279
beneficial thing but

2713
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:01,520
it's a very uh few orders of magnitude

2714
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:03,519
less impact on the world it's not it's

2715
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:05,679
just a few people in a small community

2716
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,920
using cars as opposed to the entirety of

2717
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:10,719
the world uh

2718
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,880
i like that uh the first time that a car

2719
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:15,840
equipped with some version of a solution

2720
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:17,520
to the trolley problem is uh what's niml

2721
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:20,319
stand for like not in my life not in my

2722
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,679
life i define my lifetime as up 2050

2723
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:23,279
2015.

2724
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:25,520
yeah

2725
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:27,599
uh you know and then i ask i ask you

2726
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,080
when when have you had to decide which

2727
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,600
person should i kill um no you put the

2728
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:33,039
brakes on and you break as hard as you

2729
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:36,400
can

2730
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:38,399
i mean uh making that decision it is uh

2731
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:40,319
you know i do think autonomous vehicles

2732
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,399
or semi-autonomous vehicles do need to

2733
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:44,079
solve the whole pedestrian problem that

2734
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:46,158
has elements of the trolley problem

2735
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:48,158
within it but it's not yeah well so

2736
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:50,399
here's a and i talked about it in one of

2737
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:53,279
the articles or blog posts that i wrote

2738
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:55,759
his his and people have told me i one of

2739
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:56,559
my co-workers has told me he does this

2740
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,079
he

2741
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,600
he tortures

2742
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:01,600
autonomously driven vehicles and

2743
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,760
pedestrians will will torture them

2744
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,920
they'll you know once they realize that

2745
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:07,920
you know putting one foot off the curb

2746
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:09,920
makes the car think that they might walk

2747
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:12,079
into the road kids teenagers will be

2748
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,000
doing that all the time they will

2749
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:16,319
i by the way one of my that's a whole

2750
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,719
nother discussion because my main issue

2751
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,238
with robotics is hri human robot

2752
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:22,480
interaction

2753
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:24,479
i believe that robots that interact with

2754
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:26,479
humans will have to

2755
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:28,238
push back

2756
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:30,319
like they can't just be

2757
01:37:28,238 --> 01:37:32,319
bullied because that creates a very

2758
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:34,000
uncompelling experience for the humans

2759
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:36,399
yeah well you know waymo before it was

2760
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,479
called waymo discovered that you know

2761
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:40,238
they had to do that at four-way

2762
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:42,479
intersections they had to they had to

2763
01:37:40,238 --> 01:37:44,079
nudge forward to give the cue that they

2764
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:45,839
were going to go because otherwise the

2765
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:47,359
other drivers would just

2766
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,319
beat them all the time

2767
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:52,399
so you co-founded irobot as we mentioned

2768
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:54,319
uh one of the most successful

2769
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:55,759
robotics companies ever

2770
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:58,880
what are you most proud of with that

2771
01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:00,079
company and uh the approach

2772
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,000
you uh

2773
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:04,719
took to robotics well like there's

2774
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,719
something i'm quite proud of there

2775
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:08,158
which may be a surprise

2776
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:09,679
but um

2777
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:14,079
i was still on the board when this

2778
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:15,440
happened it was march 2011

2779
01:38:14,079 --> 01:38:18,158
and we

2780
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:19,118
sent robots to japan and they were used

2781
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:21,599
to

2782
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:25,118
uh shut help shut down

2783
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,239
the fukushima fukushima daiichi nuclear

2784
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:28,319
power plant

2785
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:31,519
um which was everything i've been there

2786
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:33,279
since i was there in 2014 to the robots

2787
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,440
some of the robots were still there i

2788
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:36,238
was i was proud that we were able to do

2789
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:38,559
that

2790
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:40,559
why were we able to do that

2791
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,280
and and you know people have said well

2792
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:45,600
you know japan is so good at robotics

2793
01:38:43,279 --> 01:38:47,920
it was because we had had

2794
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:49,280
about 6 500 robots

2795
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,359
uh deployed

2796
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:54,319
in iraq and afghanistan

2797
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:55,519
teleopt but with intelligence

2798
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:56,960
dealing with

2799
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,520
roadside bombs

2800
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,960
so we had uh i think it was at that time

2801
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,400
nine years of

2802
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,239
in-field

2803
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:05,359
experience with the robots in harsh

2804
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:07,759
conditions

2805
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:09,679
whereas the japanese robots which were

2806
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,639
you know getting you know just goes back

2807
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:12,639
to what

2808
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:15,199
annoys me so much getting all the hype

2809
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:18,000
look at that look at that honda robot it

2810
01:39:15,198 --> 01:39:20,559
can walk well the future's here

2811
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,479
um couldn't do a thing uh because they

2812
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:24,800
weren't deployed but we had deployed in

2813
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:26,479
really harsh conditions for a long time

2814
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,279
and so we're able to

2815
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:29,919
to

2816
01:39:27,279 --> 01:39:31,920
do something very positive in a very bad

2817
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,679
situation what about

2818
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,600
just the simple

2819
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,359
and for people who don't know one of the

2820
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,119
things that irobot has created is the

2821
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:42,399
roomba

2822
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:44,399
uh vacuum cleaner

2823
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:46,479
what about the simple robot

2824
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:47,439
that that is the room bus quote-unquote

2825
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:49,039
simple

2826
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:51,279
that's deployed in

2827
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:53,198
tens of millions of in tens of millions

2828
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:55,840
of homes

2829
01:39:53,198 --> 01:39:57,759
what do you think about that

2830
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,880
well i make the joke that i started out

2831
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,440
life as a

2832
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:03,840
pure mathematician and turned into a

2833
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:05,519
vacuum cleaner salesman so

2834
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,719
if you're going to be an entrepreneur be

2835
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,400
ready for that

2836
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:12,239
be ready

2837
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,238
um but i was you know

2838
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:17,920
there was a there was a

2839
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:19,520
wacky uh lawsuit that i got posed for uh

2840
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,920
not too many years ago

2841
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:24,400
and i was the only one who had emailed

2842
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:25,279
from the 1990s

2843
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:27,039
and

2844
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:29,439
no one in the company had it so i went

2845
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:32,238
and went through my email and and it

2846
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:32,238
reminded me of

2847
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:37,439
you know the joy of what we were doing

2848
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:39,600
and and what what was i doing what was i

2849
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:40,879
doing at the time we were building

2850
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,840
um

2851
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,000
building

2852
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,279
uh the roomba

2853
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,439
one of the things was we had this

2854
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:49,118
incredible incredibly tight budget

2855
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:50,479
because we wanted to to put it on the

2856
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:52,238
shelves at

2857
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:54,638
200

2858
01:40:52,238 --> 01:40:57,279
there was another home cleaning robot at

2859
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:59,600
the time it was the

2860
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:00,719
electrolux

2861
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:03,039
trilobite

2862
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:04,560
which sold for 2 000 euros

2863
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:05,920
and to us that was not going to be a

2864
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,960
consumer product

2865
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:09,600
so we

2866
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,480
had reason to believe that 200 was a was

2867
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:14,960
a thing that people would buy at

2868
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:16,718
that was our aim but that meant we had

2869
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:18,399
you know that's that's

2870
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:20,719
on the shelf making profit

2871
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:22,719
uh that means the cost of goods has to

2872
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:25,600
be minimal

2873
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:27,920
so i find all these emails of me

2874
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:30,880
going you know i'd be in um

2875
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,639
taipei for a mit meeting and i'd stay a

2876
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:35,118
few extra days and go down to shinshu

2877
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,960
and talk to these little tiny companies

2878
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:40,079
lots of little tiny companies outside of

2879
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,920
uh tsmc taiwan semiconductor

2880
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:43,519
taiwan semiconductor manufacturing

2881
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,880
corporation which

2882
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,159
let all these little companies be

2883
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,560
fabulous they didn't have to have their

2884
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:49,839
own fab so they could innovate

2885
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:50,800
and then

2886
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,319
um

2887
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:55,360
they were building their innovations

2888
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:57,759
were built stripped down 6802s

2889
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:59,759
1682 was what was in an apple one get

2890
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,880
rid of half the silicon still have it be

2891
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:03,280
viable

2892
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:05,600
and i'd i'd previously got

2893
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:08,639
some of those for some earlier failed

2894
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:11,119
products of of a robot and um and that

2895
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:12,960
was um in hong kong

2896
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:15,279
going to all these um

2897
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,800
companies that built you know

2898
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:18,639
they weren't gaming in the current sense

2899
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,840
there were these handheld games that you

2900
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:21,359
would play

2901
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:23,440
um or

2902
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:26,000
or birthday cards because we had about a

2903
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:29,279
50 cent budget for computation

2904
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:31,198
so i'm trekking from place to place

2905
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:33,759
looking at their chips

2906
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:35,839
looking at what they'd removed

2907
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:39,039
their interrupt their interrupt handling

2908
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:41,840
is too weak for a general purpose so i

2909
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:43,519
was going deep technical detail and then

2910
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:45,920
i found this one from a company called

2911
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:47,600
winbond which had

2912
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:50,800
and i'd forgotten it had this much ram

2913
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:52,880
it had 512 bytes of ram and it was in

2914
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:56,159
our budget and it had all the

2915
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:58,480
capabilities we needed yeah so and

2916
01:42:56,158 --> 01:43:02,000
you're excited yeah and i i was reading

2917
01:42:58,479 --> 01:43:04,399
all these emails calling i found this

2918
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:07,198
so did you think did you ever think that

2919
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:08,879
you guys could be so successful

2920
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:10,479
like eventually this company would be so

2921
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,679
successful did you could you possibly

2922
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:14,638
have imagined

2923
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:17,118
um no we never did think that we had 14

2924
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:21,118
failed business models up till 2002 and

2925
01:43:17,118 --> 01:43:22,238
then we had two winners the same year um

2926
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:24,719
uh

2927
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:27,198
no and then you know

2928
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:30,319
we i remember the board

2929
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:32,319
um because by this time we had some uh

2930
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:36,719
venture capital in

2931
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:36,719
the board went along with us building um

2932
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,118
some robots for you know aiming at the

2933
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:43,360
christmas 2002

2934
01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:45,359
market and

2935
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:47,759
we went three times over what they

2936
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:49,599
authorized and built 70 000 of them and

2937
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:51,199
sold them all

2938
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,719
in that first because we released on

2939
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:54,000
september 18th

2940
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:58,239
and uh

2941
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:00,880
all sold by christmas so it was uh

2942
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:02,799
so we were gutsy but

2943
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:07,039
but yeah you didn't think this will take

2944
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:10,079
over the world well this is uh

2945
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:11,840
so a lot of amazing robotics companies

2946
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:13,439
have gone under over the past few

2947
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:16,480
decades

2948
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:19,678
why do you think it's so damn hard

2949
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:23,839
to uh run a successful well there's a

2950
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:25,679
robotics company there's a few things um

2951
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:29,600
one is

2952
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:31,039
expectations of capabilities by the

2953
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:32,560
founders that are

2954
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:34,079
off base

2955
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:36,000
the founders not the consumer and the

2956
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:38,319
founders yeah expectations what what can

2957
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,560
be delivered sure

2958
01:44:38,319 --> 01:44:41,279
mispricing

2959
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,199
and

2960
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:45,118
what a customer thinks is a valid price

2961
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:47,359
is not rational

2962
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:50,158
necessarily yeah

2963
01:44:47,359 --> 01:44:52,399
and expectations of customers

2964
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:52,399
and

2965
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:59,359
just the

2966
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:01,280
sheer hardness of getting people

2967
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:03,198
to adopt a new technology and i've

2968
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:05,279
suffered from all three moons

2969
01:45:03,198 --> 01:45:07,678
uh you know i've had

2970
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:09,679
more failures and successes

2971
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:10,719
in terms of companies i've suffered from

2972
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:12,079
all three

2973
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,239
um

2974
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:14,238
so

2975
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:17,559
do you think

2976
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:22,560
one day there will be a robotics company

2977
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:24,719
and by robotics company i mean where

2978
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,159
your primary source of income is

2979
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:28,239
from robots

2980
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:29,519
that will be a trillion plus dollar

2981
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:31,839
company

2982
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:34,480
and it's so what come what would that

2983
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,480
company do

2984
01:45:37,118 --> 01:45:42,559
i can't you know because i'm still

2985
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,560
starting robot companies yeah

2986
01:45:43,118 --> 01:45:47,118
i'm not making any such predictions in

2987
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,360
my own mind i'm not thinking about a

2988
01:45:47,118 --> 01:45:51,198
trillion dollar company and by the way i

2989
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:52,639
don't think you know in the 90s anyone

2990
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:54,319
was thinking that apple would ever be a

2991
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:57,760
trillion-dollar company so these are

2992
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:59,679
these are very hard to to predict but

2993
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,920
sorry to interrupt but don't you because

2994
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:04,319
i kind of have a vision

2995
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,399
in this in a small way and it's a big

2996
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:08,319
vision in a small way that

2997
01:46:06,399 --> 01:46:10,238
i see that there would be robots in the

2998
01:46:08,319 --> 01:46:13,599
home

2999
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:15,678
at scale like roomba but more

3000
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:17,199
and that's trillion dollar

3001
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:18,800
right and i and i think there's a

3002
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:21,279
there's a real market pool for them

3003
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:23,440
because of the um um demographic

3004
01:46:21,279 --> 01:46:26,238
inversion you know who's who's going to

3005
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:29,039
do all the stuff for the older people um

3006
01:46:26,238 --> 01:46:31,678
there's too many i'm you know i'm i'm

3007
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:33,920
leading here

3008
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:34,719
it's going to be too many of us

3009
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:36,399
and

3010
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:37,198
um

3011
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:39,519
but

3012
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:41,279
we don't have capable enough robots to

3013
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,320
to make that economic argument at this

3014
01:46:41,279 --> 01:46:44,559
point

3015
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:46,559
do i expect that that will happen yes i

3016
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:49,679
expect it will happen but i gotta tell

3017
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:51,600
you we introduced the roomba in 2002 and

3018
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:54,000
i stayed another

3019
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:57,280
nine years we were always trying to find

3020
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:00,158
what the next home robot would be and

3021
01:46:57,279 --> 01:47:02,319
still today the primary product of 20

3022
01:47:00,158 --> 01:47:04,000
years almost 20 years later 19 years

3023
01:47:02,319 --> 01:47:07,279
later the primary product is still the

3024
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:09,359
roomba so irobot hasn't found the next

3025
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:12,079
one do you think it's possible for one

3026
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:13,679
person in the garage to build it versus

3027
01:47:12,079 --> 01:47:15,920
like google

3028
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:18,560
launching google self-driving car that

3029
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:19,920
turns into waymo you think it's pos

3030
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,000
this is almost like what it takes to

3031
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:23,279
build a successful robotics company do

3032
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,279
you think it's possible to go from the

3033
01:47:23,279 --> 01:47:26,399
ground up or is it just too much capital

3034
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:27,599
investment

3035
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:30,238
yeah so

3036
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,280
it's very hard to get there

3037
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:32,799
um

3038
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:34,079
without a lot of capital and we're

3039
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:37,360
starting to see

3040
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:40,479
you know a fair chunks of capital uh for

3041
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:42,719
some robotics companies um you know

3042
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:44,959
series b's because i saw one yesterday

3043
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:47,180
for 80 million dollars i think it was

3044
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:49,118
for co-variant um

3045
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:51,920
[Music]

3046
01:47:49,118 --> 01:47:53,839
but it can take real money to

3047
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:55,920
to get into these things and you may

3048
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:58,079
fail along the way i've certainly failed

3049
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,480
at rethink robotics um and we've all

3050
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:03,439
lost 150 million dollars in capital

3051
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:05,118
there so okay so rethink robotics is

3052
01:48:03,439 --> 01:48:06,559
another amazing robotics company you

3053
01:48:05,118 --> 01:48:09,039
co-founded

3054
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:10,080
so what was the vision there

3055
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:12,238
what was

3056
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:14,238
the dream and

3057
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:16,638
what what are you most proud of with

3058
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:19,118
rethink robotics i'm most proud of the

3059
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:22,159
fact that we got um

3060
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:24,158
robots out of the cage in factories

3061
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:25,920
that were safe absolutely safe for

3062
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:28,158
people and robots to be next to each

3063
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:29,760
other so these are robotic arms robotics

3064
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:31,839
arms they're able to pick up stuff and

3065
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:34,159
interact with humans yeah and that

3066
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,679
humans could re-task them

3067
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:38,079
without writing code

3068
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:40,000
right and and now that sort of become an

3069
01:48:38,079 --> 01:48:42,079
expectation for a lot of other little

3070
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,920
companies and big companies are

3071
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:46,000
advertising they're doing that's both an

3072
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:47,279
interface problem and also safety

3073
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,560
problem yeah

3074
01:48:47,279 --> 01:48:52,079
yeah

3075
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:55,679
so i'm most proud of that

3076
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:58,319
i completely i let

3077
01:48:55,679 --> 01:49:01,118
myself be talked out of

3078
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:02,880
what i wanted to do and you know you've

3079
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:04,158
always got you know i can't replay the

3080
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,960
tape

3081
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:09,839
you know i can't replay it maybe

3082
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:11,679
maybe i you know if i'd been stronger um

3083
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,279
and i remember the day i remember the

3084
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:16,319
exact meeting

3085
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:17,198
um can you take me through that meeting

3086
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:18,319
yeah

3087
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:21,598
um

3088
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:23,118
so i said that i'd set as a target for

3089
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:25,119
the company that we were going to build

3090
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:26,479
three thousand dollar robots with force

3091
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:29,759
feedback

3092
01:49:26,479 --> 01:49:32,238
um that was safe for people to be around

3093
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:35,920
wow that was my goal

3094
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:39,519
and we built uh so we started in 2008

3095
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:41,520
and we had prototypes built of plastic

3096
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:43,599
plastic gearboxes

3097
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,719
and at a three thousand dollar you know

3098
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:47,279
uh

3099
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:48,239
lifetime of three thousand dollar

3100
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:50,079
i was

3101
01:49:48,238 --> 01:49:51,919
saying we're going to go after not the

3102
01:49:50,079 --> 01:49:53,760
people who already have robot arms in

3103
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:55,679
factories the people who never have a

3104
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:57,520
robot arm we're going to go after a

3105
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:59,760
different market so we don't have to

3106
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:00,880
meet their expectations

3107
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,320
um

3108
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,400
and and so we're going to build it out

3109
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:06,639
of plastic it doesn't have to have a 35

3110
01:50:04,399 --> 01:50:10,479
000 lifetime it's going to be so cheap

3111
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:10,480
that it's opex not capex

3112
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:15,679
and so we had we had a prototype that

3113
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:17,440
worked reasonably well

3114
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,920
but

3115
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:22,079
the control engineers were complaining

3116
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:24,480
about these plastic gearboxes with a

3117
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:26,238
beautiful little planetary gearbox um

3118
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:27,359
but

3119
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:29,198
we could

3120
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:31,118
use something called serious elastic

3121
01:50:29,198 --> 01:50:33,359
actuators we embedded them in there we

3122
01:50:31,118 --> 01:50:35,118
could measure forces we knew when we hit

3123
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:36,719
something et cetera

3124
01:50:35,118 --> 01:50:39,598
the control engineers were saying yeah

3125
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:42,079
but this is torque ripple because these

3126
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:44,000
plastic gears they're not great gears

3127
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:46,960
and there's this ripple and trying to do

3128
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:49,359
force control around this ripple is so

3129
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,359
hard

3130
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:54,159
and i'm not going to name names but i

3131
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:56,480
remember one of the mechanical engineers

3132
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:58,079
saying we'll just build a metal gearbox

3133
01:50:56,479 --> 01:51:01,118
with spur gears

3134
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:03,679
and it'll take six weeks we'll be done

3135
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:05,839
problem solved

3136
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:09,440
two years later we got to get the spur

3137
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:11,599
gearbox working yeah um we we cost

3138
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:14,079
reduced it every possible way we could

3139
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:16,239
um yeah but

3140
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:17,920
now the price went up to and then the

3141
01:51:16,238 --> 01:51:21,039
ceo at the time said well we have to

3142
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:26,000
have two arms not one arm so our first

3143
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:26,000
robot product baxter now cost 25 000

3144
01:51:26,238 --> 01:51:29,839
and the only people who are going to

3145
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:31,119
look at that were people who had arms in

3146
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:32,960
factories because that was somewhat

3147
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:35,759
cheaper for two arms than arms and

3148
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:37,920
factories but they were used to

3149
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:40,400
0.1 millimeter reproduce

3150
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,319
reproducibility of motion

3151
01:51:40,399 --> 01:51:44,719
and certain velocities

3152
01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:46,238
and we i kept thinking but that's not

3153
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:48,480
what we're giving you you don't need

3154
01:51:46,238 --> 01:51:50,959
position repeatability use force control

3155
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:52,238
like a human does no

3156
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,239
no but we want we want that

3157
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:55,678
repeatability we want that repeatability

3158
01:51:54,238 --> 01:51:57,118
yes all the other robots have that

3159
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:59,279
repeatability why don't you have that

3160
01:51:57,118 --> 01:52:01,118
repeatability so

3161
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:03,118
you clarify force controls you can grab

3162
01:52:01,118 --> 01:52:06,079
the arm and you can move it or you can

3163
01:52:03,118 --> 01:52:09,920
move it around but but suppose you um

3164
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:11,118
can you see that yes suppose you want to

3165
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:12,880
yes

3166
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:15,039
suppose this this thing is a you know

3167
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:16,639
precise thing that's going to fit here

3168
01:52:15,039 --> 01:52:19,118
in this right angle

3169
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:21,440
um under position control you sent your

3170
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:23,359
you you have fixtured where this is you

3171
01:52:21,439 --> 01:52:25,598
know where this is precisely and you

3172
01:52:23,359 --> 01:52:27,439
just move it open you know and it goes

3173
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:28,560
there if force control you would do

3174
01:52:27,439 --> 01:52:30,479
something like

3175
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:32,880
slidell over here till we feel that and

3176
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:35,198
slide it in there and that's how a human

3177
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:37,520
gets precise precision yeah they use

3178
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:39,759
force feedback yes and get the things to

3179
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:42,480
mate rather than just

3180
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:45,119
go straight to it yeah

3181
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:47,198
couldn't convince couldn't convince our

3182
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:48,880
customers who were in factories and were

3183
01:52:47,198 --> 01:52:50,238
used to thinking about things a certain

3184
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:52,239
way

3185
01:52:50,238 --> 01:52:54,799
and they wanted that one wonder so then

3186
01:52:52,238 --> 01:52:56,079
we said okay we're going to build an arm

3187
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:58,400
that gives you that

3188
01:52:56,079 --> 01:53:00,880
so now we ended up building a 35 000

3189
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:02,319
robot with one arm with um

3190
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:05,679
um

3191
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:05,679
oh what are they called um

3192
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:09,118
um

3193
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:10,479
a certain sort of gearbox made by a

3194
01:53:09,118 --> 01:53:11,598
company whose name i can't remember

3195
01:53:10,479 --> 01:53:12,559
right now but it's the name of the

3196
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:13,520
gearbox

3197
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:16,000
um

3198
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:18,000
and um but it's it's

3199
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,920
got torque ripple in it

3200
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,599
so now there was an extra two years of

3201
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:24,399
solving the problem of doing the force

3202
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:27,760
with the talk ripple so we had to do the

3203
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:28,479
the thing we had avoided

3204
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:30,239
and

3205
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:32,238
for the plastic gearboxes we ended up

3206
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:34,399
having to do the robot was now

3207
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:36,718
overpriced and

3208
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:38,479
um they and that was your intuition from

3209
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:40,079
the very beginning kind of that this is

3210
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:42,319
not

3211
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:43,840
you're opening a door to to solve a lot

3212
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:44,960
of problems that you're you're

3213
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:47,199
eventually going to have to solve this

3214
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,719
problem anyway yeah and also i was

3215
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:50,719
aiming at a low price to go into a

3216
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:52,560
different market price that that didn't

3217
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:53,840
have a thousand dollars would be amazing

3218
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,080
yeah i think we could have done it for

3219
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:57,760
five um but

3220
01:53:56,079 --> 01:53:59,359
you know you said talked about

3221
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:02,560
setting the goal a little too far for

3222
01:53:59,359 --> 01:54:02,559
the engineers exactly

3223
01:54:03,039 --> 01:54:10,000
so why would you say that company um

3224
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:13,840
not failed but went under

3225
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:15,198
we had buyers and um

3226
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:19,199
there's this thing called the committee

3227
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:22,238
on foreign investment in the us cyphus

3228
01:54:19,198 --> 01:54:24,559
and um that had previously been invoked

3229
01:54:22,238 --> 01:54:27,279
twice

3230
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:30,159
around where the government could stop

3231
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:32,559
foreign money coming into a u.s company

3232
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:35,839
based on

3233
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:37,280
defense requirements

3234
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:39,360
went through due diligence multiple

3235
01:54:37,279 --> 01:54:42,559
times we were going to get acquired

3236
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:43,679
um but every consortium had chinese

3237
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:45,760
money in it

3238
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:47,599
and all the bankers would say at the

3239
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:49,199
last minute you know this isn't going to

3240
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:51,840
get past cyphus

3241
01:54:49,198 --> 01:54:54,158
and the investors would go away

3242
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:55,679
and then we had two buyers

3243
01:54:54,158 --> 01:54:57,198
once we were about to run out of money

3244
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:59,599
two buyers

3245
01:54:57,198 --> 01:55:02,319
and one used heavy-handed legal stuff

3246
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:02,319
with the other one

3247
01:55:03,279 --> 01:55:06,800
said they were going to take it

3248
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:08,719
and pay more

3249
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:10,400
dropped out when we were out of cash and

3250
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:12,560
then bought the assets

3251
01:55:10,399 --> 01:55:14,799
at 1 30th of the price they had offered

3252
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:17,760
a week before

3253
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:21,679
it was a tough week

3254
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:25,840
do you um does it hurt to think about

3255
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:25,840
like an amazing company that didn't

3256
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:31,519
you know like a robot didn't find a way

3257
01:55:29,599 --> 01:55:33,279
yeah it was tough um i said i was never

3258
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:35,760
going to start another company i was

3259
01:55:33,279 --> 01:55:38,000
pleased that everyone liked what we did

3260
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:38,719
so much that the teams

3261
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,599
the

3262
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:43,359
team was hired by um

3263
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,400
three companies within a week everyone

3264
01:55:43,359 --> 01:55:46,000
had a job in one of these three

3265
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:47,920
companies some stayed in their same

3266
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,719
desks because the com another company

3267
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:54,158
came in and rented the space

3268
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:55,760
so i felt good about people not being

3269
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:59,598
out on the street

3270
01:55:55,760 --> 01:56:00,880
so baxter has a screen with a face

3271
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:03,360
what uh

3272
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:05,679
that's the revolutionary idea for a uh

3273
01:56:03,359 --> 01:56:06,479
robot manipulation like for a robotic

3274
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:07,679
arm

3275
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:09,439
uh what

3276
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:12,000
proposition did you get well first the

3277
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:13,759
screen was also used during um

3278
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,599
codeless programming where you taught by

3279
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:17,679
demonstration it showed you what its

3280
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:19,279
understanding of the task was

3281
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:21,279
so it had two roles

3282
01:56:19,279 --> 01:56:23,359
um

3283
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:25,759
some customers hated it

3284
01:56:23,359 --> 01:56:27,439
and so we made it so that when the robot

3285
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:29,599
was running it could be showing graphs

3286
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:32,238
of what was happening i'm not sure the

3287
01:56:29,599 --> 01:56:34,159
eyes other comp and other

3288
01:56:32,238 --> 01:56:35,519
people and some of them surprised me who

3289
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:37,359
they were saying

3290
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,679
well this one doesn't look as human as

3291
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:43,279
the old one we like the human looking

3292
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:46,000
yeah so there was a mixed bag

3293
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:47,759
but do you think that's uh

3294
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,158
i don't know i i'm kind of disappointed

3295
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:51,920
whenever i talk to um

3296
01:56:50,158 --> 01:56:53,679
to roboticists

3297
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:55,359
like the best robotics people in the

3298
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:58,239
world they seem to not want to do the

3299
01:56:55,359 --> 01:56:59,598
eyes type of thing like they seem to see

3300
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:01,039
it as a machine

3301
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:02,719
as opposed to a machine that can also

3302
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:04,000
have a human connection

3303
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:05,679
i'm not sure what to do with that it

3304
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,000
seems like a lost opportunity i think

3305
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:09,679
the trillion dollar company

3306
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,679
will have to do the human connection

3307
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:13,760
very well no matter what it does yeah i

3308
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:16,960
agree

3309
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:19,280
can i ask you a ridiculous question sure

3310
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:21,279
i want to give a ridiculous answer

3311
01:57:19,279 --> 01:57:23,519
uh do you think uh

3312
01:57:21,279 --> 01:57:26,000
well maybe by way of asking the question

3313
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:27,840
let me first mention that you're kind of

3314
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:31,039
critical of the idea of the touring test

3315
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:31,039
as a test of intelligence

3316
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:36,718
let me first ask this question

3317
01:57:34,319 --> 01:57:38,559
do you think we'll be able to build

3318
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:40,960
an ai system

3319
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:43,360
that humans fall in love with and it

3320
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:46,480
falls in love with the human

3321
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:46,479
like romantic love

3322
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:52,159
but we've had that with humans falling

3323
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:54,159
in love with cars even back in the 50s

3324
01:57:52,158 --> 01:57:56,158
it's a different love right well i think

3325
01:57:54,158 --> 01:57:57,439
i think there's a lifelong partnership

3326
01:57:56,158 --> 01:58:00,158
where you uh

3327
01:57:57,439 --> 01:58:02,399
can communicate and grow like

3328
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:05,439
i think we're a long way from that

3329
01:58:02,399 --> 01:58:06,479
i think we're a long long way i think

3330
01:58:05,439 --> 01:58:08,399
uh

3331
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:10,079
blade runner was you know had the time

3332
01:58:08,399 --> 01:58:11,679
scale totally wrong

3333
01:58:10,079 --> 01:58:13,039
um

3334
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:14,960
yeah but

3335
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:16,479
do you so uh

3336
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:17,679
to me honestly the most difficult part

3337
01:58:16,479 --> 01:58:20,718
is the thing that you said with the

3338
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:22,639
marvex paradox is to create a human form

3339
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:24,639
that interacts and perceives the world

3340
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:27,679
but if we just look at a voice

3341
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:28,880
like the movie her or just like an alexa

3342
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:32,560
type voice

3343
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:35,359
i tend to think we're not that far away

3344
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:37,599
well for some for some people maybe not

3345
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:40,639
but i i

3346
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:40,639
you know i i

3347
01:58:43,198 --> 01:58:46,799
you know as humans as we think about the

3348
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:48,639
future we always try to

3349
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:50,480
and this is the premise of most science

3350
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:53,199
fiction movies you've got the world

3351
01:58:50,479 --> 01:58:55,439
justices today and you change one thing

3352
01:58:53,198 --> 01:58:57,118
right but that's not how and it's the

3353
01:58:55,439 --> 01:59:00,000
same with a self-driving car you change

3354
01:58:57,118 --> 01:59:01,279
one thing no you everything changes yes

3355
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,560
everything

3356
01:59:01,279 --> 01:59:05,920
grows together so surprisingly i might

3357
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:09,039
be surprising to you or might not i

3358
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:11,840
think the best movie about this stuff

3359
01:59:09,039 --> 01:59:14,079
was bicentennial man

3360
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:16,319
and what was happening there um it was

3361
01:59:14,079 --> 01:59:18,479
schmaltzy and you know but what was

3362
01:59:16,319 --> 01:59:20,639
happening there

3363
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:21,598
as the robot was trying to become more

3364
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:23,679
human

3365
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:25,520
the humans were adopting the technology

3366
01:59:23,679 --> 01:59:27,520
of the robot and changing their bodies

3367
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:28,480
yeah so there was a convergence

3368
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:30,159
happening

3369
01:59:28,479 --> 01:59:31,678
in

3370
01:59:30,158 --> 01:59:33,359
so we will not be the same you know

3371
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:35,359
we're already talking about uh

3372
01:59:33,359 --> 01:59:36,399
genetically modifying our babies you

3373
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:37,519
know there's a

3374
01:59:36,399 --> 01:59:39,039
there's

3375
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:39,760
more and more stuff happening around

3376
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:42,479
that

3377
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:46,159
we will we will want to modify ourselves

3378
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:47,598
even more for all sorts of of things

3379
01:59:46,158 --> 01:59:50,399
we put

3380
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:52,560
all sorts of technology in our bodies um

3381
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:54,319
to improve it you know

3382
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,400
i've got

3383
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:59,359
i've got things in my ears so that i can

3384
01:59:56,399 --> 02:00:01,118
sort of hear you yeah

3385
01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:02,158
yeah so we're always modifying our

3386
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:04,158
bodies so

3387
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:06,000
so you know i think it's hard to imagine

3388
02:00:04,158 --> 02:00:07,598
exactly what it would be like in the

3389
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,840
future

3390
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:12,159
but on the turin test side

3391
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:13,279
do you think uh so forget about love for

3392
02:00:12,158 --> 02:00:15,679
a second

3393
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:19,599
let's talk about just uh like the elect

3394
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:21,359
surprise actually i was invited to be uh

3395
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:23,119
what is the interviewer for the alexa

3396
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:25,359
prize or whatever um

3397
02:00:23,118 --> 02:00:26,479
that's in two days

3398
02:00:25,359 --> 02:00:27,839
their idea

3399
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:29,118
is uh

3400
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:31,039
success

3401
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:32,799
looks like a person wanting to talk to

3402
02:00:31,039 --> 02:00:35,118
an ai system for a prolonged period of

3403
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:37,840
time like 20 minutes

3404
02:00:35,118 --> 02:00:40,399
how far away are we

3405
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:42,639
and why is it difficult to build an ai

3406
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:45,759
system with which you'd want to have a

3407
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:46,800
beer and talk for an hour or two hours

3408
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:49,280
like

3409
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:51,360
not for to check the weather or to check

3410
02:00:49,279 --> 02:00:53,920
music but just like to

3411
02:00:51,359 --> 02:00:57,198
uh to talk as friends yeah well you know

3412
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:59,760
we saw we saw um weisenbaum uh back in

3413
02:00:57,198 --> 02:01:00,638
the 60s with his programmer eliza yeah

3414
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:02,320
um

3415
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:04,800
being shocked at how much people would

3416
02:01:02,319 --> 02:01:07,279
talk to eliza and i i remember you know

3417
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:09,760
in the 70s typing you know stuff to

3418
02:01:07,279 --> 02:01:10,559
eliza see what it would come back with

3419
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:12,800
um

3420
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:13,920
you know i think right now

3421
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:16,560
and

3422
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:18,158
this is a thing that um

3423
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:19,599
uh

3424
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:23,598
amazon's been trying to improve with the

3425
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:24,719
like so there is no continuity of of of

3426
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:26,079
topic

3427
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:27,679
there's not

3428
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:29,439
you can't refer to what we talked about

3429
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:31,118
yesterday

3430
02:01:29,439 --> 02:01:32,638
it's not the same as talking to a person

3431
02:01:31,118 --> 02:01:35,279
where there seems to be an ongoing

3432
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:37,279
existence where it changes

3433
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:39,519
we share moments together and they last

3434
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:41,679
in our memory together yeah and there's

3435
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,560
none of that and there's no

3436
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:45,359
um

3437
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:47,039
sort of intention of these systems that

3438
02:01:45,359 --> 02:01:49,439
they have any

3439
02:01:47,039 --> 02:01:51,279
goal in life even if it's to be happy

3440
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:53,678
you know they don't they don't

3441
02:01:51,279 --> 02:01:55,279
even have a semblance of that now i'm

3442
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:57,520
not saying this can't be done i'm just

3443
02:01:55,279 --> 02:01:58,559
saying i think this is why we don't feel

3444
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:01,360
that way

3445
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:03,199
about them well that's a that's a a i'm

3446
02:02:01,359 --> 02:02:05,039
sort of a minimal requirement if you

3447
02:02:03,198 --> 02:02:06,719
want the sort of

3448
02:02:05,039 --> 02:02:07,920
interaction you're talking about it's a

3449
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:09,599
minimal requirement whether it's going

3450
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:10,880
to be sufficient

3451
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:12,480
i don't know

3452
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:13,920
we haven't seen it yet we don't know

3453
02:02:12,479 --> 02:02:16,718
what it

3454
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:19,760
feels like i tend to be i tend to think

3455
02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:21,599
it's uh it's not

3456
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:22,719
as difficult as solving intelligence for

3457
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:24,880
example

3458
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:27,198
and i think it's achievable in the near

3459
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,199
term

3460
02:02:27,439 --> 02:02:31,598
but on the touring test

3461
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:34,239
why don't you think the turing test is a

3462
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:35,599
good test of intelligence oh i i because

3463
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:38,238
you know

3464
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:40,480
again the turing if you read the paper

3465
02:02:38,238 --> 02:02:43,198
turing wasn't saying this is a good test

3466
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:44,959
he was using as a rhetorical device to

3467
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:46,479
argue

3468
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:49,279
that if you can't tell the difference

3469
02:02:46,479 --> 02:02:51,359
between a computer and a person

3470
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:52,880
you must say that the computer's

3471
02:02:51,359 --> 02:02:54,880
thinking because

3472
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:57,440
you can't tell the difference you know

3473
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:58,880
when it's thinking you can't you can't

3474
02:02:57,439 --> 02:03:01,678
say something different

3475
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:05,359
um what it has become as this sort of

3476
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:07,520
weird game of fooling people um

3477
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:07,519
so

3478
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:12,400
back at the

3479
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:14,560
uh ai lab in the late 80s we had this

3480
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:16,319
thing that still goes on called the ai

3481
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,520
olympics and one of the events we had

3482
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:19,759
one year

3483
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:21,840
was um

3484
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:24,320
the original imitation game as turing

3485
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:25,520
talked about because he starts by saying

3486
02:03:24,319 --> 02:03:26,479
can you tell whether it's a man or a

3487
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:28,800
woman

3488
02:03:26,479 --> 02:03:30,479
so we did that at the at the lab we had

3489
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:32,159
you know you'd go and type and

3490
02:03:30,479 --> 02:03:33,439
the thing would

3491
02:03:32,158 --> 02:03:35,839
come back and you had to tell whether it

3492
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:37,519
was a man or a woman um

3493
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:38,800
and um

3494
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:41,119
the

3495
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:43,279
the uh

3496
02:03:41,118 --> 02:03:44,399
one of the one of the one of the

3497
02:03:43,279 --> 02:03:46,238
uh

3498
02:03:44,399 --> 02:03:48,078
one man

3499
02:03:46,238 --> 02:03:49,439
came up with a question that he could

3500
02:03:48,078 --> 02:03:50,479
ask

3501
02:03:49,439 --> 02:03:53,039
which was

3502
02:03:50,479 --> 02:03:55,118
always a dead giveaway over whether the

3503
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:57,760
other person was really a man or a woman

3504
02:03:55,118 --> 02:03:59,118
you know what he would ask them did you

3505
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,920
have um

3506
02:03:59,118 --> 02:04:04,559
green plastic toy soldiers as a kid yeah

3507
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:06,560
what do you do with them and a woman a

3508
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:08,719
woman trying to be a man would say i

3509
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:10,159
lined them up we had wars we had battles

3510
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:13,118
and the man just bringing them out and

3511
02:04:10,158 --> 02:04:13,118
said i stomped on them

3512
02:04:15,039 --> 02:04:18,319
so you know

3513
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:20,078
that's what that's what the turing test

3514
02:04:18,319 --> 02:04:22,399
the turing test with

3515
02:04:20,078 --> 02:04:24,399
computers has become what's the trick

3516
02:04:22,399 --> 02:04:26,479
question that's that's that's why that's

3517
02:04:24,399 --> 02:04:27,519
right it's sort of that's right devolved

3518
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:29,439
into this

3519
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:31,920
weirdness

3520
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:33,598
nevertheless conversation not formulated

3521
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:36,319
as a test is a pretty

3522
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:38,960
it's a fascinatingly challenging dance

3523
02:04:36,319 --> 02:04:42,000
uh that's a really hard problem to me

3524
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:43,039
conversation when nan poses a test

3525
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:45,359
is a

3526
02:04:43,039 --> 02:04:47,198
is a more intuitive illustration how far

3527
02:04:45,359 --> 02:04:49,920
away we are from solving intelligence

3528
02:04:47,198 --> 02:04:52,158
than like computer vision it's hard

3529
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:53,039
computer vision is harder for me to pull

3530
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:55,039
apart

3531
02:04:53,039 --> 02:04:58,078
but with language with conversation you

3532
02:04:55,039 --> 02:05:00,960
could see because language is so human

3533
02:04:58,078 --> 02:05:02,000
we can so we can still clearly

3534
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:04,239
uh

3535
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,920
see it

3536
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:08,879
you mentioned something i was gonna

3537
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:11,920
go on off on okay um

3538
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:13,359
i mean i have to ask you because you

3539
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:16,800
you were the

3540
02:05:13,359 --> 02:05:19,679
head of csail ai left for a long time

3541
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:22,320
you're i don't know uh to me when i came

3542
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:25,760
to mit you're like one of the greats at

3543
02:05:22,319 --> 02:05:28,479
mit so what was that time like what

3544
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:29,840
and and plus you uh

3545
02:05:28,479 --> 02:05:31,279
you're

3546
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:33,679
i don't know friends with but you knew

3547
02:05:31,279 --> 02:05:36,960
minsky and all the all the folks they're

3548
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:38,000
all the legendary ai uh people of which

3549
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:39,920
you're one

3550
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,719
so what was that time like what what are

3551
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:44,719
memories that um stand out to you from

3552
02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:47,439
that time

3553
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:49,840
from your time at mit from the ai lab

3554
02:05:47,439 --> 02:05:52,000
from the dreams that they are lab

3555
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:54,078
represented to the actual like

3556
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,479
revolutionary work well let me tell you

3557
02:05:54,078 --> 02:05:57,840
first a disappointment in myself

3558
02:05:56,479 --> 02:06:01,598
you know as i've been researching this

3559
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:05,119
book um and so many of the players you

3560
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:06,960
know were active in the 50s and 60s i

3561
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:08,559
knew many of them when they were older

3562
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:09,760
and i didn't ask them all the questions

3563
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:11,280
now i wish

3564
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:13,119
i had asked

3565
02:06:11,279 --> 02:06:15,359
i'd sit with them at our thursday

3566
02:06:13,118 --> 02:06:17,920
lunches which we had a faculty lunch and

3567
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:20,399
and i didn't ask him so many questions

3568
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:22,399
that now i wish i had he asked you that

3569
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:23,759
question because because you wrote that

3570
02:06:22,399 --> 02:06:25,359
you wrote that you were fortunate to

3571
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:26,639
know and rub shoulders with many of the

3572
02:06:25,359 --> 02:06:28,399
greats

3573
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:31,359
those who founded ai robotics and

3574
02:06:28,399 --> 02:06:33,039
computer science and the world wide web

3575
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:34,960
and you wrote that your big regret

3576
02:06:33,039 --> 02:06:37,760
nowadays is that often i have questions

3577
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:39,760
for those who have passed on yeah and i

3578
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:41,440
didn't think to ask them any of these

3579
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:43,520
questions right

3580
02:06:41,439 --> 02:06:46,000
even as i saw them and said hello to

3581
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:47,840
them on a daily basis so

3582
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,039
maybe also another question i want to

3583
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:51,360
ask

3584
02:06:49,039 --> 02:06:53,359
if you could talk to them today what

3585
02:06:51,359 --> 02:06:56,479
question would you ask what questions

3586
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:59,439
would you ask well rick lyder i i would

3587
02:06:56,479 --> 02:07:01,359
ask him you know he had the vision for

3588
02:06:59,439 --> 02:07:03,598
humans and and

3589
02:07:01,359 --> 02:07:06,479
computers working together and he really

3590
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:09,279
founded that at darpa and he

3591
02:07:06,479 --> 02:07:13,279
gave the money to mit which started

3592
02:07:09,279 --> 02:07:14,960
project mac in 1963.

3593
02:07:13,279 --> 02:07:16,479
and i i would have talked about what

3594
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:19,198
what the successes were what the

3595
02:07:16,479 --> 02:07:21,439
failures were what he saw as progress

3596
02:07:19,198 --> 02:07:22,799
et cetera

3597
02:07:21,439 --> 02:07:25,598
i would have asked him more more

3598
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:27,520
questions about that because now i could

3599
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:29,360
use it in my book

3600
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:31,760
but i think it's lost it's lost forever

3601
02:07:29,359 --> 02:07:34,000
a lot of the motivations are lost

3602
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:34,000
um

3603
02:07:34,399 --> 02:07:38,799
uh

3604
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:40,639
i i should have asked marvin why he he

3605
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:43,719
and seymour pappet

3606
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:47,039
came down so hard on neural networks in

3607
02:07:43,719 --> 02:07:49,039
1968 in their book perceptrons because

3608
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:51,118
marvin's phd thesis was on neural

3609
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:53,760
networks yeah how do you make sense of

3610
02:07:51,118 --> 02:07:56,158
that that destroyed the field for he

3611
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:59,280
probably do you think he knew that the

3612
02:07:56,158 --> 02:07:59,279
effect that book would have

3613
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:04,400
all the theorems and negative theorems

3614
02:08:03,439 --> 02:08:05,839
yeah

3615
02:08:04,399 --> 02:08:06,719
um yeah

3616
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:09,840
so

3617
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:12,000
yeah that's just the way of

3618
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:14,078
that's the way of life

3619
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,920
yeah but still it's kind of tragic that

3620
02:08:14,078 --> 02:08:18,719
he was both the proponent and the

3621
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:21,359
destroyer of neural networks yeah

3622
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:22,800
um is there other memory standouts

3623
02:08:21,359 --> 02:08:27,198
from the

3624
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:27,199
the robotics and the ai work at mit

3625
02:08:28,078 --> 02:08:31,359
well

3626
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:32,880
yeah but you gotta be more specific

3627
02:08:31,359 --> 02:08:34,479
well i mean like it's such a magical

3628
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,800
place i mean to me it's a little bit

3629
02:08:34,479 --> 02:08:38,638
also heartbreaking

3630
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:40,719
that

3631
02:08:38,639 --> 02:08:44,719
you know with google and facebook like

3632
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:46,800
deepmind and so on so much of the talent

3633
02:08:44,719 --> 02:08:49,039
you know doesn't stay necessarily for

3634
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:52,079
prolonged periods of time in these

3635
02:08:49,039 --> 02:08:53,519
in these universities oh yeah i mean

3636
02:08:52,078 --> 02:08:56,479
some of the companies are more guilty

3637
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:59,119
than others are paying

3638
02:08:56,479 --> 02:09:01,519
fabulous salaries to some of the highest

3639
02:08:59,118 --> 02:09:02,960
you know producers and then just

3640
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:04,719
you never hear from them again they're

3641
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:06,560
not allowed to give public talks they're

3642
02:09:04,719 --> 02:09:08,719
sort of locked away

3643
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:11,440
and it's sort of like collecting

3644
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:13,279
collecting you know hollywood stars or

3645
02:09:11,439 --> 02:09:16,000
something and i'm not allowed to make

3646
02:09:13,279 --> 02:09:18,399
movies anymore i own them um yeah that's

3647
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,639
tragic because i mean the there's an

3648
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:22,879
openness to the university setting where

3649
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:24,880
you do research to uh both in the base

3650
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:26,719
of ideas and space like publication all

3651
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:28,560
those kinds of things yeah you know and

3652
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:30,880
you know there's the publication and all

3653
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:32,400
that and often you know although these

3654
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:34,880
places say they publish

3655
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:37,198
yeah there's pressure

3656
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:39,520
and um

3657
02:09:37,198 --> 02:09:43,598
but i think for instance um

3658
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:43,599
you know on net net i think

3659
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:48,159
google buying those 809 robotics company

3660
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,238
was bad for the field because it locked

3661
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:51,519
those people away

3662
02:09:50,238 --> 02:09:54,238
they didn't have to make the company

3663
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:57,280
succeed anymore locked them away for

3664
02:09:54,238 --> 02:09:57,279
years and then

3665
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:02,799
sort of all threaded away yeah

3666
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:05,199
so um

3667
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:08,560
do you have hope for mit

3668
02:10:05,198 --> 02:10:12,719
for him for mit yeah why shouldn't i

3669
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:12,719
well i could be harsh and say that

3670
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:16,639
i'm not sure i would say mit is leading

3671
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:18,400
the world in ai

3672
02:10:16,639 --> 02:10:20,880
or even stanford

3673
02:10:18,399 --> 02:10:25,359
or berkeley i would say

3674
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:27,440
i would say um deepmind google ai

3675
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:28,399
facebook ai say i would take a slightly

3676
02:10:27,439 --> 02:10:30,638
different approach

3677
02:10:28,399 --> 02:10:32,158
or a different answer

3678
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:34,800
i'll leave i'll come back to facebook in

3679
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:36,399
a minute but i think those other places

3680
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:40,400
are

3681
02:10:36,399 --> 02:10:40,399
following a dream of

3682
02:10:40,479 --> 02:10:46,078
one of the founders uh and i'm not sure

3683
02:10:44,078 --> 02:10:47,359
that it's well founded

3684
02:10:46,078 --> 02:10:49,599
the dream

3685
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:52,238
and i'm not sure that it's going to have

3686
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:53,760
the impact that

3687
02:10:52,238 --> 02:10:55,279
he believes it is

3688
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:56,719
um

3689
02:10:55,279 --> 02:10:58,238
you're talking about facebook and google

3690
02:10:56,719 --> 02:11:00,719
and so on i'm talking about google

3691
02:10:58,238 --> 02:11:02,799
google but the thing is those research

3692
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:04,480
labs aren't

3693
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:06,480
there's the big dream

3694
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:08,078
and i'm i'm usually a fan of no matter

3695
02:11:06,479 --> 02:11:10,319
what the dream is a big dream is a

3696
02:11:08,078 --> 02:11:12,639
unifier because what happens is you have

3697
02:11:10,319 --> 02:11:14,399
a lot of bright minds

3698
02:11:12,639 --> 02:11:17,359
working together

3699
02:11:14,399 --> 02:11:19,839
uh on a dream what results is a lot of

3700
02:11:17,359 --> 02:11:22,000
like adjacent ideas i mean yeah so much

3701
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:23,679
progress is made yeah i'm i'm so i'm not

3702
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:25,439
saying they're actually leading i'm not

3703
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:27,359
i'm not saying that the universities are

3704
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:29,279
leading yeah but i don't think those

3705
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:30,158
companies are leading in general because

3706
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:32,800
they're

3707
02:11:30,158 --> 02:11:35,598
you know and we saw this

3708
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:38,400
incredible spike in you know

3709
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:40,880
attendees at europe's and

3710
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:42,198
as i said in my january first review

3711
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:43,840
this year for

3712
02:11:42,198 --> 02:11:46,078
2020

3713
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:48,719
2020 will not be remembered as a

3714
02:11:46,078 --> 02:11:49,840
watershed year for machine learning or

3715
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:51,359
ai

3716
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:54,800
you know there was nothing

3717
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:56,639
surprising happened anyway unlike when

3718
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:57,920
deep learning hit

3719
02:11:56,639 --> 02:12:00,400
imagenet

3720
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:02,639
that was a that was a

3721
02:12:00,399 --> 02:12:04,319
shake

3722
02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:06,400
and there's a lot more people writing

3723
02:12:04,319 --> 02:12:08,479
papers but the papers are

3724
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:12,238
fundamentally boring yeah and

3725
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:12,238
uninteresting incremental work

3726
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:18,480
is there a particular memories you have

3727
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:19,599
with minsky or somebody else at mit that

3728
02:12:18,479 --> 02:12:21,198
stand out

3729
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:23,199
my funny stories

3730
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:26,078
i mean unfortunately he's another one

3731
02:12:23,198 --> 02:12:26,078
that's passed away

3732
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:29,520
you've known some of the biggest minds

3733
02:12:28,399 --> 02:12:31,839
in ai

3734
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:33,920
yeah and you know they they did amazing

3735
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:35,230
things and some sometimes they were

3736
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:36,480
grumpy um

3737
02:12:35,229 --> 02:12:38,158
[Laughter]

3738
02:12:36,479 --> 02:12:40,638
well he was uh he was interesting

3739
02:12:38,158 --> 02:12:41,679
because he was very grumpy but that

3740
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:42,719
that was

3741
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:44,480
uh

3742
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:46,800
i remember him saying in an interview

3743
02:12:44,479 --> 02:12:48,959
that the key to success

3744
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:50,639
or being to keep being productive is to

3745
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:51,599
hate everything you've ever done in the

3746
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:53,599
past

3747
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:54,880
maybe maybe that explains the perceptron

3748
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:58,880
book

3749
02:12:54,880 --> 02:13:01,440
and there it was he told you exactly

3750
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:03,679
but he meaning like just like

3751
02:13:01,439 --> 02:13:06,479
i mean maybe that's the way to not treat

3752
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:08,078
yourself too seriously just uh always be

3753
02:13:06,479 --> 02:13:09,678
moving forward

3754
02:13:08,078 --> 02:13:12,799
uh that was this idea i mean that

3755
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:13,840
crankiness i mean doesn't

3756
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:15,599
yeah

3757
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:18,000
so let me let me let me tell you you

3758
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:19,599
know what really

3759
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,039
um

3760
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:25,279
you know the joy memories are about

3761
02:13:23,039 --> 02:13:28,560
having access to technology before

3762
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:31,198
anyone else has seen it so so you know i

3763
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:33,199
i got to stanford in 1977

3764
02:13:31,198 --> 02:13:35,198
and we had um

3765
02:13:33,198 --> 02:13:38,078
you know we had terminals that could

3766
02:13:35,198 --> 02:13:41,439
show live video on them um

3767
02:13:38,078 --> 02:13:43,519
digital digital sound system we had um

3768
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:46,319
as

3769
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:47,840
xerox graphics printer we could print

3770
02:13:46,319 --> 02:13:49,599
um

3771
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:51,520
uh it wasn't you know it wasn't like a

3772
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:53,360
typewriter ball hitting in with

3773
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:56,000
characters it could print arbitrary

3774
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:58,399
things only in you know one bit you know

3775
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:01,520
black or white but arbitrary pictures

3776
02:13:58,399 --> 02:14:04,479
this was science fiction sort of stuff

3777
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:06,480
um at mit the uh

3778
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:08,638
the list machines which

3779
02:14:06,479 --> 02:14:10,959
you know they were the first personal

3780
02:14:08,639 --> 02:14:12,400
computers and you know they cost a

3781
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:14,319
hundred thousand dollars each and i

3782
02:14:12,399 --> 02:14:16,000
could you know i got there early enough

3783
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:18,000
in the day i got one for the day

3784
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:20,319
couldn't couldn't stand up let's keep

3785
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,319
working

3786
02:14:21,439 --> 02:14:26,799
um having that like direct glimpse into

3787
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:29,920
the future yeah and you know i've had

3788
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:32,320
email every day since 1977 um

3789
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:35,039
and uh you know

3790
02:14:32,319 --> 02:14:37,039
the the host field was only eight bits

3791
02:14:35,039 --> 02:14:39,039
you know that many places but we i could

3792
02:14:37,039 --> 02:14:40,960
send email to other people at a few

3793
02:14:39,039 --> 02:14:43,198
places so

3794
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:44,078
that was that was pretty exciting to be

3795
02:14:43,198 --> 02:14:45,839
in that

3796
02:14:44,078 --> 02:14:47,840
world so different from what the rest of

3797
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:50,239
the world knew um

3798
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:50,239
and uh

3799
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:55,920
let me ask you probably edit this out

3800
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:58,479
but just in case you have a story uh

3801
02:14:55,920 --> 02:15:00,239
i'm hanging out with don knuth

3802
02:14:58,479 --> 02:15:01,678
uh for a while tomorrow

3803
02:15:00,238 --> 02:15:03,359
did you ever get a chance to such a

3804
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:05,520
different world than yours

3805
02:15:03,359 --> 02:15:07,519
he's a very kind of theoretical computer

3806
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:09,520
science the puzzle of

3807
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:11,840
of uh computer science and mathematics

3808
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:13,840
and you're so much about the magic of

3809
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:15,679
robotics like the practice of it did you

3810
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:18,560
mention him earlier for like

3811
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:21,039
not you know about computation did your

3812
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:23,280
worlds cross they did enough you know i

3813
02:15:21,039 --> 02:15:25,840
i know him now we talked you know but

3814
02:15:23,279 --> 02:15:26,639
let me tell you my my donald canoe story

3815
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:28,078
okay

3816
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:30,000
so um

3817
02:15:28,078 --> 02:15:32,158
you know besides you know analysis of

3818
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,319
algorithms he's well known for

3819
02:15:32,158 --> 02:15:37,598
writing tech yeah which is in latex

3820
02:15:34,319 --> 02:15:40,799
which is the academic publishing system

3821
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:42,400
so he did that at the ai lab

3822
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:45,039
and he would do it he would work

3823
02:15:42,399 --> 02:15:47,439
overnight at the air lab

3824
02:15:45,039 --> 02:15:48,639
and one

3825
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:50,719
one day the

3826
02:15:48,639 --> 02:15:53,199
one night the uh

3827
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:55,198
the mainframe computer went down

3828
02:15:53,198 --> 02:15:57,519
and um

3829
02:15:55,198 --> 02:16:00,559
a guy named robert paul was there he

3830
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:02,639
only did his phd at the media lab at mit

3831
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:05,440
and he was a you know

3832
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:07,840
engineer uh and so

3833
02:16:05,439 --> 02:16:09,198
i and he and i you know tracked down

3834
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:11,520
what were the problem was it was one of

3835
02:16:09,198 --> 02:16:13,598
those big refrigerator size or washing

3836
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:14,800
machine size disk drives unveiled and

3837
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:17,520
that's what brought the whole system

3838
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:20,320
down so we got panels pulled off and

3839
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:23,199
we're pulling you know circuit cards out

3840
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:25,039
and donald knuth who's a really tall guy

3841
02:16:23,198 --> 02:16:26,960
he walks in and he's looking down and

3842
02:16:25,039 --> 02:16:28,639
says when will it be fixed you know does

3843
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:30,960
he want to get back to write his tax

3844
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:30,960
system

3845
02:16:32,478 --> 02:16:37,679
we figured out you know it was a

3846
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:40,079
particular chip 7400 series chip which

3847
02:16:37,679 --> 02:16:42,558
was socketed we popped

3848
02:16:40,079 --> 02:16:44,959
it out we put a replacement in put it

3849
02:16:42,558 --> 02:16:46,799
back in smoke comes out because we put

3850
02:16:44,959 --> 02:16:49,598
it in backwards because we're so nervous

3851
02:16:46,799 --> 02:16:51,358
that donald knuth was standing over us

3852
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:53,679
anyway we eventually got it fixed and

3853
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:55,519
got the mainframe running again

3854
02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:57,679
so that was your little when was that

3855
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:59,760
again that well that must be before

3856
02:16:57,679 --> 02:17:02,239
october 79 because we moved out of that

3857
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:05,599
building then so sometimes probably 78

3858
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:07,199
sometime or early 79.

3859
02:17:05,599 --> 02:17:08,880
yeah those all those figures is just

3860
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:11,760
fascinating all the people with past

3861
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:13,679
pass through mit is really fascinating

3862
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:14,800
is there uh

3863
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:18,159
let me

3864
02:17:14,799 --> 02:17:19,518
ask you to put on your big wise

3865
02:17:18,159 --> 02:17:21,200
man hat

3866
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:22,960
is there advice that you can give to

3867
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:24,800
young people today whether in high

3868
02:17:22,959 --> 02:17:26,159
school or college who are thinking about

3869
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:29,119
their career

3870
02:17:26,159 --> 02:17:31,039
or thinking about life

3871
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:33,280
how how to live uh

3872
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:35,519
a life they're proud of a successful

3873
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:35,519
life

3874
02:17:36,638 --> 02:17:41,039
yeah so so many people ask me for advice

3875
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:44,000
and have asked when i give i talk to a

3876
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:45,840
lot of people all the time

3877
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:48,079
and there is no one way

3878
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:50,960
um

3879
02:17:48,079 --> 02:17:51,840
you know there's a lot of pressure

3880
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:54,718
to

3881
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:54,719
produce papers

3882
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:59,920
um that would be acceptable and be

3883
02:17:57,439 --> 02:17:59,920
published

3884
02:18:00,159 --> 02:18:05,039
uh maybe i was maybe i come from an age

3885
02:18:02,638 --> 02:18:07,598
where i would i could be a rebel against

3886
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:09,679
that and and still succeed maybe it's

3887
02:18:07,599 --> 02:18:12,478
harder today

3888
02:18:09,679 --> 02:18:14,879
but i think it's important not to get

3889
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:15,920
too caught up

3890
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:18,398
with

3891
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:20,638
what everyone else is doing

3892
02:18:18,398 --> 02:18:22,398
and

3893
02:18:20,638 --> 02:18:24,879
if you if a lot depends on what you want

3894
02:18:22,398 --> 02:18:27,119
of life if you want to

3895
02:18:24,879 --> 02:18:29,679
have real impact

3896
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:32,240
you have to be ready to fail

3897
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:34,239
a lot of times so you have to make a lot

3898
02:18:32,239 --> 02:18:36,558
of unsafe decisions

3899
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:38,799
and the only way to make that work is to

3900
02:18:36,558 --> 02:18:41,039
make keep doing it for a long time and

3901
02:18:38,799 --> 02:18:42,879
then one of them will be work out and so

3902
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:46,080
that that that will make something

3903
02:18:42,879 --> 02:18:48,079
successful or not

3904
02:18:46,079 --> 02:18:50,000
or you may or you just may you know end

3905
02:18:48,079 --> 02:18:51,840
up you know not having a you know having

3906
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,439
a lousy career i mean it's certainly

3907
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:56,239
possible taking the risk is the thing

3908
02:18:53,439 --> 02:18:59,439
yeah so but it it

3909
02:18:56,239 --> 02:19:03,760
but there's no way to to

3910
02:18:59,439 --> 02:19:06,639
make all safe decisions and actually

3911
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:08,559
really contribute

3912
02:19:06,638 --> 02:19:12,318
do you um

3913
02:19:08,558 --> 02:19:14,879
think about your death by your mortality

3914
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:16,638
i gotta say when covert hit

3915
02:19:14,879 --> 02:19:18,318
i did because we did you know in the

3916
02:19:16,638 --> 02:19:21,358
early days we didn't know how bad it was

3917
02:19:18,318 --> 02:19:23,199
going to be and i that that made me work

3918
02:19:21,359 --> 02:19:24,960
on my book harder for a while but then

3919
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:26,719
i'd started this company and now i'm

3920
02:19:24,959 --> 02:19:28,718
doing full-time more than full-time in

3921
02:19:26,718 --> 02:19:30,638
the company so the books on hold but i

3922
02:19:28,718 --> 02:19:35,000
do want to finish this book um when you

3923
02:19:30,638 --> 02:19:35,000
think about it are you afraid of it

3924
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:39,120
i'm afraid of dribbling

3925
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:45,200
you know

3926
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:49,040
i'm losing it the details of okay yeah

3927
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:51,840
yeah but the fact that the ride ends

3928
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:53,280
i've known that for a long time um so

3929
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:55,439
it's

3930
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:57,359
yeah but there's knowing and knowing

3931
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:59,359
it's such a

3932
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:01,840
yeah and it really sucks it feels it

3933
02:19:59,359 --> 02:20:04,479
feels a lot closer

3934
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:06,478
so my in in my my blog with my

3935
02:20:04,478 --> 02:20:07,519
predictions my sort of pushback against

3936
02:20:06,478 --> 02:20:08,959
that was

3937
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:10,640
i said

3938
02:20:08,959 --> 02:20:14,000
i'm going to review these every year for

3939
02:20:10,639 --> 02:20:17,199
32 years and that puts me into my

3940
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:18,799
mid-90s so you know it's my whole every

3941
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:20,640
every time you write the blog post

3942
02:20:18,799 --> 02:20:22,719
you're getting closer and closer to your

3943
02:20:20,639 --> 02:20:24,959
own prediction that's that's true of

3944
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:28,159
your death yeah

3945
02:20:24,959 --> 02:20:30,159
what do you hope your legacy is

3946
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:32,639
you're one of the greatest roboticist ai

3947
02:20:30,159 --> 02:20:34,719
researchers of all time

3948
02:20:32,639 --> 02:20:37,039
um

3949
02:20:34,719 --> 02:20:39,599
what i hope is that i actually

3950
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:41,280
finished writing this book

3951
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:43,760
and that

3952
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:45,680
there was a there's one person

3953
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:47,600
who reads it

3954
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:50,159
and sees something

3955
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:52,159
about changing the way they're thinking

3956
02:20:50,159 --> 02:20:54,079
and that leads to

3957
02:20:52,159 --> 02:20:56,159
the next

3958
02:20:54,079 --> 02:20:57,439
big

3959
02:20:56,159 --> 02:20:59,200
and then there'll be

3960
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:02,559
on a podcast a hundred years from now

3961
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:02,560
saying i once read that book

3962
02:21:02,799 --> 02:21:07,199
and that changed everything

3963
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:08,398
uh what do you think is the meaning of

3964
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:10,560
life

3965
02:21:08,398 --> 02:21:13,199
this whole thing the existence the the

3966
02:21:10,559 --> 02:21:14,159
the all the hurried things we do on this

3967
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:15,280
planet

3968
02:21:14,159 --> 02:21:17,119
what do you think is the meaning of it

3969
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:19,680
all yeah well you know i think we're all

3970
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:21,840
really bad at it

3971
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:24,398
life or finding meaning or both yeah we

3972
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:26,239
get caught up in in in the it's easier

3973
02:21:24,398 --> 02:21:28,559
to get easier to do the stuff that's

3974
02:21:26,239 --> 02:21:29,840
immediate and not through the stuff it's

3975
02:21:28,559 --> 02:21:32,879
not immediate

3976
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:35,359
um so the big picture we're batting yeah

3977
02:21:32,879 --> 02:21:37,438
yeah do you have a sense of what that

3978
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:39,840
big picture is like why you ever look up

3979
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:42,079
to the stars and ask why the hell are we

3980
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:42,079
here

3981
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:50,079
you know my my

3982
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:52,639
my my atheism tells me it's just random

3983
02:21:50,079 --> 02:21:55,359
but you know i want to understand the

3984
02:21:52,639 --> 02:21:57,119
way random in the and that's what i talk

3985
02:21:55,359 --> 02:21:58,670
about in this book how order comes from

3986
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:00,160
disorder yeah um

3987
02:21:58,670 --> 02:22:02,318
[Music]

3988
02:22:00,159 --> 02:22:03,840
but it kind of sprung up like most of

3989
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:04,879
the whole thing is random but this

3990
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:06,559
little

3991
02:22:04,879 --> 02:22:07,599
pocket of complexity they would call

3992
02:22:06,559 --> 02:22:10,239
earth

3993
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:12,159
that like why the hell does that happen

3994
02:22:10,239 --> 02:22:13,920
and and what we don't know

3995
02:22:12,159 --> 02:22:16,799
is how common that

3996
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:18,000
pop those pockets of complexity are or

3997
02:22:16,799 --> 02:22:20,840
how often

3998
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,799
um because they may not last

3999
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:25,439
forever

4000
02:22:22,799 --> 02:22:29,119
which is uh more exciting slash sad to

4001
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:31,920
you if we're alone or if there's

4002
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:34,399
infinite number of oh i i i think i

4003
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:37,439
think it's impossible for me to believe

4004
02:22:34,398 --> 02:22:39,680
that we're alone um

4005
02:22:37,439 --> 02:22:41,520
that would just be too horrible too

4006
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:43,520
cruel

4007
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:45,359
it could be like the sad thing it could

4008
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:48,159
be like a graveyard of intelligent

4009
02:22:45,359 --> 02:22:50,640
civilizations oh everywhere yeah that

4010
02:22:48,159 --> 02:22:53,200
might be the most likely outcome

4011
02:22:50,639 --> 02:22:55,680
and for us too yeah exactly yeah and all

4012
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:58,399
of this will be forgotten yeah

4013
02:22:55,680 --> 02:23:01,520
including all the robots you build

4014
02:22:58,398 --> 02:23:03,680
everything forgotten

4015
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:05,760
well on average

4016
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:06,960
everyone has been forgotten in history

4017
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:08,960
yeah right

4018
02:23:06,959 --> 02:23:11,119
yeah most people are not remembered

4019
02:23:08,959 --> 02:23:12,079
beyond a generation or two

4020
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:14,079
um

4021
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:15,359
i mean yeah well not just on average

4022
02:23:14,079 --> 02:23:16,959
basically

4023
02:23:15,359 --> 02:23:19,040
very close to 100 percent of people

4024
02:23:16,959 --> 02:23:19,759
who've ever lived or forgotten yeah i

4025
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:22,319
mean

4026
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:24,239
no longer i don't know anyone alive who

4027
02:23:22,318 --> 02:23:26,239
remembers my great grandparents because

4028
02:23:24,239 --> 02:23:28,000
we didn't meet them

4029
02:23:26,239 --> 02:23:29,920
so

4030
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:32,398
still this fun this

4031
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:33,600
this life is pretty fun somehow

4032
02:23:32,398 --> 02:23:34,799
yeah

4033
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:37,600
even the

4034
02:23:34,799 --> 02:23:39,679
immense absurdity and uh at times

4035
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:41,439
meaninglessness of it all it's pretty

4036
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:43,120
fun and one of the for me one of the

4037
02:23:41,439 --> 02:23:45,120
most fun things is

4038
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:46,720
robots and i've looked up to your work

4039
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:47,680
i've looked up to you for a long time

4040
02:23:46,719 --> 02:23:51,039
that's right

4041
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:52,639
ron it it's it's an honor that uh

4042
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:54,240
you would spend your valuable time with

4043
02:23:52,639 --> 02:23:55,680
me today talking it was an amazing

4044
02:23:54,239 --> 02:23:57,359
conversation thank you so much for being

4045
02:23:55,680 --> 02:24:00,079
here well thanks for thanks for talking

4046
02:23:57,359 --> 02:24:01,040
with me i've enjoyed it

4047
02:24:00,079 --> 02:24:02,879
thanks for listening to this

4048
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:04,640
conversation with rodney brooks to

4049
02:24:02,879 --> 02:24:06,879
support this podcast please check out

4050
02:24:04,639 --> 02:24:09,119
our sponsors in the description

4051
02:24:06,879 --> 02:24:12,639
and now let me leave you with the three

4052
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:15,760
laws of robotics from isaac asimov

4053
02:24:12,639 --> 02:24:18,478
one a robot may not injure a human being

4054
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:20,159
or through inaction allow a human being

4055
02:24:18,478 --> 02:24:22,719
to come to harm

4056
02:24:20,159 --> 02:24:25,200
two a robot must obey the orders given

4057
02:24:22,719 --> 02:24:28,318
to it by human beings except when such

4058
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:31,280
orders would conflict with the first law

4059
02:24:28,318 --> 02:24:32,478
and three a robot must protect its own

4060
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:34,239
existence

4061
02:24:32,478 --> 02:24:35,358
as long as such protection does not

4062
02:24:34,239 --> 02:24:38,639
