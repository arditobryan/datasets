1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,318
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,479
travis stevens

3
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:09,599
2016 olympic silver medalist in judo and

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,759
one of the greatest american judoka ever

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,000
but his story is inspiring not because

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,719
of that olympic medal but because of the

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,800
decades of injury hardship incredible

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,479
battles against the best in the world

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,000
wrapping up in close heartbreaking

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,960
losses at the 2008 and 2012 games all of

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,198
which eventually led to that very silver

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,599
medal in 2016.

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,280
as we talk about in the podcast travis

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,000
is also someone who is largely

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,399
responsible for me getting into judo for

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,200
which i will forever be grateful

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,480
he also happens to be now my judo coach

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,320
and mentor

19
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,558
i'll release a video of travis and i

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,558
doing some judo in a few days

21
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,359
to support this podcast please check out

22
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,679
our sponsors in the description

23
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,280
as a side note let me say a few words

24
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,359
that i've written down

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,439
about the olympic games and the

26
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,039
international olympics committee

27
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,798
i'm visiting family has the t-shirt

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,560
but i had to pull away to write and to

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,680
say these words

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,760
because this very video was taken down

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,600
by youtube as per the request of the ioc

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
you know it's serious when a russian

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,280
takes time away from family food and

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,118
drink

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
i am heartbroken to see continued

36
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,000
incompetence greed and corruption on the

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,599
part of the ilc in failing to do as the

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,840
olympic charter states to quote ensure

39
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,919
the fullest coverage and the widest

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,040
possible audience in the world for the

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,920
olympic games end quote

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
i want to give you two facts first they

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,320
do not make most of the videos of the

44
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,239
games available for replay anywhere that

45
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,879
is accessible searchable and

46
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:52,078
discoverable whether funded by ads or by

47
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,879
subscriptions for example on youtube or

48
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,399
their own service it is not available

49
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,798
anywhere

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,599
second in the most absurd violation of

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,280
the olympic charter they've uploaded all

52
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:07,679
of the videos of the 2012 2016 and the

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
2020 slash

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,319
olympics to youtube

55
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:14,159
and they set all of these videos to

56
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,000
private

57
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,359
this results in a situation like my

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,520
four-hour conversation that you're

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,920
watching now with travis stevens being

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,879
taken down due to us including a few

61
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:27,199
seconds of a small video overlay of

62
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:30,000
travis's epic match against ole bishop

63
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,079
in 2012 this is done automatically as

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,840
per the request of the ioc

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,480
i have the video due to having screen

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,560
recorded it from 2012.

67
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,560
here you have travis stevens

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,400
an olympic silver medalist

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,439
someone who spent his entire life

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,519
overcoming injuries losses hard weight

71
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,919
cuts periods of no financial

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,959
psychological support culminating in the

73
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,280
biggest heartbreak of his career

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,400
in this one match and this match is

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,800
available nowhere online not for free

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,439
not for one million dollars

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,159
our showing short clips of it results in

78
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:09,039
the ioc taking it down not demonetizing

79
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,679
it taking it down blocking it

80
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,479
the ioc silences this amazing story of

81
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,640
travis stevens of heartbreak that

82
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,399
eventually led to triumph

83
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,039
and there are thousands of stories like

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
it stories that are supposed to inspire

85
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,400
the world

86
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,719
to me and to billions of others the

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,799
olympic games give a chance to celebrate

88
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,120
and to be inspired by the greatest

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,239
stories of human flourishing in the face

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,158
of hardship and incredibly long odds or

91
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,759
dominance in the pursuit of perfection

92
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,039
at levels previously thought to be

93
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,919
impossible

94
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,878
the olympic games inspired kids

95
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,039
like me

96
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,840
to dream and to work hard to achieve in

97
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,120
our own lives the same moments of magic

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,920
and greatness

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,438
small or big that the olympic games

100
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,679
reveal

101
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,959
i believe the members of the ilc are

102
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,719
good people

103
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,479
but people who forgot the dream the fire

104
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,639
that was sparked and burned in their

105
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,840
hearts when they first saw the olympics

106
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,318
as kids

107
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,120
they've allowed the gradual corruption

108
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,759
of their own human spirit and thereby

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,000
have robbed the world of this very fire

110
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,000
the fire of the olympic torch

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,238
the fire that ought to burn in the eyes

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,478
and hearts of kids watching the olympics

113
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,679
today daring to dream daring to be great

114
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,599
please

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,160
please do better

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,560
the world needs you the world needs the

117
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,520
olympic games

118
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,160
this is the lex friedman podcast

119
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,000
and here's my conversation with travis

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,800
stevens

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,279
judo is a martial art a sport a set of

122
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,600
techniques ideas and philosophies can we

123
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,638
start by uh maybe you giving a big

124
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,479
picture overview of what is judo

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,120
to somebody who's like outside of the

126
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:58,079
whole spectrum of grappling sports yeah

127
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,000
judo was originated in japan that was

128
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,120
used as a police tactic for self-defense

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,759
and

130
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,439
you know subduing people it's the art of

131
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,439
being able to throw somebody to the

132
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,360
ground and hold and control the

133
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,959
situation

134
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,038
um i think it's pretty much evolved

135
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,359
since then though you know it's

136
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,879
as you include like the sport aspect of

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
it it's

138
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,478
it's grown to be something more and more

139
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,800
dynamic

140
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,478
and it's kind of gotten away from that

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
so the basics is

142
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,240
people wear something called a ghee yep

143
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,038
which i think

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,478
nicely mimics like outdoor clothing yep

145
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,839
like a jacket

146
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,439
and uh they start on the

147
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,198
feet and there's uh

148
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,038
they get to grip each other and the

149
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,280
scoring works by

150
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,279
the more badass the throw is the more

151
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,198
points you get and if

152
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,079
you throw the person

153
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,360
big

154
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,639
and hard

155
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,319
on their back

156
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,400
you win the match and it's over and

157
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,478
that's called an e-pawn yep which is

158
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,279
equivalent to a knockout so i guess

159
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,519
there's no knock-downs no judo we don't

160
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,679
count those yeah they gotta hit their

161
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,599
back and they gotta hit it with force

162
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,519
and so there's a huge incentive for the

163
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,879
big throws

164
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,879
and

165
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,159
there's also the drama

166
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,680
of

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,479
somebody catching you off guard with a

168
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,639
surprise big throw and it's over yep

169
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,399
there's there's two ways of losing

170
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,639
really there's the

171
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,879
i saw this coming

172
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,199
right like you just

173
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,759
you see it but you can't stop it

174
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,000
and those ones tend to be the ones you

175
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,360
can live with the ones that are like

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,519
really hard to live with are the ones

177
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
you never saw coming right because that

178
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,279
just shows that

179
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,680
that person has really outglassed you

180
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,519
right so there's like a set of a small

181
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
set of throws maybe you can go through

182
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,560
them that are like

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,800
you saw it coming but you couldn't do

184
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,639
anything about it and then there's the

185
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,199
set of throws that are more like

186
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,120
surprises so first of all the counters

187
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,240
or if you fake one thing and go the

188
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,840
other way

189
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,639
then that's a surprise and it's like oh

190
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,079
[ __ ] you off balance the person

191
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,199
because they think you're going one way

192
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,719
and then you go the other way and

193
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,360
there's this oh [ __ ] moment all of a

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,280
sudden yeah your back is just slammed on

195
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,720
the ground one other one i mean you're

196
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:17,439
good of many throws but one of them is a

197
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,520
that i think reveals the beauty of judo

198
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,120
is the foot sweep yep

199
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:22,799
there's something about the off balance

200
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,720
and the timing that if you catch him

201
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,720
right all of a sudden it's like i had

202
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,800
the same feeling when i went skydiving

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,639
like all sudden the ground is not under

204
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,478
you anymore yeah and you just you go

205
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,720
weightlessness for like a split second

206
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:37,120
and you realize you've lost like all

207
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,639
control of your limbs like

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,639
it's like zero gravity right like you

209
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,400
just you can't turn you can't rotate you

210
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
can't do much of anything and then

211
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,959
before you know it you've hit the floor

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,199
yeah

213
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,560
it's a cool feeling when you get

214
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,560
thrown

215
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,639
um because you hope to do the same thing

216
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,120
to another person it's like you're you

217
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,720
just hit the ground hard because it's

218
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,800
not you didn't see it coming it wasn't a

219
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,440
big throw that got loaded up

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,240
it's like all sudden the surprise and

221
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,279
then

222
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,918
like

223
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,679
this like feeling your back just slams

224
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,519
and there's like the air's up

225
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,680
yeah and the worst is when you get hit

226
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,918
twice with one throw right because

227
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,680
sometimes like the guy throwing you

228
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,399
didn't expect you to leave either so you

229
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,079
hit

230
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,000
and then that guy comes down like a

231
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,159
second and a half later and it's like

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
boom boom and then the wind is just gone

233
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,599
from you yeah

234
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,918
those are the worst and then there's the

235
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,319
disappointment like then the the

236
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,158
intellectual the cognitive part comes in

237
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,399
where you're like oh [ __ ] i just lost

238
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,718
yep and you don't have like

239
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,158
a connection to why

240
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,680
right it's almost like you've just like

241
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,080
you didn't literally get a concussion

242
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,239
like you and you understand and remember

243
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,399
everything but you can't figure out how

244
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,919
this just happened

245
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,159
right those are the those are the tough

246
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,079
ones to deal with actually have you had

247
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,439
moments like that yeah where you don't

248
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
understand how it happened you have to

249
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
watch footage to understand what

250
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,920
happened even when you watch it you're

251
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,399
just like

252
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,278
i don't get it like why wasn't i in a

253
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,839
position to stop this

254
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,360
it makes zero sense

255
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,640
conceptually when you watch it you're

256
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,399
like i understand how to play defense i

257
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,919
understand

258
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,639
it looks like i'm in a defensive

259
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,039
position but at the end of the day

260
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,600
i still got thrown yeah you were talking

261
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,719
about what is it a 2008

262
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,080
match

263
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
you have a

264
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,839
non-traditional gripping style yeah

265
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,120
that's accurate to say but and then

266
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,040
you're going against another

267
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,639
right-handed player and then there's

268
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,838
some kind of fake

269
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,720
that he did

270
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,800
and then

271
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,040
he caught you yep can you can you

272
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,759
describe the throw he caught you with he

273
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:43,679
caught me with a drop sail

274
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,679
but he

275
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,759
he kind of like we were engaged we were

276
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,000
looking at each other and

277
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,600
we were kind of at like a stalemate

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,519
right he couldn't really advance i

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,759
couldn't really advance and he kind of

280
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,440
just let his gaze like

281
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,120
wander off to the right like he was

282
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,080
looking at something and then i kind of

283
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,959
like

284
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,839
what's over there and then i got thrown

285
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,719
and it's like so first of all uh for

286
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,720
people don't know uh

287
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,200
sayonagi drop means when you drop to

288
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,040
your knees and uh sanagi is one of the

289
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,040
fundamental throws of judo that's just

290
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,559
just a handful but does that actually

291
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,319
ever work

292
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,559
i always wondered that about like

293
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
boxing or judo

294
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,159
does the head movement of the person

295
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,639
work because we're still like kind of

296
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,639
dogs at heart if you look somewhere with

297
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,240
a dog the dog is gonna look that

298
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,958
direction as well does that actually

299
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,200
work ever it does um

300
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,518
but on a greater sense

301
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,879
what you try to do is not necessarily

302
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,600
get like a physical reaction of a look

303
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,919
but a lull of security where like

304
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,759
they've almost like relaxed for that

305
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,559
split second because you've

306
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:55,200
lured them into like a sense of comfort

307
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,559
and then that's when you can strike

308
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,160
so you have this

309
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:02,159
speaking of senagi you have this

310
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:05,360
gigantic uh standing synagogue yep

311
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,600
and um you have a specific grip one of

312
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,879
our challenges is there's a large number

313
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,079
of people that listen to the audio

314
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,439
version of this

315
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,838
so we're gonna have to try to describe

316
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,399
some of the stuff uh i'll do my best to

317
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,440
try to describe with words but uh you

318
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,440
have you grip with your left hand on the

319
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,760
lapel of the jacket

320
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,079
or like that area yep

321
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,319
and uh there's kind of a lean into the

322
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,759
person and i suppose is there a feeling

323
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
of a lull there that you're trying to

324
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,159
get to where you're just it feels like

325
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,078
you're both calmly dancing before you

326
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:39,199
turn your hips and go in for the throw

327
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,838
i'm actually trying to

328
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,000
create

329
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,079
a a sense of weightlessness for my lead

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,839
leg which would be my right leg

331
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:52,719
and

332
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,959
a sense of resistance from my partner

333
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,800
so you aren't you both kind of leaning

334
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,078
into each other and it creates like an

335
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,679
a-frame

336
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,278
yeah but when the a-frame is held

337
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,120
together at the top half which would be

338
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,360
my left hand and their right hand posted

339
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,200
on each other's chest it means our legs

340
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,120
are free to move and our hips are free

341
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,040
to move right and they're not gonna feel

342
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,879
your leg move because of the

343
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,799
weightlessness and is there a feeling

344
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,480
like for them is there feeling like

345
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,399
nothing bad can happen here we're all

346
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,519
relaxed everything's fine

347
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,958
yeah

348
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,120
and then they're standing off at a funny

349
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,719
angle and before they know it i've spun

350
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,639
and my back is on their chest and they

351
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,639
can't go anywhere yeah

352
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,720
yeah uh how did you first develop that

353
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,879
throw so for people um

354
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,200
it's called ippon seinagi which means

355
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,799
your right hand goes under their like

356
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,278
armpit area

357
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:42,240
and that that's like a vice that

358
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,159
connects you to them yeah and then they

359
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,839
get go on for the ride yep the

360
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,600
interesting thing with the standing one

361
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,480
is uh as opposed to drop sanagi version

362
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,040
the drop saying you kind of um

363
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,360
drop under them and because there's the

364
00:12:55,039 --> 00:13:00,399
vice they're like pulled

365
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,039
pulled under and like over yeah

366
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,278
with the standing one i suppose there's

367
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,278
some similar physics but you're kind of

368
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,360
loading them onto your hip

369
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,278
and so they're in the air

370
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,519
while you're standing still

371
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,120
there's there's a there's a sense in

372
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,759
which they're

373
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,000
like you're lifting them above

374
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,159
where they started yes

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,399
that's how you get the really big error

376
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,759
yeah if obviously if

377
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,679
um

378
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,919
if everything is right so how did you

379
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,599
first develop that how did you first i

380
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,719
first learned just learning like the

381
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,800
very basics of the throw you know foot

382
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,839
placement all that kind of stuff and

383
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,519
then

384
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,639
you know like anything the basics are

385
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,039
nice

386
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,278
um but once you get good at the basics

387
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,439
it's it's very easy to stop but it gives

388
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,360
you a good like fundamental platform to

389
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,360
learn off of and

390
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,440
to expand off of

391
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,240
and then i expanded when i first started

392
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,560
watching koga the new wind right because

393
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,278
he's the one that first like

394
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,359
introduced that split hip style sanagi

395
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,720
that i do

396
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,759
once i

397
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,879
learned that one i built

398
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,120
about eight different variations of sayo

399
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,958
off that one start position

400
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,000
that way i could regardless of your

401
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,399
defense i had an answer for a throw so

402
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,480
why that one though why can you uh can

403
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,320
you describe love to me travis stevens

404
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,519
why did you fall in love with that throw

405
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,199
in particular

406
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,679
um it

407
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,759
it was really a sense of

408
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,638
you know one of my shortcomings as a kid

409
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,159
like

410
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,159
i hate

411
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,838
leg day in the gym i hate it with a

412
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,919
passion i

413
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,040
if you ask me to do a squat i'll i'll

414
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,198
get it done

415
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,439
but i will [ __ ] and moan every step of

416
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,799
the way i hate it i remember one time i

417
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,480
was at the gym with my trainer and he

418
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,479
goes okay we're gonna do front squats

419
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,560
and i want you to put 225 on the bar and

420
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,240
i was like i can't do that

421
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,759
and he was like what do you mean you

422
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,240
can't do that and i go

423
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,519
i physically i can't do that and he was

424
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,600
like

425
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,759
are you serious and i go yeah so he's he

426
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,120
didn't believe me we put 225 on the bar

427
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,159
and i bottomed out

428
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,480
and then he was like okay let's go down

429
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,639
to 185 and i was like i can't do that i

430
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,879
just it's not happening you probably

431
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,039
couldn't strength wise you just refuse i

432
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,039
just mentally i cannot wrap my head

433
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,879
around like this ain't happening i'm not

434
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,240
doing it so i ended up your man like

435
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,320
principal

436
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,320
95 pounds on the bar i got you with a

437
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,760
front squat no problem by the way body

438
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,240
weight squats are rough too

439
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,159
psychologically so yeah i just when it

440
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,879
comes to my legs like

441
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,958
i want no part of like

442
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,039
leg pressing single leg squat split

443
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,958
squat any of that no part of it so you

444
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,039
think like the more traditional variance

445
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,518
of saying i can require you to have that

446
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,198
leg strength yeah that mass like when

447
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,360
you watch japanese judo players like

448
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,240
their thighs and their hips they're

449
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,240
thick

450
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,560
they got a lot of power there so you're

451
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,440
almost like always dropping a little bit

452
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,119
into a squat position for mine never no

453
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,680
no no not you sorry for the the

454
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,560
traditional ones yeah and so the split

455
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,399
hip

456
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,638
the split hip actually allows me to keep

457
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,159
my legs straight yeah and the farther i

458
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,639
split my legs the lower my center of

459
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,600
gravity goes now i don't need my legs

460
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,560
yeah perfect love it let's do it so

461
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,360
that's the way you were thinking about

462
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,518
it okay yeah um but it's uh you know the

463
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,480
interesting thing about it is because

464
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,560
you know as i mentioned to you i've

465
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,440
gotten to judo after first watching you

466
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:28,078
in the uh olympics and then uh watching

467
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,600
koga as well and so you start imitating

468
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,599
the people you first see

469
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,199
and then you take it to judo coaches and

470
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,560
they're like no no no that's the wrong

471
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,039
way to do it

472
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,439
and happens all the time it drives me

473
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,240
nuts drives me nuts i was in poland one

474
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,759
time

475
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,639
teaching a camp

476
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,320
and i had two coaches

477
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,399
anti-coaching

478
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,879
telling their kids not to do sayo the

479
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,320
way i do it because it never works yeah

480
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,720
it's crazy how do you have the fortitude

481
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,120
and the guts to just go on with a throw

482
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,839
that's not traditional a variant that's

483
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,600
not traditional

484
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,919
if you think about it

485
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,480
you know from a very

486
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,720
basic like root of it

487
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,959
there's a philosophy and a mentality of

488
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,720
judo of how the throes work

489
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,160
right there's a mechanical structure

490
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,120
there like

491
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,919
this makes sense if i follow that

492
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,918
principle i can do anything i want

493
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,079
nothing else matters as long as we

494
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,759
follow those core principles so in the

495
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,440
early days even

496
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,400
even then you were able to think on your

497
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,720
own yeah and i was able to develop a

498
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,640
pattern for my foot placement

499
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,519
based on my opponent's height

500
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,360
because

501
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,639
the number one thing any judo coach will

502
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,558
tell you is you need your center of

503
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,640
gravity below yours

504
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,200
well now i now i know exactly where to

505
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,200
put my feet because the shorter you are

506
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,720
the bigger the split because the lower i

507
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,480
need to get the taller you are the less

508
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,360
of a split i need

509
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,160
is there something you can say about

510
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:01,359
fundamental principles of judo is there

511
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,279
over all that time not 20 over 20 years

512
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,879
that you've been doing judo

513
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:08,960
uh it's not approaching 30 is it

514
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
yeah it's it's yeah getting it's going

515
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,519
getting there okay

516
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,480
we're a couple years away let's get in

517
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,599
there

518
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,120
um

519
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,279
is there some like

520
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,119
principles that have emerged like you

521
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,599
said you have to have your center of

522
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,159
gravity below theirs yeah is there other

523
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,759
kind of both on the gripping side the

524
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,960
footwork side

525
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,640
leverage

526
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,440
anything you can speak to there's some

527
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,200
that

528
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,600
have withstood like

529
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,440
time like

530
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,879
you have to be able to get below their

531
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,798
center of gravity because you have to be

532
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,960
able to rotate them

533
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,879
around their center of gravity and then

534
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,558
the other one is

535
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
that was always a principle when i was

536
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,558
growing up and i didn't change until

537
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,000
later on in my career was you have to be

538
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,000
able to pull

539
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,679
you need to be able to pull to get them

540
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,599
off balance

541
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,919
but when you think about that statement

542
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,359
as a whole it ended with they have to be

543
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,038
off balance

544
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,839
i don't need the pull to get you off

545
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,599
balance i just need you off balance

546
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,399
and when you think about it that way it

547
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,319
allows you to open up the doors to

548
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,120
what do i need to do to get you off

549
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,599
balance i could push pull i could flinch

550
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,479
i could fake and you could put yourself

551
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,798
in your own off balance state

552
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,000
right when you think about people who

553
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:25,679
wrestle right if i fake shoot it causes

554
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,119
you to over lean forward which means

555
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,720
you're off balance

556
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,199
there's no pull there's no push there's

557
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,120
no nothing i just get a reaction that

558
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
leaves the opportunity in the door open

559
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,000
for an attack

560
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,798
and that off balance could be very

561
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,400
subtle it could be very subtle and the

562
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:41,119
better you get and the more skills you

563
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,240
get

564
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,239
the less subtle it is

565
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,400
so we should also mention that there is

566
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,839
something called forward throws

567
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
where you

568
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,000
throw the person

569
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,918
you know they they're going to fly

570
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,319
facing forward they're going to fly

571
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,880
forward and then a backward throw is

572
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,720
they're going to fly back yep and then

573
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,520
there's lateral you know they actually

574
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,159
go sideways over like a cartwheel almost

575
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,000
okay so the forward throws there's the

576
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,280
one we've been talking about which is uh

577
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,079
say nagi and there's a bunch of

578
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,599
different variants ippon marote seinagi

579
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,079
there's drop and there's standing

580
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,199
versions of them and that all

581
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,480
i don't know if there's a way to

582
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,080
summarize it

583
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,240
but that's like as clean as uh getting

584
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,678
your center of gravity under theirs

585
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,120
as it gets

586
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,519
and then the rest is just gripping

587
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,479
variations yep i guess it's all gripping

588
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,960
variations on all of these throws but um

589
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,720
and then uh there's

590
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,120
uh in terms of forward throws there's

591
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,480
the other big one in competition is

592
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,558
uchimada

593
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,400
which is

594
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:52,158
i don't know we can try to explain that

595
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,000
one but it uh ends up being where

596
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,120
one or you're standing on just one of

597
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,359
your feet

598
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,639
and the other one is up in the air and i

599
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,759
don't know if you put in that same

600
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,360
category haragoshi like

601
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,158
those kinds of throws where you're kind

602
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,759
of a little bit single footed yeah and

603
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,600
so there's two footed techniques and

604
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,919
then there's a single footed yeah oh

605
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,879
goshi where it's like

606
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,720
you're doing a mix between the uchimada

607
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,080
and

608
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,240
it's a hug

609
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,399
you you hug a person and then you turn

610
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,480
your hips around such that you're now

611
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,720
hugging facing the same direction when

612
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,240
it comes to forward throw there's

613
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,640
regardless of the name of the throw or

614
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,480
the gripping variation that you're using

615
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,520
the whole principle is how do i get this

616
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,079
person to do a forward roll in midair

617
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,558
and land on their back

618
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,960
the more of a forward roll i can get the

619
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,558
bigger the score if i get like

620
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,079
a quarter of a turn where like you land

621
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,359
on your side and you don't go over your

622
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:53,918
back it's a half score yeah but they all

623
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,000
require me to get you to do that forward

624
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,640
rolling action so just if we think of

625
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,798
one person if they do this nice

626
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,880
leap forward and they do a roll and

627
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,480
their back nicely rolls over the ground

628
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,640
you're trying to do the exact same thing

629
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,960
with you connected to them well and if

630
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,840
it's nice and it's smooth it's probably

631
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,960
not a full score it needs to have like

632
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,558
somewhat of a violent impact

633
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,840
right so if you think of a drop saying

634
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,759
agi if i

635
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,519
if i'm moving too slow

636
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,759
and you still roll over your shoulders

637
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:27,119
and there's no direct impact it's only a

638
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:30,000
half score right they want the force

639
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,319
the force the violence that's good

640
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,759
okay uh so then uh

641
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:38,639
in terms of uh backward throws

642
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:40,558
the traditional ones there's stuff where

643
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,080
you trip them

644
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:46,879
from outside their body like osotogari

645
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,279
it's a trip where you hook your leg onto

646
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,080
their leg and you trip them but your

647
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:54,480
hook it goes outside of their legs and

648
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,798
then there's the trips from inside

649
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,240
their body there's uh one foot is called

650
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:02,158
kuchigari and then the other is ochigari

651
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,279
it doesn't matter the the most important

652
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,520
thing is outside and inside

653
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,119
uh and then there's like i don't even

654
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,480
know how you throw them sideways except

655
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,319
foot sweeps and then there's the foot

656
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,798
sweeps where you can

657
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:17,038
sweep one of their legs from out of them

658
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,960
or both their legs at the same time

659
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,000
and like we were talking about this kind

660
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,558
of

661
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,079
is when timed perfectly it's it's

662
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:29,200
effortless for everybody involved and uh

663
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,439
the ending like you said is big dramatic

664
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,519
and violent yeah

665
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,400
is there other kind of oh yeah there's

666
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,000
uh sacrifice techniques

667
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,679
there's a bunch of them

668
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,240
and that ultimately the variations have

669
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,798
to do with uh gripping but you're

670
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,159
basically you the attacker fall onto

671
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,879
your back

672
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,559
sticking your legs somewhere on

673
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,039
onto their body which is like this

674
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,639
fulcrum over which they fly and do that

675
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:56,798
same kind of role that you mentioned you

676
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,038
basically sacrifice your back to the mat

677
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,519
in order to throw them into that

678
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,200
circular pattern so they hit their back

679
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,400
sometimes we use a foot sometimes we

680
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,278
don't and so we should probably say

681
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,519
it's okay for you to go on to your back

682
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,000
as long as you're clearly demonstrating

683
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,639
control over the other person's body

684
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,278
correct you can't go to your back in the

685
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,080
same direction that your opponent is

686
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,159
trying to put you to your back right you

687
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,519
have to go the other way or you have to

688
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,840
initiate

689
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,720
you going to your own back

690
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,319
right

691
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,319
uh like clearly and then um and then

692
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,439
there's all the counters which almost

693
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,519
kind of

694
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,960
have a whole group of their own even

695
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,960
though they have

696
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,558
echoes of the same types of techniques

697
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,558
it seems like they're their own whole

698
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:47,038
thing yeah but they follow the same

699
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:49,599
principles it's just most

700
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,839
counters like if you wanted to counter

701
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,678
enuchimata for example

702
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:56,399
you're trying to throw me in a

703
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,559
somersault over my right shoulder

704
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,600
therefore i would counter you by

705
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,119
throwing you over your left shoulder

706
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,918
it goes in the opposite shoulder

707
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,798
direction but in the same somersault

708
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,240
idea

709
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,158
and there used to be

710
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,558
i already at this point forget the years

711
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,440
but it might be 20 before the 2012

712
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,359
olympics where they banned uh you you

713
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,919
used to be allowed to grab legs in the

714
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,519
same way you do in wrestling so you have

715
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,759
basically all the techniques you would

716
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,000
have in wrestling

717
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,679
available to you if you would like

718
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,440
yeah it's just that some of the

719
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,278
techniques in wrestling are not that

720
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,640
effective for getting your opponent your

721
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:34,240
to their back

722
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
wrestlers want to take the other person

723
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,159
down in any way possible and have

724
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,079
control judo wants to take you down like

725
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,240
we said in a big fashion where your back

726
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,240
slams on the ground yeah it has to be to

727
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,558
the back a lot of wrestling take downs

728
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,679
happen because they get behind them yeah

729
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:53,519
and then they they part tear out yeah

730
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,000
so uh but judo banned all touching of

731
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:59,200
the legs which is very dramatic change

732
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,319
at the sport but also 2012. after it was

733
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,200
after 20 it was in 2012 so 2008 i fought

734
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:08,000
the games and everything was free

735
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,200
in 2012 we could only touch the legs as

736
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
a

737
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,400
defensive action or

738
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,240
in response to an attack so i could try

739
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,400
to throw you with a

740
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,319
normal throw and then when you try to

741
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,798
counter i could grab your leg

742
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:25,038
right so that there uh had to be a

743
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:27,038
secondary technique and didn't like

744
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,919
didn't they disqualify

745
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:31,759
on a first offense first offense was a

746
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,759
direct disqualification which happened

747
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:38,480
at the 2012 games to the 57 brazilian

748
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:42,240
who won in 16 yeah she was dq'd and i

749
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,880
think the quarters yeah and it was like

750
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,200
i wouldn't say it was blatant as much as

751
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,720
i don't think the act

752
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,640
changed the outcome of the match had

753
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,120
they not disqualified it so that's not

754
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,880
that dramatic and by the way you say 57

755
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,599
that refers to weight divisions and

756
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,360
that's in kilograms and kilograms is the

757
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,678
measure of weight that the rest of the

758
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,439
world uses in the united states does not

759
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,120
um so

760
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,519
and there's uh we should say the

761
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,079
divisions for for guys

762
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:16,558
um i don't know what the 70 i don't know

763
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:19,038
slower level 16 60 66 73 81 90 100 and

764
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,519
heavyweight which has no ceiling

765
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,519
no ceiling

766
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,398
station yeah it is an important

767
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:28,558
distinction um

768
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,839
so and you competed most of your career

769
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:34,720
at 81 kilograms all of it

770
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:37,038
all you never did never did 73. well you

771
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,600
had to cut big for 81 anyway especially

772
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,398
towards the end of my career yeah

773
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,278
okay

774
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,519
uh

775
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,919
i overly grew into the division what's

776
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,960
uh uh i'm trying to remember is that

777
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,480
about 180 pounds

778
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,440
178.6 i think and you have to weigh in

779
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,798
with the the ghee no nothing

780
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,480
you're not allowed to wear anything

781
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,079
except for your underwear weigh in sorry

782
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,519
confusing jiu-jitsu that's right that's

783
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,839
right that's right that's which is very

784
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,720
nice

785
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:07,519
um okay so we would you say we covered

786
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,120
most of the throws or no

787
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,440
so the there's the forward and the

788
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:14,079
backward there's the sacrifice throws

789
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,679
and the counters yep and the and then

790
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,759
there's the leg grabs and we should say

791
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,360
for the leg grabs that were effective

792
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,119
it's like um

793
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,439
the big pickups where you just kind of

794
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,879
pick them up and try to figure out once

795
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,399
they're in the air what the heck to do

796
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,080
with their body to get them to the

797
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:31,278
ground you just kind of figure it out as

798
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,359
you go i think the really nice one that

799
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:34,398
was to me heartbreaking as a fan to see

800
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,839
go is

801
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,038
i guess what's called the fireman's

802
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,038
carry

803
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,278
which is uh

804
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,519
you know it does lead to judo like

805
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,640
beautiful throws and the fact that that

806
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,720
was gone is is that one i missed a

807
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,640
little bit but then a bunch of people i

808
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,880
guess came up with the variance where

809
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,759
you don't need to grab the leg

810
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,799
it's definitely not as effective as

811
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,879
being able to grab it but i'm also on

812
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,918
the side of the fence having competed in

813
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,159
all three

814
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,679
it was definitely better for the sport

815
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,039
to remove it

816
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,640
as a whole

817
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,200
it's probably good to cover sort of the

818
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,080
whole spectrum of rules of judo is uh

819
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,360
there's groundwork so there's uh you do

820
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,199
all the stuff on the feet where you're

821
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,599
trying to murder each other with a giant

822
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,080
throw but then you know if the throat

823
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,439
doesn't succeed you go to the ground and

824
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,278
you stay on the ground for some amount

825
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,880
of time like short amount of time you

826
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,880
have to move quickly you have to be

827
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,559
attacking and

828
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,960
two of the ways you can win

829
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,639
is similar to people who do jiu jitsu's

830
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,120
you can submit them

831
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,278
uh chokes arm breaks all that kind of

832
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,879
stuff no foot locks

833
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,319
and uh

834
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,240
and you can also

835
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,158
pin them yep which is get around their

836
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,240
legs and this is very

837
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,320
no this is not like wrestling you have

838
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,399
to actually get around their legs

839
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,918
and uh pin them and

840
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,839
what indigest is called side control

841
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,840
mount all kinds of ways that doesn't

842
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,918
involve their legs yeah and then you pin

843
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,398
them for like whatever 20 seconds 25

844
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,000
seconds yeah 20 seconds now i think the

845
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,398
distinction is

846
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,480
their back has to be facing the mat

847
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,479
you have to be past their legs and your

848
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,480
chest has to be on the same plane as

849
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,798
theirs yeah so it doesn't have to

850
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,120
necessarily be on top but it has to be

851
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,319
on the same plane yeah and all of this

852
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,199
is

853
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,720
i think

854
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,399
different sports of different versions

855
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,640
of this but it's like

856
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:28,079
an approximation of what dominance looks

857
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,840
like yeah so pin and wrestling is

858
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:32,000
dominating your opponent presumably if

859
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,079
you're in a street fight that position

860
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,679
allows you to then do a lot of damage

861
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,199
obviously submissions is dominance

862
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,200
because you're breaking their arm or

863
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,399
choking them to uh

864
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,319
unconscious

865
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:44,000
and then obviously the throw

866
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,599
which is not often

867
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,880
talked about but like if you talk about

868
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:49,278
a street

869
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,399
fight situation a throw

870
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:55,278
is like the best way to murder somebody

871
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,199
like this could end anyone's life yes

872
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:00,398
it's terrifying actually so okay so

873
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,120
these are all elements of dominance

874
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:03,119
so

875
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,479
going back to set of principles you're

876
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,719
mentioning

877
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,679
getting your center of mass under theirs

878
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,600
which i think applies for type of um

879
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,919
like the forward say nagi throws is

880
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,839
there is there other stuff

881
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,240
um obviously you mentioned off-balance

882
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,000
yep there's the off-balance one where

883
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,120
you can either pull to get an off

884
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,919
balance

885
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,558
or you can give way to the force

886
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,519
which can also lead to an off balance

887
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,359
um

888
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,399
you can amplify somebody's force to so

889
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,398
for example

890
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,959
if you push me

891
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:39,359
you expect a certain

892
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,159
reaction that you're ready for

893
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,839
but if you push me and i pull you

894
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,440
now you didn't expect that much force

895
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,439
coming out of you therefore you're off

896
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,600
balance

897
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,360
the thing that's distinctly recognizable

898
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,879
about judo

899
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:57,918
is like when done at the highest level

900
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,960
like it's it seems effortless when the

901
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,960
big throw happens yeah like that's just

902
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,440
it doesn't there is no other sport like

903
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,679
it in the combat sports where

904
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,679
it's like when the timing is right

905
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,080
everything just is perfect i think you

906
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,080
you get that mma and um

907
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,639
boxing sometimes when this is another

908
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,558
scout yeah perfect strike just like yeah

909
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,640
where they it but it's not just like a

910
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,879
hard hit it's like

911
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,720
it's almost like the with conor mcgregor

912
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,399
and aldo for example when you just catch

913
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,600
him just right that's right

914
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,278
and that he didn't look like he hit him

915
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,678
that hard yeah but he hit him just right

916
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:34,558
yeah and like you get to see this all

917
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,320
the time in judo it's fascinating and so

918
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,240
the beginning part of that

919
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,918
is because there's a jacket

920
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,919
there's also this whole thing that

921
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,240
you're master of which is like which is

922
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,080
gripping yeah so is there something you

923
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,000
can say about

924
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,079
are there some fundamental principles of

925
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,159
gripping that you can speak to

926
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,879
like what the hell is gripping

927
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,799
gripping is having the ability to

928
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,440
hold your opponent in such a way where

929
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:02,319
you have the ability to be offensive

930
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,120
and also the ability to be defensive at

931
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:05,480
the same given time

932
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,719
and

933
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,558
[Music]

934
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,798
it's a distinction because i can hold

935
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:13,119
you in such a way where

936
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,519
i might be able to feel offensive

937
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,839
but if you can take a purely defensive

938
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,759
grip and then i can't be offensive we

939
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,599
are no longer gripping we are holding

940
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,480
each other

941
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,798
right

942
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,759
right so like that would be the act of

943
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:30,158
being able to grip is to be in a

944
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,640
situation where you have me and i have

945
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,880
you and i can play both offense and

946
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,799
defense at the same time where you can

947
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,360
only play defense

948
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,359
so donahue talks about like jiu jitsu

949
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,158
that way and not that way but maybe you

950
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,839
can see if there's a distinction so you

951
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,399
have a set of weapons the other person

952
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,480
has a set of weapons you want to

953
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,759
sort of maximize the use of your weapons

954
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,759
and shut down

955
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,798
the set of weapons that they have that

956
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,398
they have

957
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,519
you see gripping the same way on the on

958
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,918
the feet

959
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,399
i do if we want to include body

960
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,000
positioning with our gripping

961
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:05,518
all right okay because i can give you

962
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,519
any grip you want and you still can't

963
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,320
throw me because i can put myself in a

964
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,960
position that nullifies your ability to

965
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,359
use those grips in a successful way

966
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,679
and those um would you say the hips are

967
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,719
critical to that or is it i think hips

968
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,878
shoulders chin position head position

969
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,559
you know the angle of your foot yeah

970
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:27,199
where you lean

971
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,358
wow okay and so uh and there's a bunch

972
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,598
of places you can grip obviously if

973
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:33,519
people like kind of think of a jacket

974
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,519
like there's a bunch of places you can

975
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,119
grip that are interesting so you can

976
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,358
grip on the collar

977
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,079
you can grip on the sleeves you can grip

978
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,960
like at the elbow joint yeah and you

979
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,000
could do uh those bad ass like

980
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,358
eastern european georgian over the back

981
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,918
back over the opposite sides of the

982
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,199
heads yeah yeah the koreans that grab on

983
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,440
one side around the head with their

984
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:58,399
hands together yeah there's something

985
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,079
really nice about just those like i mean

986
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,559
especially george just throwing that

987
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,720
hand yeah just over the person and just

988
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,639
it's you're not actually gripping a belt

989
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:09,118
or anything you're gripping just the

990
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,719
entirety of like as opposed to being all

991
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,559
nice so i'm gonna grab this part of the

992
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,719
jagger this part of the jacket you're

993
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,920
just like taking the whole [ __ ]

994
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:20,559
jacket and just launching somebody for

995
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,280
those people that can't picture

996
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,960
judo think about it in like if you

997
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,079
understood like what a boxing match

998
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,358
looks like

999
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,960
and you thought about that as like

1000
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,039
traditional gripping

1001
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,119
when you throw like a russian grip over

1002
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,039
the back that's more like a hockey fight

1003
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,160
like i'm just grabbing you and we're

1004
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,679
just gonna

1005
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,920
we're gonna be throwing punches left and

1006
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,000
right because when we have that grip

1007
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,240
somebody has to get thrown yeah there's

1008
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,400
no there's no we don't walk around with

1009
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:47,838
this grip it's it's go time once

1010
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,039
somebody throws it

1011
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:53,039
to me as a as a fan and sort of amateur

1012
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:55,920
practitioner

1013
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:58,000
there's two styles of olympic level judo

1014
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,440
one is where you're trying not to get

1015
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,358
thrown

1016
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,679
and the other is where you're trying to

1017
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:03,679
throw

1018
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,839
more specifically when you're trying not

1019
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,920
to get thrown there's like the strategy

1020
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,920
they're using gripping to

1021
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,760
nullify their offense and all those

1022
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,519
kinds of stuff you're you're being very

1023
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,280
clever and strategic and all that you

1024
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,440
know maybe using conditioning

1025
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,200
and then there's people who just like

1026
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,119
step in the pocket

1027
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,239
and they don't almost don't care if

1028
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,440
they're getting thrown because they have

1029
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,078
the confidence that they're going to

1030
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,920
throw first yep and those like there's a

1031
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,240
clear distinction between the people

1032
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,119
that do one or the other and i think

1033
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,959
both can be done extremely successfully

1034
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,640
at the highest level it's just like

1035
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,039
obviously you admire the people that

1036
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:44,719
step in the pocket and and i think when

1037
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,800
you look at the people who do judo

1038
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,759
the best like if we want to talk about

1039
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,000
like

1040
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,000
the top 10 percent of the people who

1041
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,519
would compete at the games

1042
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,119
they do both

1043
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,239
and they do both

1044
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,440
really well but they favor one

1045
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,439
because

1046
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,039
if you look at a player like uh

1047
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,358
lutetiliani of georgia for example

1048
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:10,480
there's a guy that stands in the pocket

1049
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:12,078
but we can find numerous occasions where

1050
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,159
he's hustled some people for like a

1051
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,920
short period of time to get out of

1052
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,838
scenarios to

1053
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,880
elongate the match to make somebody

1054
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,119
tired

1055
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,039
so you want both sides of the coin

1056
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,640
but you better pick the one that

1057
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,960
you know eighty percent of your strategy

1058
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,719
is going to be built around

1059
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,280
sorry for the romantic question but i

1060
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:34,799
talked to dan gable and uh

1061
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,200
he always looked to the russians as um

1062
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,880
as the artists in wrestling

1063
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,639
and uh he always wanted to be an artist

1064
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,280
but i think he's known for being that

1065
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,519
sort of uh guts aggression mental

1066
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,519
toughness guy but he always was drawn to

1067
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,280
the artistry of wrestling it's hard to

1068
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,199
know when you just

1069
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,960
watch you because it looks like you're

1070
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,960
aggressive and you got the guts and the

1071
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,960
mental toughness but there's also

1072
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,679
obviously a mastery of technique which

1073
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,838
would you lean towards in terms of

1074
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,399
what accounts for your success and just

1075
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,078
the way you approach judo is it the

1076
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,680
the guts the aggression the mental

1077
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,599
toughness

1078
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:15,039
and or is it the mastery of technique

1079
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,480
the artistry

1080
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,960
mine would be my

1081
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,559
my aggressiveness if i'm gonna pick

1082
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,880
those two areas

1083
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,639
um

1084
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,720
but i think there's a third area in

1085
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,039
there that i would put myself in where

1086
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,279
i'm more of a strategist

1087
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:34,719
i look at all of my opponents

1088
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,880
and all i ever see is their faults

1089
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,519
and the way i do judo is built around

1090
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,519
their faults

1091
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,640
and it's just i put myself in scenarios

1092
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,760
where i don't even know how i'm going to

1093
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,639
win

1094
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,960
but what i've done in those scenarios is

1095
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,039
i've made it very difficult for you to

1096
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,480
win

1097
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,960
and then i figure out the rest as i go

1098
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,880
like how do you study an opponent

1099
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,519
are there bins you can put them in like

1100
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,200
there's a lefty and a righty or yep

1101
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,440
this kind of stuff how many bins are

1102
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,838
there in judo in your mind that you put

1103
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,639
your opponents in

1104
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,880
yeah there's probably about 20.

1105
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,440
there's like certain players who you

1106
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,519
could put in a category of like

1107
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,599
they're only good for the first you know

1108
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,280
two-thirds of the match

1109
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,440
after that they turn into a different

1110
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,200
player where they're either falling into

1111
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,079
a sense of panic

1112
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:32,639
or uncertainty and you can if you were

1113
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,160
to take a video clip of let's say

1114
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:37,358
church's philly right they got george

1115
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,199
and i beat in the olympic semi

1116
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,679
he's somebody that would beat you in the

1117
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,838
first three minutes and if you clipped

1118
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,838
out all of his matches and you only

1119
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,838
watched the first

1120
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,279
three minutes of every match you would

1121
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,199
see one style

1122
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,280
if you found all the matches where he

1123
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:55,199
got taken into the last minute

1124
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,800
and he wasn't winning by a

1125
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,480
a major score

1126
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,920
you would see a completely different

1127
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,559
fighter

1128
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,800
and so going into like my olympic semi i

1129
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,799
put him into that category of like i

1130
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,640
want to get to this guy because this guy

1131
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,800
is beatable

1132
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,000
the trick is how do you get there how do

1133
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,560
you get there and by the way we're

1134
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,880
talking about the 2016 olympics where

1135
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,759
you won the silver medal you're part of

1136
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,200
uh three different olympics but the

1137
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,200
cardio

1138
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:26,000
aspect of it

1139
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:27,919
have you faced exhaustion often in your

1140
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,119
matches where you have to go deep and go

1141
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,599
like past

1142
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,440
yeah but that's not from

1143
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,920
the judo side of it that's from like i

1144
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,679
did a very bad job of making weight it's

1145
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,200
always the way cut yeah it's always the

1146
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,480
weight cut

1147
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:45,199
and i think people really struggle

1148
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,119
with that they blame cardio and training

1149
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,719
and everything else but

1150
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,240
when it really comes down to it like we

1151
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,679
train for an hour and a half two hours

1152
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,919
twice a day

1153
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,919
how are you tired after five minutes

1154
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,559
right right it becomes into a mental

1155
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,960
struggle your anxiety your stress your

1156
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,440
lack of belief in yourself

1157
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,599
or in my case sometimes it's poor

1158
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,920
nutrition sometimes i had one too many

1159
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,318
mcdonald's meals it just

1160
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,680
it happens okay so let's talk about wig

1161
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,039
cutting real quick

1162
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,159
so

1163
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,159
i've i've seen weight cutting

1164
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:21,118
break some of the toughest

1165
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:22,719
fighters wrestlers grapplers ever like

1166
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,680
burn out break like where they makes you

1167
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:27,118
want to quit the sport yep um so you

1168
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:28,799
know this is what people don't often

1169
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,559
talk about but mentally is one of the

1170
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,720
hardest things especially when you're

1171
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,199
doing it kind of wrong

1172
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:37,439
because it becomes a mental war

1173
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:40,078
um so you competed like you said your

1174
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,480
whole career at 81 kilograms

1175
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,240
you walked around at

1176
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,559
88 89. so about 15 pounds

1177
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:51,279
sometimes 20 pounds

1178
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:53,440
over that give or give or take

1179
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,599
and so what uh

1180
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,440
what was your process like mentally and

1181
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,119
physically first of all maybe you can

1182
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,119
comment on when the weigh-ins are

1183
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,280
relative to the mattress and then what

1184
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,440
was your process like leading like a

1185
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,400
week ahead a day ahead

1186
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,519
an hour ahead minutes ahead of the the

1187
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,760
weigh-in

1188
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:14,239
man everyone

1189
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,359
varies tremendously because we're not

1190
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:17,279
like

1191
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,199
most sports because you're dropped off

1192
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,440
in foreign countries with

1193
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:24,399
who knows what right some places have

1194
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,119
sauna some places have treadmills

1195
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,680
i went to a place one time in china in

1196
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,000
the middle of winter where the roads

1197
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:34,078
were frozen with ice and we had to use

1198
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,679
our hotel rooms because

1199
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,680
it was you couldn't sweat outside

1200
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:40,000
because it was too cold right

1201
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,159
um and every one of my olympics the

1202
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,760
weight cut was different just given my

1203
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,639
mass when i went to 2008 i was probably

1204
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,440
like

1205
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:51,920
80 to 83 kilos walking around so weight

1206
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,119
cutting wasn't a thing for me

1207
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,119
in

1208
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,519
london we actually weighed in the

1209
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,880
morning of so weigh-ins were at like 6

1210
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:00,480
a.m

1211
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,720
and the olympics were always beneficial

1212
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,039
to me because they actually don't start

1213
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:07,039
until like 10 or 11.

1214
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,639
so you actually were able to recover

1215
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,119
where on the circuit you would weigh in

1216
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,519
at 6am and the competition started at

1217
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,960
8am it's like well i was cutting weight

1218
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:16,800
at 5am

1219
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,400
and most of it for people who are not

1220
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,200
familiar but maybe you can also correct

1221
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,280
me

1222
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,879
most of it you're really just getting

1223
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,040
the water out of your system it was

1224
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,920
water at that point yeah

1225
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,679
like 24 hours before even like so are

1226
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,039
you like an hour before

1227
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:36,078
but yeah but like leading up to it um

1228
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,759
and do have you eaten the day before do

1229
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,079
you try to minimize the amount of food

1230
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,839
in your system my weight cutting process

1231
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,880
was a little bit different than than

1232
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:46,559
most people because

1233
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,599
i like to eat

1234
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,719
um

1235
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,880
i'm not

1236
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,279
i'm not the type of person that believes

1237
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,200
your athletic career is determined by

1238
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,519
your nutrition

1239
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,759
right i don't i don't believe that i

1240
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:03,280
think some sports are built that way but

1241
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,760
when it comes to combat sports like

1242
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,359
you know your ability to knock somebody

1243
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,760
out has nothing to do with whether you

1244
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,199
had a cheeseburger or a salad

1245
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,960
my ability to throw you is not

1246
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,799
determined by that i may be able to

1247
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,159
perform better because i've eaten a

1248
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,720
certain way

1249
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,920
but not enough to justify an entire diet

1250
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:22,399
change

1251
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,159
your body is built and my body is built

1252
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,400
to operate with certain things that i've

1253
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,679
had in my system for years

1254
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,920
yeah i think

1255
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:30,879
i'm with you but i also believe that

1256
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,119
there's a

1257
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,440
mental aspect so if you're surrounded by

1258
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,440
people that tell you diet matters

1259
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,039
then if your diet is off you're going to

1260
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,559
believe you're going to be off because

1261
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,480
the people around you tell you your diet

1262
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:44,239
should be good so yeah

1263
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,920
i think it's like

1264
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,399
it's the same i i've had an argument

1265
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,039
with matthew walker who's uh

1266
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,039
who's a sleep scientist about sleep and

1267
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:54,880
it's like if you believe sleep is

1268
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,239
essential it's essential to get eight

1269
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,358
hours of sleep every single night

1270
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:59,199
perfectly

1271
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:00,880
then you're going to be very stressed

1272
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,799
when you don't get it and then i think

1273
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,480
it will negatively affect the stress

1274
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,400
will negatively affect your longevity in

1275
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,400
all kinds of aspects of your life

1276
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,000
if you actually just learn to truly

1277
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,160
listen to your body become a scientist

1278
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,400
for your own body with sleep and food it

1279
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:16,078
might end up that it will be the eight

1280
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,639
hours a night or whatever but it might

1281
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,079
be something else and probably die here

1282
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:23,118
i remember when i was meeting with the

1283
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,990
usoc nutritionist after

1284
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,358
london it was probably around

1285
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:28,719
[Music]

1286
00:45:26,358 --> 00:45:29,759
2014 i think

1287
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:31,199
and

1288
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,720
when we had our team meeting at the

1289
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,639
beginning of the year and i was talking

1290
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:36,879
to him he was talking about the

1291
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,879
nutrition plans that he could put us on

1292
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,280
and i was like time out i've done the

1293
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,280
usoc thing like i've done the couscous

1294

1295
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,760
i go

1296
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:49,358
i'm full [ __ ] the kind of goose

1297
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,119
oh boy like there was just because

1298
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:52,719
there's like a cookie cutter plan right

1299
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,480
right and i was like

1300
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,159
look here's what i want you to do i go

1301
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,199
i'll listen to you

1302
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,759
but you're going to walk into the

1303
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,159
7-eleven across the street from the usoc

1304
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,319
and if you can't buy it in that 7-eleven

1305
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,879
it's not on my plan right

1306
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:08,880
i go because i go to places where

1307
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,318
the only thing i can eat is pringles and

1308
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,000
a snickers bar

1309
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:14,400
i've done that like i've flown to

1310
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,199
azerbaijan stayed in a hotel where the

1311
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,800
restaurant is closed usa judo hasn't

1312
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:20,480
paid for the meal plan

1313
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,318
and the only thing that's available is

1314
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,280
the thing across the street so you were

1315
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:25,358
eating

1316
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,680
pringles before fighting a grand slam

1317
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:29,838
event while cutting 20 pounds and and a

1318
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,440
snickers bowl yeah

1319
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:33,679
that's the visual of that that's some

1320
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,280
like that's some rocky [ __ ] okay build

1321
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:37,279
me a nutrition plan go for it because

1322
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,960
i'm not paying my own way

1323
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,280
to travel with

1324
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,358
14 days of food

1325
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,800
right i mean that's that's one of the

1326
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:48,880
magic of your whole career and also judo

1327
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,039
i mean i'm sorry to say of course you

1328
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,720
want athletes to be super rich

1329
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,679
and super well funded from an athlete

1330
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:57,759
perspective and the sport to be popular

1331
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,639
and managed in an ultra-competent way

1332
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,880
but

1333
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:02,879
that's not reality but as a fan it's fun

1334
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,720
to watch somebody like you who's

1335
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,400
exceptionally driven has to suffer in

1336
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,399
all these different interesting ways

1337
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,400
it's only suffering if you expect the

1338
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,720
other side right i don't expect it i

1339
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,960
accept it for what it is which is why i

1340
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:20,639
write off nutrition for athletes right

1341
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,720
because it can be done without it as

1342
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:23,519
long as you know to what you said before

1343
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:25,598
like

1344
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,079
you don't believe you need it

1345
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,160
some people believe they need it

1346
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,599
so the mind getting your mind right is

1347
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,358
the most important thing you know what i

1348
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,880
believe i need what's that a snickers

1349
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,239
bar when i'm tired

1350
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,480
i want a little bit of sugar makes me

1351
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:41,358
feel better

1352
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,358
you want me to see you

1353
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:44,880
uh what are you gonna do

1354
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,720
yeah so

1355
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,160
i just love the the the visual of you

1356
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:49,838
eating his thinking but that's what it

1357
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,118
became but that became part of my

1358
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:53,279
nutrition plan

1359
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,800
when the usoc guy wrote my nutrition

1360
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,760
plan i was eating a burrito bowl

1361
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,720
with brown rice white meat chicken black

1362
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,359
beans guacamole cheese two chocolate

1363
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:08,159
chip cookies and a diet coke this is

1364
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:10,639
like chipotle uh it was below co but

1365
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,719
same concept same same concept because

1366
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,199
chocolate chip cookies because i needed

1367
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,358
the sugar i was

1368
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:20,239
i was

1369
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:22,799
88 kilos when i stepped on the scale at

1370
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:25,838
six point three percent body fat

1371
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,839
now i got to make 81.

1372
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,039
what really yeah

1373
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,920
and the usoc was like hey

1374
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:36,800
you know you can't you can't fight 81

1375
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,720
anymore you have to fight 90s and i go

1376
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,119
i'm already into the quad

1377
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:43,039
i'm not changing i go

1378
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,800
build me a plan where i can do this and

1379
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,719
now we have to have an acceptable weight

1380
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,440
cut like it just what do you want me to

1381
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:51,039
do i'm not the ijf i can't just change

1382
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,480
the fact that it takes two years to

1383
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,318
qualify

1384
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,838
i know where i'm at i know what i have

1385
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:59,039
to go through and i accept the

1386
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:01,279
consequences it is what it is we want

1387
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,599
all right so what was the process i mean

1388
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,680
can you can you speak too so you you

1389
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,480
wake up early in the morning the the day

1390
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:11,199
of the weigh-ins a few hours before

1391
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,679
technically my weight cut never started

1392
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:15,199
until i got off a plane

1393
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:19,039
and to a hotel

1394
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:21,439
and how many hours three days

1395
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,960
so it's a three day cut to three days

1396
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,200
mentally you're thinking of it that way

1397
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,760
yep and then you're still eating i eat

1398
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,759
every day and then like what do you load

1399
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,480
up on water maybe as you start and then

1400
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,760
nope or the the water stops just it is

1401
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,199
what it is

1402
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,319
[Laughter]

1403
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:39,838
so use i mean it's a slow

1404
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,800
you're not actually like

1405
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:46,400
sweating all three days yeah

1406
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,960
but then it's like torture to sleep

1407
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,240
part of the process

1408
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,159
are you able to sleep sometimes

1409
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,318
it depends

1410
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:59,039
so you're dehydrated further and further

1411
00:49:56,318 --> 00:49:59,920
dehydrated with six seven percent body

1412
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,358
fat

1413
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,280
trying to lose 10 pounds i even

1414
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:04,880
developed a way to drink water out of a

1415
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,720
bottle where i don't drink anything but

1416
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,280
i feel like i have

1417
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,959
uh swishing it what's the no so like i

1418
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,680
take like a bottle of water and like if

1419
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,960
we were to like to draw a line on it i

1420
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:16,960
would tip it and i would go like this

1421
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,880
and you would draw that line but like

1422
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:28,960
i've drink now water for 20 seconds or

1423
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,160
whatever it is

1424
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,880
and i feel like

1425
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,239
i get the fix yeah brain told me i got

1426
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,680
there

1427
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,000
no problem

1428
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:41,759
that's amazing man you just

1429
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:45,920
your mind's a very powerful tool and

1430
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,440
the the problem a lot of people have is

1431
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,119
they don't accept the reality of the

1432
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,800
situation

1433
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,838
they [ __ ] about the reality of the

1434
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,839
situation i just

1435
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:56,719
of all you could always quit

1436
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:59,440
right

1437
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:01,759
yep so like you're not ex never missed

1438
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,240
wait never never

1439
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,880
you can you can perform poorly you can't

1440
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:10,000
miss wait don't miss way don't miss wait

1441
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,480
because you you can always win

1442
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,679
regardless of how bad the weight cut is

1443
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:19,358
you can never win if you miss weight

1444
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:21,679
but your brain is also really good maybe

1445
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:22,400
not your brain

1446
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:24,239
but

1447
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,400
i know my brain i think most people's

1448
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,719
brains are good at generating the more

1449
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,400
desperate things become the better it's

1450
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:33,759
generating excuses

1451
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,639
so what were you doing with your mind

1452
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,720
that

1453
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:38,960
resulted in you never

1454
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,759
missing weight the plan

1455
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,318
so

1456
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,359
like i said like my weight cut would

1457
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,400
never start until i got to the hotel

1458
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:48,558
because

1459
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,838
i didn't check my weight the morning of

1460
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:50,640
i didn't check my weight when i got

1461
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:53,358
there

1462
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:55,679
i just while i'm traveling i'm doing

1463
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,598
things at like a minimal level

1464
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,480
but i'm never not giving myself

1465
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,480
something i'm craving

1466
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,079
if i'm thirsty i'm drinking a diet coke

1467
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,159
if i'm hungry

1468
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,839
i'm buying a snickers bar i'm buying a

1469
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,519
sandwich

1470
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,759
i am

1471
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,920
and i accept the consequences when i get

1472
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,079
there and then when i get there

1473
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,039
if i step on the scale and it says 88

1474
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,880
kilos i instantaneously know exactly

1475
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,960
what it's going to take to be 81. and

1476
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,838
then you just follow like a robot follow

1477
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,519
a very specific process yep

1478
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:31,599
and then i mean because there's a lot of

1479
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,920
seconds in three days

1480
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,400
seconds and minutes and you just i just

1481
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,639
know exactly what it takes from my body

1482
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,760
i know exactly what a one hour gym

1483
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,920
workout wearing a sauna suit

1484
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,079
is gonna take i know exactly what i'm

1485
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,159
gonna lose on day one and i know exactly

1486
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,400
what i'm gonna lose on day three because

1487
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,159
they're not the same so i can instantly

1488
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,599
look at a hotel

1489
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:57,358
decide is there a bathroom sauna gym

1490
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,760
temperature of the gym

1491
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:01,838
access to the gym and when it is

1492
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,880
access to the judo mats my training

1493
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:04,799
partners

1494
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,200
the roads versus street lights the

1495
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,800
weather outside i can take a look at

1496
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:11,118
that environment and say this is my

1497
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,960
weight this is weigh-ins and

1498
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,960
instantaneously in my head there's a

1499
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,920
plan to make weight and you have a sense

1500
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,400
of how much sweat adds up to

1501
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:23,920
to 10 pounds how much sweat plus time

1502
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,920
yeah just and i make sure in my plan

1503
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,559
all of my meals and how much water i

1504
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,000
need in between is allocated to still

1505
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,680
make weight because you have to eat or

1506
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,880
drink during that time

1507
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,558
are you incorporating like mental

1508
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,079
exhaustion into this

1509
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,839
that doesn't exist

1510
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,079
it doesn't no it doesn't do you like

1511
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,679
meditators like what did the thoughts

1512
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,760
come especially three days we're not

1513
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,279
talking about four hours of suffering

1514
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,960
i'll tell you this has broken some of

1515
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,519
the toughest people in the world the

1516
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,039
hardest weight cut i ever had yeah

1517
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:57,599
hardest one

1518
00:53:53,039 --> 00:54:01,358
um i fought pan am games in 2015 in

1519
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,880
edmonton canada on a wednesday

1520
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:06,480
and i won

1521
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,240
so i i've made weight on tuesday

1522
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,838
i fought on wednesday where i had to

1523
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:11,759
weigh in five percent of my weight class

1524
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:14,558
so 84 kilos

1525
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,319
on wednesday i was 84 kilos i got on a

1526
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,200
plane

1527
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,880
on

1528
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:24,239
that wednesday night and landed

1529
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:27,599
friday morning in sochi

1530
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:31,199
okay so i've traveled now

1531
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:34,480
i got on the scale all my bags got lost

1532
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:36,078
everything so somehow i flew from

1533
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,440
there to here

1534
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:42,318
no bags and i threw all of my stuff

1535
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,960
in my bag i wore sandals

1536
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:46,400
one pair of pants and a t-shirt on the

1537
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,000
plane because i was like

1538
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,240
i'm just tired i just fought like i

1539
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,679
don't even want to carry it i don't care

1540
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:55,919
what are the odds that i get there my

1541
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:58,318
bags are gone yeah very low very low

1542
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,720
sure enough it's gone i get all the way

1543
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:02,639
to sochi i check into the hotel there's

1544
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:05,439
one sauna

1545
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:06,879
guess what you have to reserve it

1546
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,880
and you're only allowed to reserve it

1547
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,160
for an x period of time guess get a

1548
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,798
small tangent

1549
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:15,039
when you found out your bags are gone

1550
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:16,798
this is something i'll often think about

1551
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:18,798
there's like people that are helping you

1552
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:21,679
right like that there's a person airport

1553
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:23,838
who goes yep oops just like that and

1554
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,679
then the person at the hotel who tells

1555
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:27,199
you that you have to reserve the sauna

1556
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,239
and looks at you like

1557
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,960
you're

1558
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:30,159
yep

1559
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,920
they don't care that you've been

1560
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:33,279
suffering they don't know

1561
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,400
they don't even understand why you need

1562
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,720
it yeah like why oh you know oh this

1563
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,480
like uh like this little kid reserved it

1564
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,480
for five hours or something to block it

1565
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,639
off or so i'm sorry

1566
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,880
um is there a frustration that gets in

1567
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,879
there are you you just accept reality

1568
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,480
don't don't even hinder on like the

1569
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,160
things you can't change

1570
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,760
because the second you get frustrated

1571
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:56,239
the second

1572
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,040
you think you can change it you'll hope

1573
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:00,479
on it and that breaks most men yeah

1574
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:03,679
that like little thing in the back of

1575
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,039
their mind thinking oh like what if

1576
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:06,960
there's no what if like there's only

1577
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:08,400
right here right now yeah if it doesn't

1578
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,480
work it doesn't work let's just quickly

1579
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,400
come up with the solution to fix the

1580
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,039
problem by the way as another small

1581
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:18,160
tangent all the greatest people i've

1582
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:20,798
interacted with at the highest level

1583
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:23,039
think like that they don't linger on the

1584
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:25,358
no it's like the next thing yeah because

1585
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,759
like if you want to do something great

1586
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:29,679
heart stuff is gonna keep happening to

1587
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,520
you and if you're gonna let that affect

1588
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,039
you you're not ever going to do the

1589
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:34,798
great thing yeah it's fascinating

1590
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:35,920
actually like that's the one skill you

1591
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,318
have to learn

1592
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,720
um elon musk is great at this constantly

1593
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:42,960
dealing with emergencies okay okay this

1594
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,879
happened what's the next step yep

1595
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,880
except it's not that big of a deal every

1596
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,680
problem has a solution yeah

1597
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,119
yeah

1598
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:50,480
and if i can't solve it it's not my

1599
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,318
problem

1600
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,519
you want me to do it yeah exactly so

1601
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:55,119
what uh so

1602
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:57,358
you figured it out

1603
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,720
get this i get to the hotel

1604
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:00,719
i check in

1605
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,679
i don't even know about the sauna yet i

1606
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:03,358
go

1607
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,118
i need to find a clothing store i'm in

1608
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:07,199

1609
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,039
i open up google maps and i'm like

1610
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,759

1612
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,079
middle of sochi russia right

no plastics no nothing

1615
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:24,000
and no running shoes because they don't

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,079
of layers preferably

1621
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,599

1623
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,200

00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:48,639
well it's cold i have no ghee

1656
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:51,598
and i'm working out with a female i

1657
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:53,358
can't get like overly physical to like

1658
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,440
really get my muscles going to really

1659
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:56,960
break that sweat because she has to

1660
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,679
compete in a dare to do this she's not a

1661
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,720
training partner you can't just use this

1662
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:04,159
person

1663
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:05,919
i stepped on the scale i was 91 kilos so

1664
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:08,000
i went well i was a nice dent but like

1665
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,519
workout yeah i go that's that's not

1666
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,318
going to fly

1667
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:12,798
so

1668
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:14,798
sure enough the clothes are now ruined

1669
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:15,838
they didn't help me lose any extra

1670
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:17,679
weight

1671
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:19,519
so i go back to the hotel and i start

1672
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,879
reserving the sauna

1673
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:24,000
do you know how hard it is to lose that

1674
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,000
much weight in a sauna by yourself

1675
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,239
so it's hard on many levels but one of

1676
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,559
them is just mental yeah

1677
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,798
you're sitting in heat heat and you're

1678
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,040
not doing anything like if there had

1679
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:37,119
been a bike or like the sauna was big

1680
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,679
enough to use a jump rope or

1681
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:42,559
you could do some sort of activity

1682
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:44,159
but you just sit and you stew

1683
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,880
and you're there mentally

1684
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:49,279
at one point during the weight cut i

1685
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,280
actually had my mouth on the bottom part

1686
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,400
of the door where there was a little gap

1687
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,760
and my legs up on the benches and kalita

1688
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,280
holding the door

1689
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,040
so that it didn't open so i couldn't

1690
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,119
open it so that i could lean against

1691
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:04,639
that thing and have fresh air

1692
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:06,480
because i was like i was struggling

1693
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:08,719
and we're talking about i mean how many

1694
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,318
hours is that hours and then the thing

1695
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:12,879
is is because you have to reserve the

1696
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:14,318
sauna i can't even take like a 30 minute

1697
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,920
break because the sauna's not going to

1698
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:17,920
be mine in an hour

1699
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,039
which means you have to use the sauna

1700
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,039
and the heat

1701
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:24,159
for that a lot of time period

1702
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:26,880
and i hate saunas yeah that is always my

1703
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:30,078
last resort i would use a bath i will

1704
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,200
train i will run i will jump rope sauna

1705
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,119
is like

1706
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,439
oh let me do that for 10 minutes after

1707
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,960
all of my gym workouts just to keep the

1708
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,599
sweat going while i stretch and cool

1709
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,679
down that's never like the hey i'm gonna

1710
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:44,160
do five ten minute sessions because i

1711
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:46,798
need to lose two kilos that is never the

1712
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,798
plan yeah

1713
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:50,318
but i mean uh

1714
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,079
so i've done plenty of sauna for weight

1715
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:53,599
cuts to know

1716
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,720
i can't even imagine what you went

1717
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,640
through yeah the seconds slow down

1718
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:02,000
that's one way to achieve immortality is

1719
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:02,879
like the time slows down to like a stop

1720
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,400
and

1721
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,838
you're left alone with your thoughts you

1722
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,920
can't do anything just like you said you

1723
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:11,039
can't there's nothing worse than sitting

1724
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,519
in that kind of heat for 10 15 minutes

1725
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:15,039
yeah and then you walk out and you're

1726
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:17,119
not even sweating

1727
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,639
yeah there's nothing worse than that and

1728
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,079
if you like it maybe if you weigh

1729
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:21,199
yourself which you should probably

1730
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:24,880
shouldn't be doing because it'll break

1731
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:26,639
you yep you haven't lost anything yep

1732
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,519
and i was weighing myself every time

1733
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:29,440
because

1734
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:32,798
i only get breaks when i was hitting

1735
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:35,039
weight allotments so if i could lose .3

1736
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:37,440
in 10 minutes i'd give myself a break

1737
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,798
but i had to hit certain numbers

1738
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,720
because i only have the sauna for a

1739
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:42,960
certain amount of time and i remember

1740
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,118
one time i went downstairs to get my key

1741
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,599
to the sauna and the japanese team had

1742
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,880
reserved it and took it from me

1743
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:50,240
because the guy didn't put my name on

1744
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,400
the list when i called down to get the

1745
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:54,479
sauna so i lost an entire session that i

1746
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,079
had to get made up towards the later

1747
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,760
part of the day because i still have no

1748
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,440
running shoes

1749
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,440
and then sure enough

1750
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,920
my bags show up 30 minutes after

1751
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,798
williams

1752
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,880
great

1753
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:10,559
that's like uh the universe just kind of

1754
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:12,160
giving you a little wink there yeah

1755
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,960
i think like

1756
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:17,118
because so few people do this weight cut

1757
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,199
at this high of a level people don't

1758
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,200
often realize because people get a sense

1759
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:22,480
of how hard it is to run 200 miles in

1760
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:24,719
the desert

1761
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,639
like they get because they go outside

1762
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:29,279
here in texas you can run five miles oh

1763
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:30,318
it's hard but like the weight cut is

1764
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,359
really

1765
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:34,880
i can you so you just uh like how did

1766
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:38,239
you do it

1767
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,480
just [ __ ] not refusing to you have to

1768
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:42,479
make weight you have to make way and you

1769
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:46,880
just that's

1770
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,880
i am astounded when i hear like

1771
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:51,200
ufc plighters like

1772
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,480
miss weight

1773
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:54,719
right like

1774
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,079
when jaden cox missed weight at the

1775
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:00,159
olympic trials i was like

1776
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:03,359
at least his was understandable because

1777
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:05,598
he missed the actual weigh-ins he didn't

1778
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:08,719
he wasn't like not on weight

1779
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:10,400
but when ufc fighters like miss wait i'm

1780
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:12,318
like

1781
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:16,400
how did that happen

1782
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:18,239
you clearly like gave up a long time ago

1783
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,760
there were times where i was like

1784
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:21,598
well i can't do this

1785
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,839
there have been times where i've been

1786
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,000
in a s in a sauna suit

1787
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:27,838
wrestling with a training partner who's

1788
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,960
probably 60 kilos who fought earlier

1789
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:31,119
that day

1790
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,798
to lose point three

1791
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,960
to lose point three

1792
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:36,639
like are you considering your mortality

1793
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,280
in this moment like

1794
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:41,358
aren't you thinking you're gonna die

1795
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,440
because like it's severe dehydration you

1796
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:45,759
could damage your body

1797
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,280
i do are you thinking about any of this

1798
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,280
or no is it just

1799
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,118
ah man

1800
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,358
okay yes

1801
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,519
i'm on the other level too where like

1802
01:03:55,358 --> 01:04:00,078
i've been in belgium right belgium there

1803
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,480
used to be a b level tournament and the

1804
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,400
tournament used to go on and because i

1805
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,760
was always on the heavier side like 81

1806
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,599
fights on the second day which is the

1807
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,000
heavyweight day

1808
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,760
um weigh-ins were always at like let's

1809
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,159
say 2pm the day before for that

1810
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,400
tournament well there was a sauna at the

1811
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:18,960
tournament i remember like being in the

1812
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:22,480
sauna and like oh

1813
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,480
i'm 80.9 kilos

1814
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:27,838
weigh-ins aren't for three hours

1815
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:27,838
[ __ ] it i'm gonna have lunch

1816
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:34,640
because i i mentally understand that

1817
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:37,440
what i eat right now is gonna fuel me

1818
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:39,679
for tomorrow so i don't want to skip it

1819
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,599
i have the time to put it into my system

1820
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,038
and still lose it right

1821
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,880
it's almost like a computer program

1822
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,599
you're running through the process you

1823
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:50,240
haven't i i get it but like that all

1824
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,400
relies on your ability to be um

1825
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:54,078
to get it back off yeah i mean but also

1826
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,519
just like go through this process which

1827
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,119
is painful it's like those monks who

1828
01:04:55,519 --> 01:05:00,239
meditate while sitting in a fire kind of

1829
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:02,400
thing or something right like it that

1830
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:04,399
uh yeah it's a it's really interesting

1831
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,480
is there other people

1832
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,838
that are critical to this or is this all

1833
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:12,400
internal to you are there people that

1834
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:15,038
everybody has their own

1835
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,200
way of doing it um some people don't cut

1836
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,920
that much some people can't wait cut it

1837
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:20,399
all

1838
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:23,838
right they would rather have been like

1839
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:28,079
83 kilos fighting 90 then

1840
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:28,078
you know be 83 kilos fighting 81.

1841
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:33,679
so why did you never move up to 90

1842
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,519
what's your sense

1843
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,199
is it from your deep understanding of

1844
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:39,599
your own judo and like the judo

1845
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:42,159
opponents you would face at 90

1846
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:44,079
and 81 because 81 is probably the

1847
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:46,000
hardest if not the second hardest

1848
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:48,240
division in the history of judo compared

1849
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,440
to 73 and

1850
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:53,118
81. you know when i was a kid like

1851
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,798
i always wanted to be like the

1852
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:57,119
middleweight olympic champion like the

1853
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:59,038
81 kilo olympic champion

1854
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,720
when i was in high school

1855
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,359
i made a decision when i was trying to

1856
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:05,919
make weight for 73 i was like

1857
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:07,279
this is i was cutting weight for 73 like

1858
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,639
i was cutting weight at the end of my

1859
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:10,559
career

1860
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:11,440
right and i was like i'm just gonna bag

1861
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,119
it

1862
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,798
i'm gonna accept the fact that i may not

1863
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,358
make a junior world team i may not make

1864
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:19,199
this team but i'll grow into the

1865
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,440
division so when i'm a senior player

1866
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:23,598
like i'm ready to go and i'll naturally

1867
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,679
be stronger there's an understanding of

1868
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,200
like a growth process when you move up a

1869
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:30,078
weight class

1870
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,679
most people can't just

1871
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,760
oh i'm going to fight 90s and i'm going

1872
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:36,078
to win because i wanted 81.

1873
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,240
the style of judo is different how you

1874
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,760
move is different how they do things is

1875
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:41,919
different there's like a learning curve

1876
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,720
that goes into it

1877
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:47,358
and because the weight cut didn't really

1878
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:49,358
happen until i was getting ready for rio

1879
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:50,880
i wasn't about to have my last olympic

1880
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:52,480
games be at a different weight class

1881
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,680
that i may or may not be able to grow

1882
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,760
into

1883
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,838
i mean this is an awesome story of you

1884
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,760
kind of decided

1885
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,119
that this will be your life's work in

1886
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,599
terms of judo

1887
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,119
competitor is like the 81 division i'm

1888
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,240
going to i mean i don't know if you saw

1889
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,519
it that way but you're talking about

1890
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:10,719
three olympics and it's like this

1891
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:14,079
story of

1892
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:17,199
i would say tragedy and triumph of just

1893
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:19,920
wars and 81 kilograms with with the

1894
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:22,000
usual cast of characters of the you know

1895
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,559
top five in the world kind of thing so

1896
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,639
you just became a scholar of that let

1897
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,119
your body grow into it and then let your

1898
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:31,519
body outgrow it and still suffer through

1899
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,280
it to keep it in the 81 kilograms

1900
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:35,920
you never competed at like at the

1901
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,960
highest levels at 90. i entered one

1902
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,559
tournament at 90 kilos um and that was

1903
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,159
because

1904
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,280
before

1905
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:46,879
rio

1906
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,880
from 20 from the end of 2014

1907
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,119
all the way up until rios every time i

1908
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,640
fought i got hurt

1909
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,400
every time

1910
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:55,920
there was no time where i made weight

1911
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,200
and got injured because my body weight

1912
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:01,200
was so high my body fat was so low

1913
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:02,480
that by the time i dehydrated enough to

1914
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:04,399
get down there

1915
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,000
and you take the physicality of judo and

1916
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,920
throw that into the mix

1917
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,199
something broke everything

1918
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:14,960
it was like nature of the beast

1919
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:16,960
so the plan was before

1920
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:19,439
rio

1921
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,759
we made an agreement with usa judo that

1922
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:23,198
travis you're going to fight 90 kilos

1923
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,679
but you're not going to weigh in at 90

1924
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:28,238
kilos like hey there's no like you get

1925
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:30,399
to be 94 kilos and cut to 90s there's

1926
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:32,718
like a you're going to step on the scale

1927
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:35,119
at 84 kilos like a little bit of a

1928
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:36,719
weight cut but not a full one just so

1929
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:39,838
that you feel like you get into like the

1930
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:42,640
tournament because when i

1931
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:45,119
around 2012 when i was talking with the

1932
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,719
usoc nutritionist i actually got my

1933
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:48,158
weight down so much that i didn't really

1934
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,759
need to cut weight

1935
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:52,000
the problem is i wasn't cutting weight i

1936
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,198
didn't feel like i was competing got it

1937
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,960
right there you have to go through like

1938
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:56,719
that mental process

1939
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,239
and i never really reworked that it was

1940
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,719
easier to just cut the weight and be

1941
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:02,479
ready to go

1942
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,239
but when i entered into the 90 kilo

1943
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:06,318
division i was rushed to the hospital

1944
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:07,759
the night after because my body broke

1945
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:10,719
out in hives

1946
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:13,359
like full body my dad they said it was

1947
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:15,520
stress induced

1948
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,239
fascinating so a month before the games

1949
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,799
i was hospitalized and hungry

1950
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:23,919
and filled with steroids to get the

1951
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:25,838
hives to drop and every couple days

1952
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,920
my body when i got back home i would end

1953
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:29,439
up in the hospital because my whole body

1954
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,359
would break out again i wonder if it's

1955
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:34,318
like deviating from the process that you

1956
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:36,798
so like perfectly crafted already or it

1957
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,400
was stressed from my mind thinking like

1958
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:40,479
even though it's not

1959
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,079
top of mind there's probably a portion

1960
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,959
of me that like the olympics is coming

1961
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:48,000
around and it could be my last

1962
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,679
that like my body just reacted to

1963
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,920
something chemically so i was breaking

1964
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,399
out in hives i actually bought like a

1965
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,640
600u euro

1966
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:58,960
hugo boss suit because when i was in the

1967
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,039
netherlands training at the time

1968
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,640
i thought i had bed bugs because i was

1969
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:03,920
getting bit everywhere

1970
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,600
then i thought there was something in

1971
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,359
the detergent at the local thing so i

1972
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,360
threw away all my clothes

1973
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,880
like i was paying for showers because i

1974
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:12,719
was trying to get the detergent off my

1975
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,880
body and buying new clothes at the

1976
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:16,560
airport

1977
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,560
trying to figure it out trying to figure

1978
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,640
it out just go yeah accepting the

1979
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,719
situation i mean but the level of stress

1980
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,480
is exceptionally high here can we talk

1981
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,560
about the other side

1982
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:28,000
people are going to love this

1983
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,640
but you're

1984
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,479
um you have a long history of

1985
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,400
persevering through

1986
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:37,198
injuries

1987
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:39,039
through insane amounts of injuries

1988
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:42,158
uh my ability to tolerate pain is

1989
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:44,640
probably more than most people

1990
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:47,679
but see injuries aren't just pain right

1991
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:50,560
it's like um it's also mental like

1992
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:54,319
psychological like again like the weight

1993
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,199
cut it can make a lot of people quit yep

1994
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:56,840
can you

1995
01:10:55,198 --> 01:10:59,519
tell your history of

1996
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:02,719
injuries what are the biggest injuries

1997
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,920
the toughest injuries in your career um

1998
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:07,359
starting from

1999
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,840
what your early teens my early teens um

2000
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:14,799
i actually got out of sports

2001
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:16,239
from 11 to i say like 15 years old 16

2002
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,840
years old because

2003
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:19,919
a kid shot a double leg through my

2004
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,000
kneecap and i partially tore all the

2005
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,440
ligaments in my knee cartilage meniscus

2006
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,359
the whole nine yards

2007
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:29,359
and i had to learn how to walk again i

2008
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:31,920
spent two years in a leg brace crutches

2009
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:33,599
you know hobbling around the schoolyard

2010
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,920
that one was a challenge to come back

2011
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,920
from

2012
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,039
i've broken

2013
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:41,839
most of my ribs

2014
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:43,679
i won nationals with nine broken ribs

2015
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,840
i was actually getting

2016
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,279
novocaine shots into my chest to avoid

2017
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,679
feeling the pain

2018
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:52,880
and then wrapping them to try to

2019
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,880
make sure i didn't pop along

2020
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:58,158
i've broken my collarbone um i have five

2021
01:11:56,319 --> 01:12:00,559
herniated discs in my neck

2022
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:03,279
i fractured my back twice

2023
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,560
i've broken my tailbone i tore my si

2024
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:06,639
joints

2025
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,400
i've torn my right hamstring twice my

2026
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,800
left one once

2027
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:11,898
um

2028
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,899
[Music]

2029
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:18,000
broken my ankles a few times i spun it

2030
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:20,718
once in a 360 that had death surgery

2031
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,840
fingers toes elbows shoulders

2032
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:25,840
so all of these are first of all

2033
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,360
you're um

2034
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,400
you're tough

2035
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:32,158
you're tough dude man

2036
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:33,599
so each of those have a story behind

2037
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:34,839
them

2038
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,239
so if you're talking about the

2039
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:41,119
collarbone or the ankles

2040
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:43,599
uh or or the back the neck

2041
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:45,439
is there interesting stories here that

2042
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,120
behind these injuries heart training

2043
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:49,439
heart competing

2044
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:51,840
jiu-jitsu judo

2045
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:55,198
on so ground stuff like

2046
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,440
uh sparring in the dojo or like drilling

2047
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:59,039
or all that kind of stuff

2048
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:00,960
if you were to sort of break it down

2049
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:02,960
your understanding of this the landscape

2050
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:06,319
of injuries you went through

2051
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,679
i've never had one in jiu jitsu

2052
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:09,039
ever

2053
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:11,199
i mean i might have like torn a

2054
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:13,359
fingernail or like

2055
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:15,119
you know gotten g burned but i've never

2056
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:18,158
been like

2057
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:21,840
seriously injured i know when ponza

2058
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,799
straight ankle locked me at copapodio

2059
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,039
that

2060
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,079
hurt but i wasn't injured like it felt

2061
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:27,840
sore

2062
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:28,640
but like if i had to run like i could

2063
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,960
run

2064
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,880
i can now understand probably exactly

2065
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,640
what the injuries came from then

2066
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,239
you're very quickly excelled at jiu

2067
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,880
jitsu

2068
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:40,718
you have achieved another level in judo

2069
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,800
and i think that means

2070
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:44,079
the intensity with which you approach

2071
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,880
judo

2072
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:49,279
to achieve that world-class level

2073
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:50,960
probably is the source of the injuries

2074
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:54,399
yeah because

2075
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:56,960
the mentality of how i

2076
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:58,839
approach judo versus jiu-jitsu

2077
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:02,960
jiu-jitsu to me is

2078
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,560
like a game that like we would play like

2079
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,439
if you wanted to like grab a basketball

2080
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,600
and like go play a game of one-on-one

2081
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:10,879
that's like jiu jitsu to me like i can't

2082
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,520
take

2083
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,199
the sport in its entirety seriously

2084
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,000
because i feel like the community of jiu

2085
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:19,599
jitsu doesn't take it seriously so just

2086
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,359
for people who don't know just to set

2087
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,000
some context

2088
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:27,279
you're you're a black belt in jiu jitsu

2089
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,000
but more importantly you've beaten a lot

2090
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:32,000
of world-class jiu-jitsu people

2091
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,600
you've done very well at the highest

2092
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,920
levels of competition yeah i wouldn't

2093
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,199
necessarily say i've beaten them as much

2094
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,039
as

2095
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:40,319
i've trained with them

2096
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:43,679
and

2097
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:45,439
they understand whoever it is that

2098
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,560
through training with me

2099
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:51,599
that like i'm not just a judo guy

2100
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,800
like i know how to do jiu jitsu

2101
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,039
right and

2102
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:59,119
if any one of them were to come to me

2103
01:14:55,039 --> 01:15:01,279
and like say hey you know

2104
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:04,399
i want to feel what it feels like to do

2105
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:04,399
judo with me

2106
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:10,560
they would quickly understand that like

2107
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:12,079
the way i approach one is very different

2108
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,400
than the way i approach the other like

2109
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:16,479
we probably wouldn't be friends if they

2110
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:19,039
did judo with me versus if they did jiu

2111
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:20,959
jitsu with me i'm curious asking for a

2112
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:22,800
friend because mostly because i'll do a

2113
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,399
little judo with you today

2114
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,079
so you clearly because you're a great

2115
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:28,399
instructor and teacher you have a mode

2116
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,880
where you can demonstrate a technique

2117
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:32,238
do you know how to like spar where

2118
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,800
you're going like

2119
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:36,959
50 percent

2120
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,000
it's hard to put like a percentage to it

2121
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:42,480
because i've never in all of my jiu

2122
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,319
jitsu ever gone 100

2123
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:47,439
in jiu jitsu yeah like i had a

2124
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:49,840
conversation with salo one time

2125
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:52,479
where we were talking about like

2126
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,239
jiu jitsu and training and i was like

2127
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:55,359
well if i got his arm i would just break

2128
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:58,000
it

2129
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:58,000
and he was like

2130
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,880
but what if he tapped i go that's not my

2131
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,320
responsibility

2132
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,079
if he taps and the ref doesn't say

2133
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:08,399
anything you just break it you just keep

2134
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:10,158
going yeah he goes but the tap means

2135
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:12,238
it's over and i said no the ref tells me

2136
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:14,238
when it's over i go

2137
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:15,599
i never give you the opportunity to tap

2138
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:17,599
because if you have the opportunity to

2139
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,159
tap that means you had the opportunity

2140
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,159
to think about how to get out make a

2141
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:25,279
decision that you can't

2142
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:27,839
then tap i clearly operated too slowly

2143
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:29,359
yeah so there's a it's either broken or

2144
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,719
i don't have it

2145
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:33,679
you're an external

2146
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:35,439
person to go against in judo like the on

2147
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:37,039
the grounds like everything you did

2148
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:39,198
that's that's amazing

2149
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:41,760
um that's really amazing that's what

2150
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:43,279
made you a really fun person to watch

2151
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,880
because you really went to war with

2152
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:47,039
these people yeah

2153
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,440
so you know what it's like to go 100 in

2154
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:51,198
judo i do because i know

2155
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:53,198
what it's like to

2156
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:54,079
train with somebody under the mentality

2157
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:56,399
of

2158
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,399
i'm going to do everything i want to do

2159
01:16:56,399 --> 01:17:01,599
you're going to do nothing you want to

2160
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:03,839
do and you're going to accept that

2161
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:07,199
do you ever train in judo where where

2162
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,400
you let people get stuff of course

2163
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:10,719
all the time

2164
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,238
now or like always

2165
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,399
even when you're sort of building up the

2166
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:16,158
four years building up to the olympics

2167
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:17,920
like they're smaller guys that are

2168
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:21,599
throwing you in the gym and that kind of

2169
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,600
stuff no i never said that okay

2170
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:26,079
that never came out of my mouth

2171
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:28,238
i said i let people do stuff i never

2172
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:29,840
said smaller people throw me oh you mean

2173
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:31,439
you let him get a grip but then you'll

2174
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,520
position yourself in such a way that

2175
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:36,238
it's it's hopeless it's like

2176
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:39,199
the number one skill set that

2177
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:44,039
judo is going to teach you is

2178
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:44,039
the ability to give people false hope

2179
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:47,600
because i can really looking forward to

2180
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:50,719
the video we're gonna shoot

2181
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,079
like i can let you take a grip yeah i

2182
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,520
can let you think that there's

2183
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:56,079
opportunity but what you don't

2184
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,199
understand is by the position and angela

2185
01:17:56,079 --> 01:18:00,079
that i'm in

2186
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:02,079
it's actually false hope yeah like

2187
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:04,319
as long as you don't know that it is

2188
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:07,600
then now i'm free to operate and do what

2189
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:10,479
i want see i competed in judo against uh

2190
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:13,039
black belts where i would go in

2191
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:15,198
and it looks like it should be able to

2192
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:17,760
throw them and then you just hit a wall

2193
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:19,839
and then i also saw you destroy those

2194
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,480
black belts yeah so there's levels to

2195
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,760
this yeah it's the the cliche thing

2196
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:24,879
there's black belts and there's black

2197
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,800
belts

2198
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,319
you're unique in this there may be a

2199
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:30,079
couple other

2200
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:32,639
jidoka in america but you're really like

2201
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:35,600
unique i then get to see people

2202
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:38,320
that really i felt like

2203
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,840
were 10x better than me it just feels

2204
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:41,759
like that sometimes i've learned that

2205
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,039
madness that would be true

2206
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,880
might only be

2207
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:46,560
just a little better but i saw you

2208
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:49,119
destroy them

2209
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:52,640
and it was like holy [ __ ]

2210
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:55,279
there's a thing in judo right where

2211
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,480
you know imagine like you as like just

2212
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:57,599
an adult

2213
01:18:56,479 --> 01:18:59,359
right

2214
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,719
um

2215
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:02,319
and i i hope people can like

2216
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,399
conceptualize this when they hear this

2217
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:05,679
but imagine like you're a full-grown

2218
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:07,439
adult even

2219
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:09,920
male female doesn't matter but there's a

2220
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:11,759
little kid in front of you like call him

2221
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,640
five or six years old and he's acting

2222
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,800
out

2223
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,880
like do you think you have the physical

2224
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,159
capability of with one hand grabbing

2225
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,719
that person

2226
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:21,679
or that kid and making sure that they

2227
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,439
freeze

2228
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:26,319
like they feel like they're nervous and

2229
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:28,399
like they can't do anything right

2230
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:29,920
when you fight a good judo player when

2231
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:32,079
they grab you

2232
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,199
that's what it feels like as an adult

2233
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:35,039
yeah

2234
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:36,719
when people even i've felt that from

2235
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,560
like certain players in japan like when

2236
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,880
they get a grip i'm like

2237
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:43,120
i've now lost the function of this one

2238
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,079
yeah that's a really good way to put it

2239
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:45,679
i think

2240
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,359
i could potentially beat some of the

2241
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,560
people i've

2242
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:51,119
went against

2243
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:52,560
but certain grips they took it made me

2244
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:54,960
feel

2245
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:57,280
powerless yep i was like i didn't know

2246
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,880
this was possible that kind of power was

2247
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,399
possible and you don't even know where

2248
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,560
it originates from yeah because you're

2249
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:04,960
like how does one person's hand do this

2250
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,719
where i can't use my whole arm yeah or

2251
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,158
like i can't pick up my right foot

2252
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,880
because he's holding on to my right

2253
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:13,519
sleeve yeah it was kind of um

2254
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,039
on a basic animalistic sense kind of

2255
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,320
terrifying

2256
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:20,319
it's uh i mean you don't want to

2257
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:22,158
part of this is like ego

2258
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:26,238
but you realize that there's a food

2259
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:26,238
chain and you're not at the top of it

2260
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:30,158
that's part of the humbling process i

2261
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:32,399
think of martial arts it's like

2262
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:35,279
i think everybody

2263
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:36,638
um like a lot of people

2264
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:39,198
think they're much higher in the food

2265
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:40,639
chain than they really are and then when

2266
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:42,879
you realize this is why it's a really

2267
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:45,119
healthy process for people they're not

2268
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,400
even competing in the olympics to

2269
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:48,880
practice martial arts because you

2270
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,799
realize okay that like putting yourself

2271
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,719
more accurately in the food chain is

2272
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,400
really good

2273
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:56,639
way to sort of place yourself in the

2274
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:59,439
rest of the world it humbles you to the

2275
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:00,800
reality the harshness of the world yep

2276
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:02,479
it's kind of like when people look at

2277
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,800
like survival in the wilderness it's

2278
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:07,439
like oh it's not that hard

2279
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:09,440
no you'd probably die in a couple days

2280
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:10,719
same thing with like judo and martial

2281
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,960
arts like

2282
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:15,198
yeah it's really not that hard

2283
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,880
but you don't know what to do yet

2284
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:18,799
and so when you find out that first time

2285
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,119
that you don't know what to do

2286
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,560
it's devastating to a lot of people but

2287
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:23,359
those that like stick through it and

2288
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,639
like

2289
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:28,639
start to learn it's a very powerful

2290
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:30,960
like feeling that now like you can take

2291
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,119
care of yourself

2292
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,560
and i think i want to talk to you a few

2293
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:36,479
times before

2294
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,719
you talked about that there's like like

2295
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:40,479
the top three the top five in the world

2296
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:42,399
i don't know where you put them but

2297
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,839
they're they're another

2298
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:44,879
like level

2299
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,719
here yeah

2300
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:49,600
and the fact that you're i mean it's

2301
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:52,239
it's so exciting to me

2302
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,920
uh probably because i just felt all the

2303
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:57,279
levels here

2304
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,039
and i have seen you and others at that

2305
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:02,000
height destroy

2306
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:03,679
those i've i have seen the exponential

2307
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,479
levels to this game

2308
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:08,239
it's incredible that you're

2309
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:10,238
didn't quit

2310
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:13,359
didn't doubt yourself and just

2311
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:15,678
persevered through three olympics

2312
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:18,158
to get to that highest always fighting

2313
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:19,199
at that like very highest of levels but

2314
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:21,759
just like

2315
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:24,719
you know from the top 10 to the top five

2316
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,880
like really breaking in through that

2317
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,639
i don't know um

2318
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,359
what would you say it took to get to

2319
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:33,119
that highest of levels like if you when

2320
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:36,079
you look back to all the weight cuts to

2321
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:38,559
just the insane amount of injuries

2322
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:41,760
believe it or not i didn't really think

2323
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,760
i was there until

2324
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:45,679
2013 i thought i was recognized as one

2325
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:47,198
of the best

2326
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,880
because i was able to fight for

2327
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:50,879
oppensburg which was the professional

2328
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:53,440
bundesliga team for germany which is one

2329
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:56,319
of the top clubs in all of europe

2330
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:59,198
um when they asked me to i felt like

2331
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:00,079
europe had like accepted me as like

2332
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:02,238
oh

2333
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:04,000
i'm a top level judo player

2334
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:06,959
but i don't necessarily think that when

2335
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,520
i signed on to compete for them that

2336
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,520
the division or the world of judo saw me

2337
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,199
as a top level judo player

2338
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,800
right there's

2339
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:17,279
there's a

2340
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,320
mental shift that happens along that

2341
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:20,399
point

2342
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:23,840
and for me

2343
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:26,638
my mental shift really came into play in

2344
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:29,760
december of 2015

2345
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:32,239
before rio that was like

2346
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,960
when i lost in japan that's when i

2347
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:37,198
realized like the world

2348
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,039
respects my abilities and they compete

2349
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,559
against them

2350
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:41,760
they don't compete against me as a

2351
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,320
person

2352
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:47,440
they compete against

2353
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:48,479
the idea or

2354
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:51,198
the

2355
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:53,279
the persona that i've been able to

2356
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:56,000
establish over the years of competing in

2357
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:57,679
the division wow so you're the

2358
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,359
they probably have a nickname for you

2359
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:02,079
you're the system

2360
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:03,359
of ideas and thought that they study but

2361
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:06,479
they're studying

2362
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:09,599
me as a conceptual whole

2363
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:09,599
not me as the human

2364
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,960
is your style relatively unique

2365
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:18,400
in the 81 kilogram division it was

2366
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:20,719
relatively unique for kayla i and jimmy

2367
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:24,000
up until 2016.

2368
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:25,359
now since 2016 you can see a lot of what

2369
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,600
we used to do

2370
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:28,799
throughout most of europe and even asia

2371
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,159
like you're starting to see some of

2372
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,119
those techniques that you didn't see

2373
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:33,920
before

2374
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:35,039
starting to get implemented

2375
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,719
because

2376
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:39,198
when i was

2377
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:41,279
when i was gearing up for 2015 i had

2378
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:44,559
such a slew of injuries

2379
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:46,639
that entire calendar year that i never

2380
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:49,360
should have made it to rio i should have

2381
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:50,560
called it quits at the end of 2015

2382
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:52,799
because

2383
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,400
i suffered that major concussion in

2384
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:58,800
february i stepped on a mat in may for

2385
01:24:56,399 --> 01:25:01,839
the first time i lost five straight

2386
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,600
tournaments i left the national team

2387
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,319
went to japan

2388
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:07,920
won pan am games got a bacterial

2389
01:25:06,319 --> 01:25:09,279
infection at the worlds almost had my

2390
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,079
leg cut off

2391
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:14,079
tore my si joint later on that year and

2392
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:16,079
then took fifth in japan

2393
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:18,158
and when you look at like the calendar

2394
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:20,319
year as a whole

2395
01:25:18,158 --> 01:25:22,638
like the world should have treated me

2396
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:24,000
like i was washed up like this guy

2397
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:27,520
hasn't been training he hasn't been

2398
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,039
doing anything but i took fifth in japan

2399
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,159
now how does a guy that hasn't trained

2400
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:31,439
all year

2401
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:33,279
take fifth at one of the hardest

2402
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:35,439
tournaments in the world on two weeks of

2403
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:37,279
training

2404
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:40,238
because they were fighting the guy i

2405
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:42,319
used to be

2406
01:25:40,238 --> 01:25:44,238
not the guy i was at the tournament

2407
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:45,920
which means they were competing under

2408
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:48,238
the idea of like

2409
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,920
what is he really capable of

2410
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:52,238
not what have i brought to the table

2411
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,239
today

2412
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,560
and that just gave you the confidence

2413
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,239
and that told me that like

2414
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,400
well if i can take fifth and i'm this

2415
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,158
bad at judo right now

2416
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:02,960
wait until i'm healthy and i'm back in

2417
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:04,000
shape

2418
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,719
then they're not gonna know what hit

2419
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,319
them

2420
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:08,399
one of the essential components of being

2421
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:09,359
the number one in the world or up in

2422
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:11,839
that

2423
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:14,719
place is that confidence the self-belief

2424
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,159
and the rest of the world believing it

2425
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,359
you can have all the confidence in the

2426
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:18,638
world but if the rest of the room

2427
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:19,920
doesn't buy it

2428
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,840
it's nothing

2429
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,079
that's funny it's like there's certain

2430
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,880
people right with tyson

2431
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:29,760
uh mike all understand he could not

2432
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:31,440
train and they're still scared yeah

2433
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,520
right like he doesn't have to work out

2434
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:35,198
that hard anymore there's several judo

2435
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,440
you know this way better but from a

2436
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:39,359
spectator perspective like iliociliatis

2437
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,119
is like that he's one of them

2438
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:43,119
it's like he

2439
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:45,760
he's portrayed over the years everyone's

2440
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:47,920
so scared of that guy

2441
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,960
it's interesting yep i people were

2442
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:53,920
scared of you too people just gave a

2443
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:56,319
certain level of respect to my skill set

2444
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,560
and whether i had a bad weight cut or

2445
01:26:56,319 --> 01:27:00,079
didn't have a bad weight cut or not

2446
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,320
trained for the last three months which

2447
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:05,840
never happened i'm just saying

2448
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:05,840
they were gonna fight the persona

2449
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,158
and it's an important distinction when

2450
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:12,158
you're looking at the top five because

2451
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:15,439
everybody coming up

2452
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:18,238
they're training against the persona

2453
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:19,678
not who you are even i did that at a

2454
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:21,519
younger age

2455
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:23,760
that's why i would always go to people's

2456
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,360
hometowns because like i don't i don't

2457
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,760
care about the persona i want to know

2458
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:29,198
what you do day in and day out

2459
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,520
when i couldn't beat a russian i told

2460
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:33,359
jimmy send me to russia i need to i need

2461
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,239
to understand and see it with my own

2462
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:36,479
eyes

2463
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:37,919
what they do outperform so that i can

2464
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:39,678
believe

2465
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:42,560
that i can beat them

2466
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:45,039
casca and this is a small tangent so

2467
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:47,360
uh dagestan has produced some incredible

2468
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:49,679
wrestlers i don't know what the story

2469
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:52,079
where judo is where

2470
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,639
the source of source of greatness in

2471
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:56,639
russia is for judo but what do you make

2472
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:59,119
of dagestan why

2473
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:02,800
what is it in the culture of their or

2474
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:05,198
russia broadly that produces greatness

2475
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,719
specifically in the combat sports

2476
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:08,559
i don't know yeah specifically in the

2477
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:09,520
combat sports sorry uh but i don't know

2478
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,280
if you want to draw a distinction

2479
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,639
between wrestling and judah i'm almost

2480
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:15,119
curious do you understand the

2481
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:17,199
differences there in the culture

2482
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:19,760
still a combat sport to them they're

2483
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:23,039
still in that same like

2484
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,000
realm of their taking young kids

2485
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:26,158
and

2486
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,439
that that's what they do

2487
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:33,359
so khabib speaks very highly of judo yep

2488
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:35,119
like it's funny khabib vladimir putin

2489
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:35,920
people don't get it but like judo is

2490
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:38,319
like

2491
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,158
one of the premier sports in the world

2492
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:42,319
but we just don't understand it it's not

2493
01:28:40,158 --> 01:28:44,799
just popularity so definitely popularity

2494
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:45,519
but also like this respect

2495
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,000
and

2496
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:49,600
there's a certain thing

2497
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,960
which is why i really value judo

2498
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,199
internationally you don't get this in

2499
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:55,279
the united states but internationally

2500
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:57,359
there's an understanding

2501
01:28:55,279 --> 01:28:59,840
like later in life when you're a

2502
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:01,759
scientist meeting a businessman

2503
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:04,880
when you both have done judo there's

2504
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:07,360
this like nod of respect yeah it's so

2505
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,800
interesting uh just very few sports like

2506
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:10,960
that you know basketball doesn't have

2507
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:13,600
any i don't know almost any sport like

2508
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,560
that and it's fascinating wrestling has

2509
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,000
that in the u.s yet it's the us only the

2510
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,239
rest of the world doesn't do that

2511
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,079
there's a few like you could see that in

2512
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:23,439
like iran or something like that yeah

2513
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:24,559
they'll respect wrestling in that kind

2514
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:27,678
of way

2515
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:30,639
yeah it's um but judo on like a global

2516
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:32,560
scale is probably that only one

2517
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:34,639
due to its like

2518
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,080
physicality and the hardships that you

2519
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:38,639
have to go through

2520
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:40,399
to reach that upper level so why do you

2521
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,400
think dagestan why do you think khabib

2522
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:44,960
is as good as he is is there is this

2523
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,879
just the raw genetics of the human or is

2524
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,399
there something about the system the

2525
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,880
system

2526
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:52,559
it all has to do with the system

2527
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,719
so they um

2528
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,800
they grow up around fighting in all

2529
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:58,960
forms yep

2530
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:01,360
um they're also i mean their technique

2531
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,359
is exceptionally good because they they

2532
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:06,880
grow up in it they grow up and they

2533
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:08,960
don't they don't understand

2534
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:11,039
anything else so you don't have to it's

2535
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,719
almost like you with the weight cutting

2536
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:15,198
it's not like a big dramatic thing for

2537
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:17,520
them to fight it's like it's just part

2538
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:19,678
of life yes and

2539
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,480
when you're i don't want to say bread

2540
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:23,520
into it but when you've done it

2541
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:26,158
for

2542
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:28,239
you know i want to say like 90 of your

2543
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:29,198
life by the time like khabib probably

2544
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:30,799
has

2545
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:33,039
right from the time he could crawl he's

2546
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,520
probably been grappling in some fashion

2547
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:36,639
thereof right

2548
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,920
um

2549
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:40,159
you know when you

2550
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,600
as grapplers like you can look at a

2551
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:43,439
wrestler

2552
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,480
and having never seen this person before

2553
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:45,919
and go

2554
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:47,039
you wrestled

2555
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,760
yeah

2556
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:52,399
why is that it's because he's probably

2557
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:54,800
wrestled since he was like six so the

2558
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:57,839
way he carries himself the way his body

2559
01:30:54,800 --> 01:31:00,480
is built the way he grew into it was

2560
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:02,960
framed around wrestling

2561
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:04,959
right so the people in that culture are

2562
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:06,560
framed around

2563
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,359
fighting and grappling you're right it's

2564
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,360
like

2565
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:11,039
first of all philosophically

2566
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:12,960
psychologically but also just like the

2567
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:15,119
way you move your body yes that means

2568
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,800
like when you're young the people you

2569
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:19,439
admire move their body in a certain

2570
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:21,920
certain way and then genetically

2571
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:23,599
it it just as they keep doing that

2572
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:26,399
they're just going to get better and

2573
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,760
better every generation yeah

2574
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:29,119
it's just going to keep improving

2575
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,280
because they just keep building into

2576
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:32,880
that system of turning them out

2577
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:34,238
and part of it there's like cultural

2578
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,920
stuff where

2579
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:37,599
i mean it's such an interesting approach

2580
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:40,079
to wrestling i really want to travel to

2581
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,840
dagestan and just talk to them because i

2582
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:42,639
happen to be able to speak russian

2583
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:46,719
because

2584
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:49,359
because there's uh less value for

2585
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:51,359
this kind of materialistic success

2586
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:54,799
that i think sometimes can get in the

2587
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:56,799
way of uh greatness it seems like it

2588
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,960
makes coaching more difficult it makes

2589
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,880
like following orders as an athlete more

2590
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,679
difficult i don't struggle with that in

2591
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,960
usa judo yeah because you want more

2592
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:07,359
money

2593
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:10,000
but then more money if not applied

2594
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:11,839
correctly can corrupt the system somehow

2595
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,760
can split people up it's just it's same

2596
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,000
thing with the prestige around certain

2597
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,880
metals over others because athletes

2598
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,479
start

2599
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,920
chasing

2600
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,000
fame

2601
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,359
instead of development

2602
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,840
yeah

2603
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:27,359
yeah that's i mean uh the satire

2604
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,480
brothers are famous for this like

2605
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:30,639
ignoring

2606
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:33,198
ignoring fame ignoring all of this like

2607
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:34,719
focus on the art itself not even not so

2608
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:36,799
it's not even the medals exactly like

2609
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:38,639
you're saying just the purity of like

2610
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,239
when you're in it yeah and let everybody

2611
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:42,159
else figure out their stupid medals and

2612
01:32:40,238 --> 01:32:44,638
money and all that because it comes it

2613
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:46,238
comes right exactly it's a result yeah

2614
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:48,800
exactly like it's not that you don't

2615
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:50,559
appreciate it but you know that it comes

2616
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:54,480
if you focus on the art there's a

2617
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:56,880
distinction when you're talking about

2618
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:58,559
your athletic career or really any

2619
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:01,199
endeavor right

2620
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:04,960
the problem with goal setting is nobody

2621
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:06,879
teaches the athletes or the people

2622
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,480
how to transition from the goal to

2623
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,319
reality

2624
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:12,399
right so

2625
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:15,198
when you look at my career as a whole

2626
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:17,119
like when i was getting ready for 2008 i

2627
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:19,439
actually forgot to train for it

2628
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:22,079
i was so happy at such a young age that

2629
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:24,319
i became an olympian that that in and of

2630
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:26,880
itself was a goal that i thought

2631
01:33:24,319 --> 01:33:27,679
had to be admired had to be celebrated

2632
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,880
that

2633
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:31,199
you know the games are right around the

2634
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,480
corner i i didn't really come down off

2635
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:35,198
that high

2636
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:37,039
you're you're the local optima of of uh

2637
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:39,519
just winning the trials

2638
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:41,279
yeah that was it's a big thing it's a

2639
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,840
huge thing but then you're just focusing

2640
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:46,719
on the accomplishment not the correct

2641
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:48,719
but at some point right when i

2642
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:51,359
when i went into london

2643
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:52,800
i actually went into london going with

2644
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:54,479
i'm gonna prove i'm the best in the

2645
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:57,279
world because i believe i'm the best in

2646
01:33:54,479 --> 01:34:01,519
the world and i believe it from like the

2647
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:03,198
bottom of my soul that i'm winning this

2648
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,280
and then you're almost like trying to

2649
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:07,439
tell the universe like i'm accomplishing

2650
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:10,719
this thing because it's a goal

2651
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:10,719
but when i went into rio

2652
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,679
i just accepted the fact that i was

2653
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:16,559
winning

2654
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:19,840
it's not a goal like this is happening

2655
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:22,400
you visualize it but i felt it you felt

2656
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,800
it right like this is no longer a goal

2657
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:24,799
anymore

2658
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:28,800
like

2659
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:31,039
i anticipating i i can see this coming

2660
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,800
down the path because

2661
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:34,800
i'm anticipating that the games is

2662
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,600
happening and i'm gonna win it's not a

2663
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,119
goal

2664
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,960
it's an anticipation and there's a

2665
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:41,279
distinct distinction there

2666
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:43,039
between the two

2667
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:45,279
okay so for people who are just watching

2668
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:46,960
the video of this there should be an

2669
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:48,719
overlay

2670
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,600
of uh

2671
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:54,880
young travis this is uh you still had to

2672
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:56,880
make 81. is this still a tough cut here

2673
01:34:54,880 --> 01:35:01,279
no this one was relatively easy this is

2674
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:03,520
going all the way back to 2008 so this

2675
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:06,800
is the summer before the games this

2676
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:08,800
probably happened in

2677
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,480
june i would say

2678
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,360
so this is the

2679
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:14,399
olympic trials so in the united states

2680
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:15,920
you have to

2681
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:18,319
i mean similar to like wrestling you

2682
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:20,239
have to win the trials to qualify for

2683
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:22,559
that particular division to represent

2684
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:25,678
the united states so this is you said

2685
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,760
june before an august olympics yep

2686
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,480
so here i just wanted to show this match

2687
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,119
because

2688
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:32,799
uh what was there there's another one i

2689
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:34,319
think you do a pin you do some there's

2690
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:37,279
groundwork in the other one

2691
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:37,279
but in this one

2692
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:40,480
fighting a teammate

2693
01:35:39,118 --> 01:35:42,079
finding a teammate for me former

2694
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:44,079
teammate oh there's an old school double

2695
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:46,000
leg i forgot about that and it's weird

2696
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:47,679
to see

2697
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,560
so you so there

2698
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:54,480
um the travis's opponent and he's travis

2699
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:57,119
is setting up here that sanagi

2700
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:59,198
posting his

2701
01:35:57,118 --> 01:36:01,198
left arm and getting it done that's a

2702
01:35:59,198 --> 01:36:03,439
big that's a big throw

2703
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:04,638
you have too many of those big throws on

2704
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:05,839
uh

2705
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:07,920
on video

2706
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:09,199
because like you often on video you're

2707
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,279
going against the best people in the

2708
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:12,079
world it's tough to get like that much

2709
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:14,399
air

2710
01:36:12,079 --> 01:36:16,319
and a lot of times the the ones that we

2711
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:18,399
do see and you know the part that a lot

2712
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:20,639
of people don't

2713
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:22,158
experience is

2714
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,679
a lot of those times right through

2715
01:36:22,158 --> 01:36:25,519
people with that throw

2716
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,279
it was in training camps

2717
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:29,040
so by the time i got to the competition

2718
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:31,359
with these guys

2719
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:34,238
they were playing a hundred percent

2720
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:36,000
defense to never let me do that yeah

2721
01:36:34,238 --> 01:36:38,319
so you do this

2722
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,719
um here are you kind of pulling him down

2723
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,399
no he's i'm trying to get him to come up

2724
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:44,000
to come up but are you pulling him down

2725
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:46,479
to get to fake him off i'm not doing

2726
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:49,039
anything with my left hand

2727
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:51,359
uh so here the the opponent's so what

2728
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:52,479
i'm doing right now is his head is like

2729
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:55,839
in my chest

2730
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:58,000
i'm pressing him to get his head to lift

2731
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:00,000
with my chest

2732
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,800
so i'm pressing his hand down so i can

2733
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,118
use my chest to like pinch my scaps and

2734
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,480
roll his head up so he wants to pick it

2735
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:07,759
up

2736
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:09,118
and

2737
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,400
and then he i mean doesn't he know

2738
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:12,479
what's coming here

2739
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:14,238
oh no he might not

2740
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:16,399
oh no he knew he was a former teammate

2741
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:19,039
he knew exactly what i was trying to do

2742
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:23,679
and that was a really big step with your

2743
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:26,238
right foot it covers uh about four feet

2744
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:28,960
so you use the distance

2745
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:30,158
and your left

2746
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,800
um

2747
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:35,839
catches up in like perfect position yeah

2748
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,840
you back it up a little bit

2749
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:38,880
keep going

2750
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,639
keep going

2751
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:43,199
right there that's this is like an

2752
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:45,118
important distinction between mine and

2753
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:48,960
everybody else's is

2754
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:52,719
because i split his hip um i actually

2755
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:55,439
once i'm able to split i no longer need

2756
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:57,118
his center of gravity below mine

2757
01:37:55,439 --> 01:37:59,439
right and when you say split you mean

2758
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:01,519
you put your foot in between

2759
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:03,678
why do that split that four foot split

2760
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,679
yes and then when i get my feet back

2761
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:08,880
together it doesn't matter that i'm

2762
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:11,520
under his center gravity or not yeah

2763
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,400
that's why my chest is right around his

2764
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,840
like

2765
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:15,118
sternum height

2766
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,360
for me

2767
01:38:15,118 --> 01:38:19,039
yeah so so the there i mean how does he

2768
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:21,519
get uh for people just listening to this

2769
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:23,760
travis steps is like that's a big

2770
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:25,840
huge step gets

2771
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,920
like my hip is probably right around his

2772
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:31,119
nipple because he's he's sprawled back

2773
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:33,039
so much yeah that's right so like so

2774
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:35,279
you're how does the physics of this work

2775
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:37,118
you're violating the principle of

2776
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:38,719
your center of mass being under oh i

2777
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:40,719
guess somehow it is

2778
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:44,000
i don't know but he has nowhere to go

2779
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:45,279
he's screwed yes that's the kicker is

2780
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,439
the way my

2781
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:49,359
mind works is

2782
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:50,799
in order for him to play an effective

2783
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:53,279
defense

2784
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:55,360
he needs to have his feet firmly planted

2785
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:58,079
on the ground with friction

2786
01:38:55,359 --> 01:39:00,399
yeah otherwise he can't press into me to

2787
01:38:58,079 --> 01:39:02,319
stop it so when i get him to sprawl back

2788
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:05,039
when i split his legs

2789
01:39:02,319 --> 01:39:06,479
he effectively loses that contact with

2790
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:07,519
the floor even though his feet are on

2791
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:08,959
the floor

2792
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,360
they're not in a position where he can

2793
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:14,239
drive from them yeah therefore when i

2794
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:16,158
flip he flips so there's a

2795
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:18,799
so there's a natural

2796
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:20,399
like flailing here so he's not falling

2797
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:22,239
forward

2798
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:23,920
you're falling forward yeah he's just

2799
01:39:22,238 --> 01:39:25,678
attached to you so like

2800
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:27,840
you can keep him up there and their like

2801
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:30,239
legs would be just flailing yep one of

2802
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:32,560
my one of my golden rules when i'm

2803
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:34,158
training and i get really tired

2804
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,639
one of the like mantras i would always

2805
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:38,238
tell myself is i'm gonna put my back on

2806
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:39,440
your chest and then i'm gonna put my

2807
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:40,718
back on the floor

2808
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:43,118
yeah because then you'll be underneath

2809
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:45,840
me that's a good principle to very

2810
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:47,359
simple and it regardless of like all the

2811
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,600
chaos and how quickly things are

2812
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:51,679
happening it's something i can just dumb

2813
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:53,679
everything down to and focus on

2814
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:55,920
regardless of the gripping situation the

2815
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:58,079
footwork all of that get my back to your

2816
01:39:55,920 --> 01:40:00,480
chest and then put my back on the floor

2817
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:02,238
so this step of getting your back to

2818
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:04,718
their chest

2819
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:07,039
like for for people who are sort of more

2820
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:09,439
like for example for people like me

2821
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:11,279
who are just like amateur judo people

2822
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,759
like there's all kinds of ways to

2823
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:17,198
prevent this turn from happening the

2824
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,199
gripping and just everything

2825
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:20,319
how difficult is it at the highest level

2826
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,238
to get

2827
01:40:20,319 --> 01:40:24,960
into this position i mean you make it

2828
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:26,479
look effortless often but like to get to

2829
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,000
the position where you're from facing

2830
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,519
them to

2831
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,079
your backs to them

2832
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,000
is that like strategy is that timing is

2833
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:35,679
that timing

2834
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,840
it's timing

2835
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:39,920
it's like anything like if i wanted to

2836
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,920
punch you in the face like how hard is

2837
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:44,239
it to really do that if you know you can

2838
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:46,319
just play defense and block it yeah the

2839
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:50,439
trick is to get them to play defense to

2840
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:50,439
something that never happened

2841
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,159
and then you go through like another way

2842
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:56,000
and then you just go through what would

2843
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:58,079
technically be your first plan if you

2844
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
planned on them playing defense

2845
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:03,600
so i set the stage from the very

2846
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,920
beginning for this to work

2847
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:09,199
so then this you're uh you're

2848
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:11,840
celebrating here it's a huge

2849
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:14,879
sort of uh once a big accomplishment big

2850
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:17,119
relief to qualify for the olympics

2851
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,359
and then you go into the olympics and

2852
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:20,479
this is where i first saw judo

2853
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:21,920
and

2854
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:24,559
i kind of thought of them as the same as

2855
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,840
judo jiu-jitsu

2856
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,320
and i was really impressed by your

2857
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:29,920
performance in that olympics

2858
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:33,519
the footage nowhere to be found these

2859
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:35,600
days but uh um at that time i think you

2860
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:38,880
could still you could watch it live on

2861
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:40,239
nbc olympics or somewhere like that and

2862
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,279
i remember watching several of your

2863
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:43,039
matches

2864
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:45,039
one of them was the match against ollie

2865
01:41:43,039 --> 01:41:46,399
bischoff the german

2866
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:47,760
and i remember being

2867
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:49,599
it'd be nice if you can talk to that

2868
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,880
match because i don't remember it all i

2869
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:53,119
remember

2870
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,000
is being frustrated

2871
01:41:53,118 --> 01:41:55,679
yep

2872
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,479
uh by

2873
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:59,279
him

2874
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:02,479
not letting you play judo yeah

2875
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:04,000
so um obviously you faced him again four

2876
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:06,000
years later and there's a lot of

2877
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,039
frustration there as well but i remember

2878
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,800
being extra frustrated in 2008

2879
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:12,479
what was that match like so he might

2880
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,560
have been number one in the world at the

2881
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:18,238
time or up there he was up there for

2882
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:20,159
sure um especially going into 2008.

2883
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:22,079
he was really high up there yeah and did

2884
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:24,879
he win

2885
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:27,279
gold at that olympics

2886
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:29,039
yes yeah because he's silvered in london

2887
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:32,238
it was the same olympic

2888
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:34,000
final both in 2008 and london yeah

2889
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:35,519
okay so you're facing

2890
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,960
him there

2891
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,520
were you intimidated what was the

2892
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:41,520
strategy can you talk to that match

2893
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:44,719
because it kind of sets the stage for

2894
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:47,440
the rematch in 2012. yeah he was

2895
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:49,520
somebody that i had trained with in the

2896
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:50,559
past and for some reason when it comes

2897
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,840
to him and

2898
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:55,119
i

2899
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,119
when we train together

2900
01:42:55,600 --> 01:43:00,239
it's more of a physical altercation than

2901
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,400
a judo training session

2902
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:04,399
you know like it's just like the coaches

2903
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:06,799
have had to break us up a few times like

2904
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:09,198
you guys get almost like angry too

2905
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,119
a little bit it it always goes you know

2906
01:43:09,198 --> 01:43:12,879
farther than it should for

2907
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:14,880
we're friends like we say hello to each

2908
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,800
other but for some reason when we train

2909
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:18,560
together there's something about like

2910
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,320
him and me that just

2911
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:22,000
oil and water i don't know what it is it

2912
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:24,238
could be also the gripping because he's

2913
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,840
a great gripping strategist yeah it does

2914
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:27,599
he frustrates you with certain kinds of

2915
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:29,360
grips and then you get pissed off and

2916
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,880
then you frustrate him and then he gets

2917
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:32,559
pissed off and then before you know it

2918
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:34,639
somebody's kicked somebody or punched

2919
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:37,039
somebody in the mouth or done something

2920
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:40,400
yeah so one of the only evidences we

2921
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:42,880
have online of you fighting him is you

2922
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:45,279
your foot in his

2923
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:48,400
groin area is the only thing we have

2924
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:50,399
from that olympics from 2008 from 2008

2925
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:52,559
yeah and to answer everybody's question

2926
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:54,960
yes it was deliberate

2927
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,080
now you can say this yeah but yeah i

2928
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,359
remember there being a lot of

2929
01:43:56,079 --> 01:43:58,960
frustration

2930
01:43:57,359 --> 01:44:01,039
uh you go you're actually going for a

2931
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,480
lot of stuff like sacrifice those i mean

2932
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:04,158
maybe you're not going for the high

2933
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:06,399
scoring epons but you're just trying to

2934
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:09,118
shake things up if i remember correctly

2935
01:44:06,399 --> 01:44:11,839
yeah because when he i was so young then

2936
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:13,679
that and he was you know in his prime

2937
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,039
really at that time right he was must

2938
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:16,800
have been

2939
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:18,479
24 25

2940
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,960
26 you know

2941
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:22,158
world medalist european champion at the

2942
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:24,239
time

2943
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:26,000
and when he would grab me

2944
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:27,359
i would i had that sense of feeling

2945
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,520
stuck

2946
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:30,960
like i was strong enough if i used all

2947
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,560
my strength to

2948
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:34,079
not let him do anything but then you

2949
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,520
can't be offensive when you're using all

2950
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:37,840
your strength to

2951
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:39,760
hold on to the situation

2952
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:42,079
so i was getting really aggravated

2953
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:44,480
because i couldn't i couldn't generate

2954
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:46,000
any offense with every time i felt like

2955
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:47,118
i gained an advantage in the gripping

2956
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,880
scenario

2957
01:44:47,118 --> 01:44:50,719
he would take some obscure grip

2958
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,239
somewhere that was like

2959
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:53,920
well now i've got to go address this

2960
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:56,638
thing give up what i gained and i have

2961
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:58,800
to go back and

2962
01:44:56,639 --> 01:45:00,719
it if i were to think about watching the

2963
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,719
match now it probably looked like a lot

2964
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:03,840
of flailing because we're just trying to

2965
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:06,880
generate

2966
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:10,000
enough to not get a penalty but also

2967
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:11,520
not enough to where he could counter it

2968
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,800
did you think you were you could beat

2969
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,080
him like when you were walking into the

2970
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,920
match

2971
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:17,198
until i gripped him for the first time

2972
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:19,520
like

2973
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:21,919
because i had trained with him before he

2974
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,000
felt stronger and more in shape than

2975
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,960
i've ever felt him

2976
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,760
that day

2977
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,760
at that olympics

2978
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:33,679
which begs a whole nother question but

2979
01:45:30,739 --> 01:45:36,158
[Laughter]

2980
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:37,840
i remember i remember when i

2981
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:38,559
when he grabbed me for that first time i

2982
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:40,560
went

2983
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:42,400
this is different

2984
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:44,400
and i there was a sense of panic at the

2985
01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:46,079
time because i was like

2986
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:47,679
holy crap where did this come from this

2987
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:50,960
is not the guy

2988
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:52,880
that i've trained with that i expected

2989
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:55,039
because it was a definite like

2990
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:57,600
level change in like his ability

2991
01:45:55,039 --> 01:45:59,600
strength speed and stamina

2992
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:02,719
like looking back at that can you

2993
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:04,719
explain that is it just you being more

2994
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:06,560
uh less confident because of the

2995
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:08,079
olympics it was

2996
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:10,239
is there some kind of routine that he

2997
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:12,319
followed to like really level up in

2998
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:14,079
intensity for this particular event i've

2999
01:46:12,319 --> 01:46:17,279
been told that

3000
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:18,079
he only gets to like his prime

3001
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:20,479
for

3002
01:46:18,079 --> 01:46:22,800
like really big events yeah like he

3003
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:24,799
doesn't train like year-round like i

3004
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,480
would train but when it comes to like

3005
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:29,840
the games he doesn't

3006
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:31,519
do social media he doesn't work he lives

3007
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:33,920
breathes eats

3008
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:36,320
his training for the games which could

3009
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:39,199
you know institute that level

3010
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:41,359
what about you is there uh like dan

3011
01:46:39,198 --> 01:46:43,039
gable famously said like the one loss he

3012
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:44,960
had in college he was doing a lot of

3013
01:46:43,039 --> 01:46:47,519
media and stuff back back then there was

3014
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:48,480
no social media that was a huge mistake

3015
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:51,280
for him

3016
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:52,879
do you do social media do you do like at

3017
01:46:51,279 --> 01:46:55,039
that at this point well at that time i

3018
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,520
was like aol i don't know what's up i

3019
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:59,840
didn't even have a facebook page uh

3020
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:02,960
myspace nothing at this point yeah i got

3021
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:05,039
my first facebook page from the usoc in

3022
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,639
2012. yeah when i went through the media

3023
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:08,800
thing the lady was like

3024
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:10,400
you have to have it i go i don't want it

3025
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:11,760
i don't like people i want to deal with

3026
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:13,439
the people

3027
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:17,119
what am i supposed to do you know like

3028
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:19,519
the social part of the social media no

3029
01:47:17,118 --> 01:47:21,359
okay um i i have to bring this up

3030
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,520
because uh and then you went on to face

3031
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:25,359
diego camilo uh you lost that match but

3032
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,440
he went on to win bronze that's also an

3033
01:47:25,359 --> 01:47:28,799
interesting one but we can skip ahead i

3034
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:30,879
just remember being really impressed

3035
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:33,199
both by your ground work

3036
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,679
um that was a match i should have won

3037
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:38,399
yeah i should have won that i was

3038
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:40,000
if you don't know judo

3039
01:47:38,399 --> 01:47:42,000
you would visually watch that and be

3040
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,920
like i'm winning but he was technically

3041
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,000
winning on the scoreboard so it is what

3042
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:49,118
it is but the point that he got that

3043
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,118
solidified his win

3044
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:54,480
yes it was a point back in those days so

3045
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:57,119
i can't say anything but like

3046
01:47:54,479 --> 01:47:59,039
my shoulder nicked the ground so it's

3047
01:47:57,118 --> 01:48:03,118
like i don't know yeah a lot of the

3048
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:05,679
stories of your olympic career is like

3049
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:08,238
from a fan perspective it seems like

3050
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:10,158
you should have won or you very close to

3051
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:11,839
could have won yes and there was a lot

3052
01:48:10,158 --> 01:48:14,000
of frustration you and your game being

3053
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:14,960
like shut down in certain ways and

3054
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,679
but like

3055
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:19,039
the thing that immediately grabbed me in

3056
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:21,199
2008

3057
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:22,800
was how much something about the way you

3058
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:24,638
approached judo

3059
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,320
how much you wanted to win

3060
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:27,359
because i was young then

3061
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:29,679
i was

3062
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:30,880
when i was at this at this time in my

3063
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:33,440
career

3064
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:35,760
i was out to like

3065
01:48:33,439 --> 01:48:38,319
win like there was no like i'm gonna

3066
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:40,480
grab you i'm gonna throw you and if not

3067
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:42,479
you're gonna go through a battle yeah

3068
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:45,039
you're gonna make sure you earned it

3069
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:47,039
it so happened that you competing in

3070
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:50,479
2008

3071
01:48:47,039 --> 01:48:52,719
i was uh i became a fan of yours uh at

3072
01:48:50,479 --> 01:48:55,279
that moment and since then

3073
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:58,399
i uh i kind of knew about judo my

3074
01:48:55,279 --> 01:49:00,399
university had a judo club and i kind of

3075
01:48:58,399 --> 01:49:01,759
knew about jiu jitsu from

3076
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:03,599
martial arts

3077
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:05,920
and uh obviously i wrestled for many

3078
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,280
years before and i love wrestling

3079
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,760
but there's something about you

3080
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:11,118
competing that made me

3081
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:12,560
well there's no other way to say but it

3082
01:49:11,118 --> 01:49:14,479
like changed the direction of my life

3083
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,760
because it forced me

3084
01:49:14,479 --> 01:49:17,919
to say you know what i'm going to start

3085
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:19,840
judo in jiu jitsu

3086
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,920
and first of all for that i'm really

3087
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:24,239
grateful but it's fascinating to think

3088
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:26,000
because this kid is 22 years old i'm

3089
01:49:24,238 --> 01:49:28,079
sure i'm not the only one

3090
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,079
that you've influenced like you've

3091
01:49:28,079 --> 01:49:31,198
changed the direction of my life and

3092
01:49:30,079 --> 01:49:33,679
there could be

3093
01:49:31,198 --> 01:49:35,198
a huge number of others like that i mean

3094
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:37,039
that's the power of

3095
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:38,559
you as an individual at the on the

3096
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:39,840
olympic stage

3097
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,679
you ever think about the pressure of

3098
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:44,319
that did you did you think it's a 22

3099
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:46,239
year old there's a bunch of people

3100
01:49:44,319 --> 01:49:47,920
like i know i'm not the only one who

3101
01:49:46,238 --> 01:49:50,319
changed i just happened to have

3102
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:52,880
like a microphone recently

3103
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:54,399
you know what i mean like is that

3104
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,880
it's fascinating to think about right

3105
01:49:54,399 --> 01:49:58,079
like you perhaps you didn't think about

3106
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:00,000
this it's just

3107
01:49:58,079 --> 01:50:01,198
just a judo match but you're like you

3108
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,719
influenced

3109
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:04,719
hundreds of thousands of people if not

3110
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:06,000
millions is that interesting

3111
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:08,960
it's

3112
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,279
it's not something that really

3113
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:13,679
hit me until

3114
01:50:11,279 --> 01:50:13,679
um

3115
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:20,399
2012 when i lost

3116
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,399
because that's when like

3117
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:24,718
i would say like the world felt bad for

3118
01:50:23,198 --> 01:50:26,559
me

3119
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:28,960
at that point and that's when you knew

3120
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,880
that like

3121
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:34,000
people were watching

3122
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:36,159
and people were inspired by the loss

3123
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,439
because of how much went into that match

3124
01:50:36,158 --> 01:50:40,479
yeah

3125
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:42,399
because you know that 99 of us who

3126
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:44,399
watched it thought i won

3127
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:46,719
except for the one percent of the people

3128
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:48,238
who were considered judges at that day

3129
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:49,118
in the event

3130
01:50:48,238 --> 01:50:52,158
so

3131
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:54,158
but i mean that's the the winner lose

3132
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:56,079
that that was a really inspiring match

3133
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:58,479
and that's when that's when it dinged

3134
01:50:56,079 --> 01:51:00,559
that like

3135
01:50:58,479 --> 01:51:02,959
because i don't i don't watch something

3136
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:05,119
and really get inspired by like the

3137
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:08,399
person and the act

3138
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:11,198
it's like a it's an accumulative thing

3139
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:13,759
but for a lot of people like

3140
01:51:11,198 --> 01:51:15,919
when they watch how much goes into it

3141
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,000
and then when i broke down on the match

3142
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:19,840
like the amount of suffering

3143
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,520
that happens when you lose a match like

3144
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:24,239
that and then

3145
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:26,080
you know really coming back and

3146
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:27,919
winning in rio

3147
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:29,118
there's a trend of people who were

3148
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:31,279
inspired

3149
01:51:29,118 --> 01:51:33,920
that knew about london and then when

3150
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:35,519
they found out i won in rio that's when

3151
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:37,760
like people like

3152
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:40,560
in droves felt like they could overcome

3153
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:41,920
their own personal obstacles to still

3154
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:44,080
achieve something because they've

3155
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:46,399
witnessed somebody who's fallen

3156
01:51:44,079 --> 01:51:49,439
and gotten back up

3157
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:52,399
yeah but it's not something that

3158
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:54,079
you think about like on the day

3159
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:55,839
it's when you look back and you go oh

3160
01:51:54,079 --> 01:51:57,760
cause and effect

3161
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:59,199
i wonder if you can comment on that i'm

3162
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:01,280
trying to

3163
01:51:59,198 --> 01:52:03,759
realize and live up to

3164
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:05,519
the fact that there's like young people

3165
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:07,920
that come up to me

3166
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,920
and i'm starting to realize like

3167
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:12,480
certain words i say will have a long

3168
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:13,920
lasting impact on them yep because you

3169
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:16,158
say it as like

3170
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,158
you don't even doesn't just yeah the

3171
01:52:16,158 --> 01:52:21,359
whim some of them might come back 30

3172
01:52:18,158 --> 01:52:23,359
years later and a word i said was the

3173
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:25,359
reason they quit a thing and started the

3174
01:52:23,359 --> 01:52:28,079
new thing that led them to become their

3175
01:52:25,359 --> 01:52:30,079
true self like to find success all that

3176
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:32,479
kind of stuff like on the flip side

3177
01:52:30,079 --> 01:52:35,599
though some people based on the actions

3178
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:39,198
that we do today even with this cast

3179
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:42,880
will alter the course of their lives

3180
01:52:39,198 --> 01:52:44,799
forever i had a guy one time

3181
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,880
was it after london

3182
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:50,159
it must have been after london

3183
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:51,760
he actually found me on instagram

3184
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:55,519
wrote me what seemed to be like a

3185
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:58,800
dissertation on instagram about how

3186
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:01,760
much he i disrespected him

3187
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:03,679
14 years earlier because

3188
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:05,280
i didn't step on a podium to take a

3189
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:06,800
picture after winning a tournament where

3190
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:10,559
he bronzed

3191
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:12,639
yeah and i'm thinking to myself like

3192
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:14,480
at the time like

3193
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:16,079
having dinner with my family because i

3194
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:18,559
had to leave the next morning was more

3195
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:21,118
important to me as a person

3196
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:23,599
not thinking about

3197
01:53:21,118 --> 01:53:25,198
who you potentially will become

3198
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:26,960
and

3199
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:29,598
the

3200
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:33,118
actions of whatever you do today

3201
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:34,800
if you do become quote unquote famous or

3202
01:53:33,118 --> 01:53:36,479
somebody in a spotlight that that could

3203
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:38,560
come back to bite you

3204
01:53:36,479 --> 01:53:40,559
to me i don't know about you that that's

3205
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,360
that's super motivating

3206
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,280
like

3207
01:53:41,359 --> 01:53:45,519
not to be

3208
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:46,479
a lesser version of myself

3209
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,320
ever

3210
01:53:46,479 --> 01:53:49,919
yeah just be on top of your game

3211
01:53:48,319 --> 01:53:51,359
whatever that game is be on top of your

3212
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:53,199
game when you're interacting with people

3213
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:55,118
and when you're just in your own private

3214
01:53:53,198 --> 01:53:57,118
life i'm trying to make sure that i'm

3215
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:58,158
the exact same person privately as i am

3216
01:53:57,118 --> 01:54:00,479
publicly

3217
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:02,960
and like making sure i'm on point i see

3218
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:05,279
like just hanging out with uh joe rogan

3219
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:06,719
a lot i see how he's first of all the

3220
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:10,238
exact same person

3221
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:11,760
and second he he like walks around and

3222
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:14,079
there's like a huge number of fans and

3223
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,159
you'll just take pictures and like it's

3224
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:17,840
very cool and it's very cognizant of

3225
01:54:16,158 --> 01:54:19,679
like certain words he says especially

3226
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,599
young people like they're going to take

3227
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:23,440
that and that's going to be a memory for

3228
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:24,800
them for a couple years yeah that might

3229
01:54:23,439 --> 01:54:26,238
be influential for the rest of their

3230
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:27,279
life so yeah

3231
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:29,919
i don't know that's a cool

3232
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:32,960
responsibility

3233
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:35,440
not to [ __ ] it up hey but but anyway i i

3234
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:37,840
bring all that up to just say

3235
01:54:35,439 --> 01:54:37,839
thank you

3236
01:54:38,319 --> 01:54:42,639
so even if you like were frustrated that

3237
01:54:40,158 --> 01:54:43,519
you didn't win a medal at least at least

3238
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:45,118
uh

3239
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,639
you influenced one

3240
01:54:45,118 --> 01:54:48,559
silly russian kid

3241
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:50,000
to get into the martial arts and what

3242
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:51,520
happens when you get into martial arts

3243
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,960
it alters the direction of your life

3244
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:57,040
yeah mine from for for the better okay

3245
01:54:54,960 --> 01:55:00,158
so let's go to uh

3246
01:54:57,039 --> 01:55:03,760
london 2012 olympics

3247
01:55:00,158 --> 01:55:04,799
uh one of the most dramatic

3248
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:06,480
battles

3249
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,679
of all time

3250
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:09,919
rematch

3251
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:12,158
yep so you've reached the semifinals

3252
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:14,158
once again to face the german holy

3253
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:15,279
bischoff

3254
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:18,479
do you mind if we step through that

3255
01:55:15,279 --> 01:55:20,559
match a little bit

3256
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:22,399
by all means

3257
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:25,760
i've only ever watched the entire thing

3258
01:55:22,399 --> 01:55:25,759
one time just because

3259
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:33,920
[ __ ]

3260
01:55:29,118 --> 01:55:35,598
so uh for context for the listener um

3261
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:37,039
travis first of all you don't like

3262
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:39,599
losing

3263
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:41,840
i think that's fair to say you know

3264
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,760
the the hard part with this match is

3265
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:45,199
because i went into this olympics

3266
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:47,360
thinking

3267
01:55:45,198 --> 01:55:50,079
i'm not [ __ ] win the olympics i'm the

3268
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:50,079
best in the world

3269
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:59,039
i never in my right mind thought

3270
01:55:54,880 --> 01:56:01,118
oh i'm gonna win a medal like that never

3271
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:03,760
that never crossed my mind

3272
01:56:01,118 --> 01:56:03,759
so it's like

3273
01:56:04,399 --> 01:56:07,920
i would have rather him just [ __ ]

3274
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:10,959
beat me

3275
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:12,319
yeah because then i lost

3276
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:15,359
so here

3277
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:17,279
the referees as as many people thought

3278
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:19,759
robbed you of a victory but it was also

3279
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:21,679
a really close battle again with

3280
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:23,920
many of the elements of frustration as

3281
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:26,079
2008 in terms of strategically and

3282
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:28,319
gripping wise and it was just a

3283
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:29,359
fascinating battle that went to overtime

3284
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:31,679
uh so

3285
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:33,439
can you set the context so

3286
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:35,359
what what did the bracket look like who

3287
01:56:33,439 --> 01:56:37,519
were the players here

3288
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:38,639
um who did you beat leading up to this

3289
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:40,639
match

3290
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:42,639
myself as you walk onto the mat what

3291
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:45,118
happened the day before the the hours

3292
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:46,960
before as you're standing there but how

3293
01:56:45,118 --> 01:56:48,479
bad is this is it when just two people

3294
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:52,239
are standing like this

3295
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:54,839
and yes [ __ ] that [ __ ] guy man

3296
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:57,919
but this this bracket

3297
01:56:54,840 --> 01:57:00,639
um was really interesting if you look at

3298
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:02,960
like the backstory of 81 kilos like

3299
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:04,159
leading up to the olympics right

3300
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:06,719
because

3301
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:09,118
at this point in time you know

3302
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:12,719
i was inside the top 10 at all times you

3303
01:57:09,118 --> 01:57:14,799
know eight seven five four

3304
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:16,319
you know sixes i fell out of there

3305
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,320
sometimes due to injuries but i always

3306
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:20,000
climb back in

3307
01:57:18,319 --> 01:57:21,599
there was another guy

3308
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,599
um

3309
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:25,760
from azerbaijan

3310
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:28,239
that was the olympic champion at 73

3311
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:29,199
kilos in 2008

3312
01:57:28,238 --> 01:57:32,638
and

3313
01:57:29,198 --> 01:57:34,799
the entire division got rocked

3314
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:38,239
by match one

3315
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:41,199
because his first match was with antoine

3316
01:57:38,238 --> 01:57:44,399
vallis fortier of canada

3317
01:57:41,198 --> 01:57:47,598
and everybody who saw the draw come out

3318
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:49,759
was like yarza bijani is going to win it

3319
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:51,440
he's the former olympic champion

3320
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:53,760
he's pretty much one of most of the

3321
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:56,879
major events including at 90 kilos

3322
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:59,039
because he just had smooth judo

3323
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:01,359
and

3324
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:03,760
you know match one rolls around

3325
01:58:01,359 --> 01:58:05,519
match two rolls around antoine's in the

3326
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:06,639
shoot and he's looking around and he's

3327
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,880
like

3328
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:10,639
the azerbaijani is not here

3329
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:14,480
well where is he

3330
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:16,480
no joke he runs into the venue

3331
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:18,559
a match before

3332
01:58:16,479 --> 01:58:20,718
throws his gui on and runs onto the

3333
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:22,800
olympic platform

3334
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:26,239
loses to the canadian in like a

3335
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:28,320
three-minute golden score battle

3336
01:58:26,238 --> 01:58:30,718
so do you think he warmed up

3337
01:58:28,319 --> 01:58:32,559
didn't he ran he literally

3338
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:35,760
ran into the venue threw his gui on and

3339
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:37,760
ran out didn't know judo

3340
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:40,719
and there you see antoine

3341
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:42,800
losing in the quarters

3342
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:45,679
so how good was antoine

3343
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:48,560
at this point in time this is i believe

3344
01:58:45,679 --> 01:58:50,800
his first international medal was the

3345
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:52,719
olympic games

3346
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:55,599
so i don't think he'd ever meddled in

3347
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:57,198
paris um he went into this bracket

3348
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:58,719
unranked

3349
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:00,719
beating the ranked guy

3350
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:02,880
first round because he

3351
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:05,840
i don't know if he missed the bus

3352
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:07,199
i don't know if he was off his cycle and

3353
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:09,520
planned on losing because he didn't want

3354
01:59:07,198 --> 01:59:11,198
to test positive i don't know

3355
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:13,199
there's a lot of like

3356
01:59:11,198 --> 01:59:16,479
questionable things out there that could

3357
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:17,519
have potentially caused him to

3358
01:59:16,479 --> 01:59:20,158
you know

3359
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:21,599
run onto the olympic platform for match

3360
01:59:20,158 --> 01:59:22,638
one

3361
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,599
but

3362
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:24,400
you know

3363
01:59:23,599 --> 01:59:27,039
it

3364
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:28,960
it catapulted antoine into like a belief

3365
01:59:27,039 --> 01:59:32,000
that like

3366
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:33,520
i beat the seated guy i'm i'm ready and

3367
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:37,198
that was like a turning point in the

3368
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:39,199
canadians career just as a whole

3369
01:59:37,198 --> 01:59:40,799
right that's that everybody has a

3370
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:43,839
defining moment

3371
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:45,760
like mine was when i beat bishop

3372
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:46,880
in dusseldorf at the grand prix for

3373
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:49,440
germany

3374
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:52,239
after 2008

3375
01:59:49,439 --> 01:59:54,479
right i beat the olympic champion in on

3376
01:59:52,238 --> 01:59:56,839
his home soil to go win the entire

3377
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:59,118
tournament so we all have like those

3378
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:02,239
moments it's just when it happens at the

3379
01:59:59,118 --> 02:00:04,000
games it throws the bracket like into a

3380
02:00:02,238 --> 02:00:05,919
tailspin because typically you'd know

3381
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,599
like who's going to beat who where it's

3382
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:09,520
going to happen

3383
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:11,520
and when you look at my quarter final

3384
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:14,239
against the brazilian

3385
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:16,639
what most people don't know is i was i

3386
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:18,959
was so thankful i had that match most

3387
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:19,760
people would never in a million years be

3388
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,118
like

3389
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,880
i want to fight the world number one at

3390
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:25,039
the olympic games that's what i want to

3391
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:26,239
do i want to be the eighth seed fighting

3392
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:27,840
the world number one because i'm gonna

3393
02:00:26,238 --> 02:00:31,039
win

3394
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:32,639
i was pissed off at him i was so angry

3395
02:00:31,039 --> 02:00:33,920
because

3396
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:36,560
we

3397
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:37,679
we were at the pan am's i think the year

3398
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:38,960
before

3399
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:41,920
and there was a team tournament and i

3400
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:43,599
wanted to fight him i had lost

3401
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:46,639
the

3402
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:48,400
quarters to a cuban i think in like the

3403
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:51,279
first gripping exchange he threw me with

3404
02:00:48,399 --> 02:00:53,039
a drop sale out of nowhere i was pissed

3405
02:00:51,279 --> 02:00:54,960
so i wanted my hands on the brazilian in

3406
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:57,439
the team match

3407
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:59,520
well the brazilian team's warming up

3408
02:00:57,439 --> 02:01:00,638
so i walk up to him no joke i walked up

3409
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:02,400
to him and i go

3410
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:03,599
you're fighting and he goes

3411
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:06,238
not today

3412
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:07,920
and i went are you [ __ ] kidding me i

3413
02:01:06,238 --> 02:01:09,519
warmed up i taped up you're the only

3414
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:10,800
[ __ ] guy i want to fight and you're

3415
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,560
gonna [ __ ] sit in the stands and read

3416
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:14,400
a goddamn book

3417
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:15,920
i was so angry i carried that anger

3418
02:01:14,399 --> 02:01:17,039
because i never fought him until this

3419
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:19,279
day

3420
02:01:17,039 --> 02:01:21,760
i was [ __ ] pissed i was ready to beat

3421
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:24,079
him that's right i remember i forgot he

3422
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:26,320
was uh the world number one yeah how did

3423
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:28,158
he um because i remember like being

3424
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:30,319
really excited at that match how did you

3425
02:01:28,158 --> 02:01:32,319
beat him i threw him with two hands on

3426
02:01:30,319 --> 02:01:34,238
the same side collar yeah like dropped

3427
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:37,118
sail i cross gripped i yanked him behind

3428
02:01:34,238 --> 02:01:39,359
me and i threw him deep on wasari and

3429
02:01:37,118 --> 02:01:41,439
then the match ended

3430
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:44,719
30 seconds later yeah

3431
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:46,319
i was pumped i was i thought i think

3432
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:49,118
okay if i'm remembering correctly i

3433
02:01:46,319 --> 02:01:51,759
thought okay this guy might actually win

3434
02:01:49,118 --> 02:01:54,079
gold

3435
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:56,719
that's that's what made for me as a

3436
02:01:54,079 --> 02:01:59,599
spectator remembering now

3437
02:01:56,719 --> 02:02:02,960
the next match that much more like

3438
02:01:59,599 --> 02:02:05,440
painful and then the fans of judo that

3439
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:07,520
really followed the sport

3440
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:09,598
the stats when you look at the games and

3441
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:11,440
my draws i had the worst possible draw

3442
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:13,360
as you ever could have imagined

3443
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:15,039
at both london and rio i fought the

3444
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:17,118
world number one

3445
02:02:15,039 --> 02:02:19,039
to get to the final or into the semis or

3446
02:02:17,118 --> 02:02:22,238
past the semis

3447
02:02:19,039 --> 02:02:24,479
and everybody i fought in the draw

3448
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:26,799
either beat me the last time we fought

3449
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:28,879
or i had never fought before

3450
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:30,560
so i always held a loss going on to the

3451
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,159
mat at the olympic games how'd you feel

3452
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:34,800
about that by the way like what were

3453
02:02:32,158 --> 02:02:36,799
your feelings about facing the brazilian

3454
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,920
first i was so excited this well that

3455
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,719
was match

3456
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:40,639
three

3457
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:43,118
in london i fought the slovenian guy

3458
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:46,079
first round who beat me

3459
02:02:43,118 --> 02:02:48,158
um where'd he beat me was it the worlds

3460
02:02:46,079 --> 02:02:49,840
might have been the world's and then

3461
02:02:48,158 --> 02:02:51,920
church's philly i fought in the second

3462
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:54,639
round who threw me for

3463
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:55,760
wasari in japan

3464
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:57,920
and then

3465
02:02:55,760 --> 02:03:00,000
leandro who i don't think i ever fought

3466
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,118
who was world number one that avoided

3467
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,039
fighting me

3468
02:03:01,118 --> 02:03:05,359
at the team tournament but i mean every

3469
02:03:03,039 --> 02:03:07,118
single olympics you've fought you really

3470
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:08,880
stepped up the only tournament i've ever

3471
02:03:07,118 --> 02:03:10,319
prepped for

3472
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:12,800
mentally and physically and just the

3473
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:14,719
whole thing yeah we never trained

3474
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:16,239
through this tournament like we did for

3475
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:18,480
the others or

3476
02:03:16,238 --> 02:03:19,839
i would go into it injured all right

3477
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:22,638
well let's talk about you're standing

3478
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:23,920
there next to that uh

3479
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:25,679
to the german

3480
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:29,599
he looks he looked always smaller than

3481
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:32,158
you but you said like strong yeah

3482
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:34,239
um so what are you feeling now jimmy

3483
02:03:32,158 --> 02:03:36,879
pedro behind you i was [ __ ] ready to

3484
02:03:34,238 --> 02:03:38,399
take his head off

3485
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:40,159
did you have an idea of what you're

3486
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:42,238
gonna do did you try do you're thinking

3487
02:03:40,158 --> 02:03:44,559
of winning by epon were you thinking

3488
02:03:42,238 --> 02:03:47,279
like going for big throws take or take

3489
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:48,960
him in deep waters i'll grip him what

3490
02:03:47,279 --> 02:03:50,000
were you thinking we were about to have

3491
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,359
a battle

3492
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,960
and

3493
02:03:51,359 --> 02:03:55,039
i wasn't going to throw him until he

3494
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:57,760
broke mentally

3495
02:03:55,039 --> 02:04:00,000
okay that was

3496
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:02,320
there was no like oh this is going to be

3497
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,599
a clean throw that was never

3498
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:07,198
that was never the thought process

3499
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:09,039
so

3500
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:10,399
so here

3501
02:04:09,039 --> 02:04:12,479
you know there's going to be a lot of

3502
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:13,920
gripping so we're seeing a [ __ ] ton of

3503
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:17,439
gripping

3504
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:20,000
and right here he throws it bang

3505
02:04:17,439 --> 02:04:22,078
close-fisted

3506
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,479
you got a lot of adrenaline you seem

3507
02:04:22,078 --> 02:04:26,000
calm i'm pissed you're pissed like you

3508
02:04:24,479 --> 02:04:27,839
don't look serious you just look like

3509
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,039
i'm looking at the ref like because he

3510
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:31,840
keeps telling me to get up i'm like i

3511
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:33,039
have blood running down my face

3512
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,560
i go

3513
02:04:33,039 --> 02:04:37,198
okay

3514
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:39,440
here see blood see he's like oh yeah go

3515
02:04:37,198 --> 02:04:41,279
fix it and that's on your eyebrow

3516
02:04:39,439 --> 02:04:43,198
somewhere yeah he split it just

3517
02:04:41,279 --> 02:04:44,880
underneath it so you split your eyebrow

3518
02:04:43,198 --> 02:04:46,638
and so in judo they don't they're

3519
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:48,719
allergic to blood

3520
02:04:46,639 --> 02:04:51,118
probably for a good reason but they

3521
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:54,158
so now you have to try to figure out

3522
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:56,000
how to uh tape that up yeah

3523
02:04:54,158 --> 02:04:58,078
which already sets up one of the most

3524
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,479
badass

3525
02:04:58,078 --> 02:05:03,920
looks in judo history

3526
02:05:00,479 --> 02:05:05,198
first 15 seconds yeah busted my eye open

3527
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:08,480
was that getting in the way of your

3528
02:05:05,198 --> 02:05:08,479
eyesight at all or no no

3529
02:05:09,118 --> 02:05:12,399
damn he looks good at gripping how

3530
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:14,800
difficult is it to get a grip on that

3531
02:05:12,399 --> 02:05:16,078
guy very

3532
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:17,199
like i'm struggling just to get my hand

3533
02:05:16,078 --> 02:05:19,759
in the collar and he wasn't even

3534
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:20,960
blocking it is he being caged yeah

3535
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:23,440
remember like

3536
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:25,118
is he interested in offense nope he's a

3537
02:05:23,439 --> 02:05:27,198
very cagey

3538
02:05:25,118 --> 02:05:31,679
you know methodical player

3539
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:33,519
like he he never opens himself up yeah

3540
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:36,480
there you go you grab the leg as part of

3541
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:37,679
a combination yep

3542
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:39,839
and people have told me that he's

3543
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:41,118
actually very good at throwing people he

3544
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:43,279
just doesn't

3545
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:44,880
so but he just doesn't show it at these

3546
02:05:43,279 --> 02:05:46,880
no because he

3547
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:49,840
he doesn't care how he wins he cares

3548
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:51,760
that he wins yeah which makes him very

3549
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:54,078
difficult to beat

3550
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:55,199
because he knows when you've strategized

3551
02:05:54,078 --> 02:05:56,639
to do that

3552
02:05:55,198 --> 02:05:58,799
where you look at the rule set and you

3553
02:05:56,639 --> 02:06:00,639
develop a plan to to get through the

3554
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:01,920
matches then

3555
02:06:00,639 --> 02:06:04,319
you've really got to figure out a way to

3556
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:05,520
get that person off that game plan

3557
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:08,639
you know whether you get a head by a

3558
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:10,159
penalty or something

3559
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:12,400
right there

3560
02:06:10,158 --> 02:06:12,399
like

3561
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:17,199
he wouldn't give me the sleeve so i

3562
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:19,039
grabbed all of his fingers oh nice in

3563
02:06:17,198 --> 02:06:21,759
which i just opened

3564
02:06:19,039 --> 02:06:23,760
like to like this way or i grabbed them

3565
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:26,239
the other way and i started lifting them

3566
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,840
uh yeah i started nice first playing

3567
02:06:26,238 --> 02:06:29,678
mercy like this

3568
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:31,199
yeah

3569
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:33,679
is great because he wouldn't give me the

3570
02:06:31,198 --> 02:06:35,359
sleeve and i needed an attack

3571
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:36,719
and i'm like okay i can't hold on to

3572
02:06:35,359 --> 02:06:38,078
this forever because that judge is going

3573
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:39,840
to see it so let me just do a quick

3574
02:06:38,078 --> 02:06:42,479
throw here while i'm using the fingers

3575
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:45,039
and then you're just holding on yeah

3576
02:06:42,479 --> 02:06:45,039
and then i just

3577
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:51,599
and then yeah he goes to get up and i go

3578
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:54,639
to get on top and right here

3579
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:57,199
nice that elbow you get him oh you got

3580
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:59,920
him yeah it looks like i elbow him

3581
02:06:57,198 --> 02:07:02,078
did you do it kind of no i didn't even i

3582
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:04,239
at the time i never knew this happened

3583
02:07:02,078 --> 02:07:06,000
yeah until after i watched this like

3584
02:07:04,238 --> 02:07:08,479
three or four years later

3585
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,639
didn't even know i didn't even feel it

3586
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:12,959
look at that so he's legitimately angry

3587
02:07:10,639 --> 02:07:15,440
here yeah he's angry

3588
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:17,520
and of course you can't you can't move

3589
02:07:15,439 --> 02:07:19,359
why would you get this look at this this

3590
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:20,800
moment right there is gold if you're not

3591
02:07:19,359 --> 02:07:23,920
watching this on video you're missing

3592
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:25,360
out you do you never get this in judo no

3593
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:27,840
i don't know if that's ever happened

3594
02:07:25,359 --> 02:07:30,319
that little face-off especially on a

3595
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:32,159
stage like this the reference and then

3596
02:07:30,319 --> 02:07:33,920
he brings us in to like talk to us and

3597
02:07:32,158 --> 02:07:35,039
he's like hey we're good right like you

3598
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:37,760
guys aren't about to do what i think

3599
02:07:35,039 --> 02:07:39,760
you're about to do

3600
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:40,960
ah you put up like hey shake hands again

3601
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:42,320
because the first time we did it that

3602
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:44,560
wasn't good enough well you got to do it

3603
02:07:42,319 --> 02:07:44,559
again

3604
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:49,920
the heartbreaking part about this and

3605
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:51,199
why the ijf switched it to an unlimited

3606
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:54,800
golden score

3607
02:07:51,198 --> 02:07:56,158
because we fought five minutes um

3608
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:58,239
through the entire

3609
02:07:56,158 --> 02:07:59,759
normal part of the match and then we did

3610
02:07:58,238 --> 02:08:02,319
the entire

3611
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:04,159
overtime period of three minutes not one

3612
02:08:02,319 --> 02:08:06,399
penalty was given

3613
02:08:04,158 --> 02:08:08,319
no gripping infractions zero false

3614
02:08:06,399 --> 02:08:09,920
attacks like no stalls that's great

3615
02:08:08,319 --> 02:08:12,238
there was that nobody was really backing

3616
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:14,560
up yep i mean it was you know so what

3617
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:16,399
was jimmy telling you here

3618
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:19,039
how was he was he talking to you at all

3619
02:08:16,399 --> 02:08:21,920
he's not allowed to talk during medical

3620
02:08:19,039 --> 02:08:24,000
things and my nose is now broken but

3621
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:28,158
he's also oh the nose is broken from

3622
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:30,800
what um i caught an elbow from him

3623
02:08:28,158 --> 02:08:32,879
glad his face is clean that's fun

3624
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:35,039
and right here like i was pissed i was

3625
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,960
so angry at the medic because he's

3626
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:39,519
fumbling around and i'm like my whole

3627
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:41,198
plan is to break the german mentally

3628
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:42,239
yeah you got to hurry up with the tape

3629
02:08:41,198 --> 02:08:43,759
man like

3630
02:08:42,238 --> 02:08:46,399
he's supposed to be tired like he's not

3631
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:49,280
supposed to be resting

3632
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:51,118
is jimmy yelling here he can't

3633
02:08:49,279 --> 02:08:53,279
no not here not here but during the

3634
02:08:51,118 --> 02:08:54,719
match yeah and you can see i just take

3635
02:08:53,279 --> 02:08:56,000
it from him and i'm like give it to me

3636
02:08:54,719 --> 02:08:58,158
i'm going to do it myself get out of

3637
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,158
here

3638
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:01,840
how scared is the medic

3639
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:03,119
it's like this guy's going to can't even

3640
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:04,319
tear the tape

3641
02:09:03,118 --> 02:09:06,479
look how nervous he is

3642
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:09,279
[Laughter]

3643
02:09:06,479 --> 02:09:10,799
we made fun of him for this yes so much

3644
02:09:09,279 --> 02:09:12,800
throughout the years

3645
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:15,679
still due to this day all right here we

3646
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:17,760
go oh you look great

3647
02:09:15,679 --> 02:09:19,760
can't really see don't care

3648
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:20,880
was there some outcome in your mind that

3649
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:22,719
you could possibly beat him on the

3650
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:24,400
ground with a submission or a pin you

3651
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:26,719
knew you're gonna have to throw him i

3652
02:09:24,399 --> 02:09:29,839
knew i was gonna have to if i was gonna

3653
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:31,760
throw him or armbar him or pin him

3654
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:34,880
whatever the case may be

3655
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:37,360
it was going to be his mental like

3656
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:39,039
i'm just tired of this yeah right he's

3657
02:09:37,359 --> 02:09:41,039
too cagey of a player he's too

3658
02:09:39,039 --> 02:09:42,960
experienced

3659
02:09:41,039 --> 02:09:44,719
you know he has to mentally make that

3660
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:45,920
choice to give that inch

3661
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:47,039
and then you just have to be ready to

3662
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:50,000
take it

3663
02:09:47,039 --> 02:09:52,158
so i was just waiting for it

3664
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:54,078
and so now this is four minutes in one

3665
02:09:52,158 --> 02:09:54,879
minute left yep

3666
02:09:54,078 --> 02:09:56,960
oh

3667
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:58,880
um is that in your game plan two

3668
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:01,039
potential likes assuming engage like

3669
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:02,800
these sacrifice throws to him

3670
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:04,479
because the whole point of that that

3671
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:06,000
technique and the sacrifice throws

3672
02:10:04,479 --> 02:10:07,118
wasn't because i thought i was gonna

3673
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,920
throw him

3674
02:10:07,118 --> 02:10:11,598
but

3675
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:14,000
it disrupts the pattern enough to like

3676
02:10:11,599 --> 02:10:15,520
get him to make a potential mistake yeah

3677
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,639
like see he should have gotten a cheeto

3678
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:18,159
there

3679
02:10:16,639 --> 02:10:21,118
hands in the face

3680
02:10:18,158 --> 02:10:23,598
but again that's just part of judo yeah

3681
02:10:21,118 --> 02:10:26,158
he poked me in the eyeball

3682
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:28,159
this is a rough match

3683
02:10:26,158 --> 02:10:29,920
does he act at all or no like was he

3684
02:10:28,158 --> 02:10:31,598
acting frustrated or anything like that

3685
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:33,279
was all

3686
02:10:31,599 --> 02:10:34,960
like he's like acting for the ref you

3687
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:37,439
know what i mean like oh that all that

3688
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:39,198
kind of stuff you're just going in yeah

3689
02:10:37,439 --> 02:10:42,238
hard non-stop

3690
02:10:39,198 --> 02:10:44,638
like angry aggressive

3691
02:10:42,238 --> 02:10:46,799
feeling cardio here at all like i don't

3692
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:48,639
i'm not tired during this

3693
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:50,079
and then just always pressing forward

3694
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:52,480
time runs out

3695
02:10:50,078 --> 02:10:54,479
now we're into golden score 12 minutes

3696
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:56,479
and 38 seconds later

3697
02:10:54,479 --> 02:10:58,638
yeah you think about every judo exchange

3698
02:10:56,479 --> 02:11:00,319
right every time we grip up every time

3699
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:01,920
we attack sometimes it can take longer

3700
02:11:00,319 --> 02:11:03,599
to get back to the line than the entire

3701
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:05,199
exchange yeah

3702
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:06,719
so the the more aggression the more

3703
02:11:05,198 --> 02:11:09,439
exchanges you have the

3704
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:11,520
the the longer the time stretches

3705
02:11:09,439 --> 02:11:13,519
then here the six seconds left and

3706
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:14,960
golden score

3707
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:16,320
your tape

3708
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:17,760
is uh

3709
02:11:16,319 --> 02:11:20,158
is now

3710
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:22,239
yellow and red yeah

3711
02:11:20,158 --> 02:11:24,319
with sweat and blood literally and time

3712
02:11:22,238 --> 02:11:26,799
is out now what are you thinking here do

3713
02:11:24,319 --> 02:11:30,799
you think you won the match

3714
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:32,719
i i thought i won the match a minute ago

3715
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:34,880
i remember thinking to myself like if

3716
02:11:32,719 --> 02:11:36,319
this goes to the flags

3717
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:39,440
i won

3718
02:11:36,319 --> 02:11:40,880
no doubt in my mind

3719
02:11:39,439 --> 02:11:43,118
because

3720
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:44,639
i felt like the whole time like i was

3721
02:11:43,118 --> 02:11:47,839
going to him

3722
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:49,760
yeah right he was never coming at me

3723
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:51,119
yeah that's the way it felt

3724
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:52,239
i think like

3725
02:11:51,118 --> 02:11:54,000
that's the way it felt body

3726
02:11:52,238 --> 02:11:55,839
language-wise just the intensity how

3727
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:59,118
fast you're moving towards him you're

3728
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:59,119
constantly going for throws

3729
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:04,158
now if you want to rewind that we can

3730
02:12:02,479 --> 02:12:06,879
talk about the whole because it's a part

3731
02:12:04,158 --> 02:12:10,559
of this clip so wait wait a minute uh

3732
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:12,719
they all went blue they did so in judo

3733
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:14,719
there's three referees two on the side

3734
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:16,319
one in the center and they all vote and

3735
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:18,639
now let's pause it right there now the

3736
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:21,759
way this is supposed to work they raise

3737
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:23,440
their flags they do like a one two count

3738
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:26,480
and then on three they all raise it

3739
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:28,158
together yeah now as a little pretext to

3740
02:12:26,479 --> 02:12:29,839
this entire match

3741
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:32,479
up until this point

3742
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:34,719
not one match at the olympic games has

3743
02:12:32,479 --> 02:12:37,359
ever been a split decision

3744
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:39,279
meaning out of three people

3745
02:12:37,359 --> 02:12:41,118
not one of them voted against the other

3746
02:12:39,279 --> 02:12:43,279
group members

3747
02:12:41,118 --> 02:12:47,279
so they were all unified blue or all

3748
02:12:43,279 --> 02:12:50,479
unified white yeah right which is um

3749
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:52,479
statistically difficult to imagine yes

3750
02:12:50,479 --> 02:12:54,638
it's almost like the they had a referee

3751
02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:58,078
meeting and said um it's better for the

3752
02:12:54,639 --> 02:13:00,000
olympics to never have a split yeah

3753
02:12:58,078 --> 02:13:02,719
okay

3754
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:06,399
so the question becomes

3755
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:08,000
if you click that frame by frame

3756
02:13:06,399 --> 02:13:09,759
right

3757
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,599
so right now we have all the refs with

3758
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:14,320
their flags out

3759
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:15,360
and then click that so the middle middle

3760
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:18,000
guy is

3761
02:13:15,359 --> 02:13:20,158
he is all the way up all the way up the

3762
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,520
other side judges haven't moved

3763
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:25,679
we now have one side raft all the way up

3764
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:28,400
then we have a third side ref

3765
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:28,399
all the way up

3766
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:33,199
yeah so there there's a the time point

3767
02:13:31,359 --> 02:13:35,759
when the middle guy has the flag all the

3768
02:13:33,198 --> 02:13:37,759
way up if not 80 90 of the way there

3769
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:39,679
yeah then the other one does

3770
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:43,280
and then the third one goes

3771
02:13:39,679 --> 02:13:44,560
uh so now the question becomes who

3772
02:13:43,279 --> 02:13:46,559
really

3773
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:48,960
like did the outside refs really have an

3774
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,960
opinion

3775
02:13:49,118 --> 02:13:54,319
or were they told

3776
02:13:51,439 --> 02:13:55,839
to wait for the center one to start

3777
02:13:54,319 --> 02:13:59,279
and then

3778
02:13:55,840 --> 02:14:01,840
lift whatever flag the center ref picked

3779
02:13:59,279 --> 02:14:03,519
yeah this is very unfortunate because

3780
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:05,119
it's very honestly it's very possible

3781
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:06,000
that they had this meeting

3782
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:08,078
um

3783
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,118
this this is the problem with

3784
02:14:08,078 --> 02:14:11,039
the

3785
02:14:09,118 --> 02:14:13,039
the olympics they sometimes

3786
02:14:11,039 --> 02:14:15,279
it's also the problem in the soviet

3787
02:14:13,039 --> 02:14:16,319
union with communism you think the the

3788
02:14:15,279 --> 02:14:18,158
committee

3789
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:19,920
knows what's good for the people and so

3790
02:14:18,158 --> 02:14:21,519
on so they decide

3791
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:24,078
universally as opposed to letting the

3792
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:27,599
magic of the olympics

3793
02:14:24,078 --> 02:14:29,840
be what it is but nevertheless

3794
02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:31,119
the in this case the center ref decided

3795
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:32,880
blue

3796
02:14:31,118 --> 02:14:35,519
like what do you think

3797
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:36,480
do you think it's just a shitty call or

3798
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:39,199
like

3799
02:14:36,479 --> 02:14:40,638
he has the right to pick but yeah the

3800
02:14:39,198 --> 02:14:43,439
problem is is

3801
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:44,880
the other two i don't think did

3802
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:47,279
yeah so

3803
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:48,719
and then so when you do this frame by

3804
02:14:47,279 --> 02:14:49,840
frame again

3805
02:14:48,719 --> 02:14:52,399
right

3806
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:56,560
like i can see from my own perspective

3807
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:58,799
two of the refs and i see them both blue

3808
02:14:56,560 --> 02:15:01,520
right so when you fast forward that a

3809
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:04,320
little bit to get to like all the flags

3810
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:06,079
i see the two go blue and i go

3811
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:07,359
i look over and i look at the other guy

3812
02:15:06,078 --> 02:15:08,399
and i'm like

3813
02:15:07,359 --> 02:15:10,559
really

3814
02:15:08,399 --> 02:15:12,638
yeah all three

3815
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:14,320
i fought for eight minutes and i can't

3816
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:15,679
even get a vote i didn't even get a

3817
02:15:14,319 --> 02:15:17,599
penalty

3818
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:20,560
i can't even get a vote

3819
02:15:17,599 --> 02:15:20,560
and that's when i broke

3820
02:15:21,359 --> 02:15:25,839
i like oh

3821
02:15:23,279 --> 02:15:27,439
i couldn't believe it

3822
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:30,319
and i'm not going to lie

3823
02:15:27,439 --> 02:15:30,319
he looks shocked

3824
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:36,560
and here you're on your knees

3825
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:38,078
you're crying literally you're right

3826
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:39,920
this is it yeah

3827
02:15:38,078 --> 02:15:42,799
but i think it's the end amazing match

3828
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:44,719
that was such a war

3829
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:47,679
i mean both people can't believe what

3830
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:49,599
happened i know that's the and like

3831
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:51,840
honestly i wish we had the rules that we

3832
02:15:49,599 --> 02:15:52,880
do today as far as the unlimited golden

3833
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:55,039
score

3834
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:56,400
because

3835
02:15:55,039 --> 02:15:58,158
i would have loved to have seen what

3836
02:15:56,399 --> 02:16:00,158
would have happened what was jimmy

3837
02:15:58,158 --> 02:16:03,039
saying here to you i mean i guess

3838
02:16:00,158 --> 02:16:03,039
there's nothing to say

3839
02:16:03,198 --> 02:16:06,879
yeah he

3840
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:09,039
he was kind of apologizing for the way

3841
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:09,039
the

3842
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:14,639
the scores went because he knows how

3843
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:17,118
badly you want it he saw the match and

3844
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:19,440
he felt i deserved to win it yeah based

3845
02:16:17,118 --> 02:16:21,198
on like you know what happened but he

3846
02:16:19,439 --> 02:16:24,238
probably with all his experience knows

3847
02:16:21,198 --> 02:16:26,399
that this is what the olympics are about

3848
02:16:24,238 --> 02:16:28,879
the refs sometimes yep i mean that's the

3849
02:16:26,399 --> 02:16:31,198
magic of it man well and at the same

3850
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:34,000
time we're at

3851
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:36,239
we're in the olympic semi-final

3852
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,679
in a sport that's dominated by certain

3853
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:39,280
continents

3854
02:16:37,679 --> 02:16:40,318
and when you look at the three refs on

3855
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:42,800
the mat

3856
02:16:40,318 --> 02:16:44,239
they're all european

3857
02:16:42,799 --> 02:16:46,558
yeah you're telling me there couldn't

3858
02:16:44,239 --> 02:16:47,840
have been one pan am one african one

3859
02:16:46,558 --> 02:16:49,679
oceana

3860
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:51,280
you know different

3861
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:53,120
like why'd they all have to be european

3862
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:55,840
but to be fair

3863
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:58,000
it's a back to your sauna story

3864
02:16:55,840 --> 02:17:00,318
you've dealt with this stuff before and

3865
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:02,558
and you've won over this stuff before

3866
02:17:00,318 --> 02:17:05,199
and that's why like i was broken and you

3867
02:17:02,558 --> 02:17:08,000
thought you won here those

3868
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:09,920
and when i hindered on that for

3869
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:12,959
a year and a half like i couldn't even

3870
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:12,960
stand i was done

3871
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:16,239
but i'm pretty sure there's a

3872
02:17:14,398 --> 02:17:19,439
slow-motion replay on this when i watch

3873
02:17:16,239 --> 02:17:21,679
that he's all excited that [ __ ] guy

3874
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:23,439
and he's all happy he's released

3875
02:17:21,679 --> 02:17:25,840
hey hi guys

3876
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:29,120
i did it

3877
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:30,719
yeah so here's like

3878
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:32,800
slow motion

3879
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:34,718
replay of the flags being raised the

3880
02:17:32,799 --> 02:17:36,718
heart being broken travis just spending

3881
02:17:34,718 --> 02:17:37,598
over right here watch watch his reaction

3882
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:39,358
like

3883
02:17:37,599 --> 02:17:42,318
he like you could see his mouth like

3884
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:44,479
open and ah like yeah really yeah and

3885
02:17:42,318 --> 02:17:46,159
he's looking at two refs just like i am

3886
02:17:44,478 --> 02:17:48,959
he didn't celebrate until he looked at

3887
02:17:46,159 --> 02:17:51,679
the third one and said oh all three

3888
02:17:48,959 --> 02:17:53,119
so you think he knew i think in his head

3889
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:55,040
like

3890
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:57,120
i don't think he really believed he was

3891
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:58,399
winning he did it enough to win yeah

3892
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:01,760
yeah

3893
02:17:58,398 --> 02:18:01,760
because when his mouth dropped like

3894
02:18:02,318 --> 02:18:07,279
oh yeah hey all three like that's not

3895
02:18:04,959 --> 02:18:10,959
really the reaction you would give

3896
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:12,639
yeah i mean that was uh that's one of

3897
02:18:10,959 --> 02:18:15,279
the greatest matches i've ever seen i

3898
02:18:12,638 --> 02:18:16,879
mean obviously it's painful for you but

3899
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:19,840
that pain

3900
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:21,679
first of all sets the stage for uh 2016

3901
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:24,639
but even without that

3902
02:18:21,679 --> 02:18:27,040
i think it was just a beautiful story at

3903
02:18:24,638 --> 02:18:28,879
the olympics you've still did incredible

3904
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,080
job at that olympics you stood

3905
02:18:28,879 --> 02:18:31,839
toe-to-toe

3906
02:18:30,079 --> 02:18:34,879
i think

3907
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:37,599
in in hindsight having

3908
02:18:34,879 --> 02:18:39,358
lost that match did more for me and more

3909
02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:40,318
for the sport

3910
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:43,359
yeah

3911
02:18:40,318 --> 02:18:45,519
as a whole me losing that match yeah

3912
02:18:43,359 --> 02:18:47,920
i mean stories aren't about

3913
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:51,599
winning stories are about the fighting

3914
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:55,280
so and that made one hell of a story but

3915
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:56,318
it it also has to do with

3916
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:58,559
you know

3917
02:18:56,318 --> 02:19:00,718
treachery is probably not the right word

3918
02:18:58,558 --> 02:19:03,920
to use it's probably the

3919
02:19:00,718 --> 02:19:06,398
wrong word entirely to use but

3920
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:08,719
because of the conflict in the match

3921
02:19:06,398 --> 02:19:11,039
and because of how the refs

3922
02:19:08,718 --> 02:19:13,678
handled the match there at the end

3923
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:15,439
it created controversy that was spoken

3924
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:17,760
about for

3925
02:19:15,439 --> 02:19:20,000
months on world media

3926
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:21,920
right i remember articles being written

3927
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,519
about the olympics and

3928
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:26,000
you know the reffing and how it was

3929
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:27,840
corrupt and that match was

3930
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:29,439
one of them there was another one in

3931
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:33,599
fencing where like something happened

3932
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:35,200
with the timer where one of the fencers

3933
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:36,558
i guess what happens in fencing the

3934
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:38,559
timer

3935
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:41,438
resets up a second

3936
02:19:38,558 --> 02:19:44,398
if it's down so the fencer got one

3937
02:19:41,439 --> 02:19:45,519
second played out i think like 27 or 28

3938
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:48,719
times

3939
02:19:45,519 --> 02:19:51,359
and then one on like 30. so like there

3940
02:19:48,719 --> 02:19:52,799
was like clock fixing for fencing there

3941
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:54,720
was this match

3942
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:58,398
that i think just got publicity good or

3943
02:19:54,719 --> 02:20:00,639
bad publicity is publicity for judo

3944
02:19:58,398 --> 02:20:02,318
and then you came back

3945
02:20:00,639 --> 02:20:04,079
to uh i mean this is the hard thing

3946
02:20:02,318 --> 02:20:06,000
after this hard break to step up and

3947
02:20:04,079 --> 02:20:08,959
continue fighting right

3948
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:12,959
i really really struggled

3949
02:20:08,959 --> 02:20:16,000
like unbelievably struggled from 2012 to

3950
02:20:12,959 --> 02:20:17,759
like 2014. i almost quit numerous times

3951
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,439
i was so angry

3952
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:22,318
i mean at one point

3953
02:20:19,439 --> 02:20:24,000
i got so mad at the ijf feeling like

3954
02:20:22,318 --> 02:20:26,959
they were [ __ ] me every step of the

3955
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,478
way i threw a water bottle at a referee

3956
02:20:26,959 --> 02:20:30,478
after a match

3957
02:20:28,478 --> 02:20:33,279
i cussed out a referee one time on a mat

3958
02:20:30,478 --> 02:20:35,199
i got suspended from the sport because

3959
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:38,079
i was just so angry at that point in

3960
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:40,159
time and uh igf is the international

3961
02:20:38,079 --> 02:20:41,520
judo federation and they're are they the

3962
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:43,039
people that supply the referees

3963
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:44,800
basically like the they're kind of

3964
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:47,120
getting run the sport they're on global

3965
02:20:44,799 --> 02:20:47,119
scale

3966
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:49,359
so

3967
02:20:48,478 --> 02:20:52,719
uh

3968
02:20:49,359 --> 02:20:55,040
you sent a few emails 2014 15

3969
02:20:52,719 --> 02:20:57,119
uh basically quitting one of them said

3970
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:59,520
i'm mentally and physically broken

3971
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:00,319
another said with a subject line i'm

3972
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:03,579
done

3973
02:21:00,318 --> 02:21:05,600
yep the weight cuts didn't break you no

3974
02:21:03,579 --> 02:21:07,439
[Laughter]

3975
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:09,359
so if this broke you you were really

3976
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:10,800
going through a hard time

3977
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:12,559
i was like you know what

3978
02:21:10,799 --> 02:21:14,079
we're just gonna like dumb it down a

3979
02:21:12,559 --> 02:21:16,478
little bit and get some wins under our

3980
02:21:14,079 --> 02:21:19,520
belt i'm gonna go to a world cup which

3981
02:21:16,478 --> 02:21:21,199
is like three stages down or four stages

3982
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:23,359
down from like

3983
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:25,359
the olympic games like this should be

3984
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:27,040
like a cake walk like making the final

3985
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:28,479
of a world cup should be a walk in the

3986
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:30,080
park

3987
02:21:28,478 --> 02:21:34,159
i show up

3988
02:21:30,079 --> 02:21:35,680
i barely beat a 16 year old kid

3989
02:21:34,159 --> 02:21:37,760
barely

3990
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:40,079
then i got smoked in the second round i

3991
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:42,880
got thrown three times

3992
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:45,039
i was like i'm [ __ ] done they changed

3993
02:21:42,879 --> 02:21:47,199
all the [ __ ] rules they [ __ ] me out

3994
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:49,359
of the olympics like

3995
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:51,120
what am i supposed to do

3996
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:52,399
and it was at that moment when i wrote

3997
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,520
the email

3998
02:21:52,398 --> 02:21:55,599
where

3999
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:57,040
i remember sitting at a bar i don't

4000
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:58,079
drink by the way but i was sitting at a

4001
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:01,760
bar

4002
02:21:58,079 --> 02:22:03,920
um at the hotel sending this email

4003
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:05,520
and i got a response back from jimmy and

4004
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:07,760
he goes well just

4005
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:09,920
just stay for the training camp go to

4006
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:11,359
germany and then whatever happens don't

4007
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:12,239
worry about it we'll talk when you get

4008
02:22:11,359 --> 02:22:15,040
home

4009
02:22:12,239 --> 02:22:16,799
i was like [ __ ] that [ __ ] these people

4010
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:18,080
[ __ ] the rules i don't [ __ ] care

4011
02:22:16,799 --> 02:22:20,239
anymore i'm just going to do judo the

4012
02:22:18,079 --> 02:22:22,719
way i want to do judo if i [ __ ] get

4013
02:22:20,239 --> 02:22:24,719
[ __ ] out [ __ ] them

4014
02:22:22,719 --> 02:22:26,799
that was my response

4015
02:22:24,719 --> 02:22:28,478
can you become an olympic champion

4016
02:22:26,799 --> 02:22:29,920
can you become an olympic medalist with

4017
02:22:28,478 --> 02:22:31,039
that kind of thinking you think or no

4018
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:33,680
was that

4019
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:35,600
that's counterproductive yeah okay

4020
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:37,600
just checking because

4021
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:39,439
maybe that's also liberating

4022
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:41,040
the expectation was no longer that

4023
02:22:39,439 --> 02:22:43,280
travis is going to win this tournament

4024
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:44,560
the expectation was travis is going to

4025
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:45,840
come home and be [ __ ] pissed off

4026
02:22:44,559 --> 02:22:47,039
we're going to have to figure out how to

4027
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:48,799
manage

4028
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:50,800
a pissed off person that's trying to

4029
02:22:48,799 --> 02:22:52,719
quit that shouldn't be quitting

4030
02:22:50,799 --> 02:22:54,959
and the people still believe that you

4031
02:22:52,719 --> 02:22:57,199
can be a medalist again yeah like who

4032
02:22:54,959 --> 02:22:59,119
believed that jimmy believed it the team

4033
02:22:57,200 --> 02:23:01,520
managers believed it some of my

4034
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:03,600
teammates still believed it

4035
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:05,280
my training partner still did but

4036
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:06,960
they're not the ones that are

4037
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:08,479
cutting the weight

4038
02:23:06,959 --> 02:23:09,919
flying around

4039
02:23:08,478 --> 02:23:12,000
feeling like

4040
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:14,318
you know all of your judo is now null

4041
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:16,879
and void right because at this point

4042
02:23:14,318 --> 02:23:19,359
they took away leg grabs entirely

4043
02:23:16,879 --> 02:23:23,199
you couldn't break a grip with two hands

4044
02:23:19,359 --> 02:23:24,479
right the meta of judo has changed again

4045
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:26,479
right so

4046
02:23:24,478 --> 02:23:28,879
i got [ __ ] out of it they took away

4047
02:23:26,478 --> 02:23:30,639
how i did judo again and now it just got

4048
02:23:28,879 --> 02:23:31,438
more difficult

4049
02:23:30,639 --> 02:23:32,959
so

4050
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:34,559
when i'm sitting in the hotel and i'm

4051
02:23:32,959 --> 02:23:36,239
sending this email

4052
02:23:34,559 --> 02:23:38,000
i remember being at the training camp

4053
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:39,280
like

4054
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,639
i was like i don't even [ __ ] care

4055
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:42,159
what the rules are i'm just gonna

4056
02:23:40,639 --> 02:23:43,840
[ __ ] throw people i don't even care

4057
02:23:42,159 --> 02:23:45,680
if i'm cheating it doesn't matter to me

4058
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:46,398
i'll just play stupid yeah

4059
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:48,159
right

4060
02:23:46,398 --> 02:23:50,478
so i just started going back and doing

4061
02:23:48,159 --> 02:23:52,959
judo without the leg grabs but with all

4062
02:23:50,478 --> 02:23:54,239
the same gripping that i was doing

4063
02:23:52,959 --> 02:23:56,559
beforehand

4064
02:23:54,239 --> 02:23:57,359
and then when i got to germany i was

4065
02:23:56,559 --> 02:23:59,680
like

4066
02:23:57,359 --> 02:24:01,920
i don't [ __ ] care i was like if i

4067
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:04,479
gotta cheat to win then i gotta [ __ ]

4068
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:06,559
cheat to win if i get cheetoed out like

4069
02:24:04,478 --> 02:24:08,879
then i get cheetoed out and i won

4070
02:24:06,559 --> 02:24:11,279
germany

4071
02:24:08,879 --> 02:24:13,679
uh which event in germany the german

4072
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:16,159
grand prix which is grand prix yeah a

4073
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:18,880
week after losing the world cup because

4074
02:24:16,159 --> 02:24:20,159
i was trying to do judo around the new

4075
02:24:18,879 --> 02:24:22,879
rule set

4076
02:24:20,159 --> 02:24:24,000
i wasn't just trying to do judo

4077
02:24:22,879 --> 02:24:25,759
right because when you get to the

4078
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:29,840
highest level

4079
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:29,840
your game tends to morph around

4080
02:24:30,079 --> 02:24:32,879
you know what can you can or cannot get

4081
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:34,880
away with

4082
02:24:32,879 --> 02:24:36,879
i was more focused on trying to figure

4083
02:24:34,879 --> 02:24:39,920
out what i can and can't get away with

4084
02:24:36,879 --> 02:24:41,920
and i stopped actively doing judo

4085
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:43,359
once i said [ __ ] whatever the rule

4086
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:45,280
changes are i'm just going to keep doing

4087
02:24:43,359 --> 02:24:48,079
judo the way i know how to do judo and

4088
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:50,159
if i get a penalty then so be it

4089
02:24:48,079 --> 02:24:52,318
and so that that win

4090
02:24:50,159 --> 02:24:54,239
that started the road back it wrote back

4091
02:24:52,318 --> 02:24:56,799
yeah

4092
02:24:54,239 --> 02:24:58,799
because now it's like i don't care if

4093
02:24:56,799 --> 02:25:00,799
you penalize me or not because

4094
02:24:58,799 --> 02:25:02,318
i'm going to throw that guy anyways i'm

4095
02:25:00,799 --> 02:25:04,239
going to beat him anyways

4096
02:25:02,318 --> 02:25:05,199
and if i get a shito for doing something

4097
02:25:04,239 --> 02:25:07,439
wrong

4098
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:08,880
then i'll just stop doing that one thing

4099
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:10,239
and just keep doing all the other things

4100
02:25:08,879 --> 02:25:11,599
that they told me i probably shouldn't

4101
02:25:10,239 --> 02:25:14,799
be doing but they're not calling me on

4102
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:14,800
it so i'm just going to keep doing it

4103
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:18,720
well

4104
02:25:16,079 --> 02:25:21,439
you uh

4105
02:25:18,719 --> 02:25:23,438
you found yourself at the 2016 olympics

4106
02:25:21,439 --> 02:25:27,040
was that ever a doubt by the way after

4107
02:25:23,439 --> 02:25:28,720
this after 2014 in germany

4108
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:31,680
i had a lot of doubt after the

4109
02:25:28,719 --> 02:25:33,279
concussion in 2015.

4110
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:36,000
i remember

4111
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:37,040
when i first came back after four months

4112
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,040
of

4113
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:41,359
nothingness that like

4114
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:43,040
even trying to like train

4115
02:25:41,359 --> 02:25:44,559
the room would start to like tilt the

4116
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:46,160
world on me

4117
02:25:44,559 --> 02:25:47,680
and then when i finally got over that

4118
02:25:46,159 --> 02:25:49,280
and i could start doing things again i

4119
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:52,720
stepped on the mat

4120
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:54,800
for the pan ams and i was like

4121
02:25:52,719 --> 02:25:56,799
drowning's not the right word but like

4122
02:25:54,799 --> 02:25:59,438
everything was being done in such a slow

4123
02:25:56,799 --> 02:26:02,719
motion like i had sandbags everywhere

4124
02:25:59,439 --> 02:26:04,398
that like i just couldn't keep up

4125
02:26:02,719 --> 02:26:06,000
like mental fog

4126
02:26:04,398 --> 02:26:07,920
yeah like i remember fighting the

4127
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,398
brazilian for

4128
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:12,079
in the semi-final of pan ams

4129
02:26:10,398 --> 02:26:13,519
i was halfway through this match i'm

4130
02:26:12,079 --> 02:26:15,359
just like

4131
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:17,280
my eyes roll up i'm like i'm just gonna

4132
02:26:15,359 --> 02:26:18,800
[ __ ] wing it i just [ __ ] winged it

4133
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:21,120
and i got countered and thrown free pawn

4134
02:26:18,799 --> 02:26:24,239
and i was like i don't even know what to

4135
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:25,760
do and i couldn't even think clearly

4136
02:26:24,239 --> 02:26:27,439
and that's when i was like

4137
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:29,520
i may not come back

4138
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:30,880
yeah you don't have control over how to

4139
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:34,319
come back from this it's like it's just

4140
02:26:30,879 --> 02:26:36,239
your mind it's not just not operating

4141
02:26:34,318 --> 02:26:37,840
i can like oh my right hand's not

4142
02:26:36,239 --> 02:26:39,280
working because it's fractured let me

4143
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:42,079
figure out a way i cannot use that like

4144
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:44,319
when your mind's not working like

4145
02:26:42,079 --> 02:26:46,398
it's the one thing you need yeah like

4146
02:26:44,318 --> 02:26:49,039
you gotta have it so i can work through

4147
02:26:46,398 --> 02:26:51,279
anything else i needed that though and

4148
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,960
so how did you come back from that time

4149
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:55,040
that's when i wrote another email and i

4150
02:26:52,959 --> 02:26:57,358
was like i'm [ __ ] off team usa i'm

4151
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:59,760
not [ __ ] i'm not done with usa judo

4152
02:26:57,359 --> 02:27:01,680
i'm done with the tour i was like i quit

4153
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:03,359
i'm gonna go do my own thing

4154
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:05,520
they were like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

4155
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:07,120
can't quit now the olympics is in like a

4156
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:08,399
year like let's talk about this again

4157
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:10,160
because it's the second time i've tried

4158
02:27:08,398 --> 02:27:12,159
to quit in like two years

4159
02:27:10,159 --> 02:27:13,840
right

4160
02:27:12,159 --> 02:27:16,079
so then we sit down in jimmy's office

4161
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:18,079
and he's like whoa whoa whoa you can't

4162
02:27:16,079 --> 02:27:20,000
quit you're gonna kick yourself if you

4163
02:27:18,079 --> 02:27:22,000
don't go to rio i'm telling you right

4164
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,520
now don't do that to yourself

4165
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,799
let's figure out a way of like doing

4166
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:27,439
this and i was like

4167
02:27:24,799 --> 02:27:28,799
because when we trained before we did it

4168
02:27:27,439 --> 02:27:29,920
as a unit

4169
02:27:28,799 --> 02:27:31,199
right we all went to the same

4170
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:33,200
tournaments we all went to the same

4171
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:34,960
training camps and i'm like you guys are

4172
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,120
treating me like i'm the same player i

4173
02:27:34,959 --> 02:27:39,119
used to be i go i don't

4174
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:41,359
i'm not operating at the level you think

4175
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:43,680
i'm operating at i go i can't do that

4176
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:45,600
and he goes well what do you want to do

4177
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:47,760
and i'll tell you what jimmy you know

4178
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:48,800
i'm being serious because my answer is

4179
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:50,800
something you'd never would have

4180
02:27:48,799 --> 02:27:52,478
expected i go i want you to send me to

4181
02:27:50,799 --> 02:27:53,840
japan for three weeks

4182
02:27:52,478 --> 02:27:56,719
and he was like

4183
02:27:53,840 --> 02:27:59,120
really i hated japan i refused to go

4184
02:27:56,719 --> 02:28:01,358
there up until this point

4185
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:04,000
but i was like i have to get to a point

4186
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:05,600
where i can get so tired

4187
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:08,079
and get through it

4188
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:10,318
that like my judo will come back and my

4189
02:28:08,079 --> 02:28:11,920
body will learn again

4190
02:28:10,318 --> 02:28:13,920
and when you say japan you meet the

4191
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:15,680
kodokan like what

4192
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:16,639
tokai that is that the highest level of

4193
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:18,079
judo

4194
02:28:16,639 --> 02:28:19,760
it's one of the top colleges in the

4195
02:28:18,079 --> 02:28:21,600
world yeah and that's so you can go with

4196
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:24,000
the best people in the world you can go

4197
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:26,239
to war with them top level like strong

4198
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:28,159
players yeah there's a lot of very

4199
02:28:26,239 --> 02:28:30,318
strong players there's a lot of middle

4200
02:28:28,159 --> 02:28:32,000
class players and there's a lot of

4201
02:28:30,318 --> 02:28:34,159
volume of rounds

4202
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,760
so you value all of it the middle class

4203
02:28:34,159 --> 02:28:38,398
too like that because when you're tired

4204
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:39,600
like you can't just train in areas where

4205
02:28:38,398 --> 02:28:42,079
you're

4206
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:45,600
you're battling for every inch at some

4207
02:28:42,079 --> 02:28:48,000
point you have to be successful

4208
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:49,520
right so you still under duress and

4209
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,920
under strain and

4210
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:53,840
through exhaustion you still have to

4211
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:55,120
have the ability to score yeah well if

4212
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:56,639
you're training with the best people in

4213
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:58,640
the world all the time you're not always

4214
02:28:56,639 --> 02:29:01,358
going to be able to score so you still

4215
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:03,760
need those b level players in order to

4216
02:29:01,359 --> 02:29:05,520
really develop again

4217
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:07,760
what is it like if you can comment

4218
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:09,760
briefly on

4219
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:11,520
training in japan what's it like to go

4220
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:12,960
into a different place

4221
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:14,399
you probably don't speak the language

4222
02:29:12,959 --> 02:29:16,719
that well

4223
02:29:14,398 --> 02:29:19,840
um like is there an isolation aspect to

4224
02:29:16,719 --> 02:29:22,159
it is it like purely about judo now

4225
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:24,559
i really wanted to be isolated no

4226
02:29:22,159 --> 02:29:26,959
training partners no coaches

4227
02:29:24,559 --> 02:29:30,079
i wanted to get back to my roots and

4228
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:31,599
just learn how to fight again

4229
02:29:30,079 --> 02:29:35,520
i don't want to figure out how to beat

4230
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:37,760
the german i don't want to figure out

4231
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:39,359
how i can develop a new entry into my

4232
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:40,239
sail against

4233
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:42,239
you know

4234
02:29:40,239 --> 02:29:43,840
whoever it may be it's not you're just

4235
02:29:42,239 --> 02:29:45,439
i'm going to fight hard

4236
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:46,799
let me get back to fighting let me get

4237
02:29:45,439 --> 02:29:48,960
back to like

4238
02:29:46,799 --> 02:29:50,959
the root of who i am what were those

4239
02:29:48,959 --> 02:29:52,478
sessions like what we were talking about

4240
02:29:50,959 --> 02:29:54,879

4241
02:29:52,478 --> 02:29:58,719
many six six minute rounds 30-minute

every day

4248
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:17,200
five five days a week and then 11 or 12

4249
02:30:14,959 --> 02:30:19,519
rounds on saturday

4250
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:21,840
plus weightlifting plus running

4251
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:24,000
plus weightlifting plus running so that

4252
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:25,840
those are hard rounds yeah what's it

4253
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:29,120
feel like to go through that so you have

4254
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:30,880
a bunch of uh just a sea of black belts

4255
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:32,640
japan

4256
02:30:30,879 --> 02:30:33,599
um i'm sure they're hunting you a little

4257
02:30:32,639 --> 02:30:36,000
bit

4258
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:37,600
depending on who you are i was hunted a

4259
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,760
little bit like i didn't really struggle

4260
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:41,760
because of who i am

4261
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:44,239
them as college athletes

4262
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:47,040
they want to show to their coaches and

4263
02:30:44,239 --> 02:30:48,879
their you know higher players like

4264
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:49,920
oh look i can throw the world number

4265
02:30:48,879 --> 02:30:52,079
whoever

4266
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:53,760
but if you're just a guy who shows up

4267
02:30:52,079 --> 02:30:55,520
like

4268
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:58,398
them beating you doesn't provide any

4269
02:30:55,520 --> 02:31:00,800
value or raise their status no but your

4270
02:30:58,398 --> 02:31:03,279
your status raising yes

4271
02:31:00,799 --> 02:31:05,679
so i was actually like

4272
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:06,479
in a situation where nobody was watching

4273
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:08,479
me

4274
02:31:06,478 --> 02:31:10,079
and i was free to just battle at my own

4275
02:31:08,478 --> 02:31:12,478
will okay

4276
02:31:10,079 --> 02:31:14,478
which is what it was about for me

4277
02:31:12,478 --> 02:31:16,478
and you just pushed yourself because i

4278
02:31:14,478 --> 02:31:17,760
knew how to do that i know how to push

4279
02:31:16,478 --> 02:31:19,438
myself

4280
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:21,840
are you uh when you're doing these 14

4281
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:24,239
rounds is every single one

4282
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:26,398
a standalone thing for you yep so you're

4283
02:31:24,239 --> 02:31:28,799
not trying to pace yourself nope it's

4284
02:31:26,398 --> 02:31:30,719
just each one as to as much exhaustion

4285
02:31:28,799 --> 02:31:33,119
as i can get but then there must be ones

4286
02:31:30,719 --> 02:31:35,119
that were like it's like ground nine

4287
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:36,479
where you're got nothing left better

4288
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:38,000
figure out how to score

4289
02:31:36,478 --> 02:31:41,358
it's all you got to do

4290
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:43,120
you got to survive you gotta score

4291
02:31:41,359 --> 02:31:45,600
what's your memories of that of those

4292
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:46,560
three weeks what's like what stands out

4293
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:48,479
to you

4294
02:31:46,559 --> 02:31:49,840
it seems like um

4295
02:31:48,478 --> 02:31:53,199
because that's the place where you found

4296
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:53,200
the silver medal yep

4297
02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:57,359
because it's the place most people don't

4298
02:31:54,959 --> 02:31:59,199
want to be

4299
02:31:57,359 --> 02:32:01,040
everybody's comfortable

4300
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:03,040
i would rather

4301
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:05,359
i would rather find out who i am and

4302
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:08,240
what i'm made of and find those

4303
02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:09,200
those endpoints and if i can't find them

4304
02:32:08,239 --> 02:32:10,879
then

4305
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:13,439
that means everybody else has given up

4306
02:32:10,879 --> 02:32:13,438
before me

4307
02:32:14,239 --> 02:32:19,119
were there a few people that just kind

4308
02:32:16,719 --> 02:32:22,840
of you returned to battle over and over

4309
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:25,760
in those times and then it was just

4310
02:32:22,840 --> 02:32:28,478
yep no social media

4311
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:30,800
no none of that it's just like to

4312
02:32:28,478 --> 02:32:32,398
lock yourself in your room you come back

4313
02:32:30,799 --> 02:32:33,920
you've thought about it

4314
02:32:32,398 --> 02:32:35,358
and you come back with a game plan for

4315
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:37,680
that day

4316
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:38,399
against some players here or there and i

4317
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:40,639
would

4318
02:32:38,398 --> 02:32:42,478
i would develop a hit list

4319
02:32:40,639 --> 02:32:44,719
like i would be like oh that that

4320
02:32:42,478 --> 02:32:46,318
[ __ ] grabbed me at like 13 and i

4321
02:32:44,719 --> 02:32:48,159
watched him sit [ __ ] four rounds and

4322
02:32:46,318 --> 02:32:49,439
then come try to kick the shot at me i'm

4323
02:32:48,159 --> 02:32:51,439
gonna [ __ ] grab that guy early and

4324
02:32:49,439 --> 02:32:53,359
i'm gonna beat the [ __ ] at him

4325
02:32:51,439 --> 02:32:55,200
and you just developed that list there's

4326
02:32:53,359 --> 02:32:57,439
probably some epic battles in that room

4327
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:59,520
right yeah

4328
02:32:57,439 --> 02:33:00,960
uh what's it look like like how crowded

4329
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:02,560
is it very

4330
02:33:00,959 --> 02:33:04,959
and so you're just like

4331
02:33:02,559 --> 02:33:06,079
yeah it's a sea of people see a people

4332
02:33:04,959 --> 02:33:07,759
and you're trying to are you doing

4333
02:33:06,079 --> 02:33:09,600
groundwork at all just throws just

4334
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:11,200
throws your throws no transitions no

4335
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:13,040
nothing but if i get pissed off and like

4336
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:14,960
you keep dropping or like not let me do

4337
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:16,560
what i want to do i'll rip a choke right

4338
02:33:14,959 --> 02:33:17,919
across your face yeah just to let you

4339
02:33:16,559 --> 02:33:19,279
know that like

4340
02:33:17,920 --> 02:33:22,799
yeah and if i wanted to you have a

4341
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:24,800
really nice style of just like

4342
02:33:22,799 --> 02:33:26,799
respectfully

4343
02:33:24,799 --> 02:33:28,639
bullying the [ __ ] out of people because

4344
02:33:26,799 --> 02:33:30,959
some people call me a bully and i have

4345
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:33,119
to remind them that like

4346
02:33:30,959 --> 02:33:35,919
a bully enjoys like

4347
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:37,840
beating up the weak right i want to beat

4348
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:40,000
the person that fights back

4349
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:41,760
right exactly it's not fun for me if you

4350
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:43,760
don't fight back right

4351
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:46,478
some of the greatest people i've seen

4352
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:48,159
like do this they they basically

4353
02:33:46,478 --> 02:33:49,519
you have this in the iowa wrestling

4354
02:33:48,159 --> 02:33:51,520
rooms they'll push each other into the

4355
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:53,439
wall like they get there's like anger

4356
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:55,600
but it's ultimately underneath it all

4357
02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:57,840
it's like a deep respect i was training

4358
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:59,280
with colton brown one time and i went to

4359
02:33:57,840 --> 02:34:01,280
san jose state because i was in

4360
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:03,520
california for something

4361
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:04,319
and he kept like he kept circling to the

4362
02:34:03,520 --> 02:34:06,319
edge

4363
02:34:04,318 --> 02:34:08,079
they had like a cupboard that had like

4364
02:34:06,318 --> 02:34:09,519
when you opened it it had like all the

4365
02:34:08,079 --> 02:34:11,039
tape and like medical supplies i was

4366
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:12,880
like we'll [ __ ] put you right through

4367
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:14,399
that and he kind of lit he kind of

4368
02:34:12,879 --> 02:34:15,679
giggled and then he went by that edge

4369
02:34:14,398 --> 02:34:17,840
and i [ __ ] ran them right through it

4370
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:20,559
yeah see to me that's an ultimate sign

4371
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:22,719
of respect that both you and colton will

4372
02:34:20,559 --> 02:34:24,239
remember well and we're still friends we

4373
02:34:22,719 --> 02:34:25,840
still talk it's just i told him i was

4374
02:34:24,239 --> 02:34:27,600
going to do it he knew i meant it too

4375
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:30,799
yeah i did it anyways

4376
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:31,760
that was just testing me

4377
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:32,879
uh

4378
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:35,840
yeah

4379
02:34:32,879 --> 02:34:37,839
listen that's and that same attitude was

4380
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:40,239
that's that was in japan just day after

4381
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:41,920
day after day after day yep 14 rounds

4382
02:34:40,239 --> 02:34:44,398
that's that's rough

4383
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:47,200
uh and you didn't sit out rounds and i

4384
02:34:44,398 --> 02:34:49,279
did it all with a broken hand

4385
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:50,479
uh how

4386
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:52,479
wow

4387
02:34:50,478 --> 02:34:54,959
how did you do it with a broken hand you

4388
02:34:52,478 --> 02:34:57,519
show up every day you show up okay i

4389
02:34:54,959 --> 02:34:59,039
actually went left to right my right

4390
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:01,280
okay so that's okay so you can then

4391
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:02,560
focus on gripping with your left

4392
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:04,479
it's always the way

4393
02:35:02,559 --> 02:35:05,840
there's always a way but that means you

4394
02:35:04,478 --> 02:35:07,358
can't i guess you don't have to grip or

4395
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:10,000
you're right sometimes because i would

4396
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:11,920
palm it with my thumb just like hanging

4397
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,520
out like this just like this so you can

4398
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:15,120
do something so you could do like a

4399
02:35:13,520 --> 02:35:15,920
ghost because you have a

4400
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:17,760
um

4401
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:20,398
because what were your main throws it

4402
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:21,200
was sanagi koshigoroma

4403
02:35:20,398 --> 02:35:23,279
okay

4404
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:25,280
sumi uchimata

4405
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:28,399
but you have this big uh

4406
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:30,640
um like a goshi type of thing like a

4407
02:35:28,398 --> 02:35:32,318
yeah but not from like around the waist

4408
02:35:30,639 --> 02:35:33,840
it's from over the shoulder over the

4409
02:35:32,318 --> 02:35:35,279
shoulder and i can do it with just the

4410
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:38,159
one hand

4411
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:39,760
oh as i wish one hand the right one i

4412
02:35:38,159 --> 02:35:41,600
don't need the sleeve hand you don't

4413
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:44,159
need a sleeve hand but you couldn't do

4414
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:45,520
with the broken hand i could

4415
02:35:44,159 --> 02:35:47,920
because i can just put my hand in the

4416
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:50,239
key so it can't come off

4417
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:51,920
and then you just

4418
02:35:50,239 --> 02:35:53,359
because what happened was

4419
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:54,799
three days before i was leaving for

4420
02:35:53,359 --> 02:35:56,960
japan a guy

4421
02:35:54,799 --> 02:35:58,079
my hand was rested like this on a mat

4422
02:35:56,959 --> 02:36:00,159
and the guy

4423
02:35:58,079 --> 02:36:02,559
boom took my whole thumb off and tore

4424
02:36:00,159 --> 02:36:04,959
all the tendons in the palm yeah so when

4425
02:36:02,559 --> 02:36:06,799
i went to the doctor he was like

4426
02:36:04,959 --> 02:36:08,559
you know do we have to put a cast on and

4427
02:36:06,799 --> 02:36:10,478
i go i'm leaving in three days so you're

4428
02:36:08,559 --> 02:36:12,239
not putting a cast on it and i go this

4429
02:36:10,478 --> 02:36:14,879
is what i want you to do just like this

4430
02:36:12,239 --> 02:36:16,079
i said i want you to build a cast that

4431
02:36:14,879 --> 02:36:18,079
holds it

4432
02:36:16,079 --> 02:36:20,318
that velcros around

4433
02:36:18,079 --> 02:36:22,879
so that when i'm not training i can wear

4434
02:36:20,318 --> 02:36:24,719
it yeah but then when i'm training i'll

4435
02:36:22,879 --> 02:36:28,639
take it off and then i'll put the tape

4436
02:36:24,719 --> 02:36:28,639
on it and then whatever happens happens

4437
02:36:28,959 --> 02:36:33,358
whatever happens

4438
02:36:30,719 --> 02:36:37,039
happens all right so that's epic and

4439
02:36:33,359 --> 02:36:39,520
that led you to the 2016 olympics in rio

4440
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:41,600
well that led me to winning pan am gold

4441
02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:45,600
when i got back from japan and then

4442
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:47,040
almost getting my leg cut off in 2015.

4443
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:49,200
that was like

4444
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:51,520
maybe a month or two later

4445
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:53,920
i was hospitalized for seven days

4446
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:55,439
the leg being cut off for what i had

4447
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:57,840
three different types of bacterial

4448
02:36:55,439 --> 02:36:59,120
infections in my right leg my whole leg

4449
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:02,960
swelled

4450
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:06,720
and it was in my blood skin and in my

4451
02:37:02,959 --> 02:37:06,719
bone in my right leg

4452
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:11,200
um

4453
02:37:08,799 --> 02:37:13,199
so i got stuck at mgh in a hospital for

4454
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:15,840
seven days until they figured out

4455
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:17,840
what the bacteria source was

4456
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:20,318
where was the source of the infection as

4457
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:22,799
in in my knee in the knee yeah

4458
02:37:20,318 --> 02:37:25,359
okay so obviously there's a danger of

4459
02:37:22,799 --> 02:37:26,959
like that's life-threatening yep so when

4460
02:37:25,359 --> 02:37:29,040
i went into the emergency room when i

4461
02:37:26,959 --> 02:37:30,079
got back from the worlds the lady was

4462
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:31,359
like hey

4463
02:37:30,079 --> 02:37:33,680
you need to call you're gonna call

4464
02:37:31,359 --> 02:37:34,720
because you may lose your leg tonight

4465
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:35,840
yeah and then they put me in the

4466
02:37:34,719 --> 02:37:38,000
hospital

4467
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:40,239
what do you think in this whole time

4468
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:42,799
are you still thinking about olympics

4469
02:37:40,239 --> 02:37:44,879
they put me into the room like four

4470
02:37:42,799 --> 02:37:46,398
hours later the doctor came in

4471
02:37:44,879 --> 02:37:49,199
um

4472
02:37:46,398 --> 02:37:50,719
i was at mgh in boston

4473
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:52,880
and he was like

4474
02:37:50,719 --> 02:37:55,199
you have a serious infection in your leg

4475
02:37:52,879 --> 02:37:56,719
i go he's like we have to keep you

4476
02:37:55,200 --> 02:37:58,479
hospitalized until we can figure out

4477
02:37:56,719 --> 02:37:59,358
what it is and i was like

4478
02:37:58,478 --> 02:38:00,719
buddy

4479
02:37:59,359 --> 02:38:03,359
i have the olympic games in less than a

4480
02:38:00,719 --> 02:38:05,840
year i go i don't give a [ __ ] what it is

4481
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:08,000
i go just [ __ ] take it out and let me

4482
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:08,719
get on with my day he goes we can't do

4483
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,879
that

4484
02:38:08,719 --> 02:38:13,199
i'm like i don't understand i go you

4485
02:38:10,879 --> 02:38:14,478
told me it's infected just cut away that

4486
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:15,920
part of the tissue

4487
02:38:14,478 --> 02:38:17,599
drain it do whatever you got to do and

4488
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:19,439
then send me on my way he's like it

4489
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:21,120
doesn't work like that he said until we

4490
02:38:19,439 --> 02:38:23,040
figure out what it is we can't figure

4491
02:38:21,120 --> 02:38:25,520
out how to stop it from growing or how

4492
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:27,439
far it spread so it took him seven days

4493
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:29,520
to figure out what it was

4494
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:32,398
then once they figured out what it was i

4495
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:35,520
went in for surgery to remove it

4496
02:38:32,398 --> 02:38:39,199
then i spent i think it was eight weeks

4497
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:41,439
in in-home care with a picc line

4498
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:43,359
and then i came back from that

4499
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:45,040
in the first week and a half of judo i

4500
02:38:43,359 --> 02:38:46,640
tore my si joint

4501
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:48,240
trying to throw a guy

4502
02:38:46,639 --> 02:38:49,358
and then i came back from that about a

4503
02:38:48,239 --> 02:38:51,119
month

4504
02:38:49,359 --> 02:38:53,120
later and then

4505
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:55,439
fifth at the kano cup and then the game

4506
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:57,760
six months later how quickly do doctors

4507
02:38:55,439 --> 02:38:59,200
understand who they're dealing with

4508
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:00,880
like is that is that difficult for you

4509
02:38:59,200 --> 02:39:03,120
to explain who travis stevens is when

4510
02:39:00,879 --> 02:39:05,599
you go to visit a doctor i don't think

4511
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:07,120
they understand

4512
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:08,800
you know

4513
02:39:07,120 --> 02:39:11,280
their role

4514
02:39:08,799 --> 02:39:14,239
is to get me to do my job to the best of

4515
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:15,520
their ability as a doctor right meaning

4516
02:39:14,239 --> 02:39:17,760
it's going to be less than what they

4517
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:17,760
want

4518
02:39:18,639 --> 02:39:23,840
and they and they struggle conceptually

4519
02:39:21,359 --> 02:39:26,000
with like

4520
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:28,318
the textbook tells me this

4521
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:29,520
and i go but i'm not a textbook

4522
02:39:28,318 --> 02:39:31,519
right like when you go to physical

4523
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:33,520
therapy the first thing they do is they

4524
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:35,280
pull out that binder that says day one

4525
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:36,319
we do this exercise

4526
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:39,200
i go

4527
02:39:36,318 --> 02:39:41,119
but i have my own goals yeah your job is

4528
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:43,120
to help me meet my goal

4529
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:45,120
let's let's work a plan to do that or i

4530
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:47,680
got to go find somebody else

4531
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:50,000
did uh the doctors in general people

4532
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:52,720
outside of your close-knit group step up

4533
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:55,920
if they didn't i found somebody else

4534
02:39:52,719 --> 02:39:58,559
and typically i could find a person who

4535
02:39:55,920 --> 02:40:00,239
knew the right person

4536
02:39:58,559 --> 02:40:02,799
i always wonder with people like because

4537
02:40:00,239 --> 02:40:04,239
i'm i'm constantly surrounded by

4538
02:40:02,799 --> 02:40:05,679
one of the biggest problems in my life

4539
02:40:04,239 --> 02:40:08,000
has been there's a lot of people in my

4540
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:09,920
life who love me very much

4541
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:12,159
but who want me to the equivalent of

4542
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:13,520
that situation um

4543
02:40:12,159 --> 02:40:16,159
you know definitely don't go to the

4544
02:40:13,520 --> 02:40:17,920
olympics and definitely like like it

4545
02:40:16,159 --> 02:40:19,760
seems like the world is full of people

4546
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:21,279
that want you to be

4547
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:23,600
average and happy

4548
02:40:21,279 --> 02:40:25,520
which is great which is fine i mean i

4549
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:27,279
perhaps that's the way it should be

4550
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:29,120
like you know my parents people close to

4551
02:40:27,279 --> 02:40:30,880
this that's what love

4552
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:32,840
how love manifests itself often in

4553
02:40:30,879 --> 02:40:35,278
people but then like i think the

4554
02:40:32,840 --> 02:40:37,359
ultimate manifestation of love is

4555
02:40:35,279 --> 02:40:39,439
understanding who this person is here's

4556
02:40:37,359 --> 02:40:41,200
a madman who's driven towards a

4557
02:40:39,439 --> 02:40:43,520
particular thing and the best thing for

4558
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:44,960
you to do is not to say

4559
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:47,120
like

4560
02:40:44,959 --> 02:40:49,438
rest is to say

4561
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:51,120
work harder

4562
02:40:49,439 --> 02:40:53,279
like

4563
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:54,960
[ __ ] your infection yeah you should be

4564
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:56,880
training yeah

4565
02:40:54,959 --> 02:41:00,079
have you ever met anybody as crazy as

4566
02:40:56,879 --> 02:41:03,358
you that can help you most of us who

4567
02:41:00,079 --> 02:41:06,239
get to this point get there because

4568
02:41:03,359 --> 02:41:08,640
we're all a little unstable yeah even my

4569
02:41:06,239 --> 02:41:11,279
wife khalida right like

4570
02:41:08,639 --> 02:41:13,039
when she was getting ready for 2016

4571
02:41:11,279 --> 02:41:16,159
um or when she was getting ready for

4572
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:18,000
2020 because she moved to boston

4573
02:41:16,159 --> 02:41:19,279
to be a coach she

4574
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:21,439
had a

4575
02:41:19,279 --> 02:41:22,720
neck problem

4576
02:41:21,439 --> 02:41:24,398
right

4577
02:41:22,719 --> 02:41:26,879
and

4578
02:41:24,398 --> 02:41:28,879
at that at some point in time it's like

4579
02:41:26,879 --> 02:41:30,398
what's really important

4580
02:41:28,879 --> 02:41:31,679
day-to-day life

4581
02:41:30,398 --> 02:41:33,119
or judo

4582
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:36,639
and believe it or not

4583
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:39,600
the doctor in canada was like

4584
02:41:36,639 --> 02:41:42,719
i am never under any circumstances doing

4585
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:44,559
an mri of your neck again

4586
02:41:42,719 --> 02:41:46,398
that's what she told her she goes if you

4587
02:41:44,559 --> 02:41:49,039
have me do an mri yeah you're not doing

4588
02:41:46,398 --> 02:41:51,760
judo again so just know if you hurt your

4589
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:53,520
neck and it requires an mri

4590
02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:55,439
you're done with judo forever

4591
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:57,680
yeah so decide if you want to do judo or

4592
02:41:55,439 --> 02:42:00,000
not that was a conversation we actually

4593
02:41:57,680 --> 02:42:01,600
had to have that's a cool thing for a

4594
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:03,200
doctor to say

4595
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:05,040
i mean it depends how badass they sound

4596
02:42:03,200 --> 02:42:07,840
when they say it

4597
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:09,920
so that's a tough conversation judo won

4598
02:42:07,840 --> 02:42:11,760
what's what's this with your wife what's

4599
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:13,040
that relationship like so you're both a

4600
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:14,159
little crazy

4601
02:42:13,040 --> 02:42:15,840
a little bit

4602
02:42:14,159 --> 02:42:17,920
in a good sense

4603
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:20,398
or from my perspective in a good sense

4604
02:42:17,920 --> 02:42:23,520
yeah it's just we've

4605
02:42:20,398 --> 02:42:26,079
we understand that when it

4606
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:28,720
when you set a goal to do something

4607
02:42:26,079 --> 02:42:31,200
you're not signing on for the good

4608
02:42:28,719 --> 02:42:32,478
yeah you're signing on for the bad

4609
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:33,840
and i don't think a lot of people

4610
02:42:32,478 --> 02:42:36,159
understand that

4611
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:38,079
that's like a valentine's day card from

4612
02:42:36,159 --> 02:42:40,159
travis stevens

4613
02:42:38,079 --> 02:42:42,398
you have to like accept everything

4614
02:42:40,159 --> 02:42:44,318
negative that could possibly happen and

4615
02:42:42,398 --> 02:42:45,519
until you do you're never gonna make it

4616
02:42:44,318 --> 02:42:49,278
because you'll always sell yourself

4617
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:50,479
short yeah you'll never go far enough

4618
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:53,200
and if you sign up for the whole thing

4619
02:42:50,478 --> 02:42:55,278
then the negative is just like oh great

4620
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:56,960
i expected that if you're experiencing

4621
02:42:55,279 --> 02:42:58,000
the negative they're also experienced

4622
02:42:56,959 --> 02:43:00,159
the negative

4623
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:02,000
and if you overcome it maybe they'll get

4624
02:43:00,159 --> 02:43:03,520
knocked out from yep maybe they won't

4625
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,959
deal with it maybe they won't train

4626
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:06,720
through it

4627
02:43:04,959 --> 02:43:08,318
right when i had my five herniated disc

4628
02:43:06,719 --> 02:43:10,398
and i was in a neck brace i was still in

4629
02:43:08,318 --> 02:43:12,559
the gym at 7 am

4630
02:43:10,398 --> 02:43:14,959
doing whatever it is i could do because

4631
02:43:12,559 --> 02:43:16,639
my job is to be at the gym

4632
02:43:14,959 --> 02:43:19,278
david goggins i don't know if you know

4633
02:43:16,639 --> 02:43:21,519
the guy he's he's gone he's damaged lots

4634
02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:23,920
of parts of his body like you

4635
02:43:21,520 --> 02:43:25,680
trying to achieve things so you know

4636
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:27,840
unlike you

4637
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:30,639
his achievements are like

4638
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:32,478
your achievements come with a medal

4639
02:43:30,639 --> 02:43:34,959
he's just running in the darkness in the

4640
02:43:32,478 --> 02:43:36,799
middle of nowhere by himself it's like i

4641
02:43:34,959 --> 02:43:38,719
mean it's the same probably as with you

4642
02:43:36,799 --> 02:43:40,959
if you're able to be introspective about

4643
02:43:38,719 --> 02:43:42,639
it is he's just battling his own inner

4644
02:43:40,959 --> 02:43:44,559
demons and

4645
02:43:42,639 --> 02:43:47,599
working through those and he's breaking

4646
02:43:44,559 --> 02:43:48,478
up breaking his body doing so

4647
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:51,120
are you

4648
02:43:48,478 --> 02:43:54,000
cognizant of the trade-off of the fact

4649
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:55,760
that you know you're damaging

4650
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:57,760
your body

4651
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:59,439
to get to these levels of achievements

4652
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:01,920
of this level of excellence of this

4653
02:43:59,439 --> 02:44:03,920
level of greatness i mean i guess that

4654
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:05,600
depends on what you consider damage

4655
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:07,359
really because

4656
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:09,040
i don't really see that i have damaged

4657
02:44:07,359 --> 02:44:10,399
my body if anything i think i've

4658
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:11,760
strengthened it

4659
02:44:10,398 --> 02:44:15,920
my body can go through more than yours

4660
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:15,920
can yeah whose is weaker yeah

4661
02:44:16,318 --> 02:44:19,439
right it's just like

4662
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:21,120
it's just like the thai boxers right

4663
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:23,120
yeah in order to strengthen their shins

4664
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:25,040
they got to break it a few times yeah

4665
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:26,960
it's just nature of the beast you just

4666
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:28,640
uh had to break a bunch of stuff to find

4667
02:44:26,959 --> 02:44:30,719
where the weak points are and then made

4668
02:44:28,639 --> 02:44:34,239
them stronger yep of course strengthen

4669
02:44:30,719 --> 02:44:36,159
the areas around it to strengthen it by

4670
02:44:34,239 --> 02:44:37,680
you know the sheer relation to it but

4671
02:44:36,159 --> 02:44:40,559
the problem is like you may not be able

4672
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:40,559
to do judo

4673
02:44:41,359 --> 02:44:45,520
like for until you're 70.

4674
02:44:44,318 --> 02:44:46,879
why not

4675
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:48,880
i may not be able to do judo to the

4676
02:44:46,879 --> 02:44:51,039
level i used to yeah don't get me wrong

4677
02:44:48,879 --> 02:44:53,920
but i can still do judo because and i

4678
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:55,760
think a lot of people struggle with

4679
02:44:53,920 --> 02:44:57,680
they want to keep doing it like they

4680
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:59,200
used to be able to do it i don't try to

4681
02:44:57,680 --> 02:45:01,279
do judo like i used to like you're

4682
02:44:59,200 --> 02:45:02,479
seeing here yeah i'm not that guy

4683
02:45:01,279 --> 02:45:04,640
anymore

4684
02:45:02,478 --> 02:45:06,719
i accept that i don't even try to be

4685
02:45:04,639 --> 02:45:08,639
that guy anymore

4686
02:45:06,719 --> 02:45:10,639
i'm a completely different player today

4687
02:45:08,639 --> 02:45:13,639
than i am when i was winning olympic

4688
02:45:10,639 --> 02:45:13,639
medals

4689
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:20,640
and so i guess when you're looking at

4690
02:45:17,920 --> 02:45:24,000
like my journey and the trade-off is

4691
02:45:20,639 --> 02:45:26,599
i never sacrificed anything

4692
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:29,840
the people around me sacrificed for

4693
02:45:26,600 --> 02:45:32,559
me and i never had a downturn after the

4694
02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:35,200
olympics because i never identified as

4695
02:45:32,559 --> 02:45:35,199
an olympian

4696
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:40,239
you know a lot of olympians suffer from

4697
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:42,399
depression because they identify as it

4698
02:45:40,239 --> 02:45:44,959
now they don't have who they are

4699
02:45:42,398 --> 02:45:46,799
where was your personal

4700
02:45:44,959 --> 02:45:47,759
moment of greatness

4701
02:45:46,799 --> 02:45:49,599
like

4702
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:51,439
or do you not experience life that way

4703
02:45:49,600 --> 02:45:56,000
where you were truly proud to be

4704
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:57,359
yourself like every day i wake up

4705
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,799
you wake up and you're not proud of who

4706
02:45:57,359 --> 02:46:00,559
you are then

4707
02:45:58,799 --> 02:46:01,358
you've really got to seek out some like

4708
02:46:00,559 --> 02:46:03,600
help

4709
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:05,439
so that's first of all okay i'll i'll do

4710
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:06,239
that because um i definitely am not

4711
02:46:05,439 --> 02:46:08,479
proud

4712
02:46:06,239 --> 02:46:11,119
of who i am i just wonder

4713
02:46:08,478 --> 02:46:12,719
if you didn't identify with the olympics

4714
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:14,319
was there times

4715
02:46:12,719 --> 02:46:15,438
maybe in the training room maybe in

4716
02:46:14,318 --> 02:46:17,119
japan

4717
02:46:15,439 --> 02:46:19,200
like where you're all

4718
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:22,160
you just kind of felt like

4719
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:25,279
i get more of an emotional

4720
02:46:22,159 --> 02:46:27,359
i guess trigger right where like i feel

4721
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:28,960
proud of what i've done

4722
02:46:27,359 --> 02:46:30,159
when

4723
02:46:28,959 --> 02:46:33,199
i've

4724
02:46:30,159 --> 02:46:35,840
set to a task and i've done it

4725
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:39,920
so almost any task and the more

4726
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:42,318
challenging the task to more reward

4727
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:44,719
you fought up a lot of amazing uh

4728
02:46:42,318 --> 02:46:46,079
battles in 2016 olympics

4729
02:46:44,719 --> 02:46:47,438
so you got

4730
02:46:46,079 --> 02:46:49,920
you beat the

4731
02:46:47,439 --> 02:46:51,520
let's see the world number four in the

4732
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:53,439
quarterfinals

4733
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:54,880
it's like a replay every single olympics

4734
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:56,639
you're

4735
02:46:54,879 --> 02:46:58,639
all the people i got terrible draws

4736
02:46:56,639 --> 02:47:00,239
insane terrible draws and then you're

4737
02:46:58,639 --> 02:47:02,559
facing this is where i was like watching

4738
02:47:00,239 --> 02:47:05,199
this i'm like yeah he's screwed you face

4739
02:47:02,559 --> 02:47:07,199
the world number one the georgian and

4740
02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:09,359
by the way for people who don't know

4741
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:11,520
he beat me

4742
02:47:09,359 --> 02:47:13,760
five times to my beating him once and

4743
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:15,760
the one time i beat him was in london

4744
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:17,760
and all other times he beat me he beat

4745
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:20,398
me by phone

4746
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:22,719
and not by like a little throw like

4747
02:47:20,398 --> 02:47:25,278
he threw me on my head

4748
02:47:22,719 --> 02:47:27,358
at one point we were in georgia

4749
02:47:25,279 --> 02:47:29,359
i'm fighting him in the final i go to my

4750
02:47:27,359 --> 02:47:31,040
teammate and i go guess what make sure

4751
02:47:29,359 --> 02:47:33,040
you watch this fight somebody's getting

4752
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:35,920
thrown free pawn this matching and the

4753
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:37,840
same magical distance and about a minute

4754
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:39,840
in i tried to take his head off with a

4755
02:47:37,840 --> 02:47:41,279
big koshigoromo which was like a head

4756
02:47:39,840 --> 02:47:42,559
and arm

4757
02:47:41,279 --> 02:47:45,680
he caught me and then threw me on my

4758
02:47:42,559 --> 02:47:45,680
head and ended the match

4759
02:47:46,159 --> 02:47:50,079
so first of all we're watching the video

4760
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:52,478
of you again standing next to the to the

4761
02:47:50,079 --> 02:47:54,559
guy leading up to your semi-final match

4762
02:47:52,478 --> 02:47:56,799
so here if you uh if you win this you're

4763
02:47:54,559 --> 02:47:58,719
guaranteed a medal yep uh but the

4764
02:47:56,799 --> 02:48:00,959
chances of you winning from my fan

4765
02:47:58,719 --> 02:48:01,760
perspective i was like god

4766
02:48:00,959 --> 02:48:03,519
uh you damn

4767
02:48:01,760 --> 02:48:04,960
the rest of the world except for me

4768
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:06,880
except for you wha wha what are you

4769
02:48:04,959 --> 02:48:08,879
saying you're talking to yourself here

4770
02:48:06,879 --> 02:48:11,278
what are you saying my name is travis

4771
02:48:08,879 --> 02:48:13,920
stevens i'm olympic champion i will not

4772
02:48:11,279 --> 02:48:13,920
be denied

4773
02:48:14,318 --> 02:48:17,600
the georgia is probably like what the

4774
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:20,318
hell is this guy saying

4775
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:23,040
was he talking to himself

4776
02:48:20,318 --> 02:48:24,239
so he was probably ultra confident yeah

4777
02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:25,920
had to be

4778
02:48:24,239 --> 02:48:28,000
the difference is

4779
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:29,040
is i understood the last five times he

4780
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:31,600
beat me

4781
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:33,200
i was purposely trying to throw him not

4782
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:35,760
beat him

4783
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:37,920
i wanted to find out if i could

4784
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:39,200
turns out i can't

4785
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:40,478
but i don't need to throw him to beat

4786
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:44,560
him

4787
02:48:40,478 --> 02:48:47,679
i need to know how to not lose

4788
02:48:44,559 --> 02:48:50,159
but you were still going for stuff here

4789
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:51,200
but all of my attacks drag him to the

4790
02:48:50,159 --> 02:48:54,799
ground

4791
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:54,800
they're never standing on my feet

4792
02:48:54,959 --> 02:48:57,599
which is a complete which is a

4793
02:48:56,318 --> 02:48:59,439
distinction that we talked about at the

4794
02:48:57,600 --> 02:49:00,640
very beginning right you have throws

4795
02:48:59,439 --> 02:49:02,398
where you're standing and throws where

4796
02:49:00,639 --> 02:49:04,079
you're dropping every time i try to

4797
02:49:02,398 --> 02:49:05,760
throw him standing

4798
02:49:04,079 --> 02:49:08,239
he throws me free pony he picks me up

4799
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:10,318
and he throws me on my head literally

4800
02:49:08,239 --> 02:49:12,639
so what i did is i just needed to get to

4801
02:49:10,318 --> 02:49:14,719
that last one minute mark which is what

4802
02:49:12,639 --> 02:49:17,439
he does mentally in his own judo where

4803
02:49:14,719 --> 02:49:19,039
he changes into a panic and just tries

4804
02:49:17,439 --> 02:49:21,439
to like do things that are

4805
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:22,720
uncharacteristic

4806
02:49:21,439 --> 02:49:24,800
so you knew he's going to start

4807
02:49:22,719 --> 02:49:27,358
panicking here as you get as the match

4808
02:49:24,799 --> 02:49:29,438
cl draw still close and you both have a

4809
02:49:27,359 --> 02:49:31,120
paschito and actually

4810
02:49:29,439 --> 02:49:33,600
did we pass the point where i went for

4811
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:34,720
broke and i broke my rule

4812
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:38,840
which one

4813
02:49:34,719 --> 02:49:42,079
i went for a crazy foot sweep

4814
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:43,600
um like epone switch

4815
02:49:42,079 --> 02:49:45,359
thing i can't remember what it's called

4816
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:48,000
because it's not used that often

4817
02:49:45,359 --> 02:49:49,200
and he actually landed on top of me and

4818
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,239
some people wanted it to be called

4819
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:51,680
hippone

4820
02:49:50,239 --> 02:49:53,920
but he had actually

4821
02:49:51,680 --> 02:49:55,600
let go of the ghee and was looking for

4822
02:49:53,920 --> 02:49:58,719
the mat so he didn't have any control so

4823
02:49:55,600 --> 02:49:58,720
they didn't award him a point

4824
02:49:58,959 --> 02:50:01,519
yeah and here we go now we're getting

4825
02:50:00,239 --> 02:50:05,119
down into the see like he's getting

4826
02:50:01,520 --> 02:50:07,279
frustrated great yeah i love it

4827
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:09,120
perfect second penalty no big deal we

4828
02:50:07,279 --> 02:50:11,920
just got to get to the one minute mark

4829
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:11,920
that's all we got to do

4830
02:50:13,600 --> 02:50:17,120
so there's no panic here for you you're

4831
02:50:15,359 --> 02:50:19,279
not this i'm right where i need to be

4832
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:23,200
and look it

4833
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:25,359
now if you go back into this match uh

4834
02:50:23,200 --> 02:50:27,760
i would love for somebody to go back and

4835
02:50:25,359 --> 02:50:30,880
see how many times he did a drop

4836
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:33,680
right ippon say an augie

4837
02:50:30,879 --> 02:50:35,438
probably never yeah so why is he doing

4838
02:50:33,680 --> 02:50:37,279
it now

4839
02:50:35,439 --> 02:50:40,720
because he panics and he changes his

4840
02:50:37,279 --> 02:50:42,640
judo at that one minute

4841
02:50:40,719 --> 02:50:44,239
so look out look how much i kept that

4842
02:50:42,639 --> 02:50:46,879
grip yeah you kept

4843
02:50:44,239 --> 02:50:48,879
you have that grip this whole time yeah

4844
02:50:46,879 --> 02:50:50,959
of your left hand locking him down

4845
02:50:48,879 --> 02:50:53,920
walking him down

4846
02:50:50,959 --> 02:50:55,919
the he he you keep the grip as he's

4847
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:57,840
throwing yeah which

4848
02:50:55,920 --> 02:51:00,318
do were you thinking choke as he drops

4849
02:50:57,840 --> 02:51:02,559
or no it's just kind of natural instinct

4850
02:51:00,318 --> 02:51:04,879
yeah because we drilled it i spent two

4851
02:51:02,559 --> 02:51:07,199
years drilling this transition and then

4852
02:51:04,879 --> 02:51:08,398
very so for people that don't do judo

4853
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:11,040
jiu-jitsu

4854
02:51:08,398 --> 02:51:12,639
it's like really nice you keep

4855
02:51:11,040 --> 02:51:14,880
everything is nicely controlled to where

4856
02:51:12,639 --> 02:51:16,639
you're keeping that ghee under his chin

4857
02:51:14,879 --> 02:51:19,039
like it's really tight control like it's

4858
02:51:16,639 --> 02:51:20,799
very like you're cog i guess is drilling

4859
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:22,399
but you're cognizant of the position of

4860
02:51:20,799 --> 02:51:24,239
your wrist the whole time and you can

4861
02:51:22,398 --> 02:51:26,239
tell based on like

4862
02:51:24,239 --> 02:51:28,398
just years of doing it whether it's

4863
02:51:26,239 --> 02:51:30,478
under or it's not right you can just

4864
02:51:28,398 --> 02:51:32,239
feel the difference and it's probably

4865
02:51:30,478 --> 02:51:33,920
even if you wanted to stop that it's

4866
02:51:32,239 --> 02:51:36,000
very difficult because your whole time

4867
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:38,478
it's like once it's under it's almost

4868
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:40,079
impossible to stop

4869
02:51:38,478 --> 02:51:42,398
for people who practice jiu jitsu don't

4870
02:51:40,079 --> 02:51:44,000
practice judo one of the very annoying

4871
02:51:42,398 --> 02:51:46,639
things about

4872
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:48,159
judo is in order to do

4873
02:51:46,639 --> 02:51:50,079
ghee chokes they have to be under the

4874
02:51:48,159 --> 02:51:51,920
chin yes

4875
02:51:50,079 --> 02:51:54,239
even though the kind of intense jokes

4876
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:55,680
you do work just fine yeah over the chin

4877
02:51:54,239 --> 02:51:57,600
but

4878
02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:59,279
and the the kicker here and why we

4879
02:51:57,600 --> 02:52:01,040
practiced this choke

4880
02:51:59,279 --> 02:52:03,359
was because when you go back and watch

4881
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:05,840
all of the other matches he always does

4882
02:52:03,359 --> 02:52:07,600
this tripod when i try to do arm locks

4883
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:09,439
yeah which is typically what i would do

4884
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:11,279
yeah and when i do that he ends up

4885
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:12,159
sliding out and i end up falling off

4886
02:52:11,279 --> 02:52:14,800
right

4887
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:16,799
so you step up here with the choke he

4888
02:52:14,799 --> 02:52:18,000
does a tripod where he sticks his button

4889
02:52:16,799 --> 02:52:19,039
to the air

4890
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:21,279
and you

4891
02:52:19,040 --> 02:52:21,279
uh

4892
02:52:21,359 --> 02:52:24,720
dude what's the name of this choke

4893
02:52:23,279 --> 02:52:27,040
bow and arrow

4894
02:52:24,719 --> 02:52:29,039
no but okay i mean when you do from like

4895
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:31,200
from that posit

4896
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:32,880
is is there a way this entry into the

4897
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:34,640
bow and arrow i guess because you're

4898
02:52:32,879 --> 02:52:36,799
doing we we referred to in judo as a

4899
02:52:34,639 --> 02:52:38,318
british strangle which when they when

4900
02:52:36,799 --> 02:52:39,759
they're in that turtle position and you

4901
02:52:38,318 --> 02:52:41,359
do that rolling

4902
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:42,559
cool

4903
02:52:41,359 --> 02:52:44,559
and here

4904
02:52:42,559 --> 02:52:46,000
when you go into that you can fall off

4905
02:52:44,559 --> 02:52:49,039
of him like you said if you're going for

4906
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:50,719
an arm bar but here literally

4907
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:53,120
because you have it under the chin

4908
02:52:50,719 --> 02:52:55,599
really well there's just a nice control

4909
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:58,079
and i've already planned on it being on

4910
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:59,439
his chin that's why i've hooked the arm

4911
02:52:58,079 --> 02:53:02,318
yeah right it's already starting to go

4912
02:52:59,439 --> 02:53:04,800
straight probably this choke in the

4913
02:53:02,318 --> 02:53:06,239
early stages like a few frames before

4914
02:53:04,799 --> 02:53:08,318
feels like

4915
02:53:06,239 --> 02:53:11,279
it uh

4916
02:53:08,318 --> 02:53:12,959
like you're safe it's fine

4917
02:53:11,279 --> 02:53:14,800
like like the head will slip out or

4918
02:53:12,959 --> 02:53:17,679
something like that yeah and that's why

4919
02:53:14,799 --> 02:53:19,358
my left knee is up by his shoulder

4920
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:23,239
to keep that pressure down so that he

4921
02:53:19,359 --> 02:53:23,239
can't posture it up

4922
02:53:24,079 --> 02:53:28,879
when did you know you have this oh i

4923
02:53:26,239 --> 02:53:28,879
work right here

4924
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:31,920
i

4925
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:33,279
i actually panicked

4926
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:36,000
um

4927
02:53:33,279 --> 02:53:36,000
right about here

4928
02:53:36,559 --> 02:53:41,920
was maybe his head could come out

4929
02:53:38,959 --> 02:53:43,839
my hand i tore the muscle in my palm

4930
02:53:41,920 --> 02:53:45,680
because i was pulling so hard that i'm

4931
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:47,200
like

4932
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:49,600
he may not tap

4933
02:53:47,200 --> 02:53:51,040
yeah like is he is my hand just gonna

4934
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:53,200
give out

4935
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:54,720
beforehand and there he is we're right

4936
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:56,399
on this edge right

4937
02:53:54,719 --> 02:53:58,159
yeah so like if we roll a little bit

4938
02:53:56,398 --> 02:54:00,639
outside and i still don't have it like

4939
02:53:58,159 --> 02:54:03,279
that ref could stop it yeah and then i

4940
02:54:00,639 --> 02:54:05,439
felt him tapping and

4941
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:08,560
oh the that

4942
02:54:05,439 --> 02:54:10,159
he is um he's heartbroken i felt

4943
02:54:08,559 --> 02:54:12,799
surprised

4944
02:54:10,159 --> 02:54:12,799
there it is

4945
02:54:12,959 --> 02:54:16,799
the relief olympic olympic final

4946
02:54:17,200 --> 02:54:21,040
and he knew

4947
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:21,840
he knew he lost an olympic medal right

4948
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:23,760
there

4949
02:54:21,840 --> 02:54:25,200
because he already knew

4950
02:54:23,760 --> 02:54:26,478
that the japanese guy was going to be

4951
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:29,359
his bronze

4952
02:54:26,478 --> 02:54:29,358
that he never beats

4953
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:31,920
see the

4954
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:36,880
but also he probably in his head

4955
02:54:35,279 --> 02:54:40,079
was confident that he would be in the

4956
02:54:36,879 --> 02:54:41,679
final correct and so like this he almost

4957
02:54:40,079 --> 02:54:42,639
is surprised

4958
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:45,040
yeah

4959
02:54:42,639 --> 02:54:49,079
it's not supposed to happen this way and

4960
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:49,080
it's the second time it's happened

4961
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:55,680
and that's how you became an olympic

4962
02:54:54,079 --> 02:54:57,200
medalist man that must be a great

4963
02:54:55,680 --> 02:55:00,720
feeling

4964
02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:03,439
that must be a great feeling right here

4965
02:55:00,719 --> 02:55:06,000
just like all the years of injuries

4966
02:55:03,439 --> 02:55:06,000
all of it

4967
02:55:07,359 --> 02:55:12,159
as as fans that watch this too it's like

4968
02:55:10,478 --> 02:55:13,840
holy [ __ ] he actually did it it's a

4969
02:55:12,159 --> 02:55:16,478
packed stadium too

4970
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:18,000
not one empty seat

4971
02:55:16,478 --> 02:55:19,760
oh man

4972
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:22,559
so uh

4973
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:25,439
i mean what were you thinking here

4974
02:55:22,559 --> 02:55:27,920
i'm just focused on the next match yeah

4975
02:55:25,439 --> 02:55:31,200
it took me maybe

4976
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:32,799
like a minute or so to like

4977
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:35,439
decompress

4978
02:55:32,799 --> 02:55:38,398
and then like get back to like my normal

4979
02:55:35,439 --> 02:55:38,398
state for the final

4980
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:44,560
so the the final

4981
02:55:41,520 --> 02:55:46,159
is against the uh

4982
02:55:44,559 --> 02:55:49,039
the russian here what can you say about

4983
02:55:46,159 --> 02:55:51,520
your mindset

4984
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:54,080
you're saying the exact same same thing

4985
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:56,159
travis stevens olympic champion

4986
02:55:54,079 --> 02:55:58,318
i will not be denied

4987
02:55:56,159 --> 02:56:00,398
because i had felt like in london and

4988
02:55:58,318 --> 02:56:03,119
throughout the years i felt like

4989
02:56:00,398 --> 02:56:04,879
i kept getting robbed so i made sure in

4990
02:56:03,120 --> 02:56:07,680
my mantra to have that little bit at the

4991
02:56:04,879 --> 02:56:08,959
end to reassure myself that like

4992
02:56:07,680 --> 02:56:10,479
they are not going to control the

4993
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:12,318
outcome of today

4994
02:56:10,478 --> 02:56:14,079
i'm going to control the outcome what

4995
02:56:12,318 --> 02:56:15,600
did you know about the russian

4996
02:56:14,079 --> 02:56:17,039
everything

4997
02:56:15,600 --> 02:56:18,960
um

4998
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:21,359
and i i honestly i thought i'd win the

4999
02:56:18,959 --> 02:56:24,079
olympics right now and i still do think

5000
02:56:21,359 --> 02:56:28,318
that today just like

5001
02:56:24,079 --> 02:56:28,318
mentally when you think about it that

5002
02:56:28,398 --> 02:56:33,599
i've won like

5003
02:56:30,398 --> 02:56:35,119
yeah he threw me

5004
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:37,439
but it was like a one in a million

5005
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:39,840
chance that that worked for him

5006
02:56:37,439 --> 02:56:41,760
like come on so

5007
02:56:39,840 --> 02:56:44,079
so it's not like you feel lucky to be in

5008
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:46,239
the final it's like

5009
02:56:44,079 --> 02:56:48,639
you you can't remember i'm

5010
02:56:46,239 --> 02:56:50,398
i'm anticipating the goal like i'm i'm

5011
02:56:48,639 --> 02:56:51,680
past that

5012
02:56:50,398 --> 02:56:53,439
there's a confidence in the way you're

5013
02:56:51,680 --> 02:56:55,279
moving and the way you're yeah like i

5014
02:56:53,439 --> 02:56:57,279
have his sleeve he's not breaking it

5015
02:56:55,279 --> 02:56:58,640
like still walking him down still going

5016
02:56:57,279 --> 02:57:00,319
forward like

5017
02:56:58,639 --> 02:57:04,000
um

5018
02:57:00,318 --> 02:57:05,680
i knew exactly how i was gonna beat him

5019
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:07,200
and i developed the plan because when i

5020
02:57:05,680 --> 02:57:08,800
was getting ready for

5021
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:10,960
rio we brought in

5022
02:57:08,799 --> 02:57:12,478
a lot of the top japanese players that

5023
02:57:10,959 --> 02:57:13,759
weren't invited to the camp for the

5024
02:57:12,478 --> 02:57:16,000
national team

5025
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:17,439
to boston so i had four people three of

5026
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,879
them were on the national team one of

5027
02:57:17,439 --> 02:57:21,359
them had won

5028
02:57:18,879 --> 02:57:22,879
the universities in japan all at 81

5029
02:57:21,359 --> 02:57:24,800
kilos

5030
02:57:22,879 --> 02:57:26,239
i only got thrown once during camp for a

5031
02:57:24,799 --> 02:57:28,000
month wow

5032
02:57:26,239 --> 02:57:30,719
like i was

5033
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,719
i was ready

5034
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:35,200
i just

5035
02:57:32,559 --> 02:57:36,639
i [ __ ] slipped

5036
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:38,399
where does it happen

5037
02:57:36,639 --> 02:57:40,478
right when he threw me so if you let

5038
02:57:38,398 --> 02:57:41,599
this play out really quick

5039
02:57:40,478 --> 02:57:43,438
there's a point right here where i'm

5040
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:45,640
going to come around his back

5041
02:57:43,439 --> 02:57:48,000
and i'm kind of going to just

5042
02:57:45,639 --> 02:57:49,039
yokosoteme which means like a lateral

5043
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:51,200
drop and i'm just going to bring him

5044
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:53,680
down to the floor which isn't a throw

5045
02:57:51,200 --> 02:57:55,279
right here yeah it's more of like a a

5046
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:57,120
take down right i'm trying to get him to

5047
02:57:55,279 --> 02:57:59,200
the ground because i want to burn him he

5048
02:57:57,120 --> 02:58:01,120
doesn't do nawaza yeah so i'm just going

5049
02:57:59,200 --> 02:58:02,399
to keep burning him and you can see that

5050
02:58:01,120 --> 02:58:05,040
like

5051
02:58:02,398 --> 02:58:07,119
i get really close here

5052
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:10,560
he just went a little too far

5053
02:58:07,120 --> 02:58:12,160
to his side during this exchange

5054
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:15,119
and like he's running

5055
02:58:12,159 --> 02:58:15,119
oh my god he

5056
02:58:17,359 --> 02:58:23,359
he's very wiry for an 81kg player yeah

5057
02:58:20,719 --> 02:58:25,119
there's not much like muscle on him

5058
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:26,880
but he uses his length and his leverage

5059
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:28,800
very well and you can see like i'm

5060
02:58:26,879 --> 02:58:30,879
really burning the clock here like

5061
02:58:28,799 --> 02:58:32,719
i'm owning these exchanges more than i'm

5062
02:58:30,879 --> 02:58:34,639
owning the tachiwaza ones the ones on

5063
02:58:32,719 --> 02:58:36,959
our feet so you weren't trying to

5064
02:58:34,639 --> 02:58:40,239
necessarily like submit him here or

5065
02:58:36,959 --> 02:58:43,039
like really hard or like

5066
02:58:40,239 --> 02:58:45,600
pin him you're trying to break him a bit

5067
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:46,720
i'm doing both um i'm being overly

5068
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:47,059
physical

5069
02:58:46,719 --> 02:58:48,239
um

5070
02:58:47,059 --> 02:58:50,398
[Music]

5071
02:58:48,239 --> 02:58:52,159
and to a lot of the bjj people who are

5072
02:58:50,398 --> 02:58:53,680
watching this like

5073
02:58:52,159 --> 02:58:55,200
they're like oh well i would have done

5074
02:58:53,680 --> 02:58:57,200
this i would have done that you've got

5075
02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:59,600
to think like

5076
02:58:57,200 --> 02:59:01,040
if that referee who's reffing the judo

5077
02:58:59,600 --> 02:59:03,120
side of it looks at it for a couple

5078
02:59:01,040 --> 02:59:05,120
seconds and it's like

5079
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:06,079
uh he's not really moving yeah they'll

5080
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:09,120
stop it

5081
02:59:06,079 --> 02:59:11,359
yeah so you're uh like you understand

5082
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:13,200
judo yeah what's called nawaz or

5083
02:59:11,359 --> 02:59:15,760
groundwork like what you because you're

5084
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:19,200
really showing it to the ref yes you

5085
02:59:15,760 --> 02:59:21,040
have to show movement and progression

5086
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:23,279
that hurt the forehead like see i threw

5087
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:27,880
that hand in there kind of hard

5088
02:59:23,279 --> 02:59:27,880
ripping it across his face just because

5089
02:59:28,799 --> 02:59:33,599
the i gotta i gotta tell you there's a

5090
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:34,880

little broken

5092
02:59:34,879 --> 02:59:39,519
but

5093
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:41,359
the the russians have like this calmness

5094
02:59:39,520 --> 02:59:43,760
they're pretty good at well don't forget

5095
02:59:41,359 --> 02:59:47,120
they've competed like this for a long

5096
02:59:43,760 --> 02:59:47,120
time yeah it's all he knows

5097
02:59:47,439 --> 02:59:50,800
and this is where i lose it see how my

5098
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:52,880
knee hit the ground yeah my knee wasn't

5099
02:59:50,799 --> 02:59:54,478
supposed to touch the ground yeah

5100
02:59:52,879 --> 02:59:55,759
i was supposed to sit to my hip to bring

5101
02:59:54,478 --> 02:59:57,760
him down

5102
02:59:55,760 --> 02:59:58,960
something happened where my knee touched

5103
02:59:57,760 --> 03:00:00,318
yeah and

5104
02:59:58,959 --> 03:00:02,159
it didn't happen in the first one it

just happened there

5106
03:00:02,159 --> 03:00:04,559
it's like that

5107
03:00:03,520 --> 03:00:06,960
we never should have been in that

5108
03:00:04,559 --> 03:00:08,840
predicament yeah

5109
03:00:06,959 --> 03:00:11,919
and that's that's one of the things

5110
03:00:08,840 --> 03:00:14,398
where when you're looking at

5111
03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:17,120
you know sports for anybody who's trying

5112
03:00:14,398 --> 03:00:17,119
to improve

5113
03:00:17,200 --> 03:00:20,319
you have to when you're when you're

5114
03:00:18,799 --> 03:00:22,079
trying to improve you've really got to

5115
03:00:20,318 --> 03:00:24,959
ignore

5116
03:00:22,079 --> 03:00:26,239
the ends of the spectrums right the the

5117
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:28,159
oopsies

5118
03:00:26,239 --> 03:00:30,318
and the they got lucky

5119
03:00:28,159 --> 03:00:32,398
and you only focus on the middle like

5120
03:00:30,318 --> 03:00:33,278
the technique i was doing was perfectly

5121
03:00:32,398 --> 03:00:35,519
sound

5122
03:00:33,279 --> 03:00:37,120
but it just happened that the one oopsy

5123
03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:41,040
happened on the stage it shouldn't have

5124
03:00:37,120 --> 03:00:43,680
happened on and there's no

5125
03:00:41,040 --> 03:00:45,200
there's no amount of drilling that will

5126
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:46,479
ever

5127
03:00:45,200 --> 03:00:48,079
like

5128
03:00:46,478 --> 03:00:50,799
prevent that from happening and that's

5129
03:00:48,079 --> 03:00:53,039
just the the that's sports that sports

5130
03:00:50,799 --> 03:00:54,719
especially olympics especially judo when

5131
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:57,760
it's like one yeah

5132
03:00:54,719 --> 03:01:00,000
oopsie can just be your that's it

5133
03:00:57,760 --> 03:01:01,200
that's it you know it really requires

5134
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:03,680
and you have to wrap your head around

5135
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:05,200
the idea of like if you want the ability

5136
03:01:03,680 --> 03:01:07,040
to beat these people and throw these

5137
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:10,319
people like you got to be willing to get

5138
03:01:07,040 --> 03:01:12,399
thrown yourself yeah

5139
03:01:10,318 --> 03:01:13,760
like this isn't boxing there's no like

5140
03:01:12,398 --> 03:01:16,000
i'm going to stand in a place where he

5141
03:01:13,760 --> 03:01:17,520
can't hit me and i can hit him

5142
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:19,600
because we have the ghee and because

5143
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:22,399
they can grab it they have just as much

5144
03:01:19,600 --> 03:01:24,159
ability to throw you as you them

5145
03:01:22,398 --> 03:01:26,000
so how'd you feel here

5146
03:01:24,159 --> 03:01:27,600
how long was the duration of you feeling

5147
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:30,879
upset that you didn't get the gold

5148
03:01:27,600 --> 03:01:32,239
versus never felt it never felt it

5149
03:01:30,879 --> 03:01:34,559
just

5150
03:01:32,239 --> 03:01:36,879
because he didn't beat me right right

5151
03:01:34,559 --> 03:01:39,920
it's an important distinction because

5152
03:01:36,879 --> 03:01:43,438
when i'm training and when i'm competing

5153
03:01:39,920 --> 03:01:45,040
like i understand that i take risks

5154
03:01:43,439 --> 03:01:46,559
and i accept those consequences that's

5155
03:01:45,040 --> 03:01:49,359
why i take them

5156
03:01:46,559 --> 03:01:51,920
that's a consequence that's not him

5157
03:01:49,359 --> 03:01:54,079
being the better judo player that

5158
03:01:51,920 --> 03:01:56,159
dominated a match and i didn't have an

5159
03:01:54,079 --> 03:01:58,079
answer and then he threw me

5160
03:01:56,159 --> 03:01:59,520
then i would be a little upset

5161
03:01:58,079 --> 03:02:01,439
like when you're tired and somebody's

5162
03:01:59,520 --> 03:02:03,359
coming at you and like you can't do

5163
03:02:01,439 --> 03:02:04,800
anything about it that's a shitty

5164
03:02:03,359 --> 03:02:06,800
feeling yeah

5165
03:02:04,799 --> 03:02:08,639
you know and that wasn't this one and

5166
03:02:06,799 --> 03:02:10,318
that wasn't this

5167
03:02:08,639 --> 03:02:11,760
like i accept

5168
03:02:10,318 --> 03:02:14,000
losing when it's

5169
03:02:11,760 --> 03:02:16,079
when it's my fault

5170
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:17,879
well that was a hell of a story man so

5171
03:02:16,079 --> 03:02:19,439
from 2008

5172
03:02:17,879 --> 03:02:22,159
2012

5173
03:02:19,439 --> 03:02:23,600
just the sheer number of injuries the

5174
03:02:22,159 --> 03:02:26,559
weight cuts

5175
03:02:23,600 --> 03:02:28,960
all of that the wanting to quit

5176
03:02:26,559 --> 03:02:31,439
the the doubts

5177
03:02:28,959 --> 03:02:33,358
uh i'm sure you did not get like the

5178
03:02:31,439 --> 03:02:34,720
fans probably started disappearing

5179
03:02:33,359 --> 03:02:37,200
somewhere between the second and the

5180
03:02:34,719 --> 03:02:40,000
third olympics like the support

5181
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:42,640
from it did judo within the united

5182
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:45,120
states and just everybody you know just

5183
03:02:42,639 --> 03:02:46,879
the usoc tried to cut all my funding in

5184
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:48,560
2015

5185
03:02:46,879 --> 03:02:49,519
and say nah you're too old

5186
03:02:48,559 --> 03:02:52,079
yeah

5187
03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:53,439
so through all of that to win the medal

5188
03:02:52,079 --> 03:02:55,359
i mean

5189
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:57,680
that's what the olympics is about is is

5190
03:02:55,359 --> 03:02:59,680
there some like when you look back does

5191
03:02:57,680 --> 03:03:02,159
that seem like another person is this

5192
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:03,680
like another lifetime ago or like that's

5193
03:03:02,159 --> 03:03:06,639
a hell of an accomplishment how do you

5194
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:06,639
feel about the whole thing

5195
03:03:06,879 --> 03:03:12,159
it's a it's an interesting kind of

5196
03:03:10,398 --> 03:03:13,920
predicament because there's like those

5197
03:03:12,159 --> 03:03:17,520
cookie cutter answers about how proud

5198
03:03:13,920 --> 03:03:19,120
you are and how grateful you are but

5199
03:03:17,520 --> 03:03:20,079
at the end of the day it's not who you

5200
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:22,720
are

5201
03:03:20,079 --> 03:03:24,799
so that that skill set and that

5202
03:03:22,719 --> 03:03:27,519
mentality that

5203
03:03:24,799 --> 03:03:29,039
you know it took to accomplish that

5204
03:03:27,520 --> 03:03:30,560
that's who you are

5205
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:33,600
and so

5206
03:03:30,559 --> 03:03:34,719
this was just a stepping stone in in who

5207
03:03:33,600 --> 03:03:37,040
i am

5208
03:03:34,719 --> 03:03:39,599
so it's in the past to me

5209
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:41,920
like there's no shrine in my house that

5210
03:03:39,600 --> 03:03:44,479
has like an olympic medal in it i can't

5211
03:03:41,920 --> 03:03:46,478
remember last time i looked at it

5212
03:03:44,478 --> 03:03:49,519
so you're saying like the the

5213
03:03:46,478 --> 03:03:51,438
all the stories the skills along the way

5214
03:03:49,520 --> 03:03:53,040
that's like you right now sitting here

5215
03:03:51,439 --> 03:03:55,760
is the shrine

5216
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:58,880
yeah the who you become along the

5217
03:03:55,760 --> 03:04:02,000
journey is really what the prize is

5218
03:03:58,879 --> 03:04:04,959
right like when you think about

5219
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:06,639
any of them most of the people that

5220
03:04:04,959 --> 03:04:09,519
you know go through that depression

5221
03:04:06,639 --> 03:04:11,760
after the games it's because

5222
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:14,159
that is their shrine like that is who

5223
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:16,159
they've identified as that is who

5224
03:04:14,159 --> 03:04:18,318
they've told the world the community

5225
03:04:16,159 --> 03:04:20,398
their friends their family that's how

5226
03:04:18,318 --> 03:04:22,239
they've identified

5227
03:04:20,398 --> 03:04:24,478
i've identified as the person who

5228
03:04:22,239 --> 03:04:27,680
perseveres overcomes

5229
03:04:24,478 --> 03:04:27,679
and accepts challenges

5230
03:04:28,239 --> 03:04:33,439
so like i all those things are just like

5231
03:04:31,520 --> 03:04:35,600
you know putting a suitcase off to the

5232
03:04:33,439 --> 03:04:38,800
side and i'm on to the next great

5233
03:04:35,600 --> 03:04:39,920
chapter thing that i'm trying to do

5234
03:04:38,799 --> 03:04:42,879
and it's

5235
03:04:39,920 --> 03:04:45,279
it's both sad and cool that um

5236
03:04:42,879 --> 03:04:46,959
very few people in the world get to to

5237
03:04:45,279 --> 03:04:48,319
experience what it's like to be you i

5238
03:04:46,959 --> 03:04:52,398
mean this level

5239
03:04:48,318 --> 03:04:55,920
of having gone through that yeah journey

5240
03:04:52,398 --> 03:04:55,920
everyone has the opportunity to

5241
03:04:56,079 --> 03:04:58,559
yeah

5242
03:04:57,359 --> 03:05:00,800
yeah

5243
03:04:58,559 --> 03:05:02,079
i mean i've done a few

5244
03:05:00,799 --> 03:05:03,679
uh

5245
03:05:02,079 --> 03:05:06,799
difficult things in my life but i got to

5246
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:07,680
tell you weight cuts and sauna

5247
03:05:06,799 --> 03:05:09,199
um

5248
03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:11,920
and i would tell people right now who

5249
03:05:09,200 --> 03:05:14,079
are listening like don't go through that

5250
03:05:11,920 --> 03:05:15,040
and i think a lot of wrestlers a lot of

5251
03:05:14,079 --> 03:05:17,840
young

5252
03:05:15,040 --> 03:05:20,240
judo players a lot of long young like

5253
03:05:17,840 --> 03:05:23,760
just combat sports people where

5254
03:05:20,239 --> 03:05:25,520
weight classes are a thing

5255
03:05:23,760 --> 03:05:27,439
they almost take a sense of pride like

5256
03:05:25,520 --> 03:05:29,359
when i hear them talking about like oh

5257
03:05:27,439 --> 03:05:30,800
how much weight do you have to cut if

5258
03:05:29,359 --> 03:05:32,159
you have to cut a pound more it's like

5259
03:05:30,799 --> 03:05:34,879
you've accomplished more like you're

5260
03:05:32,159 --> 03:05:36,879
tougher yeah like you're not

5261
03:05:34,879 --> 03:05:38,318
like there's no there's no trophies for

5262
03:05:36,879 --> 03:05:41,039
that

5263
03:05:38,318 --> 03:05:43,199
you whatever the reason had a job to do

5264
03:05:41,040 --> 03:05:45,279
and you got it done and that

5265
03:05:43,200 --> 03:05:48,000
that is truly inspiring no matter how

5266
03:05:45,279 --> 03:05:49,840
hard that there's a big deep lesson to

5267
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:51,439
learn from that

5268
03:05:49,840 --> 03:05:54,318
then you start getting to the specifics

5269
03:05:51,439 --> 03:05:56,318
of whether you should wake up or not but

5270
03:05:54,318 --> 03:05:58,000
if we don't then most of the great

5271
03:05:56,318 --> 03:06:00,239
things we have in this world we wouldn't

5272
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:01,920
have the reason we have many other great

5273
03:06:00,239 --> 03:06:02,799
things is because people did that weight

5274
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:04,559
cut

5275
03:06:02,799 --> 03:06:06,318
the equivalent of the way cut for

5276
03:06:04,559 --> 03:06:08,478
whatever the discipline man

5277
03:06:06,318 --> 03:06:11,119
there's a difference between

5278
03:06:08,478 --> 03:06:13,438
having to do it because you have to and

5279
03:06:11,120 --> 03:06:17,439
you get through it yeah then setting

5280
03:06:13,439 --> 03:06:19,120
yourself up to do that because you think

5281
03:06:17,439 --> 03:06:20,720
it's the cool thing or the thing you're

5282
03:06:19,120 --> 03:06:24,160
supposed to be doing in order to be

5283
03:06:20,719 --> 03:06:26,159
successful yeah there are plenty of like

5284
03:06:24,159 --> 03:06:27,520
two-time olympic medalists i probably

5285
03:06:26,159 --> 03:06:29,520
could have been a two-time olympic

5286
03:06:27,520 --> 03:06:30,960
medalist had i not

5287
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:33,279
cut that much weight i probably would

5288
03:06:30,959 --> 03:06:34,398
have multiple world medals had i not cut

5289
03:06:33,279 --> 03:06:36,640
that much weight because my body

5290
03:06:34,398 --> 03:06:38,959
wouldn't have been that broken yeah

5291
03:06:36,639 --> 03:06:40,840
there's always the other side of it so

5292
03:06:38,959 --> 03:06:43,599
just when you're looking at it

5293
03:06:40,840 --> 03:06:45,200
like i just hear it in like young kids

5294
03:06:43,600 --> 03:06:46,960
even some of my own like when you hear

5295
03:06:45,200 --> 03:06:47,760
them talk about like where their weights

5296
03:06:46,959 --> 03:06:50,000
at

5297
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:51,760
they almost take a sense of pride on how

5298
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:53,359
much they have to lose because they hear

5299
03:06:51,760 --> 03:06:54,559
stories like this

5300
03:06:53,359 --> 03:06:57,439
and it's like

5301
03:06:54,559 --> 03:07:00,559
that's not the takeaway i did it because

5302
03:06:57,439 --> 03:07:01,439
i had to i was put in a situation where

5303
03:07:00,559 --> 03:07:03,199
like

5304
03:07:01,439 --> 03:07:04,720
i may not have gone to this game that i

5305
03:07:03,200 --> 03:07:07,680
moved up to 90 kilos because i wouldn't

5306
03:07:04,719 --> 03:07:09,199
have had time to grow into the division

5307
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:10,398
and then you get the job done and then

5308
03:07:09,200 --> 03:07:12,720
you get the job done you're right

5309
03:07:10,398 --> 03:07:15,039
there's a

5310
03:07:12,719 --> 03:07:17,519
it's a very important difference yeah

5311
03:07:15,040 --> 03:07:19,279
also with sleep uh that's what people

5312
03:07:17,520 --> 03:07:21,760
talk to me about there should not be any

5313
03:07:19,279 --> 03:07:23,920
glorification of not sleeping yes there

5314
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:26,398
should not be a glorification of cutting

5315
03:07:23,920 --> 03:07:27,920
weight but if that's

5316
03:07:26,398 --> 03:07:29,920
on the way

5317
03:07:27,920 --> 03:07:32,079
to your whatever

5318
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:35,040
is that fire inside you that you know

5319
03:07:32,079 --> 03:07:35,840
needs to get done like the job at hand

5320
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:37,520
if

5321
03:07:35,840 --> 03:07:39,920
you need to sacrifice in some of those

5322
03:07:37,520 --> 03:07:42,640
ways you get the job done yes yeah and

5323
03:07:39,920 --> 03:07:44,719
uh the wake up is an interesting one

5324
03:07:42,639 --> 03:07:46,398
because it's different i mean you you

5325
03:07:44,719 --> 03:07:48,079
you could speak to this

5326
03:07:46,398 --> 03:07:50,478
there's different sports in which the

5327
03:07:48,079 --> 03:07:52,799
weight is more important than others and

5328
03:07:50,478 --> 03:07:55,039
there's different levels to this game i

5329
03:07:52,799 --> 03:07:57,679
think at the level you operated in that

5330
03:07:55,040 --> 03:08:00,399
was probably essential yeah like those

5331
03:07:57,680 --> 03:08:03,120
huge games change completely from 81 kg

5332
03:08:00,398 --> 03:08:04,799
to 90 kg it's a huge weight jump it's

5333
03:08:03,120 --> 03:08:07,040
it's first of all it's weight but then

5334
03:08:04,799 --> 03:08:08,478
the strategy it's like so much changes

5335
03:08:07,040 --> 03:08:10,240
the height and all those kinds of things

5336
03:08:08,478 --> 03:08:12,478
the physical like people don't

5337
03:08:10,239 --> 03:08:15,039
understand it but the physical size of a

5338
03:08:12,478 --> 03:08:17,438
90 kilo judo player versus the physical

5339
03:08:15,040 --> 03:08:19,200
size of an 81 kilo cheater player it's

5340
03:08:17,439 --> 03:08:22,079
like putting a human in a human like

5341
03:08:19,200 --> 03:08:23,439
there's enough space that's not like

5342
03:08:22,079 --> 03:08:25,200
you know you could stand next to your

5343
03:08:23,439 --> 03:08:27,040
friend who's 180 pounds and you could be

5344
03:08:25,200 --> 03:08:29,520
160 and you guys could look identical

5345
03:08:27,040 --> 03:08:31,840
yeah it is different when both the 90

5346
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:33,520
kilo 100 kilo and 81 kilo both have six

5347
03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:35,760
percent body fat

5348
03:08:33,520 --> 03:08:36,960
and they're cutting into the class

5349
03:08:35,760 --> 03:08:39,200
it almost feels like there's more

5350
03:08:36,959 --> 03:08:41,438
variety at 90 kilo because some of them

5351
03:08:39,200 --> 03:08:43,920
are linking tall yeah and some short and

5352
03:08:41,439 --> 03:08:45,359
stocky stocky it's like 81 is more

5353
03:08:43,920 --> 03:08:47,040
uniform which

5354
03:08:45,359 --> 03:08:48,960
but then the you know the flip side of

5355
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:51,040
that is the this is why i like in jiu

5356
03:08:48,959 --> 03:08:53,519
jitsu again amateur

5357
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:55,040
uh competing against bigger guys like i

5358
03:08:53,520 --> 03:08:57,040
love that more i like i like cutting

5359
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:58,479
weight just so i'm slim like that's when

5360
03:08:57,040 --> 03:09:00,240
i feel the best with the same thing that

5361
03:08:58,478 --> 03:09:01,278
you mentioned but like i love going

5362
03:09:00,239 --> 03:09:05,279
against

5363
03:09:01,279 --> 03:09:07,760
200 220 that because in jiu jitsu

5364
03:09:05,279 --> 03:09:10,399
the weight doesn't get amplified in the

5365
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:12,159
sport like the weight is just the weight

5366
03:09:10,398 --> 03:09:14,799
right if you can

5367
03:09:12,159 --> 03:09:17,200
if you can leg press 220 and you can

5368
03:09:14,799 --> 03:09:19,199
bench 220 then

5369
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:20,960
yeah you can train with a guy who's 220

5370
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:23,520
that's that's easy they're not going to

5371
03:09:20,959 --> 03:09:24,559
hurt you and i mean there's there is a

5372
03:09:23,520 --> 03:09:26,640
truth that

5373
03:09:24,559 --> 03:09:28,639
you know lightweights and middleweights

5374
03:09:26,639 --> 03:09:31,039
in jiu jitsu and the same is true for

5375
03:09:28,639 --> 03:09:33,760
judo it's just like a lot more of them

5376
03:09:31,040 --> 03:09:34,560
that means if you want to be

5377
03:09:33,760 --> 03:09:37,120
is

5378
03:09:34,559 --> 03:09:38,238
you're just competing at a higher level

5379
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:40,560
so like

5380
03:09:38,238 --> 03:09:42,478
there's much more variety of games the

5381
03:09:40,559 --> 03:09:45,359
level is much higher so you're taking on

5382
03:09:42,478 --> 03:09:48,159
a bigger challenge even if you're like

5383
03:09:45,359 --> 03:09:49,680
um have a weight advantage so those are

5384
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:51,600
all decisions you have to kind of make

5385
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:53,040
and certainly jiu jitsu people that are

5386
03:09:51,600 --> 03:09:55,120
way cutting are silly i mean that's

5387
03:09:53,040 --> 03:09:56,399
that's the natural beginner thing to do

5388
03:09:55,120 --> 03:09:58,960
is to

5389
03:09:56,398 --> 03:10:01,119
feel um the way the nervousness about

5390
03:09:58,959 --> 03:10:03,599
competition expresses itself

5391
03:10:01,120 --> 03:10:05,600
is through the desire to be

5392
03:10:03,600 --> 03:10:08,399
as light as possible which is the

5393
03:10:05,600 --> 03:10:09,680
totally wrong desire to have right like

5394
03:10:08,398 --> 03:10:12,398
when you

5395
03:10:09,680 --> 03:10:13,359
when you look at me now i'm probably

5396
03:10:12,398 --> 03:10:14,719
like

5397
03:10:13,359 --> 03:10:16,079
230

5398
03:10:14,719 --> 03:10:18,799
right

5399
03:10:16,079 --> 03:10:19,840
but i probably have the strength of a 70

5400
03:10:18,799 --> 03:10:22,159
kilo

5401
03:10:19,840 --> 03:10:23,359
judo player yeah right the weight

5402
03:10:22,159 --> 03:10:25,359
doesn't really

5403
03:10:23,359 --> 03:10:26,399
do much yeah

5404
03:10:25,359 --> 03:10:28,640
i mean you have the same thing with

5405
03:10:26,398 --> 03:10:30,799
wrestling yeah the skinny the skinny

5406
03:10:28,639 --> 03:10:32,799
guys the skinny you that we're looking

5407
03:10:30,799 --> 03:10:34,799
at there just the amount of power in

5408
03:10:32,799 --> 03:10:36,238
that person yeah it's fascinating

5409
03:10:34,799 --> 03:10:38,398
because it doesn't look like you have

5410
03:10:36,238 --> 03:10:40,398
some muscle but it doesn't look but i

5411
03:10:38,398 --> 03:10:43,840
felt the power of some of those people

5412
03:10:40,398 --> 03:10:45,439
yeah uh it's scary yeah

5413
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:47,200
it's different that's the best way i can

5414
03:10:45,439 --> 03:10:49,760
describe it it's like scary it's like oh

5415
03:10:47,200 --> 03:10:52,479
[ __ ] again it's the food chain you're

5416
03:10:49,760 --> 03:10:53,920
not at the top of the future yeah

5417
03:10:52,478 --> 03:10:55,679
that's the that's the natural feeling

5418
03:10:53,920 --> 03:10:56,639
when you're going with some judo people

5419
03:10:55,680 --> 03:10:58,238
um

5420
03:10:56,639 --> 03:11:01,039
what's your sense about this recent

5421
03:10:58,238 --> 03:11:03,760
olympics what uh stands out to you

5422
03:11:01,040 --> 03:11:05,840
as uh so like uh teddy renair who was on

5423
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:07,200
a big run for a long time

5424
03:11:05,840 --> 03:11:09,840
man he considered to be one of the

5425
03:11:07,200 --> 03:11:10,960
greatest judo players of all time

5426
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:14,318
two-time

5427
03:11:10,959 --> 03:11:16,238
olympic gold medalist and uh

5428
03:11:14,318 --> 03:11:18,799
two-time olympic bronze medalist the

5429
03:11:16,238 --> 03:11:21,439
four-legged clothes yeah uh not counting

5430
03:11:18,799 --> 03:11:23,679
like team stuff just doing individual

5431
03:11:21,439 --> 03:11:25,439
and then like yeah i'm not 10 times

5432
03:11:23,680 --> 03:11:27,920
world champ yeah i'm not sure they're

5433
03:11:25,439 --> 03:11:29,200
going to catalog that team event like

5434
03:11:27,920 --> 03:11:31,040
are they all technically olympic

5435
03:11:29,200 --> 03:11:32,880
champions or is france an olympic

5436
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:34,319
champion no they're all technically

5437
03:11:32,879 --> 03:11:35,599
olympic champions but i'm going to

5438
03:11:34,318 --> 03:11:36,879
ignore that

5439
03:11:35,600 --> 03:11:39,120
is that how they're gonna classify it

5440
03:11:36,879 --> 03:11:41,759
now according oh sorry according to

5441
03:11:39,120 --> 03:11:43,439
wikipedia like according to the internet

5442
03:11:41,760 --> 03:11:44,719
i don't know according to igf or

5443
03:11:43,439 --> 03:11:46,079
whatever because you know some of those

5444
03:11:44,719 --> 03:11:48,559
players never

5445
03:11:46,079 --> 03:11:49,439
you know want a match they just filled a

5446
03:11:48,559 --> 03:11:52,318
spot

5447
03:11:49,439 --> 03:11:53,680
oh that's even a starker example oh

5448
03:11:52,318 --> 03:11:55,600
that's sad

5449
03:11:53,680 --> 03:11:57,840
you know they lost in the individual and

5450
03:11:55,600 --> 03:11:59,600
then they also lost in the team

5451
03:11:57,840 --> 03:12:01,520
and so

5452
03:11:59,600 --> 03:12:03,520
well it's interesting because in in the

5453
03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:04,640
case of uh teddy

5454
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:06,720
uh

5455
03:12:04,639 --> 03:12:09,519
he was a you know important to the win

5456
03:12:06,719 --> 03:12:12,959
against japan in this olympics so like

5457
03:12:09,520 --> 03:12:14,399
in the team event so like if you

5458
03:12:12,959 --> 03:12:17,119
i feel like you should put that in the

5459
03:12:14,398 --> 03:12:19,358
equation and say who won gold right it

5460
03:12:17,120 --> 03:12:20,160
it does feel like he won gold in the

5461
03:12:19,359 --> 03:12:22,079
team

5462
03:12:20,159 --> 03:12:25,359
because he carried the team well you

5463
03:12:22,079 --> 03:12:27,680
have like namura at 60 kilos from japan

5464
03:12:25,359 --> 03:12:29,040
three-time olympic gold medalist no team

5465
03:12:27,680 --> 03:12:30,800
event

5466
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:32,960
yeah

5467
03:12:30,799 --> 03:12:35,119
yeah are you gonna weigh teddy's team

5468
03:12:32,959 --> 03:12:36,799
event no no we're not we're not arguing

5469
03:12:35,120 --> 03:12:38,640
this of course no i'm just wondering how

5470
03:12:36,799 --> 03:12:41,840
like the ijf like when you look at a

5471
03:12:38,639 --> 03:12:44,639
player's stat yeah is it gonna be like

5472
03:12:41,840 --> 03:12:46,960
team gold medal for the olympics versus

5473
03:12:44,639 --> 03:12:49,920
like their own personal gold medal

5474
03:12:46,959 --> 03:12:51,438
yeah i think in sports we have to be

5475
03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:53,359
brutally honest

5476
03:12:51,439 --> 03:12:55,359
and i think i

5477
03:12:53,359 --> 03:12:57,920
hopefully this doesn't piss off people i

5478
03:12:55,359 --> 03:12:59,040
hope it does but judo is an individual

5479
03:12:57,920 --> 03:13:01,520
sport

5480
03:12:59,040 --> 03:13:03,760
it's honestly just that one athlete

5481
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:05,920
maybe the athlete and coach

5482
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:08,800
right if you look at the big big picture

5483
03:13:05,920 --> 03:13:10,639
but there's no there's no team in judo

5484
03:13:08,799 --> 03:13:13,358
that's the beauty of combat sports

5485
03:13:10,639 --> 03:13:15,760
that's the honesty of it that's the the

5486
03:13:13,359 --> 03:13:17,840
brutality of losing to another human

5487
03:13:15,760 --> 03:13:19,439
being in a combat sport that's why it's

5488
03:13:17,840 --> 03:13:22,079
so damn embarrassing when you get

5489
03:13:19,439 --> 03:13:23,200
slammed is because it's like you there's

5490
03:13:22,079 --> 03:13:24,879
no team

5491
03:13:23,200 --> 03:13:26,079
to uh uh

5492
03:13:24,879 --> 03:13:28,159
to like carry some of that

5493
03:13:26,079 --> 03:13:30,719
responsibility it's all on you and you

5494
03:13:28,159 --> 03:13:32,799
suck that's what you lost there's that

5495
03:13:30,719 --> 03:13:35,278
weight and that's why it's like magical

5496
03:13:32,799 --> 03:13:37,519
it's not it's not like soccer it's not

5497
03:13:35,279 --> 03:13:39,120
uh it's not like basketball yeah i

5498
03:13:37,520 --> 03:13:40,640
couldn't play team sports because if one

5499
03:13:39,120 --> 03:13:42,640
of my teammates

5500
03:13:40,639 --> 03:13:44,318
wasn't doing their job correctly i would

5501
03:13:42,639 --> 03:13:45,599
go play their position

5502
03:13:44,318 --> 03:13:47,439
i'm going to do it better than you yeah

5503
03:13:45,600 --> 03:13:49,120
but that you know some of the greatest

5504
03:13:47,439 --> 03:13:51,120
leaders of teams also do that michael

5505
03:13:49,120 --> 03:13:52,000
jordan is like that right i mean it's

5506
03:13:51,120 --> 03:13:54,239
like

5507
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:57,760
with your actions

5508
03:13:54,238 --> 03:13:59,359
you raise the the level for everybody

5509
03:13:57,760 --> 03:14:00,960
like excellence is expected and

5510
03:13:59,359 --> 03:14:03,600
therefore everybody needs to step up so

5511
03:14:00,959 --> 03:14:05,599
some some of the greatest uh i would say

5512
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:07,920
uh team leaders are

5513
03:14:05,600 --> 03:14:09,920
individualists at heart but so okay so

5514
03:14:07,920 --> 03:14:11,040
teddy i think ten time world champion

5515
03:14:09,920 --> 03:14:13,200
not team

5516
03:14:11,040 --> 03:14:14,800
regu regular uh

5517
03:14:13,200 --> 03:14:16,319
it's a big number but i think he has

5518
03:14:14,799 --> 03:14:18,079
some like open weight categories in

5519
03:14:16,318 --> 03:14:20,079
there open weight right right i mean you

5520
03:14:18,079 --> 03:14:21,039
can count those right i mean that that's

5521
03:14:20,079 --> 03:14:22,959
interesting

5522
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:24,560
it's the same division twice it's the

5523
03:14:22,959 --> 03:14:26,079
same division twice that's right one day

5524
03:14:24,559 --> 03:14:27,439
after another yeah that's right i don't

5525
03:14:26,079 --> 03:14:29,760
know if i want to

5526
03:14:27,439 --> 03:14:32,398
count that yeah well i mean that's one

5527
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:36,159
of the the reasons people don't usually

5528
03:14:32,398 --> 03:14:37,680
put heavy weights in judo as like the

5529
03:14:36,159 --> 03:14:39,439
greatest of all time

5530
03:14:37,680 --> 03:14:41,439
because the level of competition is

5531
03:14:39,439 --> 03:14:44,559
lower yes

5532
03:14:41,439 --> 03:14:46,398
uh but anyway he did lose in this match

5533
03:14:44,559 --> 03:14:49,278
to um

5534
03:14:46,398 --> 03:14:51,278
to a young russian yep uh tamerlan

5535
03:14:49,279 --> 03:14:54,159
besheath

5536
03:14:51,279 --> 03:14:56,319
match also not on the internet thank you

5537
03:14:54,159 --> 03:14:58,079
olympics i am definitely going to go on

5538
03:14:56,318 --> 03:14:59,519
some rants on the internet

5539
03:14:58,079 --> 03:15:01,920
because uh

5540
03:14:59,520 --> 03:15:03,439
as a fan of um olympics i feel like this

5541
03:15:01,920 --> 03:15:04,879
definitely needs to change

5542
03:15:03,439 --> 03:15:07,040
moving forward

5543
03:15:04,879 --> 03:15:08,959
the like every single major olympic

5544
03:15:07,040 --> 03:15:10,399
event i also like i also like random

5545
03:15:08,959 --> 03:15:12,000
sports like weightlifting even though i

5546
03:15:10,398 --> 03:15:14,559
don't do olympic weightlifting it's fun

5547
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:15,520
just to watch fun to watch such high

5548
03:15:14,559 --> 03:15:17,760
level

5549
03:15:15,520 --> 03:15:20,479
of excellence and the fact that we can't

5550
03:15:17,760 --> 03:15:22,800
just freaking watch the full

5551
03:15:20,478 --> 03:15:25,438
like each nicely categorized event is

5552
03:15:22,799 --> 03:15:27,519
really heartbreaking in judo in olympic

5553
03:15:25,439 --> 03:15:28,559
weightlifting and track and gymnastics

5554
03:15:27,520 --> 03:15:30,479
all of that

5555
03:15:28,559 --> 03:15:31,760
anyway uh

5556
03:15:30,478 --> 03:15:33,599
so teddy

5557
03:15:31,760 --> 03:15:35,680
lost i mean that does that stand out to

5558
03:15:33,600 --> 03:15:37,600
you if you were to like recap the things

5559
03:15:35,680 --> 03:15:39,920
that you remember from this olympics i

5560
03:15:37,600 --> 03:15:41,200
picked him losing already like in my

5561
03:15:39,920 --> 03:15:43,600
predictions

5562
03:15:41,200 --> 03:15:45,680
lose which where that match or just in

5563
03:15:43,600 --> 03:15:47,520
general somewhere in the final in the

5564
03:15:45,680 --> 03:15:49,920
final you thought yeah final or was it

5565
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:52,319
semi when i looked at his draw because

5566
03:15:49,920 --> 03:15:56,318
he decided not to compete throughout the

5567
03:15:52,318 --> 03:15:59,600
squad and do like the bare minimum to go

5568
03:15:56,318 --> 03:16:01,920
because of his age i didn't think

5569
03:15:59,600 --> 03:16:04,079
he would have enough energy to battle

5570
03:16:01,920 --> 03:16:06,719
his way through yeah the draw that he

5571
03:16:04,079 --> 03:16:09,039
had and sure enough he didn't he he felt

5572
03:16:06,719 --> 03:16:11,438
earlier than i thought but

5573
03:16:09,040 --> 03:16:13,359
he just he's not the young athletic

5574
03:16:11,439 --> 03:16:16,238
person he used to be

5575
03:16:13,359 --> 03:16:18,559
and when they changed the rules to judo

5576
03:16:16,238 --> 03:16:21,279
they allowed people to take people into

5577
03:16:18,559 --> 03:16:23,680
really really deep waters

5578
03:16:21,279 --> 03:16:25,680
which you saw at this olympics which

5579
03:16:23,680 --> 03:16:27,840
you know

5580
03:16:25,680 --> 03:16:28,800
it didn't ruin the sport or did it not

5581
03:16:27,840 --> 03:16:30,880
like

5582
03:16:28,799 --> 03:16:33,039
i'm not sure but it was definitely

5583
03:16:30,879 --> 03:16:34,559
difficult to watch

5584
03:16:33,040 --> 03:16:37,040
would you put him at the greatest of all

5585
03:16:34,559 --> 03:16:38,478
time or asked another way like who do

5586
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:39,680
you think is the greatest judo player of

5587
03:16:38,478 --> 03:16:41,519
all time

5588
03:16:39,680 --> 03:16:42,639
he's definitely not the greatest judo

5589
03:16:41,520 --> 03:16:45,439
player

5590
03:16:42,639 --> 03:16:46,799
but he's definitely the best competitor

5591
03:16:45,439 --> 03:16:48,880
what's the difference between judo

5592
03:16:46,799 --> 03:16:50,879
player and competitor there's an ability

5593
03:16:48,879 --> 03:16:53,839
to like

5594
03:16:50,879 --> 03:16:55,920
do the act of judo of like throwing

5595
03:16:53,840 --> 03:16:57,040
pinning arm locking

5596
03:16:55,920 --> 03:17:00,398
versus

5597
03:16:57,040 --> 03:17:01,600
can you win a judo match

5598
03:17:00,398 --> 03:17:03,599
right like when you look at somebody

5599
03:17:01,600 --> 03:17:06,159
like nomura who like

5600
03:17:03,600 --> 03:17:07,439
threw everyone he fought through three

5601
03:17:06,159 --> 03:17:09,439
olympics

5602
03:17:07,439 --> 03:17:10,960
multiple world championships multiple

5603
03:17:09,439 --> 03:17:13,520
things like

5604
03:17:10,959 --> 03:17:16,398
that's a pure judo player in the essence

5605
03:17:13,520 --> 03:17:18,000
of judo he can throw pin or arm lock

5606
03:17:16,398 --> 03:17:20,959
just about anybody he steps on the mat

5607
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:22,959
with during his time

5608
03:17:20,959 --> 03:17:25,278
teddy tended to

5609
03:17:22,959 --> 03:17:27,199
when you look at his judo

5610
03:17:25,279 --> 03:17:28,479
because of his size

5611
03:17:27,200 --> 03:17:30,239
again it's just because he's in the

5612
03:17:28,478 --> 03:17:34,159
heavyweight category

5613
03:17:30,238 --> 03:17:36,079
he was so much bigger so much stronger

5614
03:17:34,159 --> 03:17:38,079
people just couldn't handle it and you

5615
03:17:36,079 --> 03:17:38,959
would see really good judo players just

5616
03:17:38,079 --> 03:17:40,959
break

5617
03:17:38,959 --> 03:17:43,119
yeah like they could hang in there for a

5618
03:17:40,959 --> 03:17:45,039
little bit but eventually his size like

5619
03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:46,960
you can't control that weight

5620
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:49,359
weight moves weight and when you have to

5621
03:17:46,959 --> 03:17:52,238
use all your strength to keep him

5622
03:17:49,359 --> 03:17:53,680
upright and off of you your muscles just

5623
03:17:52,238 --> 03:17:55,680
give out because you don't have somebody

5624
03:17:53,680 --> 03:17:57,680
of that stature

5625
03:17:55,680 --> 03:17:59,520
and that skill like to train with to

5626
03:17:57,680 --> 03:18:01,680
train those muscles so what you're

5627
03:17:59,520 --> 03:18:04,880
thinking more like those uh

5628
03:18:01,680 --> 03:18:08,079
73 81 90 kg people that just stand in

5629
03:18:04,879 --> 03:18:10,079
the pocket and just give yeah everything

5630
03:18:08,079 --> 03:18:11,039
like what comes to my mind is like a

5631
03:18:10,079 --> 03:18:13,840
koga

5632
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:16,399
koga you know a namura who's a 60 kilo

5633
03:18:13,840 --> 03:18:19,359
guy but again like his dynamics

5634
03:18:16,398 --> 03:18:20,840
and how long he was dominant for

5635
03:18:19,359 --> 03:18:23,760
like it

5636
03:18:20,840 --> 03:18:26,318
just do you put value to like

5637
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:27,920
epic throws like singular moments of

5638
03:18:26,318 --> 03:18:29,760
greatness

5639
03:18:27,920 --> 03:18:32,559
if it's against

5640
03:18:29,760 --> 03:18:34,000
um a noteworthy player in a noteworthy

5641
03:18:32,559 --> 03:18:36,639
position

5642
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:38,719
there are a lot of highlights of people

5643
03:18:36,639 --> 03:18:40,398
that are good judo players but their

5644
03:18:38,719 --> 03:18:43,920
highlights are of

5645
03:18:40,398 --> 03:18:46,478
you know scrubs yeah on the ijf circuit

5646
03:18:43,920 --> 03:18:48,398
but it's like great the japanese guy

5647
03:18:46,478 --> 03:18:49,438
threw the guy from

5648
03:18:48,398 --> 03:18:51,599
you know

5649
03:18:49,439 --> 03:18:54,000
senegal free pwn

5650
03:18:51,600 --> 03:18:56,238
great we kind of expected that you took

5651
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:57,680
the world number one against the 330th

5652
03:18:56,238 --> 03:18:59,680
person in the world

5653
03:18:57,680 --> 03:19:01,439
what did you think was gonna happen like

5654
03:18:59,680 --> 03:19:04,238
when i see those highlights like thrown

5655
03:19:01,439 --> 03:19:05,600
around like social media i'm like that's

5656
03:19:04,238 --> 03:19:07,199
not a highlight

5657
03:19:05,600 --> 03:19:09,520
they might as well have just been at the

5658
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:12,399
dojo like practice and throws if you

5659
03:19:09,520 --> 03:19:15,520
look at the like top 10 list for judo

5660
03:19:12,398 --> 03:19:18,398
kano always comes up you know as um but

5661
03:19:15,520 --> 03:19:20,560
he's not somebody that i don't think his

5662
03:19:18,398 --> 03:19:22,238
results are there but you don't really

5663
03:19:20,559 --> 03:19:23,519
know how he

5664
03:19:22,238 --> 03:19:25,760
got there

5665
03:19:23,520 --> 03:19:28,640
so it's hard for me to like i can't see

5666
03:19:25,760 --> 03:19:29,920
his judo yeah so i'm not sure kano by

5667
03:19:28,639 --> 03:19:31,599
the way is the founder of judo for

5668
03:19:29,920 --> 03:19:33,279
people who don't or considered to be the

5669
03:19:31,600 --> 03:19:35,680
founder of judo yeah

5670
03:19:33,279 --> 03:19:37,439
the sport evolves yeah the players that

5671
03:19:35,680 --> 03:19:38,960
are like if you took champions from the

5672
03:19:37,439 --> 03:19:40,398
past and you fought them against the

5673
03:19:38,959 --> 03:19:41,519
players of today

5674
03:19:40,398 --> 03:19:43,519
they're

5675
03:19:41,520 --> 03:19:44,720
it's not happening and that goes with

5676
03:19:43,520 --> 03:19:46,319
anything right

5677
03:19:44,719 --> 03:19:47,920
so every time you think of like who's

5678
03:19:46,318 --> 03:19:49,439
the best of all time

5679
03:19:47,920 --> 03:19:52,159
it's probably somebody within a

5680
03:19:49,439 --> 03:19:53,520
generation or two of today yeah if i'm

5681
03:19:52,159 --> 03:19:56,318
gonna pick my

5682
03:19:53,520 --> 03:19:57,439
my top three let's say top three and i

5683
03:19:56,318 --> 03:19:59,439
would go

5684
03:19:57,439 --> 03:20:02,639
generationally speaking

5685
03:19:59,439 --> 03:20:04,960
i would pick ono for today

5686
03:20:02,639 --> 03:20:07,920
probably illiadus for like

5687
03:20:04,959 --> 03:20:09,919
my time frame like the

5688
03:20:07,920 --> 03:20:12,159
from a developmental standpoint and then

5689
03:20:09,920 --> 03:20:14,639
i'd probably go koga and then before

5690
03:20:12,159 --> 03:20:17,200
koga i'd probably go nomura

5691
03:20:14,639 --> 03:20:20,079
as like the person of that generation

5692
03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:20,079
that people like

5693
03:20:20,238 --> 03:20:25,439
as a whole in judo respected

5694
03:20:23,120 --> 03:20:27,200
yeah well in the case of uh i wonder if

5695
03:20:25,439 --> 03:20:29,200
people feared koga

5696
03:20:27,200 --> 03:20:31,279
yeah yeah

5697
03:20:29,200 --> 03:20:33,120
like here that that little guy's gonna

5698
03:20:31,279 --> 03:20:35,600
get under you and you're gonna go for a

5699
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:37,359
ride you know he was 78 kilos when he

5700
03:20:35,600 --> 03:20:39,680
took second at the all japans which is

5701
03:20:37,359 --> 03:20:41,359
an open weight class yeah

5702
03:20:39,680 --> 03:20:43,120
you know like he

5703
03:20:41,359 --> 03:20:45,680
he could throw down with anybody any

5704
03:20:43,120 --> 03:20:48,079
weight class and still win he was one of

5705
03:20:45,680 --> 03:20:51,520
the early people that planted the seed

5706
03:20:48,079 --> 03:20:53,439
uh of judo love of judonia like yeah

5707
03:20:51,520 --> 03:20:56,399
and when i looked at him like

5708
03:20:53,439 --> 03:20:58,800
that was how like i wanted my judo to be

5709
03:20:56,398 --> 03:20:59,760
portrayed that style

5710
03:20:58,799 --> 03:21:02,238
yeah

5711
03:20:59,760 --> 03:21:03,600
and then elias iliadus you just like i

5712
03:21:02,238 --> 03:21:05,279
mean you have a similar attitude with

5713
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:06,840
him mm-hmm so you just like the way he

5714
03:21:05,279 --> 03:21:09,279
cares that's why we get along

5715
03:21:06,840 --> 03:21:11,040
[Laughter]

5716
03:21:09,279 --> 03:21:12,880
you guys hang out anyway i'd love to see

5717
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:15,120
that conversation i remember when we

5718
03:21:12,879 --> 03:21:16,478
were talking about like his coaching i

5719
03:21:15,120 --> 03:21:18,000
was like

5720
03:21:16,478 --> 03:21:20,238
why didn't you take this team or like

5721
03:21:18,000 --> 03:21:21,760
why'd you pick this team and he's like i

5722
03:21:20,238 --> 03:21:23,760
can't work with those people like those

5723
03:21:21,760 --> 03:21:25,600
people are weak they're children

5724
03:21:23,760 --> 03:21:27,439
like they don't know how to train hard

5725
03:21:25,600 --> 03:21:28,640
i love that guy

5726
03:21:27,439 --> 03:21:30,479
uh what about ono because he was

5727
03:21:28,639 --> 03:21:33,199
competing in this olympics he got he got

5728
03:21:30,478 --> 03:21:35,438
gold in this olympics right uh

5729
03:21:33,200 --> 03:21:37,439
yeah yeah he lost in the team tournament

5730
03:21:35,439 --> 03:21:39,120
though i think he just didn't care yeah

5731
03:21:37,439 --> 03:21:41,600
he just really wanted to throw that guy

5732
03:21:39,120 --> 03:21:43,520
he like throws everybody yeah

5733
03:21:41,600 --> 03:21:44,800
so he's he represents the thing you're

5734
03:21:43,520 --> 03:21:47,760
mentioning

5735
03:21:44,799 --> 03:21:50,159
i signed up to the judo fanatics best of

5736
03:21:47,760 --> 03:21:52,238
uh ono is there something that stands

5737
03:21:50,159 --> 03:21:55,039
out to you about him that's especially

5738
03:21:52,238 --> 03:21:56,799
you find beautiful like or powerful

5739
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:57,760
about his technique

5740
03:21:56,799 --> 03:22:00,639
um

5741
03:21:57,760 --> 03:22:03,120
his adaptability to the situations and

5742
03:22:00,639 --> 03:22:05,439
understanding of

5743
03:22:03,120 --> 03:22:07,040
like what needs to happen in order to

5744
03:22:05,439 --> 03:22:09,520
throw these people

5745
03:22:07,040 --> 03:22:11,120
i specifically watched a match

5746
03:22:09,520 --> 03:22:13,359
with his and i was going to do a

5747
03:22:11,120 --> 03:22:14,720
breakdown video on it because

5748
03:22:13,359 --> 03:22:17,600
is there a match do you remember what it

5749
03:22:14,719 --> 03:22:19,358
is it's him versus

5750
03:22:17,600 --> 03:22:21,920
garvey of

5751
03:22:19,359 --> 03:22:24,800
hungary um is he good at gripping so

5752
03:22:21,920 --> 03:22:27,279
we're watching the match against hungary

5753
03:22:24,799 --> 03:22:29,358
uh so the one minute comes right here

5754
03:22:27,279 --> 03:22:31,840
coming up i've heard he's freakishly

5755
03:22:29,359 --> 03:22:33,680
strong i've never had the ability to to

5756
03:22:31,840 --> 03:22:36,719
train with him so i'm not

5757
03:22:33,680 --> 03:22:38,318
obviously looks super skinny

5758
03:22:36,719 --> 03:22:39,599
but but when you see him without his key

5759
03:22:38,318 --> 03:22:41,600
jacket on like

5760
03:22:39,600 --> 03:22:42,600
he's a jack dude

5761
03:22:41,600 --> 03:22:44,640
which is

5762
03:22:42,600 --> 03:22:46,479
uncharacteristic of a japanese player

5763
03:22:44,639 --> 03:22:48,159
from back in the day

5764
03:22:46,478 --> 03:22:49,599
in a way changed all that he was like

5765
03:22:48,159 --> 03:22:51,359
we're gonna get physical to compete with

5766
03:22:49,600 --> 03:22:53,279
the europeans that's another one of the

5767
03:22:51,359 --> 03:22:56,000
greats right and yeah he doesn't get

5768
03:22:53,279 --> 03:22:56,000
mentioned enough

5769
03:23:01,200 --> 03:23:04,159
and he's a righty here yeah

5770
03:23:03,279 --> 03:23:05,600
okay

5771
03:23:04,159 --> 03:23:07,600
and this is where he starts setting it

5772
03:23:05,600 --> 03:23:09,120
up it's like you can see he was standing

5773
03:23:07,600 --> 03:23:09,870
in like a left-handed stance and then he

5774
03:23:09,120 --> 03:23:11,760
changes

5775
03:23:09,870 --> 03:23:15,520
[Laughter]

5776
03:23:11,760 --> 03:23:17,760
so he grips almost like a double uh

5777
03:23:15,520 --> 03:23:20,560
uh double sleeve not a double sleeve

5778
03:23:17,760 --> 03:23:22,960
tricep the tricep and the the front

5779
03:23:20,559 --> 03:23:26,079
sleeve standing like a lefty

5780
03:23:22,959 --> 03:23:29,039
and no body grip just correct tricep and

5781
03:23:26,079 --> 03:23:32,719
sleeve and it was like the the biggest

5782
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:34,319
whip and twist of a of a new chamada

5783
03:23:32,719 --> 03:23:36,159
yeah he doesn't actually lift him off

5784
03:23:34,318 --> 03:23:38,559
the floor yeah and

5785
03:23:36,159 --> 03:23:40,159
if you look at it in like slow motion

5786
03:23:38,559 --> 03:23:42,159
almost

5787
03:23:40,159 --> 03:23:44,478
um

5788
03:23:42,159 --> 03:23:45,600
yeah let's yeah there we go

5789
03:23:44,478 --> 03:23:48,000
um

5790
03:23:45,600 --> 03:23:51,200
the hungarian player was like a hundred

5791
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:52,719
percent defense and he still did this

5792
03:23:51,200 --> 03:23:54,880
right so

5793
03:23:52,719 --> 03:23:57,599
right here like press pause

5794
03:23:54,879 --> 03:23:59,519
this this is like

5795
03:23:57,600 --> 03:24:01,439
and identify if you're trying to like

5796
03:23:59,520 --> 03:24:02,159
learn judo and figure out how to set it

5797
03:24:01,439 --> 03:24:04,960
up

5798
03:24:02,159 --> 03:24:06,318
because knowing how to get to the point

5799
03:24:04,959 --> 03:24:08,398
right before you pull the trigger is

5800
03:24:06,318 --> 03:24:10,799
probably the most important

5801
03:24:08,398 --> 03:24:12,559
so when we watch this play out what ono

5802
03:24:10,799 --> 03:24:14,398
ono's going to do is he's going to pivot

5803
03:24:12,559 --> 03:24:16,079
off his right leg right here

5804
03:24:14,398 --> 03:24:18,719
he's going to back step with his left

5805
03:24:16,079 --> 03:24:20,318
and it's going to pull um garvey's front

5806
03:24:18,719 --> 03:24:22,959
leg all the way forward into what we

5807
03:24:20,318 --> 03:24:25,039
would call like a neutral square stance

5808
03:24:22,959 --> 03:24:26,559
so he plants hard

5809
03:24:25,040 --> 03:24:28,319
and look at there's an interesting pull

5810
03:24:26,559 --> 03:24:30,799
with the track oh no it's not try so he

5811
03:24:28,318 --> 03:24:31,920
almost like if he starts with the tricep

5812
03:24:30,799 --> 03:24:33,358
and he like collects the gear or

5813
03:24:31,920 --> 03:24:35,359
something like that but it's still above

5814
03:24:33,359 --> 03:24:37,920
the elbow because you can see the bend

5815
03:24:35,359 --> 03:24:40,960
right and right here see how he never

5816
03:24:37,920 --> 03:24:41,760
put back it up a little bit

5817
03:24:40,959 --> 03:24:43,519
that

5818
03:24:41,760 --> 03:24:45,279
this is kind of like one of those things

5819
03:24:43,520 --> 03:24:47,760
yeah pause it right there

5820
03:24:45,279 --> 03:24:50,399
so when he puts his right foot down he's

5821
03:24:47,760 --> 03:24:52,238
pulling so hard with his back

5822
03:24:50,398 --> 03:24:54,879
that when ono goes to put his left foot

5823
03:24:52,238 --> 03:24:57,199
down it never touches the mat

5824
03:24:54,879 --> 03:24:58,879
but by putting his left foot back

5825
03:24:57,200 --> 03:25:00,319
it actually pulls him garvey's foot

5826
03:24:58,879 --> 03:25:02,238
forward

5827
03:25:00,318 --> 03:25:04,719
and so he's able to speed up his throw

5828
03:25:02,238 --> 03:25:06,478
by just continuing that motion back yeah

5829
03:25:04,719 --> 03:25:07,760
which what was supposed to have been a

5830
03:25:06,478 --> 03:25:09,679
step

5831
03:25:07,760 --> 03:25:12,159
turned out to just

5832
03:25:09,680 --> 03:25:13,920
in the middle of the action he makes a

5833
03:25:12,159 --> 03:25:16,000
split second decision before putting the

5834
03:25:13,920 --> 03:25:18,079
foot down to just continue yeah because

5835
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:20,238
he recognizes that feel in his hands

5836
03:25:18,079 --> 03:25:22,000
yeah and so it's like it never it's a

5837
03:25:20,238 --> 03:25:24,079
swing like he never touches the guard

5838
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:26,559
but it never it never started as like a

5839
03:25:24,079 --> 03:25:28,478
big swing to a back step yeah he changed

5840
03:25:26,559 --> 03:25:29,359
his mind part way through so it's right

5841
03:25:28,478 --> 03:25:31,760
there

5842
03:25:29,359 --> 03:25:32,880
right yeah and then he goes nope he's

5843
03:25:31,760 --> 03:25:36,318
bringing that foot forward i'm just

5844
03:25:32,879 --> 03:25:37,599
gonna go for it and wait is he full like

5845
03:25:36,318 --> 03:25:38,639
full air

5846
03:25:37,600 --> 03:25:41,200
look at that

5847
03:25:38,639 --> 03:25:44,559
boom boom and look at if you go a few

5848
03:25:41,200 --> 03:25:46,239
more steps forward right there his hip

5849
03:25:44,559 --> 03:25:48,000
is the same height as um garvey's

5850
03:25:46,238 --> 03:25:50,398
shoulder yeah

5851
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:52,879
because he's leaning so far into the

5852
03:25:50,398 --> 03:25:55,278
throw with his body weight

5853
03:25:52,879 --> 03:25:57,599
and he's allowing that tricep grip to

5854
03:25:55,279 --> 03:25:58,640
rotate that's going to draw and garvey

5855
03:25:57,600 --> 03:26:01,040
forward

5856
03:25:58,639 --> 03:26:03,439
and now when you pause it right here

5857
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:06,960
you think about the sheer physics to

5858
03:26:03,439 --> 03:26:09,439
like get your body into this position

5859
03:26:06,959 --> 03:26:11,519
jimmy and i were so like when we saw

5860
03:26:09,439 --> 03:26:13,600
this for the first time we tried to just

5861
03:26:11,520 --> 03:26:14,560
stand like that and we couldn't do it

5862
03:26:13,600 --> 03:26:17,040
his

5863
03:26:14,559 --> 03:26:19,680
left foot is pointing straight ahead

5864
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:21,600
his chest is perpendicular to that foot

5865
03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:23,840
or parallel with it right and his head

5866
03:26:21,600 --> 03:26:25,600
is by his foot yeah is that only

5867
03:26:23,840 --> 03:26:27,760
possible in the midst of a throw do you

5868
03:26:25,600 --> 03:26:29,040
think he works on making like i think

5869
03:26:27,760 --> 03:26:31,200
he's done

5870
03:26:29,040 --> 03:26:33,920
this particular throw not this style of

5871
03:26:31,200 --> 03:26:35,600
it but uchimada so much yeah that his

5872
03:26:33,920 --> 03:26:38,000
body has adapted

5873
03:26:35,600 --> 03:26:39,600
to be able to do this so when people are

5874
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:43,120
trying to learn and like break down

5875
03:26:39,600 --> 03:26:46,720
videos yeah they don't understand like

5876
03:26:43,120 --> 03:26:48,399
the power he has and what we call end

5877
03:26:46,719 --> 03:26:50,159
range motion

5878
03:26:48,398 --> 03:26:52,639
yeah look at that so like look at the

5879
03:26:50,159 --> 03:26:56,238
full range of motion he takes right yeah

5880
03:26:52,639 --> 03:26:58,478
that left foot swings all the way around

5881
03:26:56,238 --> 03:27:00,879
and the torso starts

5882
03:26:58,478 --> 03:27:02,639
like at three o'clock and it goes all

5883
03:27:00,879 --> 03:27:04,719
the way around

5884
03:27:02,639 --> 03:27:08,238
like almost back to the three o'clock

5885
03:27:04,719 --> 03:27:12,000
yeah like like like that what it and he

5886
03:27:08,238 --> 03:27:12,000
never lifts his leg above his hip

5887
03:27:12,719 --> 03:27:17,438
and the crazy part is he never fell over

5888
03:27:15,120 --> 03:27:18,960
during any of it yeah look at that

5889
03:27:17,439 --> 03:27:21,439
stayed on his feet

5890
03:27:18,959 --> 03:27:23,438
what's he doing

5891
03:27:21,439 --> 03:27:24,318
is that is that a matter of pride or

5892
03:27:23,439 --> 03:27:26,479
just

5893
03:27:24,318 --> 03:27:28,959
i think that's just habit

5894
03:27:26,478 --> 03:27:31,358
the way the forces work like he can just

5895
03:27:28,959 --> 03:27:32,799
stay up

5896
03:27:31,359 --> 03:27:35,520
i that's one of the most beautiful

5897
03:27:32,799 --> 03:27:38,639
throws i've ever seen

5898
03:27:35,520 --> 03:27:40,399
there's so much wrong with it

5899
03:27:38,639 --> 03:27:41,519
but it worked it worked because when you

5900
03:27:40,398 --> 03:27:43,278
think about remember what we talked

5901
03:27:41,520 --> 03:27:45,040
about the very beginning like he's got

5902
03:27:43,279 --> 03:27:46,640
to get his center of gravity under his

5903
03:27:45,040 --> 03:27:48,080
wow well here's one of the top players

5904
03:27:46,639 --> 03:27:50,159
in the world throwing another top player

5905
03:27:48,079 --> 03:27:53,520
in the world with his hip at that guy's

5906
03:27:50,159 --> 03:27:55,200
shoulder height and it's still working

5907
03:27:53,520 --> 03:27:57,600
it's

5908
03:27:55,200 --> 03:28:00,239
okay so he this generation he could be

5909
03:27:57,600 --> 03:28:01,760
the great yeah and like he switched a

5910
03:28:00,238 --> 03:28:04,000
lot of those

5911
03:28:01,760 --> 03:28:06,079
details of the throw in the middle in

5912
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:07,840
the middle and that that only is that

5913
03:28:06,079 --> 03:28:11,120
means he's probably what like a hundred

5914
03:28:07,840 --> 03:28:12,960
thousand times that throws happen yeah

5915
03:28:11,120 --> 03:28:14,640
i saw you were into chess recently so

5916
03:28:12,959 --> 03:28:16,559
you're like me

5917
03:28:14,639 --> 03:28:17,358
a bit of a beginner in chess

5918
03:28:16,559 --> 03:28:18,959
you're

5919
03:28:17,359 --> 03:28:20,318
part of launching the website effective

5920
03:28:18,959 --> 03:28:22,559
chess

5921
03:28:20,318 --> 03:28:24,799
so i got to ask maybe it's a personal

5922
03:28:22,559 --> 03:28:26,478
question but uh do you have advice to

5923
03:28:24,799 --> 03:28:28,238
yourself and to other beginners in

5924
03:28:26,478 --> 03:28:30,639
exploring chess

5925
03:28:28,238 --> 03:28:32,478
of how to one have fun and to

5926
03:28:30,639 --> 03:28:35,278
start getting good it's nice to see like

5927
03:28:32,478 --> 03:28:36,398
olympic caliber athlete

5928
03:28:35,279 --> 03:28:38,800
take on

5929
03:28:36,398 --> 03:28:40,959
a difficult

5930
03:28:38,799 --> 03:28:44,000
task with a beginner's mind so like

5931
03:28:40,959 --> 03:28:45,358
what's that process like i'm a huge fan

5932
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:47,840
of just

5933
03:28:45,359 --> 03:28:49,040
learning new things in general

5934
03:28:47,840 --> 03:28:51,760
right like

5935
03:28:49,040 --> 03:28:55,439
when i left judo like i took a job as

5936
03:28:51,760 --> 03:28:56,478
you know marketing for fuji sports

5937
03:28:55,439 --> 03:28:58,238
and

5938
03:28:56,478 --> 03:28:58,959
i was getting frustrated with designers

5939
03:28:58,238 --> 03:29:00,559
so

5940
03:28:58,959 --> 03:29:02,639
i learned photoshop

5941
03:29:00,559 --> 03:29:04,879
i also got angry with a photographer so

5942
03:29:02,639 --> 03:29:06,879
now i take all the photos too

5943
03:29:04,879 --> 03:29:09,839
just because i don't mind learning you

5944
03:29:06,879 --> 03:29:11,119
know i've spent my entire judo career

5945
03:29:09,840 --> 03:29:13,040
learning

5946
03:29:11,120 --> 03:29:16,399
all the time like adding new techniques

5947
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:18,080
finding new ways practicing developing

5948
03:29:16,398 --> 03:29:20,478
and so when it comes to

5949
03:29:18,079 --> 03:29:22,959
chess i treat it just like i do anything

5950
03:29:20,478 --> 03:29:25,199
else i just stick to one plan

5951
03:29:22,959 --> 03:29:26,478
and i learn all the ins and outs of that

5952
03:29:25,200 --> 03:29:29,359
one plan

5953
03:29:26,478 --> 03:29:31,119
and then i develop another plan right

5954
03:29:29,359 --> 03:29:33,200
like i might practice

5955
03:29:31,120 --> 03:29:35,600
like a london opening for example and

5956
03:29:33,200 --> 03:29:37,680
just i don't even care if i win or lose

5957
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:38,800
i just want to figure out how i'm going

5958
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:40,398
to lose

5959
03:29:38,799 --> 03:29:41,840
and then figure out how i'm going to win

5960
03:29:40,398 --> 03:29:44,318
and once i know

5961
03:29:41,840 --> 03:29:46,159
that position is now done then i start

5962
03:29:44,318 --> 03:29:47,840
with another position

5963
03:29:46,159 --> 03:29:49,520
and then once i've figured out how i'm

5964
03:29:47,840 --> 03:29:51,200
going to lose and how i'm going to win

5965
03:29:49,520 --> 03:29:53,600
the next thing i do is i don't go to a

5966
03:29:51,200 --> 03:29:55,040
third i figure out the bridge between

5967
03:29:53,600 --> 03:29:56,880
the two

5968
03:29:55,040 --> 03:29:59,359
like at what point during my openings

5969
03:29:56,879 --> 03:30:01,278
can i transition back into this opening

5970
03:29:59,359 --> 03:30:03,279
right so like you

5971
03:30:01,279 --> 03:30:04,720
have like some basic openings and you

5972
03:30:03,279 --> 03:30:06,159
want to see how they go wrong how they

5973
03:30:04,719 --> 03:30:08,159
go right all the different ways and then

5974
03:30:06,159 --> 03:30:09,600
that starts to solidify

5975
03:30:08,159 --> 03:30:10,959
a higher level concept of that

5976
03:30:09,600 --> 03:30:12,800
particular opening and you start to

5977
03:30:10,959 --> 03:30:14,559
stitch together the concept the concepts

5978
03:30:12,799 --> 03:30:17,759
together because being able to go from

5979
03:30:14,559 --> 03:30:18,719
one to another and then back and forth

5980
03:30:17,760 --> 03:30:20,238
is

5981
03:30:18,719 --> 03:30:23,519
part of the reasons why like i was

5982
03:30:20,238 --> 03:30:25,119
successful at judo is just because

5983
03:30:23,520 --> 03:30:27,520
everything i do

5984
03:30:25,120 --> 03:30:29,359
at some point it touches that spider web

5985
03:30:27,520 --> 03:30:30,479
of like being able to get from one area

5986
03:30:29,359 --> 03:30:32,318
to another

5987
03:30:30,478 --> 03:30:34,478
we refer to it as like a toolbox right

5988
03:30:32,318 --> 03:30:35,840
you need more tools in your toolbox

5989
03:30:34,478 --> 03:30:37,840
but if you're always grabbing the wrong

5990
03:30:35,840 --> 03:30:40,079
tool for the right for that job then

5991
03:30:37,840 --> 03:30:42,478
you're just not going to have success

5992
03:30:40,079 --> 03:30:44,079
i actually forgot to ask you mentioned

5993
03:30:42,478 --> 03:30:46,000
a few greatest chess players of all time

5994
03:30:44,079 --> 03:30:48,559
and i noticed he didn't mention vladimir

5995
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:49,760
putin i gotta ask you about

5996
03:30:48,559 --> 03:30:52,318
um

5997
03:30:49,760 --> 03:30:54,960
his judo do you by chance know much

5998
03:30:52,318 --> 03:30:56,238
about his judo what do you think about

5999
03:30:54,959 --> 03:30:58,719
you know

6000
03:30:56,238 --> 03:31:00,719
a president of a major nation being a

6001
03:30:58,719 --> 03:31:02,000
judo black belt and i think from

6002
03:31:00,719 --> 03:31:03,920
what i've seen

6003
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:07,439
pretty good at it

6004
03:31:03,920 --> 03:31:09,920
i think it shows you know if he

6005
03:31:07,439 --> 03:31:11,680
if he actually got it like let's let's

6006
03:31:09,920 --> 03:31:13,120
go with that premise of like he earned

6007
03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:14,238
it

6008
03:31:13,120 --> 03:31:17,359
right

6009
03:31:14,238 --> 03:31:19,279
that just shows like a level of like

6010
03:31:17,359 --> 03:31:20,318
physical persistence

6011
03:31:19,279 --> 03:31:24,000
and

6012
03:31:20,318 --> 03:31:25,519
mental fortitude to be able to like

6013
03:31:24,000 --> 03:31:27,439
you know take those

6014
03:31:25,520 --> 03:31:30,000
beatings and just keep showing up until

6015
03:31:27,439 --> 03:31:32,238
you've overcome yeah and can now give

6016
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:34,318
those beatings as you know in japan and

6017
03:31:32,238 --> 03:31:35,840
russia you get it by just like

6018
03:31:34,318 --> 03:31:37,600
when you're young it's easier to get a

6019
03:31:35,840 --> 03:31:39,359
black belt when you're like just go

6020
03:31:37,600 --> 03:31:41,439
through a bunch of beatings

6021
03:31:39,359 --> 03:31:44,079
for like 10 years in your in your

6022
03:31:41,439 --> 03:31:45,040
teenage years uh but there's also from

6023
03:31:44,079 --> 03:31:46,079
it

6024
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:48,479
um

6025
03:31:46,079 --> 03:31:50,159
springs like a camaraderie like there's

6026
03:31:48,478 --> 03:31:53,039
a definitely a brotherhood

6027
03:31:50,159 --> 03:31:55,279
and and sisterhood in terms of judo

6028
03:31:53,040 --> 03:31:57,760
to where you're you're connected

6029
03:31:55,279 --> 03:31:59,279
forever because of that yeah for many

6030
03:31:57,760 --> 03:32:01,439
people it's their childhood connection

6031
03:31:59,279 --> 03:32:03,279
you sort of leave judo

6032
03:32:01,439 --> 03:32:04,800
you know in your 20s and your 30s but

6033
03:32:03,279 --> 03:32:06,720
that's always there and the same is true

6034
03:32:04,799 --> 03:32:10,639
with wrestling so it's it's interesting

6035
03:32:06,719 --> 03:32:12,000
to see him uh pay respect to that

6036
03:32:10,639 --> 03:32:13,199
like by going

6037
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:16,000
uh with the

6038
03:32:13,200 --> 03:32:17,600
with the russian national judo team and

6039
03:32:16,000 --> 03:32:19,600
i think he did obviously they they have

6040
03:32:17,600 --> 03:32:20,559
to get thrown right but just you can

6041
03:32:19,600 --> 03:32:22,159
tell

6042
03:32:20,559 --> 03:32:24,398
and you probably can tell even better

6043
03:32:22,159 --> 03:32:26,398
but you can tell when a person moves

6044
03:32:24,398 --> 03:32:27,439
in a way where you're like okay you've

6045
03:32:26,398 --> 03:32:29,680
had

6046
03:32:27,439 --> 03:32:31,439
like 10 years of beatings

6047
03:32:29,680 --> 03:32:33,439
you can tell yeah the way they pull the

6048
03:32:31,439 --> 03:32:36,639
way they move yeah but i also like in

6049
03:32:33,439 --> 03:32:37,439
contrast to the us national team

6050
03:32:36,639 --> 03:32:38,959
or

6051
03:32:37,439 --> 03:32:40,720
the i don't even think there's a

6052
03:32:38,959 --> 03:32:44,318
national team for us right

6053
03:32:40,719 --> 03:32:44,318
it's the pedro judo center right

6054
03:32:44,719 --> 03:32:47,760
that there is some

6055
03:32:46,478 --> 03:32:49,519
it's really cool when there's a

6056
03:32:47,760 --> 03:32:51,520
camaraderie like that amongst the

6057
03:32:49,520 --> 03:32:53,600
highest level olympic caliber athletes

6058
03:32:51,520 --> 03:32:55,439
in russia i suppose japan might have

6059
03:32:53,600 --> 03:32:56,720
similar kind of thing and and then you

6060
03:32:55,439 --> 03:32:59,279
have

6061
03:32:56,719 --> 03:33:01,278
then you can have the system

6062
03:32:59,279 --> 03:33:03,520
of people together and then you can have

6063
03:33:01,279 --> 03:33:05,439
a strong coaching staff not just like a

6064
03:33:03,520 --> 03:33:07,120
coach but a coaching staff and you can

6065
03:33:05,439 --> 03:33:08,880
have the nation backing that stuff i

6066
03:33:07,120 --> 03:33:11,359
mean yeah and then the result is like

6067
03:33:08,879 --> 03:33:12,639
you have some incredible level of judo

6068
03:33:11,359 --> 03:33:13,920
emerge

6069
03:33:12,639 --> 03:33:15,680
um

6070
03:33:13,920 --> 03:33:18,238
is there something you could say we did

6071
03:33:15,680 --> 03:33:21,760
we didn't talk much about jimmy i mean

6072
03:33:18,238 --> 03:33:22,478
he was a critical part of your just

6073
03:33:21,760 --> 03:33:25,279
like

6074
03:33:22,478 --> 03:33:27,199
of your perseverance through all the

6075
03:33:25,279 --> 03:33:29,520
all that you had to go through um what

6076
03:33:27,200 --> 03:33:31,359
did you learn from jimmy

6077
03:33:29,520 --> 03:33:32,560
what are some impacts that he had on

6078
03:33:31,359 --> 03:33:35,840
your life

6079
03:33:32,559 --> 03:33:36,959
both on the mat and off the mat

6080
03:33:35,840 --> 03:33:38,880
you know

6081
03:33:36,959 --> 03:33:41,679
if we had to like

6082
03:33:38,879 --> 03:33:44,639
put it down to like a very simple thing

6083
03:33:41,680 --> 03:33:44,639
he taught me how to win

6084
03:33:44,799 --> 03:33:47,358
right it wasn't necessarily

6085
03:33:46,478 --> 03:33:49,920
like

6086
03:33:47,359 --> 03:33:51,840
the technical side of judo like we went

6087
03:33:49,920 --> 03:33:53,520
over gripping we went over this we

6088
03:33:51,840 --> 03:33:56,398
adapted that

6089
03:33:53,520 --> 03:33:58,319
but the real strength to jimmy was like

6090
03:33:56,398 --> 03:34:00,559
he knows how to win

6091
03:33:58,318 --> 03:34:01,920
and most people think

6092
03:34:00,559 --> 03:34:03,920
well if i get really good at this

6093
03:34:01,920 --> 03:34:05,520
technique i'll be able to throw people

6094
03:34:03,920 --> 03:34:08,000
with it not win

6095
03:34:05,520 --> 03:34:09,120
that is not how the world of sports

6096
03:34:08,000 --> 03:34:10,799
works

6097
03:34:09,120 --> 03:34:11,680
right like

6098
03:34:10,799 --> 03:34:13,278
i

6099
03:34:11,680 --> 03:34:15,439
remember in one of my youtube videos i

6100
03:34:13,279 --> 03:34:17,840
was doing a breakdown of a match

6101
03:34:15,439 --> 03:34:20,079
from the cuba grand prix where i was

6102
03:34:17,840 --> 03:34:22,159
fighting a mongolian guy he's kicking

6103
03:34:20,079 --> 03:34:24,159
the [ __ ] at me not gonna lie

6104
03:34:22,159 --> 03:34:25,520
four minutes in like

6105
03:34:24,159 --> 03:34:27,359
he was just

6106
03:34:25,520 --> 03:34:29,680
throwing me like left and right he was

6107
03:34:27,359 --> 03:34:31,040
so fast i felt like i just couldn't get

6108
03:34:29,680 --> 03:34:33,279
to him

6109
03:34:31,040 --> 03:34:36,560
in the last 30 seconds

6110
03:34:33,279 --> 03:34:37,439
he changed he started protecting his

6111
03:34:36,559 --> 03:34:39,119
lead

6112
03:34:37,439 --> 03:34:41,760
instead of continuing the fight the way

6113
03:34:39,120 --> 03:34:43,359
the entire match was going in his favor

6114
03:34:41,760 --> 03:34:45,920
he made a mental shift and when he made

6115
03:34:43,359 --> 03:34:47,840
that mental shift i beat him yeah

6116
03:34:45,920 --> 03:34:50,079
because he didn't know how

6117
03:34:47,840 --> 03:34:52,639
to win the fight

6118
03:34:50,079 --> 03:34:54,079
he can win exchanges but he can't win

6119
03:34:52,639 --> 03:34:55,680
the fight

6120
03:34:54,079 --> 03:34:56,639
so the last thing you want to do is have

6121
03:34:55,680 --> 03:34:59,760
to

6122
03:34:56,639 --> 03:35:01,840
win every exchange in a match

6123
03:34:59,760 --> 03:35:03,840
you want to know how to

6124
03:35:01,840 --> 03:35:06,079
kick it into sixth gear

6125
03:35:03,840 --> 03:35:09,120
like when to step off the gas

6126
03:35:06,079 --> 03:35:11,439
when to focus on gripping when to attack

6127
03:35:09,120 --> 03:35:12,479
how often to attack all those things

6128
03:35:11,439 --> 03:35:14,079
like

6129
03:35:12,478 --> 03:35:16,318
and you've had those conversations with

6130
03:35:14,079 --> 03:35:17,920
jimmy like this is not like how to stop

6131
03:35:16,318 --> 03:35:20,079
trying to win every exchange that kind

6132
03:35:17,920 --> 03:35:21,920
of thing yeah and instead because i was

6133
03:35:20,079 --> 03:35:23,920
a brawler before i was like if i threw

6134
03:35:21,920 --> 03:35:25,920
you once i'm throwing you again yeah and

6135
03:35:23,920 --> 03:35:26,879
sometimes you get caught yeah why would

6136
03:35:25,920 --> 03:35:28,799
i do that

6137
03:35:26,879 --> 03:35:30,238
i'm already winning

6138
03:35:28,799 --> 03:35:32,719
what about like the mental side of the

6139
03:35:30,238 --> 03:35:34,719
game the preparation all those things

6140
03:35:32,719 --> 03:35:36,639
one of the biggest things jimmy brought

6141
03:35:34,719 --> 03:35:39,920
to the forefront when it came to like

6142
03:35:36,639 --> 03:35:41,039
the mental side was the visualization

6143
03:35:39,920 --> 03:35:43,920
right

6144
03:35:41,040 --> 03:35:46,479
and when i started visualizing myself

6145
03:35:43,920 --> 03:35:49,279
winning i started seeing more success

6146
03:35:46,478 --> 03:35:51,119
but once i started seeing more success

6147
03:35:49,279 --> 03:35:52,720
with the visualization also came

6148
03:35:51,120 --> 03:35:56,880
self-doubt

6149
03:35:52,719 --> 03:35:56,879
because as i'm starting to

6150
03:35:57,040 --> 03:36:00,640
picture myself like

6151
03:35:58,959 --> 03:36:02,079
i would picture myself before fighting

6152
03:36:00,639 --> 03:36:03,840
church's philly

6153
03:36:02,079 --> 03:36:06,238
i'm going to throw him with koshigoroma

6154
03:36:03,840 --> 03:36:08,238
and i can see it and if i stand in the

6155
03:36:06,238 --> 03:36:10,079
chute for too long

6156
03:36:08,238 --> 03:36:12,398
you start to like

6157
03:36:10,079 --> 03:36:14,159
but what if he counters

6158
03:36:12,398 --> 03:36:16,000
then you go well if he counters with

6159
03:36:14,159 --> 03:36:17,920
this i'm gonna counter with that but you

6160
03:36:16,000 --> 03:36:19,439
already let that doubt in

6161
03:36:17,920 --> 03:36:21,120
and then you start playing this like

6162
03:36:19,439 --> 03:36:23,520
five step scenario but you still come

6163
03:36:21,120 --> 03:36:25,520
out on top but all that doubt has like

6164
03:36:23,520 --> 03:36:28,399
seeped into your mind

6165
03:36:25,520 --> 03:36:30,319
right and a lot of people don't

6166
03:36:28,398 --> 03:36:32,559
understand that

6167
03:36:30,318 --> 03:36:34,478
that's a bad thing you're still winning

6168
03:36:32,559 --> 03:36:36,478
in your mind but you're also doubting

6169
03:36:34,478 --> 03:36:37,278
yourself in your mind yeah once you let

6170
03:36:36,478 --> 03:36:39,760
the

6171
03:36:37,279 --> 03:36:41,840
like that little sleep in itself

6172
03:36:39,760 --> 03:36:43,760
destructive yeah

6173
03:36:41,840 --> 03:36:45,520
and so i remember i was at the world

6174
03:36:43,760 --> 03:36:46,478
championships i can't remember what year

6175
03:36:45,520 --> 03:36:49,040
it was

6176
03:36:46,478 --> 03:36:51,599
but i was ready like i was healthy

6177
03:36:49,040 --> 03:36:53,760
i was ready to go and we all thought

6178
03:36:51,600 --> 03:36:55,200
like this is the year travis wins the

6179
03:36:53,760 --> 03:36:57,680
worlds

6180
03:36:55,200 --> 03:37:00,960
i go out there in the first round

6181
03:36:57,680 --> 03:37:02,880
i'm in the shoot for like 45 minutes

6182
03:37:00,959 --> 03:37:04,318
like the match went into golden score

6183
03:37:02,879 --> 03:37:06,159
then the next match went into golden

6184
03:37:04,318 --> 03:37:08,318
score and the [ __ ] next match went

6185
03:37:06,159 --> 03:37:10,398
into golden score then the referee came

6186
03:37:08,318 --> 03:37:12,079
and told me you can't weigh your ghee

6187
03:37:10,398 --> 03:37:14,238
then big jim goes why can't he wear his

6188
03:37:12,079 --> 03:37:15,680
key any gui that has his name on it

6189
03:37:14,238 --> 03:37:17,680
we're not going to let him wear he has

6190
03:37:15,680 --> 03:37:19,279
to wear a different key so then i go

6191
03:37:17,680 --> 03:37:21,200
[ __ ] you i'm leaving and i walked out

6192
03:37:19,279 --> 03:37:22,479
there and i fought i lost in golden

6193
03:37:21,200 --> 03:37:25,120
score because i did a cochi and they

6194
03:37:22,478 --> 03:37:27,119
called it a false attack and i went

6195
03:37:25,120 --> 03:37:29,120
great i'm out of the [ __ ] worlds

6196
03:37:27,120 --> 03:37:31,040
but when i was in the shoot

6197
03:37:29,120 --> 03:37:33,680
i struggled because

6198
03:37:31,040 --> 03:37:35,680
i started allowing the like hungarian

6199
03:37:33,680 --> 03:37:37,359
guy that i was gonna face

6200
03:37:35,680 --> 03:37:39,040
to do things to me

6201
03:37:37,359 --> 03:37:42,640
that i would have to play defense to and

6202
03:37:39,040 --> 03:37:45,439
then counter it's like great but now i'm

6203
03:37:42,639 --> 03:37:47,519
doubting my own ability so i went to a

6204
03:37:45,439 --> 03:37:49,760
sports psychologist and the big game

6205
03:37:47,520 --> 03:37:52,079
changer for me was

6206
03:37:49,760 --> 03:37:54,880
i focus more on the

6207
03:37:52,079 --> 03:37:56,159
emotional physical response that happens

6208
03:37:54,879 --> 03:37:58,639
in matches

6209
03:37:56,159 --> 03:38:00,559
rather than the actual

6210
03:37:58,639 --> 03:38:02,959
you know quote unquote like instagram

6211
03:38:00,559 --> 03:38:05,359
picture that would have happened yeah so

6212
03:38:02,959 --> 03:38:07,119
when i was getting ready for 2016

6213
03:38:05,359 --> 03:38:08,318
you think about

6214
03:38:07,120 --> 03:38:10,000
like

6215
03:38:08,318 --> 03:38:11,359
how do you feel like standing in the

6216
03:38:10,000 --> 03:38:13,279
chute like what does your body feel like

6217
03:38:11,359 --> 03:38:15,040
is your heart racing how's your breath

6218
03:38:13,279 --> 03:38:16,560
is your mouth dry

6219
03:38:15,040 --> 03:38:18,160
and then you think about like okay the

6220
03:38:16,559 --> 03:38:20,398
ref just started the match what happens

6221
03:38:18,159 --> 03:38:23,039
like how was the atmosphere like how do

6222
03:38:20,398 --> 03:38:24,639
you emotionally respond to these things

6223
03:38:23,040 --> 03:38:28,000
more so than

6224
03:38:24,639 --> 03:38:29,920
me trying to beat a specific judo player

6225
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:31,840
right like oh the ref just gave you a

6226
03:38:29,920 --> 03:38:33,199
penalty at a minute 30 like how do you

6227
03:38:31,840 --> 03:38:34,639
feel

6228
03:38:33,199 --> 03:38:36,399
and then you start thinking about the

6229
03:38:34,639 --> 03:38:37,599
physical responses and when you do that

6230
03:38:36,398 --> 03:38:38,959
really well

6231
03:38:37,600 --> 03:38:40,479
you can actually get the pins and

6232
03:38:38,959 --> 03:38:42,318
needles and your body will start to

6233
03:38:40,478 --> 03:38:44,559
sweat and your heart will start to race

6234
03:38:42,318 --> 03:38:47,278
as if you're in it

6235
03:38:44,559 --> 03:38:49,680
because it's not about the technique

6236
03:38:47,279 --> 03:38:51,120
it's more about the physical like what

6237
03:38:49,680 --> 03:38:52,960
does it feel like to have your fingers

6238
03:38:51,120 --> 03:38:56,079
ripped out of a ghee in the first

6239
03:38:52,959 --> 03:38:57,759
exchange now my hands can feel that

6240
03:38:56,079 --> 03:38:59,120
that's fascinating and then on a

6241
03:38:57,760 --> 03:39:01,359
cellular level

6242
03:38:59,120 --> 03:39:03,840
like i fought the olympic games so many

6243
03:39:01,359 --> 03:39:07,120
times to the point where like it is no

6244
03:39:03,840 --> 03:39:09,120
longer a goal it's an anticipation right

6245
03:39:07,120 --> 03:39:11,279
so down to the experience of the grip

6246
03:39:09,120 --> 03:39:13,520
break the just the sweat the

6247
03:39:11,279 --> 03:39:15,040
the heart beating the yeah

6248
03:39:13,520 --> 03:39:16,720
does it feel to have your head smashed

6249
03:39:15,040 --> 03:39:18,640
into a mat and driven across the mat

6250
03:39:16,719 --> 03:39:21,039
with a map burn yeah and then getting

6251
03:39:18,639 --> 03:39:23,358
about that yeah and getting back up

6252
03:39:21,040 --> 03:39:25,040
yeah like with a bit of a burn all that

6253
03:39:23,359 --> 03:39:27,279
kind of stuff the actual sensations in

6254
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:28,720
this case the actual sensation of what

6255
03:39:27,279 --> 03:39:30,800
it takes to fight it you don't matter

6256
03:39:28,719 --> 03:39:32,559
it's not a strategy like but the actual

6257
03:39:30,799 --> 03:39:34,079
sensations the experience that's

6258
03:39:32,559 --> 03:39:35,439
fascinating

6259
03:39:34,079 --> 03:39:37,680
because then your body's gonna fight

6260
03:39:35,439 --> 03:39:40,398
hundreds of matches without the physical

6261
03:39:37,680 --> 03:39:42,720
damage and you could probably get really

6262
03:39:40,398 --> 03:39:45,119
far with that and not also in just judo

6263
03:39:42,719 --> 03:39:48,159
but basically anything

6264
03:39:45,120 --> 03:39:50,560
you can simulate yeah if you learn how

6265
03:39:48,159 --> 03:39:53,920
to simulate well

6266
03:39:50,559 --> 03:39:55,760
you've lived a very uh

6267
03:39:53,920 --> 03:39:57,359
a hell of a life

6268
03:39:55,760 --> 03:39:58,559
is there a device you can give to young

6269
03:39:57,359 --> 03:40:00,479
people

6270
03:39:58,559 --> 03:40:02,238
instead of high school

6271
03:40:00,478 --> 03:40:03,679
college

6272
03:40:02,238 --> 03:40:05,119
you know thinking about their career

6273
03:40:03,680 --> 03:40:08,559
thinking about life

6274
03:40:05,120 --> 03:40:08,560
how to live one they're proud of

6275
03:40:10,559 --> 03:40:14,238
i think the the number one thing

6276
03:40:12,700 --> 03:40:16,720
[Music]

6277
03:40:14,238 --> 03:40:18,398
i can tell people is and how i've lived

6278
03:40:16,719 --> 03:40:20,398
my life is

6279
03:40:18,398 --> 03:40:21,920
you've really got to like forget

6280
03:40:20,398 --> 03:40:23,840
everybody in your life right now your

6281
03:40:21,920 --> 03:40:25,520
mother your father your grandparents

6282
03:40:23,840 --> 03:40:28,478
your girlfriend your boyfriend whoever

6283
03:40:25,520 --> 03:40:31,680
it is and really decide like

6284
03:40:28,478 --> 03:40:34,799
what is gonna make you happy

6285
03:40:31,680 --> 03:40:38,159
right at some point in my career

6286
03:40:34,799 --> 03:40:40,159
the act of pushing my body to the limit

6287
03:40:38,159 --> 03:40:43,920
made me happier

6288
03:40:40,159 --> 03:40:43,920
than winning a grand slam medal

6289
03:40:44,238 --> 03:40:50,159
pushing my body to the limit didn't make

6290
03:40:46,318 --> 03:40:51,760
me happier than winning an olympic medal

6291
03:40:50,159 --> 03:40:52,719
right there was a there's a balance

6292
03:40:51,760 --> 03:40:54,960
there

6293
03:40:52,719 --> 03:40:56,719
and i think a lot of people struggle

6294
03:40:54,959 --> 03:41:00,238
with living their life where they're

6295
03:40:56,719 --> 03:41:02,559
happy and they make other people happy

6296
03:41:00,238 --> 03:41:04,478
or take in their

6297
03:41:02,559 --> 03:41:07,198
their feelings into the considerations

6298
03:41:04,478 --> 03:41:08,879
of what they need to do in their life

6299
03:41:07,199 --> 03:41:10,560
and i think if they can cut those

6300
03:41:08,879 --> 03:41:11,519
strings

6301
03:41:10,559 --> 03:41:13,278
sooner

6302
03:41:11,520 --> 03:41:15,120
and it'll allow you to get over it

6303
03:41:13,279 --> 03:41:16,000
quicker and get to a happier place

6304
03:41:15,120 --> 03:41:17,600
sooner

6305
03:41:16,000 --> 03:41:19,840
and then as long as you're focusing on

6306
03:41:17,600 --> 03:41:21,920
what's making you happy

6307
03:41:19,840 --> 03:41:24,159
the things you do that make you happy

6308
03:41:21,920 --> 03:41:27,120
will attract other people who do those

6309
03:41:24,159 --> 03:41:29,199
things that will in turn build stronger

6310
03:41:27,120 --> 03:41:31,359
better relationships

6311
03:41:29,199 --> 03:41:33,120
and then you will also

6312
03:41:31,359 --> 03:41:35,040
realize the

6313
03:41:33,120 --> 03:41:37,680
the best form of yourself and inspire

6314
03:41:35,040 --> 03:41:39,920
many others like yeah you've

6315
03:41:37,680 --> 03:41:42,559
inspired me

6316
03:41:39,920 --> 03:41:44,559
to uh for whatever the hell i've done uh

6317
03:41:42,559 --> 03:41:46,719
at least to do a slightly better job

6318
03:41:44,559 --> 03:41:49,119
than i otherwise would have by doing

6319
03:41:46,719 --> 03:41:50,639
martial arts but taking that uh journey

6320
03:41:49,120 --> 03:41:53,600
