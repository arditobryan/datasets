an intense passion for life so when our

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,119
paths happened across i knew we needed

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,439
to talk

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,439

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,280
in the description and now here's my

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,879
conversation with kelsey sharon

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,960
you mentioned that studying history had

20
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,920
a big impact on you and that your

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,600
grandfather was a world war ii vet

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,600
so people that have gone through world

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,239
war ii in my family too they don't seem

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,480
to talk about it much like the worse the

25
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,078
tragedy the less they talk about it i

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,439
mean it's understandable i can respect

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,079
that but

28
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,438
i don't think people fully understood

29
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,840
the value

30
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:12,719
in human stories over

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,159
over time and sharing that that certain

32
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,280
civilizations don't have written

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,920
language

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,759
the value in that being passed down is

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
is extraordinary but

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,519
we didn't really have that with the

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,040
world war ii vets it seems like well

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,280
they kind of want to protect you from

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,640
the pain like my grandfather my

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,560
grandmother

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
went through holler more which is the

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,359
ukrainian starvation of millions of

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,680
people and then obviously uh went

44
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,359
through world war ii with the nazi

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,360
occupation

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,319
and uh

47
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,159
same on the grandfather's side who uh

48
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,559
on my dad's side grandfather fought in

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,560
world war ii and they seem to not want

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,200
to talk about those experiences to

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,719
protect you from the suffering to

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,118
protect you from the evil that they've

53
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,399
experienced which is uh

54
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,560
sad because

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,359
the lessons from that history are not

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,600
then propagated through you and also

57
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,280
there's something about the strength you

58
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,199
carry with you knowing that that's in

59
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,038
your blood those great heroes are in

60
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,878
your blood and that suffering overcoming

61
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,919
that suffering is in your blood i would

62
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,598
argue that's exactly correct if you

63
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,119
if you have someone you know that comes

64
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,318
from your lineage that has done

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
something

66
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,039
super gnarly that's just been

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
a badass and in so many different ways

68
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,159
you want to know about that person you

69
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,079
have that person's blood in you that's

70
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,598
important to acknowledge and when that

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,040
isn't shared i feel like it's just a

72
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,799
detriment to that individual

73
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,359
what do you make of world war ii in

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,319
terms of history do you think about uh

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,519
those kinds of wars where uh two times

76
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:48,399
more civilians died than the number of

77
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,719
uh military personnel so most of the

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,360
wars basically just

79
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,878
the death of civilians and the invasion

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,200
of homes the burning of homes the

81
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,518
bombing of homes all of that world war

82
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:02,079
ii for me i find

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,560
that was the first experience

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
where i became

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
just

86
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,399
obsessed with history

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,480
world war ii really did it for me um

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,519
i'm not sure if it's because

89
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,359
of the dramatization of

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,920
film and tv and the way that our

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,680
generation has looked at it but for me

92
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,598
it was more than that

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,920
i felt a deep connection to it and i

94
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,079
still can't figure out why

95
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,119
like a pull almost uh

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,879
people

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,480
joke around about those past lives and

98
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,878
those things or those connections and

99
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,878
there's something deeper within me that

100
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,000
feels a pull towards that and i'm not

101
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,479
quite sure

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,479
if um it's because

103
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:44,000
i had family that you know escaped

104
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,919
hungary once the soviets came in so

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
thanks for that um or if it was because

106
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,158
my grandfather served in it or for

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,799
whatever reason i just i have this pull

108
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,479
to it and so when you think about

109
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,879
the mass

110
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,399
casualty of the civilian population

111
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,878
that's very difficult for me to wrap my

112
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
brain around after being in a war and

113
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,759
seeing

114
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
when you have a small subset of

115
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,878
civilians die

116
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,878
how much of an impact that has on that

117
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,000
community right there and just in just a

118
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:16,079
tiny area so to try to wrap my brain

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,839
around what happened in europe and all

120
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,439
across and and all that i really

121
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,000
struggle with that because i don't know

122
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,240
that i can comprehend

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,959
what that would truly mean to somebody

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,800
if i if i didn't experience it or or see

125
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,758
it for what it is does that make sense

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
yeah

127
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,840
but uh so first of all you're right a

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,319
lot of people are drawn to world war ii

129
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,679
for different reasons so one is hitler

130
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,759
and stalin

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,519
trying to understand how it's possible

132
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,199
to have that

133
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,918
scale of evil

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,439
in very different flavors of evil

135
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,519
it's almost fascinating that human

136
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,439
nature can allow for that and then also

137
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,599
it's fascinating that so many people can

138
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,759
follow leaders like that

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
with with the pride and with the love of

140
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,199
country

141
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,360
yeah and that's like it's almost like

142
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,600
this weird experiment it's like wow i

143
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,759
wonder if i'm the the same

144
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,560
i'm made from the same

145
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,879
uh cloth as those people like would i be

146
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,000
a good german if uh if i lived in

147
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,519
germany

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
uh and

149
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,719
was you know during the time of hitler

150
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,000
would i believe that

151
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,680
germany

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,759
has been done wrong i'm jewish by the

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,478
way which what makes me a little bit

154
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,520
more comfortable talking about this uh

155
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:30,959
is what i would i believe in the dream

156
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,198
sold by a charismatic dictator who says

157
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,038
that wrongs have been done and we need

158
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,120
to correct those wrongs

159
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,478
that to me is the compelling thing that

160
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,800
draws me

161
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,800
to world war ii uh the human nature

162
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
question i would agree with you on that

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,840
i think there's a way to look at people

164
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,198
like that and

165
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,359
at that time

166
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,120
there was no real well there wasn't a

167
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,879
full understanding of the psyche the way

168
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,038
that we're starting to i mean we still

169
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,439
don't understand

170
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,599
any of it but it seems like the you know

171
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,079
the time gap back then

172
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,560
there was no real understanding of

173
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,719
sociopaths and narcissists and you know

174
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,199
psychopaths and really what those traits

175
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,759
were and i feel like you you know people

176
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,360
will follow blindly if they're given a

177
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,439
good enough reason well if you have an

178
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,680
individual who is

179
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,000
ranting and screaming at the top of his

180
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,319
lungs in the middle of these town

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
squares and he's getting this attention

182
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,439
it's human nature to want to understand

183
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,240
and be a part of a group mentality it's

184
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,160
human nature to want to fit in and so i

185
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
don't know if it's more of

186
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,120
people were

187
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,639
at the beginning were just this is the

188
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,319
cool thing to do

189
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,478
or if it was they were genuinely

190
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,160
terrified

191
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,079
or if there was an aspect that was like

192
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,439
this guy is saying something that

193
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,959
resonates with me

194
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,478
there could be a lot of different things

195
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,959
i think it's unfortunate

196
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,959
that we didn't get to

197
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,120
or no one got to really

198
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,719
you know examine this individual's brain

199
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,079
and this person and

200
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
and why they thought the way they

201
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,439
thought because i that's always been the

202
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,079
biggest thing for me is i'm really

203
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:07,038
curious about why people do what they do

204
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,478
like deeply deeply curious about it i'm

205
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,318
not sure who's more interesting the

206
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,839
people that follow hitler or hitler

207
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,759
himself

208
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,519
so i mean that the

209
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,520
the question that's coupled with that is

210
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,758
uh would history roll out in similar

211
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,159
ways even if there wasn't a hitler you

212
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,560
know it's the people that created the

213
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,240
hitler or did hit or create the events

214
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,598
of world war ii

215
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,360
i think the people would be more

216
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,199
interesting in my opinion

217
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,160
that seems to be the that the

218
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,000
charismatic leaders are all out there

219
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,759
uh the failed artists in the case of

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,759
hitler they're all out there right and

221
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,000
it's just when there's this environment

222
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,400
of anger and fear

223
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,199
charismatic leaders can take over right

224
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,758
and uh it doesn't matter if they're evil

225
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,038
or good it's like a role the dice in

226
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,919
terms of history what uh how evil how

227
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,680
truly insane they are like us i think

228
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,159
stalin

229
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,319
was much more cold than calculating he

230
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,080
wasn't as insane as hitler hitler was

231
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,879
legitimately insane

232
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,560
uh

233
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,039
like especially later on in the war

234
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,598
where he would do irrational actions i

235
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,120
would say so that but that

236
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,478
that that's like a weird roll of the

237
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,959
dice you could have gotten a totally

238
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,560
different leader uh the the

239
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,598
wanting to take over the entirety of

240
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,720
europe and then invading russia that's

241
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,800
that's like insanity yeah that just even

242
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
just the the first part of that wanting

243
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,319
to take over europe if you really think

244
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,240
about the scale

245
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,959
if you really sit down and go he want

246
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,719
this one individual was like i want all

247
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,879
of this if you really sat down and you

248
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,680
were to sit down and put him in his

249
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,639
traits that we know of into

250
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,239
any sort of document nowadays that that

251
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,600
deems somebody a psychopath or a

252
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,000
narcissist

253
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,360
this guy would set it on fire

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,200
there's you know he himself was so

255
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,399
i think so damaged and he reminds me a

256
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,519
lot of

257
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,600
um people now who who struggle to find

258
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,639
their way he reminds me a lot of

259
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,879
angry individuals who are told no either

260
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,480
by women or by business or by whatever

261
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,919
the sector they're in

262
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,200
he reminds me very much of that like

263
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,199
what's the word i'm looking for just

264
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,759
that individual who's just like the

265
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,160
world is [ __ ] and the the world owes me

266
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,838
everything and just it's that mentality

267
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,838
he really came

268
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,160
from that it seems like and when you

269
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,200
foster that too long you get that

270
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,278
there's a

271
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,920
book called uh what is it man from

272
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,399
underground by dostoevsky i might be

273
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,319
misnaming the book but it's about the

274
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,159
bitterness of a man it's like it

275
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,278
breathes within his mind and it just

276
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,399
grows that bitterness i mean we we all

277
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,399
have that

278
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,240
sort of uh resenting of the world when

279
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,278
you're when you're younger when

280
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,120
you have a choice when you fail do you

281
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,000
blame the world

282
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,839
or do you hold it's the jackal thing do

283
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,480
you hold do you care the responsibility

284
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,560
of that and uh become a better man or

285
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
woman because of that that's that's the

286
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,719
decision and in some sense i mean

287
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,679
unfortunately

288
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,480
see that because he took responsibility

289
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,879
and leadership

290
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,519
he wasn't a leader yeah

291
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,320
so it's not that he's a failure he's not

292
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,399
a person not a failure but it's it's you

293
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
can't say he's powerless did not take

294
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,879
action i think he's just basically uh

295
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,479
embodiment of the anger and the fear of

296
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,360
people at the time

297
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,399
and

298
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,720
but the insanity of obviously many of my

299
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,120
relatives not just murdering them but

300
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
putting them in camps and torturing them

301
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,720
but many of those

302
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,879
people jewish people were also some of

303
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,240
the best scientists the insanity of

304
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:49,838
murdering some of the best germans yeah

305
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,919
uh is i it makes no sense but so that's

306
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,160
why it's fascinating to kind of look

307
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,519
back at that time in history it's like

308
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,519
and think

309
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,240
are these the same humans

310
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,120
and also are there echoes of that now

311
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,519
yes

312
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,000
and and are we is that going to happen

313
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,959
again is there going to be a world war 3

314
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,120
this in some other kind of way is there

315
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,518
going to be some mass scale injustice in

316
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,679
some other kind of way which uh we're

317
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,759
not uh yet like because of our blindness

318
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,159
uh and maybe not learning the lessons of

319
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,120
history will will allow to happen again

320
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,199
and

321
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,278
and then obviously it's a very common

322
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,560
thing to whatever political leader you

323
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:33,039
don't like to call them hitler

324
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,439
that that to me i gotta i gotta tell you

325
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,439
when somebody calls somebody hitler

326
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,000
the weight behind that has been

327
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,560
completely lost in this generation

328
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,958
this generation does not understand

329
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:47,278
what that truly means to call someone

330
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,399
hitler or a nazi

331
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,679
or stalin i to be honest the uh the

332
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,600
starvation

333
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,120
has i've just been talking to a lot of

334
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
folks recently especially like north

335
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,360
korea yeah

336
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,639
starvation and i remember from my

337
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,079
grandmother

338
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,159
it wasn't

339
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,799
any time and time again

340
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,799
not having food to eat is the thing that

341
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,838
people say is the worst

342
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,159
everything

343
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,560
it's way worse than murder

344
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,958
not having food and the places that

345
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,638
takes your mind and the actions that

346
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,719
forces you to do

347
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,519
that's terrifying and all of that seems

348
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,600
very distant in our history yeah i love

349
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,600
her i watched that interview with her

350
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,360
she is i want to talk to that woman so

351
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,920
bad because when she was on joe and she

352
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,440
sat there and said joe's like do you

353
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,159
have you done any therapy and she

354
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,680
laughed i was like oh that's my girl

355
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,439
it's such a fascinating i mean i would

356
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,919
love for you to kind of talk to her and

357
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,399
explore her mind because we kind of

358
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,319
explored her story right and that's

359
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,958
there's power and importance to her

360
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
story but it's so difficult to

361
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,439
understand

362
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,600
like how does she become

363
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,839
healthier and better

364
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,759
uh even more so than she's already she's

365
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,839
she's recovered

366
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,679
quite a bit you know she's found herself

367
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,279
quite a bit but i wonder

368
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,799
is she haunted

369
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,559
you're saying questions i want to ask

370
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,000
like that's what i mean because

371
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,439
after

372
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,519
being in a war

373
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,680
there are certain things there's certain

374
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,519
atrocities that you see that

375
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,199
it doesn't matter the therapy

376
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,720
that you do and i don't care what all

377
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
the special ops guys say like i know

378
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,959
plenty of them that have a light switch

379
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,479
and they turn it off and they can

380
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,319
function but i also know them when

381
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,759
they've been out for 10 years

382
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,278
there's things that haunt people

383
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,679
differently

384
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,519
but there's no way there's not something

385
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,919
going on there deeply

386
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,919
yeah but there's also extra levels of

387
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,919
complexity in her case because um

388
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,919
i mean this is what just looking at

389
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:50,240
history about family

390
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:51,599
is she spent much of her early life

391
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,198
loving

392
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
the dictator

393
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,120
right we like the water or something

394
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,199
like we like water or we like this

395
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
because there is no like individual like

396
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,439
when they said there was no love or

397
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,278
anything but there is a love for the

398
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,000
just that individual for that individual

399
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,278
and so i mean it's like the ultimate

400
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,759
abusive relationship oh yeah and

401
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,519
but but it's still love the experience

402
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,120
like you don't know the alternative so

403
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,240
it's not even

404
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,639
it's complicated because like

405
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,639
i i wonder if she truly explored it what

406
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,680
you would find because uh

407
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,600
the trauma much of her trauma i think

408
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,359
comes from when she was escaping north

409
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,199
korea

410
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,079
treatment by china

411
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,240
uh it's like the mom and what she had to

412
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,599
witness within that and being helpless

413
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,919
with that on yeah

414
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,320
so it's like evil men essentially

415
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,399
abusing her trading her you know and and

416
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,720
doing so nonchalantly like it's part of

417
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,360
just the way of of life

418
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,440
that i wonder if she sees kind of

419
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,360
yeah it's so complicated because

420
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,040
childhood it would be normal to her

421
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,879
because she didn't know any different

422
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,480
exactly and there's

423
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,838
like uh i grew up poor but i i never

424
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,560
sensed that

425
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,480
because parents didn't make you well and

426
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,559
everyone else around was too right and

427
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,560
so you don't notice it i mean it's a

428
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,479
cultural thing so the way you grow up

429
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,239
you only start to notice it when you

430
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,240
compare yourself to others

431
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,639
when you learn of the alternative that's

432
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:26,320
a dark reality when you're abused you um

433
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,639
i wonder i mean you truly and begin to

434
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,759
suffer in some kind of way when you

435
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,720
understand that you were being abused

436
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,159
that that's a dark kind of thought

437
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,560
that i wonder if you live your whole

438
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,719
life just in that abuse

439
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,119
if you don't know better that that's a

440
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,560
safer that's like uh what's a better

441
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,720
life

442
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,879
going suffering and then learning that

443
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,519
you were suffering or just

444
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,360
suffering until your last days there's a

445
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,278
two ways to look at this i'd argue on

446
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,519
one side that's suffering

447
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,519
and suffering till you die

448
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,839
you know no different so you can't have

449
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,440
hope you can't have

450
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,600
this idea that there's better and

451
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,600
sometimes that's

452
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,959
keep that in its box but then if you

453
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
have kind of what you have with park

454
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,559
where she

455
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,479
she knows now that there's different she

456
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,479
knows that there's better then you run

457
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,320
into those what is the damage that has

458
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,000
been done what is going to be passed on

459
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,720
as intergenerational trauma i know she's

460
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,559
a mom so it's like now you got to look

461
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,278
long-term a little bit because now she's

462
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,958
an influence on a child and

463
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,278
there's

464
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,198
there's a positive to looking at

465
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,519
both i would say and i know that sounds

466
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,639
horrible for the living and trauma your

467
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,679
whole life and just not knowing any

468
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,839
better

469
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,559
but there's

470
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,360
i don't know if that saves the brain

471
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,198
and the body and just just that overall

472
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,720
or if it actually

473
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,559
would be better because there's no way

474
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,199
to really find that out i don't think

475
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,799
yeah i think but the reality is when you

476
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,399
give people hope and you make them

477
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,919
realize that they're

478
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,839
suffering you're putting a burden on

479
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,719
them that's the first step on a long

480
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,000
journey and so and obviously she now

481
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,919
that she knows that the suffering she

482
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,119
wants to make uh people in north korea

483
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,400
currently

484
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,198
suffer less

485
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,280
and that's that admirable goal it's

486
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,959
it is it's what we do to each other is

487
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,318
try to like

488
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,038
when you see suffering in the world you

489
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,119
try to make it better and unmask that's

490
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,838
probably in a long arc of history going

491
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,678
to

492
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,318
make for uh

493
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,519
for a better world i'm hopeful

494
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:29,279
at that idea

495
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,000
for north korea i'm hopeful for that

496
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,759
because you you never want to leave

497
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,038
individuals suffering

498
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,319
when you know

499
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,679
that they're actively suffering while

500
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,359
you're just living your day-to-day life

501
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,200
in the western world just out grocery

502
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,119
shopping and you see all this food and

503
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,480
you know in the back of your mind like

504
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,678
that interview [ __ ] me up a little bit

505
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,279
i won't lie like and i had some of the

506
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,000
girls in my office listen to it they're

507
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,678
just

508
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,880
bawling because there's

509
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,840
we're all parents and there's this idea

510
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,000
that

511
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,399
not being able to feed our children

512
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,599
that just the idea of that damages the

513
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
psyche it

514
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,839
brings up the pain in the chest like

515
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,519
just the idea of it and so going to the

516
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,279
grocery store for about a week after

517
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,200
that i just remember standing there

518
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,798
looking and just going what the [ __ ] are

519
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,480
we doing

520
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,960
but then there's that snap reality that

521
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,919
comes into play and goes

522
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,919
so how do we fix that

523
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,679
you got to take on china that's never

524
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,720
going to happen

525
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,960
and the reason that's not going to

526
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,200
happen it's happening again so akani

527
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,600
comes down through afghanistan chinese

528
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,279
all through afghanistan iran makes the

529
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:33,599
deal with china

530
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,879
for her the roadway to get the oil well

531
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,678
that's done in the blink of an eye

532
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,760
without anyone knowing there's no way

533
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,200
there's just so much at play with china

534
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,839
they control

535
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,840
such a large aspect of our world

536
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,199
unfortunately that

537
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:51,279
to take and free north korea a drastic

538
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,519
action would have to happen and then

539
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,440
your people would come in it would be a

540
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,480
mess what do you mean your people what

541
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,759
do you mean your people you're russians

542
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,360
did you hear what she said about

543
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,038
russians did you hear what she says

544
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,279
russians i love russians you know what i

545
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:07,519
didn't love the russian recruiting video

546
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,279
that came out that [ __ ] was terrifying

547
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,240
did you watch it i told you about it of

548
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,839
course you didn't watch it i didn't

549
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,640
watch it oh shocker

550
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,839
um

551
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,400
the usa put out a recruiting video yes

552
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,759
and then like a day or two later russia

553
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,440
put one out

554
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,839
and the recruiting fruit video in the

555
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,798
states was a

556
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:29,279
animation of a a female soldier yeah

557
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,879
with two moms and she was gonna go

558
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,879
change the world

559
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,120
right russia came out with one

560
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,480
it's like it's the the character from

561
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,239
like rocky

562
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,839
essentially and there are guys in the

563
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,519
mud and just in the rain just [ __ ]

564
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,038
doing push-ups just pushing it out

565
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,639
they're just like they see their boot

566
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,879
they're just like crushing things and

567
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,038
i'm like and it's all like and the deep

568
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,039
rush in the voice i'm like oh my god

569
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,720
yeah which one is better would you say

570
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,679
which bothered you

571
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,720
more

572
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,480
what do you mean by bother specify

573
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,240
so deception is a funny thing because

574
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,240
when you're young and you're choosing to

575
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,279
go to the military or not it's not like

576
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,038
you know

577
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,119
like none of us know what the best

578
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,839
trajectory for life is right for many

579
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,439
people going to the military is a really

580
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,959
makes them incredible human beings some

581
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,840
of the best people in this world i know

582
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,759
are soldiers so it's i'm not i don't

583
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,158
mean like it's somehow bad to go to the

584
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,400
military i think it's a great choice but

585
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,919
there is something

586
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,320
the honest truth is i just don't like

587
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,080
marketing people well

588
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,918
and so this is essentially a marketing

589
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,519
effort yeah it is a marketing effort so

590
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,880
which one do you like as a marketing

591
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:39,119
effort better russia

592
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,320
yeah there you go i do because canada

593
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,879
doesn't you know what our recruiting

594
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,119
videos are it's like um

595
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,840
uh i love it they're the best

596
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,479
sorry a yeah oh [ __ ] here we go it's

597
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,480
starting it started awesome

598
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,480
so canada does these ones where it's

599
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,400
like um it'll have

600
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,759
a bunch of like soldiers doing movements

601
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
and then they'll like snip it together

602
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,440
really quick it'll be like a navy one

603
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,119
and then a guy jumping of a plane and

604
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,360
then it'll be like an artillery and then

605
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,759
like an armored then it'd be like

606
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,439
join the canadian forces today and like

607
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,960
that's like their

608
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,000
their videos so it's like very

609
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,319
marketable very palatable to canadians

610
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
who don't really want war and who don't

611
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,399
really acknowledge their military in the

612
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,159
first place and do everything they can

613
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,000
to make sure that vets don't get any

614
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,400
support when they come home

615
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,880
so they i can see why that one is uh

616
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,480
acceptable what russia did

617
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,880
was meant to be more of an intimidation

618
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,200
tactic in my opinion

619
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,039
i like that style better though i think

620
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,120
we need harder i need i think we need

621
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,200
people to be harder i think it's

622
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,599
acceptable and okay to say that our

623
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,919
soldiers need to have a harder mindset a

624
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,519
stronger mindset a better mentality and

625
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,840
mental health support going into the

626
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,759
service and a harder body

627
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,359
because i know

628
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,960
when you go to the u.s i've also

629
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,719
encountered plenty of soldiers that are

630
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,120
600 pounds

631
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,200
what are you going to do

632
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,119
so we should say that you when you join

633
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,840
the military you're in incredible shape

634
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:05,599
or

635
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,720
not maybe incredible

636
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,959
no i was an incredible show it was the

637
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,319
best shape of my life yeah yeah so i'm

638
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,400
okay with that

639
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,839
it's okay i you know what i used to do

640
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,280
sit-ups

641
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,798
like no i would do sit-ups in the

642
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,399
morning when i was little

643
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,240
until i could see myself like i always

644
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,280
had a six-pack because all i did was

645
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,919
train

646
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,678
but like if i couldn't like see it i

647
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,360
would just sit there morning cartoons

648
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,038
and just do sit-ups and my mom and dad

649
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,279
thought that was like normal acceptable

650
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,960
behavior so if you had like instagram

651
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,639
back then you'd be a david goggins you

652
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,240
would be just like without the cursing

653
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,000
that cursing started once the military

654
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,079
started okay got it

655
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,519
so i mean the people should know because

656
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,519
they probably already know that you also

657
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,599
competed in taekwondo like you were an

658
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,240
athlete of all kinds

659
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,119
they even saw rugby in there yeah i was

660
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,400
i was

661
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,279
i was good at rugby i played that for

662
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,759
seven

663
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:58,000
six years i guess you could say total

664
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,640
i think the worst injury i've ever ended

665
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,798
up having was i tore my right eyelid off

666
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,200
we were doing an exhibition game i don't

667
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,038
do exhibition games well i don't do like

668
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,679
for fun well i don't do like be very

669
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,000
competitive no not me

670
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,919
so you're being funny ah there it is he

671
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,279
gets it you see he's not he's not a

672
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,759
robot

673
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:20,240
what i was saying though to you

674
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:23,200
was that

675
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,880
we did an exhibition game and

676
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,038
the team ahead was winning the team we

677
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,080
were playing was winning which was

678
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,119
annoying

679
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,879
and so

680
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,839
there was an opportunity to take out a

681
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,760
girl

682
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,199
that was going one end of the field to

683
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,679
the other and she just kept hitting

684
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,080
tries left right and center she was fast

685
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,559
so i figured if i just aimed her up like

686
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,240
she's a target and i just run full force

687
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,960
at her because she was really she was a

688
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,720
tall individual if i just if i do that

689
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,480
i'll take her out of the knees so i did

690
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,079
that um

691
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,519
but that what that resulted in was she

692
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,879
put her tooth through her mouth guard

693
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,720
and knocked out and didn't just she just

694
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,799
stayed there but when i stood up

695
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,038
i tore the right eyelid off and it was

696
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,359
hanging from the inner corner yeah my

697
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,200
mom was there because mom was my

698
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,119
mom's my biggest fan

699
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,798
she was supportive oh she's supportive

700
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,479
of everything and she didn't miss a game

701
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,480
she didn't miss anything

702
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,000
and um i stood up and i kind of turned

703
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,440
around and we had already had a girl

704
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,679
break her nose that day so she was on

705
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,679
the sideline with her nose sideways and

706
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,038
just bloody my mom was like i'll take

707
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,400
her to the emergency after once the

708
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:23,839
game's over

709
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,080
and so i turned around and looked at her

710
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,678
and she just she almost vomited on the

711
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,399
spot and i was like what's wrong she's

712
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,240
like

713
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,480
don't move your eyelids off i'm like but

714
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,079
i can see like i was trying to blink

715
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,240
but like it was just down so i could

716
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,319
just constantly see she's like we're

717
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,400
just gonna go to the emergency we're

718
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,319
just gonna go there now was there blood

719
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,480
yeah there's lots of it but i couldn't

720
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,639
really tell okay

721
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,319
were you okay with blood at that point

722
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,159
yeah i mean i guess we did taekwondo and

723
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,000
all that yeah i didn't get knocked out

724
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,080
very often i didn't really when i was

725
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,159
younger in taekwondo i was really good i

726
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,399
only lost a handful of times

727
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,799
so when i did lose that was bad

728
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,360
um but i never had like a

729
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,519
broken nose or a lot of blood on my feet

730
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,678
like nothing like that really so nothing

731
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,038
freaked me out too much

732
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,240
was there aggression there or just

733
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:15,038
purely competition over skill

734
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,759
a mix of both i was

735
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:20,000
this was right after not too long after

736
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,879
my coach went to prison for statutory

737
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,640
rape

738
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,400
um and that was like

739
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,600
how you talk about park talking about

740
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,640
how

741
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,278
that was

742
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,799
like she knew love because of that

743
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,200
person

744
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,798
that person was like a god to me

745
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,240
and so when that happened i was just an

746
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,839
angry individual from that point on so

747
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,839
there was competition and aggression

748
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,879
mixed in there oh like it was betrayal

749
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,199
that this is somebody that is

750
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,440
was a symbol of love for you was could

751
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,679
also be a very bad person i used to eat

752
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,919
sleep and breathe whatever that man said

753
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,559
from four years old on

754
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,799
i lived with my coaches at a point so i

755
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,720
could train that much i i helped look

756
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,839
after their daughter i i was at the club

757
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,360
24 7. it just the idea that somebody

758
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,599
could do something like that yeah that

759
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:10,079
really messed me up

760
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:12,319
where were you on 9 11.

761
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,798
i was 11

762
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:18,399
and i was in my parents basement

763
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,519
and in uh where ontario in ontario

764
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
canada

765
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,278
canada

766
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,320
what did you think of 911 at that age

767
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,679
from canada they have an impact on you

768
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,439
in terms of

769
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,360
uh changing

770
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,600
the uh

771
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,439
the level of evil you thought is there

772
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,759
in the world today

773
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,558
not initially i remember it really

774
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,558
vividly i have a decent memory for

775
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,798
certain things it seems like stuff like

776
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,000
that i'd stick with really well um i

777
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,720
remember watching i was sitting on the

778
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,319
couch and um my mom

779
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,759
my mom called my dad because my my

780
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,678
parents are truck drivers my dad was on

781
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,079
the road i'm not mistaken

782
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,278
and he would go in and out of cities all

783
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,960
the time and i think he was on the east

784
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:01,440
coast my mom was like a little panicky

785
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,120
so she she tried to get a hold of him on

786
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,840
i think she at the time it was like

787
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,119
beepers and

788
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,199
um yeah so he'd get a beep he would go

789
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,759
to a payphone and call us he was fine

790
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,679
and um i remember my mom

791
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,640
being like really upset and i couldn't

792
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,559
quite grasp why she was so upset i knew

793
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,960
something really bad had happened it's

794
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,759
when i then saw the second plane go into

795
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,519
the tower and i remember her just

796
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,359
like the stereotypical like hand over

797
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,398
her mouth and she just felt sick and she

798
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,439
just was

799
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,918
so confused and i knew it was bad

800
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,360
but i didn't fully grasp it we went to

801
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,640
school that day

802
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,918
and they had talked about it briefly you

803
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,759
could hear the teachers kind of

804
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,759
reminiscing about it there was a point

805
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,879
the that week that

806
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,319
all of a sudden all of the children

807
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
who were from a middle eastern family

808
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,480
were not the school

809
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,079
i just remember them saying like a lot

810
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,038
of people aren't coming to school but it

811
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:59,519
was it was in particular i think parents

812
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:01,440
were afraid once it got out that it was

813
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,359
of a certain um

814
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,278
group they were afraid for their own

815
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,359
kids and fair enough i mean

816
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,960
you never know you don't know

817
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,879
and um

818
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,399
i knew it impacted me enough that i did

819
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,799
write i remember i

820
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,678
the school was doing a memorial for it

821
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,918
and i remember they asked i wrote a poem

822
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,440
and a reporter was there and i read it

823
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,880
on air that's like i remember like

824
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,558
it was like

825
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,559
it was a very short one but i remember i

826
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,960
wanted to do something but i didn't know

827
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,639
why or for for what reason i just i knew

828
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,720
i wanted to do something to honor it but

829
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,000
i didn't i couldn't grasp why you

830
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:41,759
eventually went to afghanistan yeah

831
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,159
did that begin to plant a seed of

832
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,079
thinking about conflict in the world

833
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,520
it's a good question i've never thought

834
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,199
about it that in depth i mean i've done

835
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,158
12 years of therapy you think that would

836
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,000
have come up dr passi but apparently not

837
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,200
we'll work on it though i mean when did

838
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,038
uh like when did the idea of war

839
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,480
start entering your mind late high

840
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:04,240
school i think it was for me um i was i

841
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,558
finished high school at 17.

842
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,919
i moved away and went to

843
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:08,960
college i went to algonquin college

844
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,320
because i wasn't smart enough to get

845
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,480
into ottawa u

846
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,558
so i was like well

847
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,120
algonquin she is i just wanted to play

848
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,398
sports and frankly i wanted away from my

849
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,000
small town that i was living in i went

850
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,839
through like a bad high school breakup

851
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,278
as a kid and you know that where you

852
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,439
think that's like the love of your life

853
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,398
and you just can't bear to be anywhere

854
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,000
near anybody and so i moved away as fast

855
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:31,359
as i possibly could

856
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,519
and

857
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,519
i didn't grasp it still at that point

858
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,519
love

859
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:42,398
and heartbreak

860
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:45,038
okay why did you become a soldier

861
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,479
why did you want to become a soldier

862
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:47,759
my parents told me from an early age

863
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,640
they always figured i would either be a

864
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,960
cop

865
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,480
i would do they didn't think military

866
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,038
but they thought it would be like a type

867
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,480
a personality possibly carry a gun

868
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:57,759
situation

869
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,599
and um

870
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,839
i'd never hunted before we never had

871
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,678
guns in our house i was never exposed to

872
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,079
weapons of any kind

873
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,240
if anything it was it was the opposite

874
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,519
we just all the hunters on the property

875
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,359
like all the deer would come to our

876
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,440
property and all the hunters would be no

877
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,798
i'm not my mom would put salt licks out

878
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,558
so that they wouldn't get killed your

879
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:19,200
property was the safe space for the deer

880
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,079
yeah it was 17 acres of forest and they

881
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,840
just

882
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,678
we had two turkeys that used to walk up

883
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,000
and down the driveway every day we had

884
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,200
bears in there nobody bothered them

885
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,119
and so

886
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
there was no aspect of like i want to go

887
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:32,719
kill [ __ ] that was not like a thing i

888
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,679
had no idea i wanted to take anybody off

889
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,679
the face of the earth or anything

890
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,278
i went to school and because i'm a

891
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,120
history person i

892
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:44,880
my parents has always always made it uh

893
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,558
really important that remembrance day is

894
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,919
the thing in our life so that's

895
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,839

you go

900
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,720
and so

901
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:00,398
i went to the remembrance day ceremony

902
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,798
in ottawa that year which was it's our

903
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,239
capital which is

904
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,000
yeah it's our capital and it's really

905
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,480
small and so i went

906
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,159
but i took the bus and i was on the bus

907
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,640
back to algonquin and i met a lady

908
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,720
who was like a world war ii vet

909
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,159
really old lady she had an air force

910
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,399
uniform on and just like this row of

911
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,320
metals and

912
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,599
i mean i think you can tell by our

913
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,439
limited to

914
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,439
extreme interactions we've had over the

915
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,880
short period of time i'm curious and

916
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,720
i'll just ask you

917
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,559
and so i just got up and talked to her

918
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,880
and just started talking to her and she

919
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,839
didn't say like i don't remember exactly

920
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,640
her words but she served she was one of

921
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,759
the

922
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,360
first females to fly and you know all

923
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,200
all these kind of things that stuck in

924
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,038
my head and we just kind of kept talking

925
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,080
and i missed my stop

926
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,519
and then i finished talking to her and i

927
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:53,038
got back on the bus and went back to the

928
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,440
college and

929
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,440
walked into my uh my small apartment

930
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,798
where i had two roommates

931
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,000
these two guys i went to high school

932
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:01,519
with one of them went to high school

933
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,679
with one was from out of town and i i

934
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,159
just didn't like what i was

935
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,000
i wasn't happy i wasn't doing

936
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,440
what i wanted to do

937
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,960
and i didn't know what i wanted to do

938
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,200
truthfully

939
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,798
something just said

940
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,720
why don't you join the army like in

941
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,359
myself my my self-talk was like let's

942
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,038
just join the military let's do it

943
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,079
are you in general somebody just follows

944
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,398
the gut

945
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,558
like when your heart tells you something

946
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,759
you go with it for the most part because

947
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,678
i figured out at least now i figured out

948
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,200
what parts i could like what feeling i

949
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,278
can trust and which one i can't which

950
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,519
one's anxiety versus which one's my

951
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,440
actual intuition talking so why did you

952
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,839
sign up to be an artillery gunner

953
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,519
because they wouldn't let me be

954
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:47,199
infantry i mean is it

955
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,200
why why would you want to be infantry

956
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,120
i mean this you're you're you're you're

957
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,399
naming a lot of dangerous activities

958
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,319
yeah but that wasn't a thought in my

959
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,079
mind at the time

960
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,119
my idea was if i was going to do this

961
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,119
and i was going to put myself through

962
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,959
the [ __ ] and the training and all of

963
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,798
the hell and the push-ups and the mama

964
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,759
screamed at i wanted to do something

965
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,759
that i know was actually going to be

966
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,440
affecting something and what i knew was

967
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,519
making change or affecting or on the

968
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,399
front lines was infantry artillery or

969
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,000
armored

970
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:15,678
so i was like one of those can you

971
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,599
explain the difference infantry

972
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,880
artillery and armored do you want like

973
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,558
the layman's term or do you want me to

974
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,559
actually explain explain

975
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:24,079
well listen to a conversation with giaco

976
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,240
especially i love how you get into

977
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,759
details okay so let's detail this then

978
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,759
okay so infantry is your front line door

979
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,240
kicking

980
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,000
you know blasting the door open running

981
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,359
and get the [ __ ] on the ground just that

982
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,720
that that they're the guys that you know

983
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,240
the double tap you in the face and they

984
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,240
show up in the middle of the night and

985
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,000
put a barrel in your head like those are

986
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,558
the guys that are sleeping in the

987
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,319
trenches that are eating mres who are

988
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,879
being shot out who are being blown up

989
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,720
who are doing the dirty work and not

990
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,440
sleeping and carrying the hundred pound

991
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,319
pack and and are side by side with your

992
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,200
buddies in the trenches i wanted that

993
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,278
that

994
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,440
they said i was too small for that

995
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,679
so that's your side to interrupt you or

996
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,240
what too small under 100 pounds um at

997
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,480
the time i was about 103 and i'm i'm

998
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,239
five foot like on a if you roll my back

999
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,480
out like i really

1000
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,000
try i'm five foot

1001
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,559
at the time though i think it might my

1002
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,679
license said 411.

1003
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,480
so

1004
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,559
so you were too small too small for

1005
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,079
infantry yeah they just like there was

1006
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,078
no mandate

1007
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,280
at which they said you can't be but they

1008
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,320
said you know we don't want to put you

1009
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,839
through training that you're going to

1010
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,559
fail out of and then have to recourse

1011
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,838
you and then find a new job for you and

1012
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,199
they want to try to if this is what

1013
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,358
you're going in for they want to have

1014
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,838
you follow through that path

1015
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:45,119
so then there was armored which are your

1016
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:47,440
tanks so that's your movie like fury

1017
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,039
where your tank battles and which we

1018
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,480
don't really do anymore but you're

1019
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,480
rolling around in tanks you got guys in

1020
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,719
the back you're a driver you're a turret

1021
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,358
gunner which i would have enjoyed but

1022
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,719
the idea of being in a closed

1023
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,480
metal box

1024
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,480
something about it made me panic so i

1025
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,880
was like maybe not for me

1026
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,280
oh there's of course power to that kind

1027
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,240
of uh big gun

1028
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,880
well that's why i went for the bigger

1029
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,719
one okay by the way i think russia leads

1030
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,079
the world a number of tanks they're

1031
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:18,959
still it's very like uh what is it alpha

1032
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,720
demonstration of like force look we have

1033
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,559
largest number of tanks you know what

1034
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,279
takes tanks out though what some

1035
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,599
gasoline some old batteries and a wire

1036
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,519
yeah but tanks still look badass they

1037
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,119
look great but they don't last but so

1038
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,440
much of the military like we said with

1039
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,519
the recruiting videos it's a display of

1040
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,679
power versus the actual

1041
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:40,239
implementation of power fair

1042
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,919
okay artillery so i'm doing my best here

1043
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,000
yeah i don't even know what double tap

1044
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,000
means which you said earlier so double

1045
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,960
top is like two shots to the face why

1046
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,960
two

1047
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,720
to be sure okay

1048
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,480
all right you guys the taxpayers pay for

1049
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,838
the ammo it's fine but you don't want to

1050
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,760
do three because that's wasting money

1051
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:57,519
well that's now that's a waste okay

1052
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,000
double tap the face there's so much

1053
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,280
awesome terminology here or uh gruesome

1054
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,639
terminology depending on your

1055
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,920
perspective okay so artillery yeah

1056
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,920
so that's the hand of god

1057
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,280
sorry no i

1058
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,760
that's

1059
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,240
that's intensely uh romanticized version

1060
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,839
but okay artillery the hand of god so

1061
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:19,519
because it will reach out and touch you

1062
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,000
from wherever we want

1063
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:24,159
it's like it's like f um

1064
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,159
f 18 pilots or bombers

1065
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,920
they'll you won't know they're there

1066
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:31,920
until they're there and so for artillery

1067
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,000
i i really honestly didn't think

1068
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,920
artillery would be a fit for me i didn't

1069
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,320
know much about it they were just like

1070
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,960
these are what you can pick from and i

1071
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,200
was like i'll go here so

1072
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,960
in world war ii they used much closer

1073
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,639
artillery so it's the we were called the

1074
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,320
royal canadian horse artillery because

1075
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,440
the queen made us royal

1076
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,200
canadian artillery and um we we shoot

1077
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,039
these rounds when you're in training you

1078
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,439
shoot smaller smaller ammunition they're

1079
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,039
about 40 pounds they go

1080
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,280
i'm gonna get this wrong

1081
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,480
20k 20 kilometers so whatever that is in

1082
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,760
your

1083
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,358
mile things

1084
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,760
and um

1085
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,279
they have a casing on them and

1086
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,160
they're much easier they're easier to

1087
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,599
handle

1088
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,199
the guns are smaller you need less

1089
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,720
people for them they're basically what

1090
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,838
you train on nowadays it's not what we

1091
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:20,159
use overseas what we use overseas

1092
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:22,559
now those things are beautiful those are

1093
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,239
just a sheer work of

1094
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,759
the engineering behind them just makes

1095
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,439
my heart skip a beat yeah the

1096
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,800
engineering on modern guns is amazing so

1097
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,480
are we talking about machine guns here

1098
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,680
so no you're talking fully automatic no

1099
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,838
you're talking about an artillery gun so

1100
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,399
what it is it's a 155 millimeter

1101
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:39,679
howitzer that shoots up to up to 40

1102
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,240
kilometers accurately 45

1103
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,679
unrecorded and it shoots a hundred pound

1104
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:44,039
round

1105
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,679
oh

1106
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,599
[Music]

1107
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:50,078
okay

1108
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,559
so that but there is still precision

1109
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,079
accurate as hell accurate okay accurate

1110
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:56,400
if the people behind it that are

1111
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,240
shooting it and aiming it are accurate

1112
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,358
okay uh so

1113
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,358
so how

1114
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,838
at which stage of the warfare do they

1115
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,319
come in are they saving you like say a

1116
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,480
bunch of people get uh raided a bunch of

1117
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,320
the soul infantry get raided and then

1118
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,240
the artillery saves them or are they the

1119
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,480
first line of attack or what where are

1120
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,479
they wh where does their artillery go

1121
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,679
like the hand of god presumes because

1122
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,400
it's

1123
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,480
yeah yeah that's well that's it so

1124
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,240
depending on the operation or whomever

1125
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,679
is running it or how they want it done

1126
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,000
sometimes if they just know there's

1127
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,440
targets they'll use us

1128
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,838
you know high value targets so we have

1129
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,519
this round it's called the excalibur

1130
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:35,599
round it costs about half a million

1131
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,480
dollars per round it comes in a special

1132
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,359
tube

1133
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,199
that

1134
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,639
is like sealed and locked and you have

1135
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:43,439
to get permission from ottawa to shoot

1136
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:46,078
it and it's only used for vip targets so

1137
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,119
like we have vip for everyone and it

1138
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,000
will

1139
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,320
it's gps guided it's rocker propelled

1140
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,119
and when you fire it

1141
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,559
it will if if this is a wall

1142
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,240
and somebody's standing on this side of

1143
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:01,199
it we'll hit you right there we won't

1144
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:03,919
touch that wall it will hit you pinpoint

1145
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,239
it'll go right through whatever concrete

1146
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,480
whatever and it will destroy

1147
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,959
so it's basically uh the same thing as

1148
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,440
being a sniper but with a much

1149
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,720
more damaging we don't use that round

1150
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,119
often i think it's only been used a

1151
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:19,838
handful of times max in afghanistan that

1152
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,440
i'm aware of again i haven't i wasn't

1153
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:25,039
there from 2009 until 21. but i i know

1154
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,639
people that still deployed in that in

1155
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,960
those units and i don't know that it was

1156
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,358
used very often but the regular rounds

1157
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,920
so there's hg there's loom so he's high

1158
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,639
explosive there's a loom you shoot that

1159
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,320
it

1160
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,078
explodes in the sky it lights up the sky

1161
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,880
for the infantry below

1162
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,480
um

1163
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,000
and then there's shrapnel rounds that

1164
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,400
will explode in the sky and the shrapnel

1165
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,199
just rains down hell on you h e is what

1166
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,039
you use normally

1167
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,118
in my i'm trying to say this right

1168
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:52,400
because i i know people squawked at me

1169
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,079
about some of the stuff on jacob so i'm

1170
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,559
trying to be very accurate in my

1171
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,160
experience we used he rounds to wipe

1172
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,920
people off the face of the earth when

1173
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,239
the infantry needed us

1174
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,240
so we would get a call

1175
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,519
at any time and there's always two guns

1176
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,239
together

1177
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,559
so you never you never go solo gun ever

1178
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,679
if you are it's there's it's sketchy and

1179
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,119
there's a

1180
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,719
bad shit's happening can you explain

1181
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,440
that to those two got two people two

1182
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,959
guns no two guns with each gun troops so

1183
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,039
each gun troop has five to seven people

1184
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,159
running a gun at all times oh wow it

1185
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,318
takes a lot of people to run one of

1186
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,239
those how much electronics is there the

1187
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,239
gps like the computer system that's on

1188
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,439
it itself i never ran that much but it

1189
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,399
is completely technologically it's gps

1190
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,240
guided

1191
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,318
all you have to do is literally type in

1192
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:39,199
the coordinates then you've got the two

1193
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:41,519
big um there's a there's a technical

1194
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,679
word for it but basically wheels and one

1195
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,119
does the trajectory you know you do here

1196
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:46,639
right and you're just kind of doing this

1197
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,559
and you're watching the watching it and

1198
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:50,239
once you hit your target that's you know

1199
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,880
it'll tell you that's where you need to

1200
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:55,199
hit do you know if there's any like ai

1201
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,480
stuff like computer vision like where

1202
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:00,159
there's cameras and they help you target

1203
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,920
using

1204
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,598
like all different kinds of cameras to

1205
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,760
see through like the fog all those kinds

1206
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,440
of things no we use um

1207
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,599
the foo which are forward observation

1208
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,079
office officers which are an artillery

1209
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,480
individual that is

1210
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,480
embedded with an infantry unit oh wow

1211
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,559
okay they call from the front give us

1212
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,400
their grid coordinates and basically say

1213
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,559
like don't drop this on us

1214
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,559
got it so well you know what not to sh

1215
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,119
which parts not to shoot correct and

1216
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:29,279
then there's no one moves

1217
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,440
don't move stay still

1218
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,800
but you can hear it coming yeah but you

1219
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,159
can't hear it until it's too close so

1220
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,240
like when i went sorry go ahead you were

1221
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,639
gonna say no what's i was gonna say

1222
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,879
what's the experience on the other

1223
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:43,759
like what does it feel like to be maybe

1224
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,880
infantry or underneath it underneath the

1225
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,680
artillery

1226
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,480
well i i had the rare opportunity to do

1227
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,078
that

1228
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,400
and i have a video i'll show you after

1229
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,599
it's terrifying

1230
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,440
because i know the people that were

1231
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,880
shooting it and i know them personally

1232
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,960
and i know what they're like as humans

1233
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,240
and for the most part they're dialed but

1234
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,559
you get the odd duck where you're like

1235
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:07,279
i've seen people have an nd which is a

1236
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,880
negligent discharge you basically get

1237
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,800
charged for it you get a lot of trouble

1238
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,200
because you can blow people up and i

1239
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,800
it's like accidents happen and so i know

1240
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,439
accidents can happen in stressful

1241
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,680
situations and when i was with the brits

1242
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,838
we had to call danger close artillery

1243
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,598
and when it goes over top of you

1244
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,279
it sounds like thunder and lightning so

1245
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,599
you fire it

1246
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,960
and it's not the stereotype that you

1247
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,440
hear in world war ii where it kind of

1248
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,838
like that

1249
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,920
it's more of like a crackle

1250
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:36,960
and then you just hear like a whiz and

1251
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,079
it

1252
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,720
[ __ ] just goes everywhere it's loud it

1253
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,039
shakes the ground it shakes you it you

1254
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,919
feel it

1255
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,679
okay okay is there some more words you

1256
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,200
can put to like the experience of what

1257
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:56,318
it's like to be in the heat of of battle

1258
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:58,399
there so what is i is there literally is

1259
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:00,719
it hot is it are you talking about being

1260
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,358
under it or shooting it under it oh yeah

1261
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,879
it 55 degree heat you're you know that

1262
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:07,838
you're waiting for it to be called you

1263
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,000
feel an overwhelming excitement to start

1264
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:12,480
because for me i'd never been under it

1265
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,159
so i was like okay i had my camera ready

1266
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,240
like i was a kid at a candy store and

1267
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:17,519
i'm like i want to watch this happen

1268
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,000
and

1269
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:22,159
once you hear the crackle

1270
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,039
i got really fearful my anxiety kicked

1271
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:24,559
up

1272
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,800
significantly

1273
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,639
i i got to the point where

1274
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,119
i got numb

1275
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,639
like i was my nerves were on overdrive

1276
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,480
so much that like my body would go like

1277
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,239
numb like i could move but like my

1278
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,159
nerves were numb if that makes sense

1279
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,559
what what were the nerves like are we

1280
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:43,279
talking about fear or is it just

1281
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,039
anxious excitement anxious excitement

1282
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,720
hopeful that they wouldn't blow it up on

1283
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:50,639
us and there was this

1284
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,799
there was this excitement that's hard to

1285
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:54,318
describe because you don't want to be

1286
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,599
excited that you're dropping bombs on

1287
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:57,199
people

1288
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,119
but when you just saw their faces and

1289
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,679
they're shooting at you there's this

1290
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,800
overwhelming feeling of

1291
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,159
got you [ __ ] yeah yeah

1292
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,119
well we'll talk about that because

1293
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:11,519
that's such a difficult thing

1294
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,838
about wars you forget that it's other

1295
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,239
human beings yeah because those other

1296
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:19,440
human beings are doing really bad things

1297
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:20,799
to you and so the very basic anger takes

1298
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,200
over

1299
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,519
um hate can take over

1300
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:29,118
and then also just the excitement of

1301
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:30,159
almost like video game like

1302
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,640
you know

1303
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,879
aspect of war like sport it's it's like

1304
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,838
sport that all of those elements are all

1305
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,838
baked in it's hard to be philosophical

1306
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:42,078
in that situation it seems like

1307
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,679
i've never played video games so i can't

1308
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,680
compare it to that but like from from

1309
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,358
like a sports perspective yeah i could i

1310
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:48,879
could argue that like i felt like we won

1311
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:50,318
there for a second

1312
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,160
and it's

1313
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:54,639
it's not just like a heat from outside

1314
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:58,719
it's like this radiation within you

1315
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:58,719
that is something i've never felt since

1316
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,440
you uh just to take a small step back to

1317
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,679
the weapons training

1318
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,358
what uh what kind of guns did you train

1319
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:08,399
on because you also mentioned a rocket

1320
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:10,239
launcher

1321
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,400
i love karl kristoffs

1322
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:13,919
what are those what what are those carl

1323
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,318
g carl g's

1324
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,760
what what's that what's uh uh

1325
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,679
my only experience with the rocket

1326
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,359
launches is from the movie commando with

1327
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:22,719
arnold schwarzenegger oh yeah and we've

1328
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:23,838
all discussed i haven't seen that yet

1329
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,439
and i've heard about it and people have

1330
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:27,440
made me tell yeah i know i feel like you

1331
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,480
haven't seen a single movie that's

1332
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,159
relevant to war military because every

1333
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,920
time anyone brings it up you say you

1334
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,679
haven't seen it i don't have time to

1335
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,920
watch movies lex platoon you haven't

1336
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,239
seen platoon which is um you're the

1337
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,440
scientist how do you have the time i'm

1338
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:46,639
not a scientist i just play one on tv

1339
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,880
okay sure so uh what can you talk about

1340
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:51,440
the rocket launcher yeah and maybe any

1341
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,200
other yeah for both engineering actually

1342
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,440
to me those guns are very interesting

1343
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:56,719
from an engineering perspective too well

1344
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,240
they should be they're fascinating when

1345
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:01,039
you take them apart and you see how

1346
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:02,799
small the parts get down to and how how

1347
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,719
necessary every single little piece is

1348
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,720
to make that thing run and even without

1349
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,879
the tiniest little bb smaller than a

1350
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,000
piece on there an artillery gun might

1351
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,680
not run

1352
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,599
so we were trained on

1353
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,399
carl g's um

1354
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,440
called m72s which are disposable rocket

1355
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,720
launchers

1356
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,559
i'll back up carl g's are around

1357
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:23,759
i don't know the exact

1358
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:24,960
millimeter of the round it's been a

1359
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,400
while since i shot them we only did

1360
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,039
those in training

1361
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,440
but essentially it takes most people one

1362
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,199
person can fire it you know effectively

1363
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,358
hold it and fire it it takes another

1364
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,439
person to load it so you put it onto

1365
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:40,159
your shoulder and it weighs i would i

1366
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,519
don't know 30 pounds 40 pounds oh wow

1367
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,239
can't remember it's been a minute it's

1368
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:46,400
been one person can carry it oh

1369
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,959
yeah okay

1370
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,160
i don't know it just seems like a rocket

1371
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,599
launcher's pretty uh intense kind of

1372
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,480
device

1373
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,440
it for sure is i mean it's the diameter

1374
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,599
i can't even tell you the diameter

1375
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,960
they're about that big i mean

1376
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,039
and it goes on your shoulder it goes on

1377
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,880
your shoulder and then it has a little

1378
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,400
sight that pops out that's almost like

1379
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,640
plastic-like which is kind of funny

1380
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,760
because it reminds me of like the

1381
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,679
little um green army men it i just felt

1382
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,960
so flimsy to me i was like this is

1383
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:16,399
hilarious

1384
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,480
and then another person stands behind

1385
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,680
you and opens the hatch and so

1386
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,119
there's this there's these two um levers

1387
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,078
and you just kind of open it and then

1388
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,318
the back end which is flared so it's

1389
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,079
just a tube and then it's flared that

1390
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,000
will open it and drop down and you load

1391
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,680
around into that and then you load it

1392
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,119
back up

1393
00:47:33,679 --> 00:47:36,480
and you're never supposed to stand

1394
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,760
behind it because the blast behind it

1395
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,119
will kill you

1396
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,960
it's

1397
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:45,519
yeah but in my case when i fired it

1398
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,960
it was me and another individual um i

1399
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,280
want to say it wasn't sarah pellegrin

1400
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,960
but it was another girl that was smaller

1401
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,200
and the person is supposed to wrap

1402
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,720
around your waist and tuck low and hold

1403
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,239
your stability and we were just aiming

1404
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,799
at tanks that day and they were just

1405
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:01,039
concrete um heads so they would just

1406
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,160
either they would hit and bounce off or

1407
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:03,679
whatever

1408
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:05,440
and so

1409
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,440
when my sergeant saw that he just kind

1410
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,679
of looked at both of us i was like

1411
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,599
no i'm just gonna and he got real low

1412
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,960
and just like wrapped

1413
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,920
both of us

1414
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,599
and then we'd fire it and it feels like

1415
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,720
you're getting punched in the side of

1416
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,200
the head on repeat by jocko yeah

1417
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:25,598
it you lose all your hearing

1418
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:26,960
you just like just

1419
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,480
snot comes out of your nose and you're

1420
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,519
just kind of discombobulated for a

1421
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,800
minute

1422
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:32,239
it's a real

1423
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,559
mind [ __ ]

1424
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:36,879
is it is there other uh any other kind

1425
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,040
of guns that um

1426
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,640
in at that time because you were new to

1427
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:41,599
this you haven't shot guns when you were

1428
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:43,759
younger

1429
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,599
that were really impressive to you in in

1430
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,079
the training all of them because i i've

1431
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,640
never fired a weapon so we had the c7s

1432
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,119
which are like your m16s i believe

1433
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:54,558
um the long barrel the cute thing about

1434
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,039
those is when i have that slung my

1435
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,800
barrel drags on the ground

1436
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:01,119
so that's fun

1437
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,559
and they shoot you know your 762 or your

1438
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,440
556 round

1439
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,880
i loved that i preferred the um the c8

1440
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,679
which was a short barrel which is what

1441
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,920
the sf guys use not because it's cooler

1442
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:14,078
looking which it obviously is but

1443
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,599
because it was functional for my body

1444
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,720
height and it didn't drag on the ground

1445
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,960
when i ran

1446
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:20,799
i loved those they're your personal

1447
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,159
weapon being an artillery gunner if

1448
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,200
you're not an officer at least in our

1449
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:27,679
unit you didn't get a side a side piece

1450
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:29,279
i didn't have a slide piece lex um so i

1451
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,519
never had a

1452
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,720
handgun of any type i fired those in

1453
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:34,400
training you can't get over that side

1454
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,318
piece comment look at you

1455
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,838
uh i was gonna say i know what a side

1456
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,119
piece is you don't have to explain to me

1457
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:40,480
but you're single so how do you even

1458
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,400
have a side piece if you don't have a

1459
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,559
main piece the joke the joke would be

1460
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,318
the fact that we have a total

1461
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,760
misunderstanding what side pieces okay

1462
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,318
grace you didn't have a side piece as a

1463
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,960
non-officer right so i never fired those

1464
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,558
much we did grenades and training oh

1465
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,240
cool yeah grenades are fun i love

1466
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,640
grenades i have a massive one tattooed

1467
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:00,239
on me i have them all over my office how

1468
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,159
does a grenade work

1469
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,639
there's the spoon and the pin

1470
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:06,318
so this the pin holds the spoon in place

1471
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,879
when you pull that pin

1472
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:11,679
the firing mechanism inside as long as

1473
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,599
that the spoon is up against it it won't

1474
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,679
fire as soon as that spoon goes i

1475
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,599
believe it causes a reaction on the

1476
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,440
inside and you've got about five seconds

1477
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,880
to check it you'd be better to ask that

1478
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,480
question too

1479
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,240
i don't want me to get philosophical no

1480
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,519
you're not but there's something about a

1481
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:26,959
grenade

1482
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:29,599
because you're essentially committing

1483
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,599
suicide

1484
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,599
unless you get rid of the thing

1485
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,118
there's something like or if you're

1486
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,280
unlucky and it just goes off when you

1487
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,200
pull the pin which has happened to tons

1488
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,160
of people so it just feels like a very

1489
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:45,039
kind of leap it's a it's a dangerous

1490
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:46,799
leap into the abyss every time you use

1491
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:48,639
the thing because when you shoot a gun

1492
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,559
like the gun is much less likely to

1493
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:52,799
malfunction in terms of like all the

1494
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,880
possible ways to go wrong it just seems

1495
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,960
like grenade is like

1496
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,358
primitive almost yeah it's primitive

1497
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,440
it's it's also real like in the way that

1498
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:03,598
like a bar fight is like being punched

1499
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,838
in the face is real it's like you're

1500
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,000
here with the weapon of destruction it's

1501
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,078
just you and in the thing yeah you have

1502
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,760
to get rid of it i don't know is that is

1503
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,559
that terrifying to you like p do people

1504
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,000
still use grenades in warfare oh yeah

1505
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,000
okay yeah those are fantastic the

1506
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,760
taliban were throwing them over the wall

1507
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,880
at the airport in kabul

1508
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,319
people use them all the time because

1509
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,760
when you're in afghanistan if you're in

1510
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:25,599
a rural area you're going from village

1511
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,440
to village and they're they're you know

1512
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,880
they're mud hut walls like they're tall

1513
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,240
but you're walking through corridors and

1514
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,519
stuff oh you gotta

1515
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,118
lob one of those it's gonna take the

1516
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,039
whole unit out that just walked by like

1517
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,559
it's they're accurate

1518
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,558
if you're close enough and they're

1519
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,680
effective if you're close enough

1520
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,519
um

1521
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,799
i love them though

1522
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:44,880
i think

1523
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,039
they're fascinating to me because

1524
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,119
they're such a tiny little thing

1525
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,039
with such devastation

1526
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,280
they just can cause such devastation but

1527
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,960
for me when i had them

1528
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,240
the some of the canadians would make fun

1529
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,838
of me because when i did go outside the

1530
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:58,799
wire with the british i had two right

1531
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:00,960
here

1532
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,640
and i remember i put a piece of tape

1533
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,559
over the spoons

1534
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:07,279
because in my mind i could picture

1535
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,519
myself searching someone and grabbing me

1536
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,599
and pulling that and that would be me

1537
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,519
that that would have been like yep that

1538
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,359
if anyone that was gonna happen to

1539
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,599
it was her for sure

1540
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,838
so you were deployed to afghanistan in

1541
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,880
2009

1542
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:23,599
okay

1543
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:26,640
and uh like we said you were in uh great

1544
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:30,318
no perfect physical shape [ __ ] epic

1545
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,199
shape epic shape six-pack or i mean yeah

1546
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:33,039
okay

1547
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:34,349
so uh you could do pull a lot of

1548
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:35,599
pull-ups and push-ups and

1549
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:37,440
[Music]

1550
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,680
yeah okay uh

1551
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,920
and well-trained would you say we were

1552
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:44,799
you already what like no

1553
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,639
no no i'll argue that point till i'm

1554
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,920
blue in the face i spoke to him recently

1555
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:49,279
i actually spoke to my sergeant he's not

1556
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,119
a sergeant anymore but sergeant mark

1557
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,400
leblanc he's in africa right now on a

1558
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,680
deployment he gave me a call the other

1559
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,280
day and i remember talking to him about

1560
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:59,598
this and it's frustrating because we

1561
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,760
were at an active war we were involved

1562
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,680
in an active war where

1563
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,359
we the units that i were in were dagged

1564
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,118
red which meant

1565
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:09,358
they needed people

1566
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,800
so when you need people

1567
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:12,799
things go quick

1568
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,800
whether or not that's right i mean you

1569
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,240
could argue that's the similar thing to

1570
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,680
what's happening in the world right now

1571
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:21,838
we needed a vaccine we got a vaccine

1572
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:22,639
is it the best it could be could it be

1573
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:25,119
better

1574
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:26,960
could it do more things sure probably

1575
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,960
but with the time that we had we did the

1576
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,000
best that we could

1577
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,679
that's my logic on that for me

1578
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,280
i joined the military in november of

1579
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:37,358
2007.

1580
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:41,599
i was in basic training in january of

1581
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:44,400
2008 i was graduated basic sq which is

1582
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,920
all your weapons training your dp1

1583
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,760
which is your

1584
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,599
trade specific training so whatever

1585
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,599
trade you're going to go into whether

1586
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,318
it's infantry armored artillery medic

1587
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,400
whatever that's your dp1 it's called

1588
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:58,800
different things in different units and

1589
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,079
then i got posted to my unit in

1590
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,000
september

1591
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:04,160
so january to september i had done all

1592
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,599
my training and i'm an english-speaking

1593
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:07,679
individual

1594
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,838
i got posted to a french unit that only

1595
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:11,759
speaks french and had to learn that all

1596
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:13,679
of the weapon systems

1597
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,680
everything again that i just learned in

1598
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,000
that short time frame in french this

1599
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:20,159
part of your story that we you you're

1600
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,559
telling this to jocko is

1601
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,639
one way to say is very impressive that

1602
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,480
you had to learn all of this in french

1603
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:28,400
so there's also the camaraderie the

1604
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,838
social aspect of it which is difficult

1605
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,559
probably it didn't have any that's

1606
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:34,400
enough yeah it didn't have any but it

1607
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,480
also make you a more effective soldier

1608
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,960
to be socially

1609
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,199
for that cohesion to be there right um

1610
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,480
but also just understanding the the

1611
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:44,318
basic um

1612
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,760
terminology correct

1613
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:47,679
and uh great way to say something on the

1614
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,720
radio the right way to run a gun the

1615
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:50,000
right way to

1616
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,480
because you got to move with those guns

1617
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,079
you've got seven people it's it's it's

1618
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,480
really magical

1619
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,318
i i'll send you a video we when we did

1620
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,760
um some live fire in workup training in

1621
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:01,279
texas before we left we did a

1622
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,720
competition between the other gun to see

1623
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,440
who could fire 10 rounds fast like

1624
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,639
faster wow um

1625
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,798
it is

1626
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:11,759
truly beautiful to watch an artillery

1627
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:13,838
unit fire a gun because it's it's like a

1628
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,839
symphony everyone has their parts and

1629
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,279
everyone knows and everyone's yelling

1630
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,519
but they know why they're yelling and

1631
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,119
everyone this guy's got to do this in

1632
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:24,000
order for this guy to load the round

1633
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,559
it's just it's beautiful it really is it

1634
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,559
is gorgeous to watch i miss it deeply is

1635
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,640
there by the way for a gun is there like

1636
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,798
one person responsible for the

1637
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:34,159
for the aim and the

1638
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:37,280
or like the specification of the

1639
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:39,679
location and somebody else that pulls it

1640
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,280
presses the lanyard is that the lanyard

1641
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:42,639
is there a button it's bet it's better

1642
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,480
than a button you'll like it i'll tell

1643
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:46,719
you in a second okay um

1644
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,798
yours there's your sergeant in charge

1645
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:52,000
and then they have their two ic

1646
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:54,318
and so the comms come in to the sergeant

1647
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,880
and the sergeant is the

1648
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,920
or your master bombardier bomba de chef

1649
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,318
um

1650
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,039
yeah sorry what

1651
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:03,039
a chef what

1652
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:08,719
chef oh that's the french master

1653
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,240
bombardier yeah so it goes like private

1654
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:13,118
in the north like an infantry or in a

1655
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:15,039
regular unit it's like private corporal

1656
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,838
master corporal sergeant

1657
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:20,480
in artillery it goes gunner

1658
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:22,480
bombardier master bombardier sergeant

1659
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,519
weren't on and off like that

1660
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,280
so

1661
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:27,199
you have two people but the sarge is

1662
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,119
like you don't move till he says move

1663
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:30,399
you don't fire until he says fire like

1664
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,599
he's your guy he'll give you the

1665
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,400
coordinates he'll feed him to the guy

1666
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,079
that's doing the the gps that that

1667
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,000
portion i really never did it much i

1668
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,920
wasn't tall enough to see it

1669
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,920
like legitimately the way how high it is

1670
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,119
up on the gun like it was i couldn't see

1671
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,798
clearly enough it was not good so

1672
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,119
obviously you have a big personality

1673
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,759
you're strong person you don't say

1674
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,760
yeah and you have a big hat currently

1675
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,079
i always wear a hat legs

1676
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,720
okay it seems like your height and your

1677
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,640
size was a factor oh for sure how were

1678
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,480
you able to step up in all those moments

1679
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:04,480
and uh

1680
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,838
how difficult was it

1681
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,039
i don't know that i realized it was

1682
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:08,639
difficult while i was doing it because

1683
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:11,199
that's just the way it's been i've

1684
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:12,639
always been the short person that's life

1685
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:14,078
nothing i can do to fix that so there

1686
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:16,239
was no point when am i gonna whine about

1687
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,599
it i'm gonna break my femurs and insert

1688
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:18,959
things to make me grow a little bit

1689
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,400
maybe

1690
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,240
maybe since you're in robotics you can

1691
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,160
figure that out okay

1692
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,318
that's your task now

1693
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,399
make me be five foot three that'd be

1694
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:30,079
great um

1695
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,079
for artillery

1696
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,160
really what it came down to was the unit

1697
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,480
when i got there there was only a couple

1698
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,719
people who spoke any sort of english

1699
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,798
and my sergeant was not one of them

1700
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,639
but once he kind of started to get to

1701
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:43,599
know me a little bit the best that he

1702
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,759
could

1703
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:48,079
he started to put effort into making

1704
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,880
sure i could lift the rounds train make

1705
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:53,200
sure my my capacity to do my job was

1706
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,280
there and so he took me under his wing

1707
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:56,719
in that in that aspect so he would take

1708
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,798
me to the gym with him

1709
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:01,358
and he would show me

1710
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,039
exercises that would specifically help

1711
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:04,880
me load

1712
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,279
the round so pick the round up from the

1713
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,358
ground pick it up like a trick to put

1714
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,200
your knee under it use your legs instead

1715
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:13,679
of just pick it up use your back pull

1716
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:15,279
your back out he would work on that and

1717
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,239
then depending on the position i was

1718
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,559
running the gun in if i was running the

1719
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,239
side that had the charge bags

1720
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,519
i'll explain that in a second but if i

1721
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:24,879
was running the side that had the charge

1722
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:26,880
bags

1723
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,720
i could step up

1724
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,920
onto the gun

1725
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,078
and if i

1726
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,599
leaned inward enough with my right hand

1727
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:38,640
with the charge and i kind of kicked off

1728
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:41,440
i could kind of jump and shut and

1729
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,519
shove it up the tube got it

1730
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,200
almost enough yeah if i was running the

1731
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,400
lanyard which is the thing that makes it

1732
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:48,879
go boom

1733
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,680
it's really easy it's a long rope

1734
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,880
you hook it on and you put it your right

1735
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:54,639
hand on your hip and on your left and

1736
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,480
you and you hold it there and you just

1737
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:58,639
stare at your sergeant like this and you

1738
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,920
just wait for him to yell fire and he

1739
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:02,239
points at you when he does it and when

1740
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,119
you do it you turn your whole body with

1741
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,719
it

1742
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,400
and when you do that it alleviates the

1743
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:10,078
a misfire essentially because if you

1744
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,119
just pull it sometimes that's not enough

1745
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,480
you got to really give it your whole

1746
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,119
body into it

1747
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,960
and so he would train me on

1748
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,480
how to do things differently so that i

1749
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,720
could do them effectively

1750
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,920
and i wasn't a [ __ ] pump

1751
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:24,239
uh a what

1752
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,559
so ship pump is a term that we use in

1753
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:30,000
canada to call somebody useless a ship

1754
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:31,760
pump is a useless soldier who is just

1755
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,400
you're there and that's the ship pump

1756
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,480
and so we all just deal with it but

1757
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,318
somehow they're still there yeah what

1758
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,599
were we talking about the lanyard okay

1759
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,159
yeah uh

1760
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,079
we're talking about artillery guns so

1761
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:47,920
those things though what you would find

1762
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:49,440
fascinating is just how they break down

1763
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:52,159
when you have to take one of those apart

1764
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,880
i think your mind would really find it

1765
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:57,440
fascinating how a breech comes apart all

1766
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,880
the way down to like ball bearing size

1767
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,559
and the only and there's a way to just

1768
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,160
make that gun completely ineffective and

1769
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,640
all you have to do

1770
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:07,039
when you're on the charge side there's a

1771
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:09,519
magazine that's a long linear magazine

1772
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,119
and it holds like 15 little rounds if

1773
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:12,798
you just take that thing out

1774
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,318
nothing's not firing

1775
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:15,920
how many people does it take to move

1776
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,159
that like how easy it is to move that

1777
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,318
thing to move a triple seven

1778
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:22,159
triple seven i like it that's what

1779
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:23,838
they're called m triple seven is a lot

1780
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,399
of the terminology cross over the same

1781
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:28,000
in english and french no okay

1782
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,000
i mean m triple seven does because it's

1783
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,519
an obvious howitzer i'm sure has a

1784
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,280
separate word but like if you're running

1785
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:35,519
it you're running it in french

1786
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,119
so like when i'd be running the

1787
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:39,358
when i'm doing the charge bags and i'm

1788
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,960
doing

1789
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:42,078
i'm doing you know i'm loading

1790
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,240
everything and i'm getting that ready

1791
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,559
and that's my position that day i'm also

1792
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,959
controlling the breach

1793
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,079
so like how it opens how it closes when

1794
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,760
it locks

1795
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,839
and so but you have to yell that as you

1796
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,440
do it so you're yelling like my lib

1797
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:57,358
coulas

1798
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,880
like you have to yell all these things

1799
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:01,679
you have to learn them though

1800
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,240
and so for a long time it's

1801
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:05,919
it's it's it was a little frustrating i

1802
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:08,000
won't lie it's really exciting i took a

1803
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,680
lot of french but i forgot all of it but

1804
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,559
i think it's a beautiful romantic

1805
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,279
language

1806
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,119
it's a good language if it's from quebec

1807
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,119
yeah that's true it's a good language to

1808
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,039
fall in love with not as good as russian

1809
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,039
but uh i mean second

1810
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:22,880
english is uh all right

1811
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:25,599
i mean russian really is that like a

1812
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,880
love language it is to me i mean because

1813
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,400
you're russian but like if somebody

1814
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,440
walked up to me was like

1815
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,039
hey kelsey i like you i'd be like oh god

1816
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,720
he's gonna put me in a camp that's

1817
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:36,318
because you don't understand love and

1818
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:37,199
kelsey i don't we'll talk about that

1819
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,960
okay

1820
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:40,879
how many people does it take to move

1821
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,400
them triple seven it depends if you're

1822
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,760
moving it by ground you're moving it on

1823
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,318
a truck and when you're moving it on a

1824
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,680
truck you're hooking the back of it onto

1825
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:49,358
you're hooking the front of the barrel

1826
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:51,358
onto one of those

1827
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:53,279
big transport looking trucks that has

1828
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:55,038
those cargo tents that's got soldiers in

01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,480
it you don't want to ever move an m

1830
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,920
triple seven by that way if you don't

1831
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,358
have to the barrel is worth a million

1832
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,440
dollars

1833
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,038
wow okay so this is like a serious piece

1834
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,679
of equipment you don't want to move them

1835
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:08,319
okay when we got to kandahar we were

1836
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:10,318
there for a couple days we got flown out

1837
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:12,798
to the fall we were going to be at

1838
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:14,558
ford observation base kandahar is the

1839
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:16,559
safe space or was the major base in

1840
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,839
afghanistan that we were at

1841
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:21,359
there's things like tim hortons there

1845
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,119
the different countries in the world

1846
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,639
kind of come together you would see

1847
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,519
italians you would see germans you would

1848
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:30,798
see

1849
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:32,318
french you would see all these different

1850
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:33,599
uniforms and you never know who to

1851
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:34,880
salute because you don't know what each

1852
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,200
thing means

1853
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,798
it doesn't feel like a war zone no oh

1854
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:40,399
god no there's a boardwalk there's

1855
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:42,000
hockey there like floor hockey because

1856
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,880
canada had to have that there's a tim

1857
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,318
horton's a subway a pizza hut

1858
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,079
a px

1859
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:50,639
um i think there's a restaurant there

1860
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,480
somewhere but i never i didn't get to go

1861
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:54,480
you know stuff like that there's gyms

1862
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,838
you can run around it you feel fairly

1863
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,519
safe you always have a weapon on you but

1864
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,920
you can you know live your life

1865
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:01,440
um when you get out to the fob the guns

1866
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,280
are already there

1867
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,200
so those m triple sevens get lifted by a

1868
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,720
chinook normally if they're going by air

1869
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,960
they go by chinook because they're heavy

1870
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:09,919
as hell and chinooks can hook them under

1871
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,000
the bottom

1872
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,559
and they fly them and then they'll drop

1873
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,239
them down they have wheels on them but

1874
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:18,000
you don't need them if you're gonna

1875
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:19,919
leave it in place

1876
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,440
gotta and you're getting information

1877
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,200
about ieds

1878
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,079
you're getting a land a lay of the land

1879
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:26,558
as to what's been going on in the

1880
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,318
country for the past six months and this

1881
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,440
you know nothing you're just like this

1882
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,599
is your first time you're getting

1883
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,960
deployed so what was your deployment

1884
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,480
like can you tell the story of your

1885
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,559
deployment

1886
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,798
to afghanistan

1887
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,480
like the whole deployment

1888
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:42,559
getting like actual deploying not the

1889
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,559
deployment itself what's the difference

1890
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,480
between the two well actually getting

1891
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,960
ready to deploy is a little different so

1892
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,760
i mean the emotional build up to it got

1893
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,318
it and uh some of the some of the

1894
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,079
memorable things that kind of uh you

1895
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:56,838
remember from that experience both on

1896
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,359
the

1897
01:03:56,838 --> 01:04:02,558
excitement i get to see battle i get to

1898
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:04,159
be part of this and the fear and also

1899
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,680
like being surprised like with the tim

1900
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:07,279
hortons and all those kinds of things so

1901
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:09,118
like the lead up before everything

1902
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,359
should hit the fan okay cool

1903
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,519
so

1904
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:15,838
you're such a fascinating person but yes

1905
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:18,079
something like that i've been called

1906
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:20,639
many things yeah let's start with the

1907
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,640
letter f yeah no i don't know i don't

1908
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:25,679
know many words with f okay so with the

1909
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:27,279
build up so the uh deployment so for the

1910
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:29,358
build up for the deployment

1911
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,400
i was in quebec and my unit was

1912
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:33,838
deploying from quebec and at that time

1913
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,200
you kind of get your marching orders you

1914
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:38,239
know you're deploying i knew i was

1915
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:39,838
deploying before i even graduated

1916
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:41,358
that's how much they needed people so

1917
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:43,838
once i did all that training on

1918
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:46,000
graduation parade day a couple men from

1919
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,759
quebec in uniforms came over and said

1920
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,519
you you you and you are all being posted

1921
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,799
to vacation and you're going to deploy

1922
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:52,400
with us in april

1923
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:54,079
so that's how i found it i was deploying

1924
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,680
why was there such a need for troops in

1925
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,680
afghanistan is that that was a

1926
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:58,960
well-known thing that there's a scaling

1927
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:01,279
up of troops

1928
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,480
2007 on canada really started taking a

1929
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,319
combat role

1930
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,079
before it was very much more a u.n type

1931
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:08,400
deal where doing what we normally do in

1932
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,480
most wars where we just we wear blue and

1933
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,519
we don't shoot anyone

1934
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,000
and so

1935
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:15,920
we're there to help and so they were

1936
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,679
really they were scaling up and there

1937
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,519
wasn't a lot of people in those uh

1938
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:21,199
trades initially i think when the war

1939
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:22,400
kind of started so canada really started

1940
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:25,199
to scale

1941
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,318
and so when i got to quebec

1942
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:28,078
we've kind of found oh yeah we're

1943
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:29,519
deploying and it was a weird situation

1944
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,920
because i've never actually been at a

1945
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:33,440
unit on a non-deployable unit

1946
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,880
so i don't know what they do day to day

1947
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,400
that's different from what i did i just

1948
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,400
know what i did

1949
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,680
so we would do things like in the

1950
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,000
morning we would get up and we would

1951
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:43,038
meet for pt at 5 a.m and that would

1952
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,159
include

1953
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:48,079
going for a 10k run or

1954
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:50,719
playing ball hockey for a few hours in

1955
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,160
the gym or lifting weights together or

1956
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:53,838
you know just going on a ruck march

1957
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:55,759
along rock mart should just stuff like

1958
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:56,639
that you would have a shower you would

1959
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,240
meet

1960
01:05:56,639 --> 01:05:59,598
and then you would just sit around the

1961
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:00,719
regiment

1962
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,280
you would just

1963
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:04,879
sit around the regiment and you would

1964
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,880
if there was busy work you'd mop the

1965
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,559
floors you would clean weapons

1966
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,640
there wasn't a whole lot until there was

1967
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,798
a whole lot to do

1968
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:14,960
we did a lot for a while

1969
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:18,480
and then we went away on workup training

1970
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:21,920
to texas for a week we came down here

1971
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,679
and we did live fire with um with our

1972
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,880
other troop that was going to be with us

1973
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:29,598
so alpha alpha had two guns and two guns

1974
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,680
has two groups of people

1975
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,880
and so we all would go down to texas and

1976
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:36,480
we did live fire here for a week and

1977
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,760
i end up getting gastro which was

1978
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,760
awesome

1979
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,280
so thanks for that

1980
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,200
apparently there was uh they were having

1981
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,640
water problems and sanitary problems so

1982
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,519
everyone was getting it

1983
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:49,519
on the base okay so it just makes your

1984
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:51,838
life way harder i didn't get it towards

1985
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:54,318
the end till towards the end so that was

1986
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:56,239
fortunate so we would fire live fire we

1987
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:58,000
would go out to the middle of nowhere

1988
01:06:56,239 --> 01:06:59,919
the guns would be there

1989
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
and we would get uh offload a truck of

1990
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,480
uh rounds and we would do live fire and

1991
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,318
we would practice just constant practice

1992
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,880
what's that saying perfect practice

1993
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:09,679
makes perfect yeah so this is a sensory

1994
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,400
uh

1995
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:14,399
like a shooting range for artillery for

1996
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,079
artillery for long range so what does

1997
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,000
practice look like

1998
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,240
so you roll up in your trucks and you're

1999
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,358
you're you know you've got uh each group

2000
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:22,959
of people

2001
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:24,400
you've got two trucks and then you've

2002
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,720
got like a medic vehicle and then you've

2003
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,200
got like an officer vehicle and a coms

2004
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:30,879
vehicle and you you go to your

2005
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:32,318
perspective guns and then you offload

2006
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,240
your ammo and then you basically wait

2007
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:35,279
for them to send you

2008
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:36,078
like a

2009
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,079
uh

2010
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,519
a fire mission wow get that together

2011
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,440
they would call they would say and miss

2012
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:43,038
y'all sit so it'd be a fire mission so

2013
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,720
we'd wait for that and once we got that

2014
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:47,119
then you all run like a bunch of

2015
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:49,038
scattered rats to the gun like it's like

2016
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:51,119
the greatest thing you've ever seen

2017
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,400
and then um you just wait you wait for

2018
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,160
the call for the sergeants to say and

2019
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,880
then you'll hear it because it's not

2020
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,558
headphones you can hear it on a speaker

2021
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,798
and it'd be like i'm not gonna do it in

2022
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:03,200
french don't ask it'd be like

2023
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:03,199
um

2024
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:07,920
uh so and so 10 rounds

2025
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:09,358
fire when ready

2026
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,480
and then you'd get your rounds ready and

2027
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:12,318
everyone would have them writer would be

2028
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,159
in their perspective um respected

2029
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:15,759
positions and then you would wait and

2030
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:17,119
then they would say

2031
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,560
fire when ready and as soon as i say

2032
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:19,439
fire when ready that means just start

2033
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,039
going

2034
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:23,678
just start and then that's when the

2035
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:25,439
magic starts you go like the loop like

2036
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,359
you you shoot one or whatever there's a

2037
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,719
reloading process there's a loop so what

2038
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,880
you would do you get the fire mission

2039
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:32,079
you would find out the rounds the two ic

2040
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,000
would be standing by the rounds and it

2041
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:35,679
was his job to make sure the amount of

2042
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,439
rounds that was told would be the only

2043
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:39,600
rounds that would go downrange

2044
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:41,439
and so he'd stand there and on each

2045
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,920
round depending on the type of round is

2046
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:45,039
a fuse which gets screwed onto the top

2047
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,838
of the round

2048
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:46,798
so

2049
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:48,880
they're

2050
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:51,519
about that big and it's just a point and

2051
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,960
then you would have to put it on

2052
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,199
give it a spin

2053
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,439
and depending if it was the time release

2054
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,719
you had a little um

2055
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,238
what do you call you get those at ikea

2056
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:01,838
when you have to build everything allen

2057
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:03,119
k allen yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you

2058
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:04,640
know what i'm talking about yeah and

2059
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:05,759
then like a big one or something no just

2060
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,039
a little one because it's a tiny little

2061
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:08,960
hole and you just got to click it to

2062
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:10,880
where it's supposed to go and it

2063
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,198
depended on what the columns were and it

2064
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,359
was a timer when you said like wheel you

2065
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:16,639
mean like a little thing then

2066
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,079
is that is that what we're talking about

2067
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,239
i'm talking about the round itself so

2068
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:22,880
you would put a fuse on top of the round

2069
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:24,399
so you would unload the ammo and then

2070
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,079
you would put fuses on them and the

2071
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:27,519
fuses are on the top and they're like a

2072
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:29,359
little like a

2073
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,080
ice cream topper kind of thing and you

2074
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:34,079
would spin those on okay okay and then

2075
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:35,198
once they're on depending if it's a time

2076
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,359
release or not you would take this

2077
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:38,719
little thing and you would move it the

2078
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:40,480
top and that would it's almost like a

2079
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:42,158
little timer cool

2080
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,000
yeah it depended so you're just

2081
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:45,679
assembling a bullet

2082
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,520
essentially a very big one that goes up

2083
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,039
to my waist

2084
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,719
yeah this is this is very cool and

2085
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:53,359
you're you're a fascinating person okay

2086
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,600
so that you just that you still even

2087
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,120
years later have all this in your memory

2088
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,560
it's not all perfectly accurate and

2089
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,599
that's what irritates me though is

2090
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,960
because i'm

2091
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,920
it bothers me when i can't remember

2092
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,439
things accurately but i have a lot of

2093
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,119
i've had a lot of memory issues and

2094
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:08,238
problems after like having too many hits

2095
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:10,238
to the head

2096
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:13,279
and this is from earlier in childhood or

2097
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:15,359
later uh both okay both the military did

2098
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:16,880
not help it

2099
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:18,960
where was the hits in the head in the

2100
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,719
military well when you have a car go

2101
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,079
stuff beside your face like this and it

2102
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:24,239
shoots around it it gives you a

2103
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:26,079
concussive blast also there's new

2104
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:27,279
research being done i'll find out

2105
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:28,719
exactly what it is but there's new

2106
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:30,800
research that's being done that shows

2107
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,719
that if you're an artillery gunner and

2108
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,159
you stand within a certain range of that

2109
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:35,920
gun you get the same amount of

2110
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:38,719
concussive blasts and it there's a

2111
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,719
there's a range i had no idea but you

2112
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:43,520
feel it when it goes off like it hurt

2113
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:45,359
your whole body feels it

2114
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,120
your mind is fascinating because it's

2115
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:49,039
like literally the opposite of my one

2116
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:52,319
you're able to speak very quickly very

2117
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:54,079
clearly very sharply sorry no what

2118
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:56,479
i talk too fast no that's perfect it's

2119
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:58,640
my hearing i admire i mean i admire that

2120
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,799
i can't do any of that and you listen

2121
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,960
extremely well and you're extremely

2122
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:06,000
attentive and you have a good memory so

2123
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:08,000
anyways just fun fun to watch you at um

2124
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,760
i can tell you were a great soldier

2125
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,840
and just all different aspects of it

2126
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,520
thank you

2127
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,279
but what the heck we're talking about oh

2128
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,880
build up to the deployment how did we

2129
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:18,800
get to texas because that was part of

2130
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,319
the build-up to my deployment and li-fi

2131
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,320
you got to did that feel good

2132
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:30,960
it's so good what's the favorite what's

2133
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:33,520
the best part about like

2134
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:36,560
shooting artillery like what what's the

2135
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,400
thing that's that feels good which part

2136
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,360
the well the full the feeling of power

2137
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:43,439
when is the best moment of the highest

2138
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:45,279
moment of the feeling of power

2139
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:48,319
is it the whole process that you love or

2140
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:50,238
is there like when you actually shoot it

2141
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:53,439
it's symbiotic it's a beautiful thing to

2142
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:55,839
watch to know that a gun can fire

2143
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:57,439
and it takes kind of a dance to make it

2144
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,679
work there's something about that to me

2145
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:02,000
that just got my heart racing

2146
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:05,279
when you actually shoot the round and

2147
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,960
you see it go and you hear it

2148
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,800
it's unlike it you can't describe

2149
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,840
there's no i've never felt another

2150
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:14,239
feeling i've also never been in like

2151
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,319
an f-18 or an f like 16 or like any i've

2152
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:18,079
never been in anything like that and

2153
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:19,198
i've you know

2154
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:20,079
i've never

2155
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:21,119
tried to think of something else to be

2156
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:22,640
comfortable i've never been in like a

2157
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:25,279
formula one car those are the only

2158
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:28,159
things i can picture being

2159
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:30,639
that much for me because

2160
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:32,238
to shoot one of those and to know

2161
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,320
that you've done your job right means

2162
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:36,479
that you've helped

2163
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:37,519
and that to me was really what it did it

2164
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:40,000
for me

2165
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:42,239
when you hear your sergeant say

2166
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,399
mission accomplished target hit tired

2167
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:46,799
acquired then you're like

2168
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:48,839
that's a good feeling that's the stuff

2169
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:53,039
quick pause take a break

2170
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:55,760

snake season people and i was like i

2185
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:28,640
have to pee and squat down

2186
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:32,559
why why texas and from like canada is it

2187
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:35,199
a simulation of uh afghanistan

2188
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,719
okay so that's okay so you're getting

2189
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:38,719
and that's the way the live fire was

2190
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,520
seen in artilleries like you're trying

2191
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,279
to

2192
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,960
simulate certain aspects of what you

2193
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,119
might actually see in afghanistan i

2194
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:48,480
would think so i mean we

2195
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:50,079
it it looks like it's hot like it you're

2196
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:52,079
out in the middle of nowhere

2197
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:54,158
very similar to rain that's the first

2198
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,559
time we started to get to where our tan

2199
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:58,319
boots and our tan like our combat tan

2200
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,520
stuff before you couldn't wear that so

2201
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:00,479
it gave us an opportunity to kind of

2202
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,679
break in

2203
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:03,039
break in how we were going to be doing

2204
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:04,800
this what it was going to look like how

2205
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:06,319
the guns were going to work and all of

2206
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,640
those lovely things

2207
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:10,000
how do you go from there to being

2208
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,239
deployed

2209
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,119
what was the next part of the journey so

2210
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:17,119
then we go to wainwright alberta often

2211
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:19,439
called or referenced as wayne [ __ ]

2212
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:22,559
because it sucks so bad

2213
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:24,639
it is a massive open space in alberta

2214
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,080
which most of alberta is

2215
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,520
and it's outside of a small town called

2216
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:32,559
wainwright and it is a field ex training

2217
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,239
area for all of the canadian military

2218
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,800
and it's where you do

2219
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:37,839
live fire but you also do work up

2220
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,920
training

2221
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,119
so you go out there for a month or two i

2222
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,960
think it is i don't remember the exact

2223
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:45,119
time we were there because it was just

2224
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,279
you sleep in a tent you're in your cot

2225
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:50,000
you're in like full mission mode

2226
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:52,158
and you go outside and we did this

2227
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,600
operation called operation maple leaf i

2228
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:56,479
think it was

2229
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:59,280
and you put on these little suits these

2230
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:01,039
uh hap they have haptic uh

2231
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,039
you can feel when you're shot and then

2232
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:04,399
there's a little camera and a sorry

2233
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,279
screen in the front of it and it's got

2234
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:09,359
button options and so it's to mimic

2235
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:11,359
if you get shot it'll say gunshot wound

2236
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:12,799
and then you have to choose okay do i do

2237
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:15,119
this or do i do this and depending on

2238
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,360
your response person dies or lives

2239
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:19,519
and they have other people who aren't on

2240
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:20,880
a rotation for deployment come and act

2241
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,640
as the taliban

2242
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,760
and attack you

2243
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:27,840
in the middle of the night

2244
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:31,280
is there a good understanding of the

2245
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:34,000
tactics that the taliban used to attack

2246
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:36,639
i mean this may be fast forwards to

2247
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,760
our conversation a little bit but is

2248
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,920
there a

2249
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:42,239
strategies on the other side

2250
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:44,480
that are being used in afghanistan by

2251
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:46,959
the taliban by the taliban

2252
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:49,759
ieds suicide bombers

2253
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:52,158
uh vehicle-born ieds um

2254
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,840
their their standard way to hit people

2255
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:56,479
really was

2256
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,880
ieds and vehicle board ieds suicide

2257
01:15:56,479 --> 01:16:00,718
bombers they'd put um

2258
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:03,119
like backpacks full of an ied and then

2259
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,319
put like toys around it and then just be

2260
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:05,840
like

2261
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:08,880
so they will conceal it certain ways and

2262
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:10,719
probably use civilians oh 100 yeah and

2263
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,480
women were a great way to get close to

2264
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:13,840
the soldiers because women seem

2265
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:15,359
non-threatening when you see a burka

2266
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,840
walk up to you you're not expecting an

2267
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:19,920
ak-47 to roll out of that and then

2268
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,440
or you know but they're they're great

2269
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,800
ways to get clothes

2270
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:25,198
okay so

2271
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,440
what is wayne something wing [ __ ]

2272
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:29,919
no that's not how wayne right

2273
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:31,279
so let's go to alberta okay okay so i

2274
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:35,119
mean we don't have to go to alberta

2275
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:37,920
nobody wants to no let's in our minds

2276
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:40,559
in our imagination so okay so that's

2277
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,319
getting you closer to afghanistan right

2278
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,000
uh what what was that like i mean are

2279
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:45,279
you getting anxious at this point is

2280
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,800
there a build up

2281
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:48,479
what are you thinking or is it just all

2282
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,560
part of the training for me it was more

2283
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:53,119
part of the training i was i was excited

2284
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:55,120
to go because i did know that we were

2285
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,519
going to do some live fire i did know

2286
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:59,920
that we were going to be

2287
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,960
doing more of the military type job i i

2288
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,560
thought we were going to be doing

2289
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,480
because up until that point i had just

2290
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,400
done training so i was learning how to

2291
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:08,399
march and salute and who to salute and

2292
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:10,319
not salute like that was the focus of

2293
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,479
that was my experience of the military

2294
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:14,559
and then the next experience was sitting

2295
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:16,158
in a regiment just working out a lot and

2296
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,520
going for breakfast a lot and drinking

2297
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:18,479
like that was so i was like this is the

2298
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,840
army

2299
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:22,559
so when i actually got to go to wayne

2300
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,440
right i got my first full taste of okay

2301
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,199
well

2302
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:27,198
there's fire picket duty so one person

2303
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:29,919
gets picked every night to you know do

2304
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:32,319
sentry there's a little less sleep

2305
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,679
you're eating out of a canteen now

2306
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:35,519
you're drinking a canteen you're in your

2307
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,880
kit more you're in your deployable kit

2308
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,880
now you're in your

2309
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,400
you know you're wearing um

2310
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,000
your tack vest you're you're getting

2311
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:42,879
ready to practice having plates on

2312
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,560
you're

2313
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,079
having ammunition on you you've got your

2314
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,840
weapon with you all the time when you're

2315
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:48,880
on base and that can't say in quebec

2316
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,520
you're

2317
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:53,840
you're just like an everyday job maybe

2318
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,199
you can paint a clear picture to me

2319
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,640
when was there an understanding that

2320
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:58,559
you're actually getting deployed was it

2321
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,560
just a sense that you're getting

2322
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,320
deployed or was this officially told to

2323
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,000
you i was officially told on graduation

2324
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:06,158
day you're deploying in april with that

2325
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,319
hits oh there were okay there's no date

2326
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:10,719
they're like they they knew so what had

2327
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:12,079
happened is the reason that

2328
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,600
that could say the unit needed more

2329
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:15,039
people so they came to that and they

2330
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,320
picked five people there was five

2331
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,079
english-speaking people that went to

2332
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,840
vacation it wasn't just myself there was

2333
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:21,359
a couple other people i knew that were

2334
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,840
english-speaking that got put on other

2335
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:26,719
guns within the regiment i wasn't with

2336
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:29,119
any of them we all kind of got split up

2337
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,719
and so

2338
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:33,359
there was an understanding that we were

2339
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:35,119
going to always be deploying

2340
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:37,279
next year it was like 2009 you're

2341
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:38,158
deploying whether you left in may or

2342
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:39,759
april

2343
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:42,559
we were deploying because that was the

2344
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:44,640
rotation time so each canadian unit did

2345
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,400
between six and nine months and then you

2346
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:49,280
knew right around that point another

2347
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:51,119
base of individuals would then deploy so

2348
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:53,198
you would go on these rotations

2349
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,359
and so even when i was on my deployment

2350
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:57,279
then i was slated to go again the

2351
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:59,839
following year but towards the end of

2352
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,759
the year so there was always a rotation

2353
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,039
if you were in a combat arms unit and

2354
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,600
you were in one that was a deployable

2355
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:08,238
unit so if you were from edmonton a

2356
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,079
ppcli which were you know the princess

2357
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:13,519
patricia's which were their infantry

2358
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:15,679
unit if you were rcr out of

2359
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,679
uh petawawa ontario you knew you were

2360
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:19,679
deploying if you were at vacate you knew

2361
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:21,920
you were deploying there's combat arms

2362
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:23,359
bases and then there's like naval bases

2363
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,119
i didn't know their deployment structure

2364
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,479
i didn't know how they worked i

2365
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:28,800
i'm on the ground don't worry about the

2366
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:30,879
boats so i didn't know how the air force

2367
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:34,640
deployed i knew that can't say it was

2368
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:37,359
deploying in april you were going

2369
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:40,560
get ready that was that so you show up

2370
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:43,359
to afghanistan right what is a combat

2371
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:46,080
arms unit looks like what's the

2372
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:47,439
situation look like how much chaos is

2373
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:50,158
there

2374
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:51,678
how much clarity about mission is there

2375
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:53,679
what are your feelings about the whole

2376
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:55,840
thing so when you leave

2377
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:57,600
uh the day you leave we left quebec we

2378
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,679
got driven to the airport and then we

2379
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,520
walked onto the tarmac and we load our

2380
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:03,119
own bags and we got on a plane and it's

2381
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,960
just empty it's just it's our plane

2382
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:07,679
right and you don't go right to

2383
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,119
afghanistan you go to a stopover point

2384
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,119
which i don't know if i'm allowed to say

2385
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:13,760
where that is frankly so i just say it's

2386
01:20:11,119 --> 01:20:15,679
somewhere overseas okay and you go there

2387
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,039
and you go there for a couple days i

2388
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,800
think it's like a day or two and that's

2389
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:20,079
where you get like your kit that's where

2390
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,360
you get your bulletproof plates for the

2391
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:23,119
first time and realize how heavy those

2392
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,279
[ __ ] things are it's where you get

2393
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,880
your your weapon and your ammunition

2394
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:29,759
your first few mags it's where you get

2395
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,520
your helmet and your vests and you get

2396
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,159
everything that you need while you're

2397
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,920
there it's pretty nonchalant it's it's

2398
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:37,920
hot as hell it's your first time being

2399
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,760
in that kind of heat so you just never

2400
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,199
stop sweating the place we were in it's

2401
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,960
just the second you got out of the

2402
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:44,879
shower you were still wet after you got

2403
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,719
out what the hell is happening it's so

2404
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,079
humid and i'm like is this going to be

2405
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,000
like this in afghanistan like no it's

2406
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:52,319
not humid there at all i'm like why is

2407
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,760
this so bad here like it'll be fine

2408
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:54,799
don't worry about it

2409
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,800
so

2410
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,960
and where we were there

2411
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,520
it was kind of cute we were like in a

2412
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:05,600
base within a base and they had like

2413
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:07,840
turf and we had like ice cream and fruit

2414
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,600
and you could go get on a computer you

2415
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,239
could go make calls you had showers you

2416
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,639
had a real bed it was very

2417
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:15,919
kind of okay for that point and then you

2418
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,359
got all your stuff and then okay we're

2419
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,880
rolling out which is about a five hour

2420
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:20,880
flight again my experience with

2421
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,960
helicopters is mostly

2422
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,760
uh from uh another arnold schwarzenegger

2423
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,760
movie the predator

2424
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,480
i'm not do you want me to say i've never

2425
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,198
seen it i've never seen it last year

2426
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:33,599
yeah

2427
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:34,559
no you want to tell the audience

2428
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,560
the

2429
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,080
all the uh excellent shows that you

2430
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,719
mentioned me offline that you watch

2431
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,719
instead instead of platoon listen

2432
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:44,560
yeah that's

2433
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,639
sex in the city was that more important

2434
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,480
oh no i've never seen that don't don't

2435
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:51,359
put me in that category did you just put

2436
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:53,359
me in a box i did i watch like homeland

2437
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:56,000
i watch no i watch like

2438
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:57,279
i watch a lot of documentaries i watch i

2439
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,840
like to watch real

2440
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,719
real things more than than than just

2441
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,639
film

2442
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,760
i did a little bit of um film stuff when

2443
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,000
i got back

2444
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,760
um into canada and i was like once

2445
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,359
you're once you've seen how it's made

2446
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,119
like i don't want to do

2447
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:14,000
yeah i mean i'm the same with superhero

2448
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:15,760
movies it doesn't i want i want uh

2449
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,560
i want something closer to reality but

2450
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:21,280
then movies like platoon reveal some

2451
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,039
deep aspect of reality without it i did

2452
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:25,039
superman man of steel

2453
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:27,198
wait you sorry you you were what do you

2454
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:28,319
mean you did i was not a military expert

2455
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:30,238
but i was a

2456
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:31,359
a stunt expert

2457
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:32,879
even though i didn't actually have to do

2458
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:34,238
any stunts it's just because i had

2459
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,600
previous military experience and they

2460
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:37,359
were going to have me as an extra as a

2461
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,639
military person but if you have preview

2462
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:40,399
experience they have to make it as like

2463
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:42,079
a stunt roll like you get paid more you

2464
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:43,920
got it so i got to sit at a desk and i

2465
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:45,359
was in that i was in that like

2466
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,279
you'd see me like

2467
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:49,279
for like two seconds so you're what

2468
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:51,599
you're saying is you were the mastermind

2469
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:53,679
behind that movie for the entire thing

2470
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,679
you're so accurate okay

2471
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,840
great your representation of me is just

2472
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:02,158
fantastic the combat arms unit right in

2473
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:04,400
afghanistan um the ice cream machine

2474
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:06,719
what like when you actually get closer

2475
01:23:04,399 --> 01:23:09,119
and closer to the mission what well when

2476
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,399
does that happen when i you know got to

2477
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:11,519
where we were before we were leaving to

2478
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:13,599
get on the plane

2479
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,840
i don't really really i don't think i

2480
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,039
realized what the hell i was doing

2481
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,560
truthfully like you're asking me all

2482
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:20,800
these like what did you feel how do you

2483
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:23,600
like when i really think about it if i

2484
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,600
sit there and really think about it

2485
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:28,400
i was deploying i was aware i knew what

2486
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:30,719
i was going to do i knew my job but once

2487
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:33,519
we actually stepped onto that hurt to

2488
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:35,679
leave to get into the afghan airspace i

2489
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:38,000
think that's when it hit me yeah i think

2490
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:39,279
it smacked me in the face so hard

2491
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,840
and that's when

2492
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:44,079
the overwhelming

2493
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,079
just reality was

2494
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:46,840
oh [ __ ]

2495
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:48,399
oh

2496
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,400
oh

2497
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:52,719
when they said

2498
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,879
uh make weapons ready put the barrel to

2499
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,239
the ground put your helmets on

2500
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,199
that's when they start flying tactically

2501
01:23:56,238 --> 01:23:58,879
which means they're going between the

2502
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:00,719
mountains that means we're gonna land

2503
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,279
soon which means if you're flying like

2504
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:05,679
this it's because rpgs

2505
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:06,639
can hit you so that was my first moment

2506
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,399
of

2507
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:11,520
oh i could like just be shot down right

2508
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:12,638
now like i i couldn't i didn't grasp it

2509
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:17,280
i was

2510
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:18,880
how old was i 19 19 yeah wow okay

2511
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:20,158
so that's why i feel bad when i'm trying

2512
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,079
to explain you because it's hard because

2513
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:23,359
i don't know that i actually did grasp

2514
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:25,279
it until

2515
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:28,719
i was in the air getting ready to land

2516
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:32,158
in kandahar was the first time you heard

2517
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:33,520
bullets enemy enemy bullets or enemy

2518
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:34,799
explosions

2519
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,880
well when you're in canada when you're

2520
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,639
in kandahar when you're at cafe

2521
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,239
there's you're fairly insulated away

2522
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:42,079
from the main walls you would hear stuff

2523
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:43,678
go off or you would hear the rocket

2524
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:45,519
sirens would go off

2525
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:47,279
so you would hear though

2526
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,639
and everyone just kind of got down on

2527
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:50,639
the ground and just waited for the all

2528
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:52,400
clear and then got back up

2529
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,960
i didn't hear any

2530
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:56,238
actual live fire

2531
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:59,198
until

2532
01:24:56,238 --> 01:25:00,638
i got to the fob it was more

2533
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:02,559
just a lot of noise you would hear a lot

2534
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,400
of helicopters a lot of planes

2535
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,679
going in and out of the base so there

2536
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:07,439
was that sense you could feel the ground

2537
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:08,639
shake when they took off but there was

2538
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,399
that sense you know things were going

2539
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:13,199
around things were happening you just

2540
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:16,719
weren't far enough you were not close

2541
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:18,799
enough to the edges of calf to see it

2542
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:21,359
what's uh what's the fob

2543
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:23,199
fob is a forward observation base which

2544
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:24,880
is a small little base out in the middle

2545
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:27,759
of wherever

2546
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,520
and that's that's uh specific to our

2547
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,520
artillery

2548
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,280
that's in general just an observation

2549
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,360
base from which cramping tree to go in

2550
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:37,279
and out of um for armor to go in and out

2551
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:38,799
of special ops go in and out of them

2552
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:40,158
they fly they'll stop there they'll pick

2553
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,880
people up or do whatever then they'll go

2554
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:43,119
out

2555
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,960
so it's a forward observation basis is

2556
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:47,198
is used essentially to have eyes in that

2557
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,119
area without having to be doing patrols

2558
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:50,879
every five seconds but there's not is it

2559
01:25:49,119 --> 01:25:52,960
like is there like medics there is oh

2560
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,400
yeah yeah yeah so it was actual base

2561
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,079
yeah i was a it's a

2562
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:58,719
i don't call it an actual base you sleep

2563
01:25:56,079 --> 01:26:01,198
in tents and cots and it is

2564
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,880
the walls are this mesh material that

2565
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,960
are filled with gravel

2566
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,440
and that's the walls

2567
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,560
and then you have towers you had five i

2568
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:10,960
think we had five towers because the

2569
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:13,039
americans ran four and we ran one and so

2570
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,158
it was an american fob it's called

2571
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:15,198
ramrod

2572
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:16,960
and

2573
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:18,960
there was a

2574
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:21,760
were they marines no i think they were

2575
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,840
the 101st they were out of their

2576
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,360
this is where i get dicey because i was

2577
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,039
moved a lot so when people are like who

2578
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:29,039
are you with i'm like

2579
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:30,880
i know what their patches looked like

2580
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:32,560
i don't know the full ins and outs so

2581
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,840
i'm working on getting that back so that

2582
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,600
i can tell it accurately because i

2583
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,760
believe it deserves that type of respect

2584
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,760
but that being said i'm still trying to

2585
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,560
you know wrap my brain around all of

2586
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,400
this

2587
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,199
yeah you almost have to go back and do

2588
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:44,638
like

2589
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,559
research

2590
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:48,079
to understand the full details of all

2591
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,280
the things you were experiencing and so

2592
01:26:48,079 --> 01:26:50,639
i reached out to actually a bunch of

2593
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:52,079
people even before i wrote the book and

2594
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,600
i didn't get a lot of answers well once

2595
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:55,198
i did jocko all the people have reached

2596
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,280
out to me and were like hey

2597
01:26:55,198 --> 01:26:58,719
and i'm like called you so now i'm work

2598
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:01,279
that's why i'm doing the rewrite is i'm

2599
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,480
working on making sure that things are

2600
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:04,399
exact

2601
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:06,879
and so there was infantry units going in

2602
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:08,158
out of that fob and it was a really tiny

2603
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,440
fob

2604
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:11,599
it was

2605
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:13,759
uh run by the americans and then there

2606
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,600
was a tiny little corner that was the

2607
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,639
canadian artillery unit

2608
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,320
and

2609
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:19,760
the americans normally it's americans

2610
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:21,599
shooting for americans canadian

2611
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,000
canadians the rest of the regiment that

2612
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,719
deployed so bravo and charlie they were

2613
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,880
at canadian fobs massim guard and

2614
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:31,198
another one and these were huge fobs

2615
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,960
ours was this tiny like three kilometer

2616
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:33,919
around

2617
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,920
place

2618
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,440
and we had this tiny little subsection

2619
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,920
of it and the rest was so it was like

2620
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:42,000
this and then all american here

2621
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,319
and when we got there

2622
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,079
we landed the guns were already there so

2623
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:47,599
you ripped out the unit before you so

2624
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:49,198
those guys were just leaving and we were

2625
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,880
just replacing them

2626
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:52,879
so that we knew the guns they were

2627
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,880
canadian guns we understood you know how

2628
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:57,600
to run those that was fine

2629
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,600
when we got there though

2630
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,760
we had come in on chinook

2631
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,719
and chinooks are super loud and they're

2632
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,880
like we're hearing protection they don't

2633
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:08,480
you're not no that's this is not reality

2634
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,679
like this is why i'm partially deaf now

2635
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:11,519
like that's not real

2636
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:13,920
so sorry to take attention but do you

2637
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,360
usually wear uh ear protection in any

2638
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:19,760
aspects of warfare of this whole process

2639
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:21,599
you wear comms like you have a com on

2640
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,639
like in a radio if you're outside the

2641
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,320
wire

2642
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,800
oh so comms is that like a bluetooth

2643
01:28:24,319 --> 01:28:29,359
headset yes it's a bluetooth headset

2644
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,760
okay no like from nike or like um i was

2645
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:33,359
gonna say adidas okay maybe apple was

2646
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,639
involved at some point

2647
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:36,238
i don't know this equipment looked like

2648
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:38,880
it was from world war ii so there's

2649
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:41,759
comms but is that having ear protection

2650
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:43,600
uh like no no and i didn't wear them

2651
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,039
that's just what some people were people

2652
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,960
when you were as low as me like we

2653
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:48,800
weren't privy to conversation like we

2654
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,480
were just told what to do and you do it

2655
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,320
so when you're doing like on the op

2656
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:53,839
tower you have a radio you pick up and

2657
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:56,000
you call in and then you put the radio

2658
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:58,079
down but for a hearing protection i mean

2659
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,560
i would put in ear plugs but

2660
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:02,319
those things are so violently loud that

2661
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,560
ear plugs they don't do it justice

2662
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:07,439
either i feel like when you go shooting

2663
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,920
there's uh certain kinds of

2664
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:12,000
earplugs that you you it blocks out the

2665
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,760
gut like certain kinds of sounds

2666
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,319
associated with guns and you can still

2667
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,239
hear other types of stuff so the ones

2668
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:19,840
they issued us were these big things

2669
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:21,359
that had like a

2670
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,600
headpiece like here but you have to wear

2671
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:25,519
your helmet when you're firing right so

2672
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,440
you can't have both on

2673
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,199
okay so how much are you aware of the

2674
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:31,678
logistics of the whole thing that's

2675
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:33,599
always fascinating with warfare

2676
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:36,000
like in terms of setting up you

2677
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:38,480
mentioned gravel and the fobs

2678
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,639
like setting all those bases up were you

2679
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:42,638
seeing any of this or again it's a 19

2680
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:44,000
year old kind of just well it's not that

2681
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:46,000
i was oblivious that's the one thing i

2682
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,439
would say i wasn't i was i'm very aware

2683
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,880
of my surroundings that's something

2684
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:50,559
that's always been taught to me from a

2685
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,560
very early age because i traveled a lot

2686
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,840
with my dad in the truck and so my dad

2687
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,280
would be like you're gonna go into that

2688
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,639
bathroom and i'm gonna watch you come

2689
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:58,719
out and you're gonna watch everyone

2690
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:01,039
around you because people get kidnapped

2691
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:03,119
like that's just the reality i was

2692
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:04,319
always very paranoid

2693
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:05,679
so

2694
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:07,759
so you're paying attention to

2695
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,679
surroundings but the fob was already

2696
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,440
built up when we got there okay this is

2697
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:13,199
already like well-established basis

2698
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:15,519
already like there's there's established

2699
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:17,039
enough all right

2700
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,800
and that is one of the first times

2701
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:21,519
you've heard

2702
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:23,199
actual fire yeah that was like the i

2703
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,960
mean i heard it on the when we when we

2704
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:27,439
shoot when we you know zero in weapons

2705
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:29,679
and we do all that stuff but i had never

2706
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:31,759
heard it heard it like that before

2707
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:33,440
and then you would see the the the guys

2708
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,600
the americans would roll out every day

2709
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:37,439
and go on patrol and come back look

2710
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:39,520
back and so you would see them you would

2711
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:41,519
hear them they would tell the stories

2712
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:43,679
those types of things but i never

2713
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,360
experienced it because we never

2714
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,639
we never got attacked like our base

2715
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:48,399
never got hit

2716
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,600
we were really lucky that way

2717
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:50,960
there were other ones around us that

2718
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,239
were getting hit but we weren't we

2719
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,079
weren't getting hit

2720
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:55,919
so we were very fortunate

2721
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:59,119
um at least we didn't get hit when i was

2722
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:00,239
there i believe the entry got there was

2723
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:02,079
an attempt

2724
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:04,799
there was an attempt at some point in a

2725
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:06,399
past but i i wasn't privy to that

2726
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,880
but we were in the op towers so we had

2727
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:10,238
to do our own security but because we

2728
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,679
were such a small subset of canadians

2729
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:13,039
and we always had to have

2730
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:14,480
people running the guns and ready to run

2731
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:16,560
the guns at all times

2732
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:18,238
we only had to man one tower so you

2733
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:20,320
would do four hour shifts with a fire

2734
01:31:18,238 --> 01:31:22,000
team partner in the tower depending on

2735
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:24,719
whatever but you do it every day

2736
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,800
so i would look out into the the rest of

2737
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:28,480
afghanistan at that opportunity

2738
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,800
otherwise it was just like your walls

2739
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:32,799
what did it look like is it beautiful

2740
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:35,520
just the full landscape

2741
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,960
or is it where i was there was mountains

2742
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,280
in the distance

2743
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,800
it was just very sandy very flat

2744
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:42,719
and there was a couple small compounds

2745
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,520
on the outside it wasn't a lot to look

2746
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,198
at

2747
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,880
there was a long road that you knew that

2748
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:49,599
got hit all the time

2749
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:52,960
there wasn't a lot to look at

2750
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:54,400
such a strange place to be the center of

2751
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,760
superpowers

2752
01:31:54,399 --> 01:32:00,158
over the decades it really is

2753
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,320
like and and the fact that the populace

2754
01:32:00,158 --> 01:32:04,879
the civilians are almost completely

2755
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:07,198
clueless to the full history of things

2756
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:09,199
in terms of globally the geopolitics of

2757
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:11,519
it all yeah well if you look at the

2758
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:13,439
location of it right on a map it makes

2759
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:15,199
more sense right you can wrap your brain

2760
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:16,879
around it

2761
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:18,238
but i met plenty of people who had never

2762
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:20,000
even seen a picture of themselves when i

2763
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:21,359
was in that country so i mean how much

2764
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,560
more are they going to understand if

2765
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:27,839
they don't know what even exists outside

2766
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:30,719
you tell a small story of taking a

2767
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:33,360
picture of a girl and showing it to her

2768
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:34,880
an afghani girl yeah

2769
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:35,679
we were i was with the british at that

2770
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,679
time

2771
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:39,199
and we were on that operation that gets

2772
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,679
highlighted quite a bit

2773
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:43,678
and uh we had stopped and we the icom

2774
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:45,440
radios were pinging and icon radios are

2775
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:47,520
a radio that

2776
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:48,719
we have an interpreter on

2777
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,320
that

2778
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:52,319
the taliban basically we can hear what

2779
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:53,439
they're saying it's their coms it's us

2780
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:55,119
tapped in

2781
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:58,158
when it's really clear

2782
01:32:55,119 --> 01:32:59,840
they're close when it's scatty and

2783
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:01,359
it's they're far enough away normally

2784
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,920
you know they're not planning an attack

2785
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:04,799
although you never know really

2786
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,279
and we

2787
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,960
we were going door-to-door

2788
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:10,238
kind of like what they're doing now

2789
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:12,319
and we were pulling people out of their

2790
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:14,079
houses and we knew there were there was

2791
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:15,679
people in there that were active taliban

2792
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:17,119
and we knew the icons were pinging when

2793
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:18,880
we got in there they had hidden all the

2794
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:20,079
women and kids and locked them inside

2795
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,760
the house

2796
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:23,600
because often

2797
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,360
nowadays women the women they would hide

2798
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,639
things on them that they shouldn't have

2799
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:28,238
because no one would be ever there to

2800
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:30,079
search them because there isn't a lot of

2801
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:31,919
women on the front lines

2802
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:35,039
but i got borrowed to go specifically

2803
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,800
search women and children so they had me

2804
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,639
and one of the little girls kind of

2805
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,199
snuck out and was kind of sitting near

2806
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:43,119
me and i was eating something and i had

2807
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:44,559
like these little these little candies

2808
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:46,000
they're called little sweeties the

2809
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,840
british have them in the ration packs i

2810
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,679
don't know they're good though and she

2811
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,639
saw me eating them and so i gave them to

2812
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,679
her

2813
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,960
and then her brother came over and

2814
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,480
slapped her upside the head and took him

2815
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,679
from her so then i just went over and

2816
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:57,198
slapped him upside the head and just

2817
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,960
pointed my gun at her while she ate them

2818
01:33:57,198 --> 01:33:59,678
all yeah because i was like

2819
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,600
no

2820
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:03,520
yeah like you can have these i'm gonna

2821
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,000
stand here and make sure you do

2822
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,280
and i remember asking can i take a

2823
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,399
picture with her i asked the trip can

2824
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:09,198
you ask her can i take a picture with

2825
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:10,319
her

2826
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:12,479
um

2827
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:14,000
and she was very confused and when you

2828
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:16,158
look at the photo you see her face she's

2829
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,840
very stunned she's very stunned and it

2830
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:20,359
was a wasn't my camera it was my

2831
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:22,719
officer's camera it was a hot pink like

2832
01:34:20,359 --> 01:34:24,960
fluorescent pink camera so i pulled this

2833
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:27,119
like huge pink thing and i'm like

2834
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,239
let's take a picture like

2835
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:30,000
and so she stood there and took a

2836
01:34:28,238 --> 01:34:31,359
picture but then she grabbed the camera

2837
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,840
because i flipped it and showed it to

2838
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:35,839
her and her eyes got huge and she

2839
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,520
grabbed it she ran inside

2840
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,840
and they're like oh that's gone forever

2841
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:41,360
like that's it's over for you

2842
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,639
and then she came out and she kind of

2843
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:44,719
snuck out

2844
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:46,079
and i went in and grabbed it and the mom

2845
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:48,239
lifted up her burger and was showing me

2846
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:50,079
that she like shaved her legs

2847
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:51,839
to be more western

2848
01:34:50,079 --> 01:34:54,719
and i was just

2849
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,719
at that moment

2850
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,920
i don't know that

2851
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:02,319
i could have realized how much that

2852
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,840
moment affected me

2853
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:06,319
how much of how much that moment would

2854
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,520
affect me later on in my life

2855
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:10,639
until

2856
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:12,800
it's been later on in my life

2857
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:15,600
yeah there's little like glimmers like

2858
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,920
that in uh in parts of the world that

2859
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,760
are basically you're taking away

2860
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:23,199
everything from the populace like

2861
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:25,840
freedoms and and so on and when they um

2862
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:27,118
when you see that glimmer of humanity

2863
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:29,600
like yeah

2864
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:31,839
shaved legs or or or like using

2865
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:34,320
technology for the first time

2866
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,920
it's magic or like food being presented

2867
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:38,960
with certain kinds of foods that you've

2868
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:43,920
never tried i mean right you want to see

2869
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:45,920
true like joy of discovery is you bring

2870
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,480
basically the american supermarket

2871
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,920
anything from it to most parts of the

2872
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:52,399
world and they

2873
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:55,279
i just i mean i remember even i mean we

2874
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:57,679
weren't like in poverty in russia just

2875
01:35:55,279 --> 01:36:00,319
poor but just the supermarket was full

2876
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,920
of joy i thought i could just die happy

2877
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:03,599
in an american supermarket when i first

2878
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:05,279
saw it and how old were you when you

2879
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,719
came here 13.

2880
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:09,198
did you speak english

2881
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:12,000
yeah not well i thought

2882
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:14,719
i was i never was good at languages so i

2883
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,520
it was very much like why would i need

2884
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:19,920
to learn another language okay it was

2885
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,360
that attitude it was very like doesn't i

2886
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:24,560
don't know

2887
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:26,719
well no i think culturally in

2888
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:30,159
not in america but everywhere else in

2889
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:32,158
the world it's constantly kind of seen

2890
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:34,479
it's a good thing to do to learn other

2891
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:36,158
languages because especially english

2892
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:38,479
because it's like that's the language of

2893
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:39,839
the world right and i i just thought

2894
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:41,839
like um

2895
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,600
i don't need english to discover the

2896
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:46,159
beauty of the world like what this

2897
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,440
doesn't like i enjoy life i enjoy soccer

2898
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:48,799
i enjoy

2899
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:51,039
i mean i don't remember what else i

2900
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,679
enjoyed in life but math like why do i

2901
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:55,519
need english for this so that kind of

2902
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:57,920
attitude got me in a lot of trouble when

2903
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:59,280
i came here because i i couldn't

2904
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:01,118
reluctant

2905
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:03,198
yeah but also just couldn't speak well

2906
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:04,479
and when you move 13 years old as middle

2907
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:06,158
school

2908
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:07,839
you get made fun of a lot you get

2909
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:09,759
bullied and all those kinds of things

2910
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,199
which in retrospect is a very positive

2911
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:13,360
thing because it

2912
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:14,799
makes you harder

2913
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:16,719
i thought being russian would make be

2914
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:18,880
like hard enough

2915
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,880
no well me everyone is different i mean

2916
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:23,279
the part of the russian thing is uh it's

2917
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:25,440
kind of you know i'm joking because

2918
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:29,519
if you know me

2919
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:31,118
i admire being hard i admire

2920
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:33,280
fighting and these kinds of things right

2921
01:37:31,118 --> 01:37:35,039
these um what would you call them

2922
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:36,719
struggle in all of its forms martial

2923
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:39,039
arts wrestling all those kinds of things

2924
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:41,600
but i'm all ultimately like i'm so much

2925
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:43,760
about love like i'm clearly sensitive to

2926
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,560
the world in some weird genetic way

2927
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,600
that

2928
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,840
um

2929
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,920
it was important for me to harden up

2930
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,760
when i when i came here and i was in

2931
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,359
love with people and it's like and

2932
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,560
everybody's being mean to me and it's

2933
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:57,039
like what

2934
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:59,440
that it's like it's a little like

2935
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:00,399
like slap like oh okay

2936
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:02,879
like

2937
01:38:00,399 --> 01:38:04,319
it's not like life is not often fair and

2938
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,560
then that's when for me personally

2939
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:08,399
everybody has has different journeys of

2940
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,920
hardship that are much much more

2941
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:11,039
difficult like your story is much more

2942
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,920
difficult

2943
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:14,880
uh

2944
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,239
is you know i started to read a lot it's

2945
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,520
like something happens some kind of

2946
01:38:16,238 --> 01:38:20,479
challenge where you start to think about

2947
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:23,199
the world start to think about yourself

2948
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:25,279
that that can ultimately create really

2949
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:27,599
interesting minds it can break some

2950
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:28,840
people it can create interesting minds

2951
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,119
and

2952
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:29,920
uh to be weeded out i thought we talked

2953
01:38:29,118 --> 01:38:29,920
and then they it's

2954
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:35,600
about this yeah the strong will survive

2955
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:36,560
the week will die off

2956
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,719
yeah

2957
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:41,600
now you're talking uh russian to me i'm

2958
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:44,239
not speaking russian i'm just giving

2959
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,800
solid life advice just be harder and

2960
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:48,718
then everyone will be fine

2961
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:51,039
uh yeah this is your inner david goggins

2962
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:53,039
coming out real quick here okay

2963
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:54,880
the fob yeah and then i was just

2964
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:57,439
explaining to you that

2965
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:59,118
the way it is run you're gonna love this

2966
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:00,559
when we walked up to those tents for the

2967
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:01,839
first time

2968
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,800
the people that were there before us

2969
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,800
left us a noose

2970
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,840
i have a photo of it

2971
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,439
like it's a

2972
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,600
like hanging from the tent like at the

2973
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:14,000
front of the tent like welcome

2974
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:16,000
so you were also mentioning like the the

2975
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,960
dark humor of it it was is it basically

2976
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,639
a funny joke correct yeah it was funny

2977
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:22,480
at first that's pretty funny

2978
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,880
it was funny during the time

2979
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:26,479
now when i look back at it i was like

2980
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:28,000
come on and

2981
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:29,279
that was a poo

2982
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,960
i mean i get it because they had already

2983
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:34,319
been there and like so i

2984
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:36,239
afterwards i can see how it's funny um

2985
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:38,559
now with like the suicide epidemic in

2986
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:41,279
the veteran community now i'm like

2987
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:43,280
i don't post that photo really so

2988
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:44,719
doesn't that dark humor still somehow

2989
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:48,079
help even when you're considering

2990
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:50,719
suicide doesn't it some of it somehow

2991
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:52,238
somehow yeah it's like you're not hiding

2992
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:53,920
it

2993
01:39:52,238 --> 01:39:56,158
it's it's like humor is one of the way

2994
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:59,760
to reveal

2995
01:39:56,158 --> 01:40:01,439
reveal the reality of abuse of suffering

2996
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:03,199
if you look at there's this photo that

2997
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:05,599
generates around right around suicide

2998
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:07,039
prevention month which is september

2999
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,440
and it's always like a photo of like

3000
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:11,039
robin williams and bourdain and all of

3001
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,599
these other individuals who were

3002
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:15,279
comedians who all took their lives and

3003
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,280
they're all smiling

3004
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:18,800
and they're like this is the face of

3005
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:21,118
depression

3006
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,480
there's a way our brains work where

3007
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:25,920
humor

3008
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:28,879
is a necessary part of survival whether

3009
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,600
it's used for joyous things or it's used

3010
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,079
for

3011
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,520
ways to cope through life for me the

3012
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:34,960
military humor was one of the things

3013
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,760
that helped get me through

3014
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:40,480
and it still does to this day frankly

3015
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,480
because humor

3016
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:46,880
humor makes some of the horrific things

3017
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:48,320
i say not seem so horrific

3018
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:50,960
and people can

3019
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:53,759
digest it rather than being like you

3020
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:56,239
need to be locked up somewhere

3021
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:58,000
yeah that's why i mean one one of the

3022
01:40:56,238 --> 01:41:00,238
aspects of russian humor there's a

3023
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,359
darkness to it because

3024
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:04,718
um

3025
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:06,880
through it reverberates all the

3026
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:08,239
the millions of people who died right it

3027
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:11,199
seems like the only way to make sense of

3028
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:13,118
it is to joke about it i i still love it

3029
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:15,839
because if you don't it'll break you

3030
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:17,839
yeah something like that or also

3031
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,360
humor is just seems to be the highest

3032
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:22,000
form of

3033
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:23,920
us humans in the human experience it

3034
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,238
just seems

3035
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,920
it seems to somehow uh accumulate the

3036
01:41:26,238 --> 01:41:30,079
full thing the absurdity of it the

3037
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:31,840
unfairness of it the because like

3038
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:34,000
ultimately all the suffering is like

3039
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,079
it's all just apes

3040
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,399
fighting for power and love

3041
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:39,679
and somehow torturing each other in the

3042
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:42,399
process

3043
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:44,158
hello podcast listener lex here

3044
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:45,920
quick intermission to say that some of

3045
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:48,238
the names in the following story have

3046
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:49,760
been silenced out to protect their

3047
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:50,799
privacy

3048
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,600
the

3049
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,600
story of

3050
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:57,279
and

3051
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:59,760
witnessing

3052
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:02,559
i think your first somebody you met

3053
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:04,320
somebody you saw somebody you began to

3054
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:05,360
be close with

3055
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:07,359
his

3056
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:09,118
life

3057
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:11,839
him dying

3058
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:12,719
can you tell the story

3059
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,199
sure

3060
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:17,198
that's uh no problem i will tell you

3061
01:42:15,198 --> 01:42:20,479
that i have i'm gonna leave some of the

3062
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:22,638
names out of the people because uh

3063
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:23,839
they have reached out and asked that i

3064
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,679
do such

3065
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,079
i've also been informed of other things

3066
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:30,480
i forgot that happened during the thing

3067
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:32,639
that were way worse than i thought so

3068
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:34,000
i'll i'll try to uh add those in as

3069
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:35,279
because that's new information to me

3070
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,079
because my brain has blocked it out but

3071
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:37,759
i've been

3072
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:40,639
i've been told which is good because

3073
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:42,320
it's better detail um so we were

3074
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:44,319
we were doing a movement that morning

3075
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:47,198
and we were going from

3076
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:49,679
uh compound to compound

3077
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:52,000
i was never told what we were doing

3078
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:54,319
i knew what my job was i didn't know the

3079
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,439
operational overview i didn't i didn't

3080
01:42:54,319 --> 01:42:57,519
know

3081
01:42:55,439 --> 01:43:00,238
who we were looking for i wasn't there

3082
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:02,400
for that my job was specifically to look

3083
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:04,638
after the women and children and to

3084
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:06,719
provide support if need be

3085
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:09,440
and when you have

3086
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:11,520
certain people so the i.e the bomb dog

3087
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:13,039
handler and the bomb dog and then you

3088
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:14,880
have the medics and then you have like a

3089
01:43:13,039 --> 01:43:16,960
female searcher

3090
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:19,520
that there's only one of those in each

3091
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:22,399
unit or if if there's even one in each

3092
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,320
unit i got passed between units so that

3093
01:43:22,399 --> 01:43:25,599
they could have access to me for for

3094
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:28,079
both

3095
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,360
and we were kind of sitting

3096
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:31,679
and we were waiting for the all clear to

3097
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:32,719
move and at that time

3098
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:34,158
the

3099
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:35,840
the compound

3100
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:37,599
wall i was leaning up against i had my

3101
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:40,079
back up against

3102
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:41,280
i wasn't facing the direct direction

3103
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:43,118
where

3104
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:44,880
actually blew up i was

3105
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:47,039
had my back to it and i had happened to

3106
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:48,719
turn and look to the left and on the

3107
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:50,639
right hand side

3108
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:52,960
across the road of where we were leaned

3109
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:55,760
up against was another compound two

3110
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,880
stories high people inside a sniper on

3111
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,440
the roof

3112
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:02,480
and a spotter

3113
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:04,559
there was a handful of us on this wall

3114
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:07,439
and in front of me

3115
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:09,280
there was a road

3116
01:44:07,439 --> 01:44:10,638
the road went straight

3117
01:44:09,279 --> 01:44:12,399
that compound's here there's another

3118
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:14,800
road here on the right-hand side in

3119
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:16,479
front of it and then this road went

3120
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,840
along here and this was a wide open

3121
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:21,678
space just a

3122
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:24,000
huge we hate those you hate those

3123
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:25,520
because it's too much space it's too

3124
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,118
easy it's like

3125
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,560
fish in a barrel you don't want to be in

3126
01:44:27,118 --> 01:44:29,439
that field

3127
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,800
um

3128
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:32,799
because there's too much

3129
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,880
line of sight line of sight could be

3130
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:35,840
ieds it could be it could be it could be

3131
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,760
anything

3132
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,520
and so

3133
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:42,719
uh

3134
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:45,840
when i was leaning up against the wall

3135
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:48,239
we'd send a couple people ahead to go

3136
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:50,000
and clear the road so that we could all

3137
01:44:48,238 --> 01:44:52,158
go along it and then clear the gray pup

3138
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,079
off to the left hand side

3139
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:56,799
we are doing that because

3140
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:58,800
they use those locations to put ieds so

3141
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,440
that when you're going to search it

3142
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,639
it's just it's a better chance of you

3143
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:04,399
blowing into a million pieces

3144
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:06,159
essentially why they love that

3145
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:08,559
put bombs in small places send people

3146
01:45:06,158 --> 01:45:10,319
into small places small places go boom

3147
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,080
they paint the walls

3148
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:13,279
so we were just kind of sitting and

3149
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:14,719
waiting

3150
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:16,479
and then

3151
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:18,158
i turned happened to turn i was looking

3152
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:20,559
in that direction and i heard the ground

3153
01:45:18,158 --> 01:45:22,158
shake before i even realized what i was

3154
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:24,000
seeing with my own eyes

3155
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:25,118
the ground shook

3156
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,760
and

3157
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:27,759
i saw

3158
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:32,480
a big piece of a body

3159
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:34,238
i think it was the torso

3160
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:36,000
just kind of

3161
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:38,238
fly through the air

3162
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,639
and land into the field and as soon as

3163
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:42,079
that happened all hell broke loose

3164
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:43,359
it was like the

3165
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:45,359
they were sitting and watching and

3166
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:47,118
waiting and they do that and i say they

3167
01:45:45,359 --> 01:45:48,479
mean the taliban they do that they they

3168
01:45:47,118 --> 01:45:50,559
love that because then they can record

3169
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:52,319
it for propaganda and they can use it

3170
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,960
against us and they just love being able

3171
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:56,479
to take take our people out

3172
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:57,760
and we had the interpreter sitting

3173
01:45:56,479 --> 01:45:59,678
beside me

3174
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,760
and he had the icon radio on

3175
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:05,520
and as soon as the blast went off i

3176
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:06,719
heard just the scream

3177
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,480
i heard it

3178
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:10,239
and i knew what that meant but i

3179
01:46:08,479 --> 01:46:12,079
couldn't

3180
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:13,759
i didn't understand what was about to

3181
01:46:12,079 --> 01:46:16,319
happen

3182
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,320
i couldn't

3183
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:20,159
i couldn't wrap my brain around what was

3184
01:46:18,158 --> 01:46:23,439
about to happen because

3185
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:24,799
i had never been outside the wire

3186
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:26,479
and

3187
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,239
people are like people say to me now

3188
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:29,759
they're like

3189
01:46:28,238 --> 01:46:30,959
no there's no way that shit's true

3190
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,960
there's no way that she was involved in

3191
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,439
that and then that and then and that and

3192
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,600
then in that well let me explain

3193
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:42,158
i was one person

3194
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:46,000
i was being passed around to units

3195
01:46:42,158 --> 01:46:48,079
i was with a ton of different people

3196
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,880
i had no comms

3197
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:52,399
and i was just being told where to go

3198
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,639
um

3199
01:46:52,399 --> 01:46:57,679
and i just happened to be like a [ __ ]

3200
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:59,199
hit the fan magnet it felt like

3201
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:00,319
and then i found out later it was not

3202
01:46:59,198 --> 01:47:02,000
just me it was

3203
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:03,759
all of us were getting it

3204
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,279
so that made me feel better because then

3205
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:06,880
i was like well that i have a lot of

3206
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:08,719
survivors guilt that's like a thing

3207
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,639
that's still stuck with me i've worked

3208
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:13,118
through a lot of [ __ ] but survivor's

3209
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:14,960
guilt that's a big one for me certain

3210
01:47:13,118 --> 01:47:15,429
food is a big one for me

3211
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:16,960
um

3212
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:21,039
[Music]

3213
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:24,158
yeah uh skin on food

3214
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:26,880
so like chicken with skin on it

3215
01:47:24,158 --> 01:47:27,679
oh just because of the biology of death

3216
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,199
just

3217
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:31,279
well when you hold people's bodies and

3218
01:47:29,198 --> 01:47:33,439
your hands with no gloves on

3219
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:36,079
you know what that feels like

3220
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:38,000
when you touch raw meat again it's the

3221
01:47:36,079 --> 01:47:40,399
same thing that's what that feels like

3222
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,000
when when there's a dying or dead body

3223
01:47:40,399 --> 01:47:45,439
well my friend was blown into a million

3224
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:49,000
pieces so i just had pieces of him

3225
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:49,000
so there was no

3226
01:47:50,158 --> 01:47:55,198
there was no differentiator of like this

3227
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,800
was his thigh or this was his torso or

3228
01:47:55,198 --> 01:47:58,238
there was like

3229
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,760
there was none of that

3230
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:02,559
there was only one instance with the

3231
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:04,480
boot but um

3232
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:06,560
but i i what i i

3233
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:08,399
at that point we had been in some fire

3234
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,360
fights and we had been taking some

3235
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:14,158
rounds but it was more like

3236
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:16,399
take around we you know get hit and then

3237
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:18,479
we duck into a compound we would set up

3238
01:48:16,399 --> 01:48:20,000
and then we'd be firing i wasn't i

3239
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:21,678
wasn't really involved in a lot of the

3240
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,679
firefights until after this after that

3241
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:25,600
the rest of the week i was like

3242
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:27,359
i was angry and i wanted them all to go

3243
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,280
and i wanted to be in every position to

3244
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:30,399
take them out myself so i put myself in

3245
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:32,158
every position

3246
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:33,920
so i made sure i was on the roof i made

3247
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:35,118
sure i was there i made sure if hey you

3248
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,639
need something i'll [ __ ] run it i

3249
01:48:35,118 --> 01:48:38,000
don't care if i die anymore because as

3250
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:39,199
soon as that happened my light switch

3251
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,039
went off

3252
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:43,678
it didn't matter anymore to me can you

3253
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:46,158

3254
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:48,319
you were hearing these

3255
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:49,118
screams yeah so

3256
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:50,559
the

3257
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:52,238
id went off

3258
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,639
and what had happened was they put an

3259
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,799
ied inside of a grape hut and the gray

3260
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:58,079
putt has rectangular wall um rectangular

3261
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,000
holes in the wall

3262
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:02,479
and there's just like one door and it's

3263
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,639
this tall mud hut with just all these

3264
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:06,399
like holes in it

3265
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:08,400
and they had put an ied underneath a

3266
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:10,238
pile of sticks

3267
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:12,000

a metal detector the brits carry them

3269
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,560
i've never seen i think other countries

3270
01:49:13,439 --> 01:49:15,598
have them but i've only ever seen them

3271
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:17,760
use it

3272
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:20,239
and that's how we were kind of detecting

3273
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:22,400
if there was an id we must have hid it

3274
01:49:20,238 --> 01:49:24,638
the sticks or something and set it off

3275
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:25,920
and it just it was over he there's no

3276
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:27,520
way he felt anything and then there was

3277
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:29,840
another guy at the door

3278
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,760
bent down on one knee

3279
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,119
and he was facing and kind of watching

3280
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:35,599
for

3281
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:36,960
and then the blast hit him on this side

3282
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:38,239
and so it took him out and pulled his

3283
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:40,480
kid off pulled his helmet pulled

3284
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:44,158
everything off [ __ ] him all up

3285
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:46,718
big time this is one ied yeah

3286
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:49,198
but it was in a contained area

3287
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:52,399
and he was in the doorway

3288
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:54,079
up and out can you explain what an ied

3289
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:56,158
is and how does it work

3290
01:49:54,079 --> 01:49:58,238
i can do my best uh they're improvised

3291
01:49:56,158 --> 01:49:59,679
explosive devices they can be used

3292
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:02,479
pretty much out of anything to make

3293
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:04,239
anything so um

3294
01:50:02,479 --> 01:50:06,158
garbage when we got to afghanistan they

3295
01:50:04,238 --> 01:50:07,359
did the id meeting with us they're like

3296
01:50:06,158 --> 01:50:09,439
these are what we're finding that they

3297
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:12,079
would show us diffused ieds so they

3298
01:50:09,439 --> 01:50:14,158
would see those big blue drums filled

3299
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:16,079
with gasoline buried in the ground you

3300
01:50:14,158 --> 01:50:17,598
would see a wire it would go to a

3301
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:19,279
pressure plate you hit the pressure

3302
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:20,400
plate that would hit that and it would

3303
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:22,238
go

3304
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:24,238
you would see ieds

3305
01:50:22,238 --> 01:50:26,079
some of them were ridiculous the inju in

3306
01:50:24,238 --> 01:50:27,759
the uh the engineering that went into

3307
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:29,439
some of these was hilarious because they

3308
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:31,039
were thinking

3309
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:33,598
they were thinking to use everything

3310
01:50:31,039 --> 01:50:35,599
they could there was a cigarette pack

3311
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:36,880
they had used they lined the inside with

3312
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:38,159
tin foil

3313
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,599
and when you stepped on the tin foil it

3314
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:41,920
had a piece of wire it was enough of a

3315
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:43,039
spark to set off a line of batteries

3316
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,800
that we had thrown out that were all

3317
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:46,960
dead when you fuse them all together

3318
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:48,800
there was enough juice to make it go

3319
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:51,520
then they would attach that to like like

3320
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:53,760
phosphorus or gasoline or whatever they

3321
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,920
could that would make a big boom

3322
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:57,039
they would use um

3323
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,480
yeah that's why you never kick garbage

3324
01:50:57,039 --> 01:51:00,079
on the ground you'll never see me kick

3325
01:50:58,479 --> 01:51:02,799
something on the ground you'll see me

3326
01:51:00,079 --> 01:51:04,719
walk around it always if i ever see a

3327
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:05,920
pile of rocks or something that looks

3328
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:06,880
like it shouldn't be there i won't walk

3329
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,719
near it

3330
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:10,639
even now because

3331
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:12,158
they use that pile of rocks to remind

3332
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:13,359
people there's something there we don't

3333
01:51:12,158 --> 01:51:15,359
know what that means but we know that

3334
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:18,079
something's there and very often they

3335
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:19,839
would use anything garbage

3336
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:21,359
wires

3337
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:24,000
we were very we had to burn everything

3338
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:28,079
for a reason

3339
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:30,880
it's so terrifying to not

3340
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:33,039
for the source of death to be

3341
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:35,359
like little parts of the environment and

3342
01:51:33,039 --> 01:51:37,279
then people

3343
01:51:35,359 --> 01:51:38,799
that don't look like that they're not

3344
01:51:37,279 --> 01:51:41,759
dressed as soldiers

3345
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:43,920
like civilians and like regular because

3346
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:46,800
then you when you have to come back or

3347
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:49,279
even there is you're just surrounded by

3348
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:51,119
danger and then you distrust everything

3349
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:53,759
essentially that's the problem and

3350
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:55,519
that's why you have such ptsd issues

3351
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,760
with the soldiers we have now

3352
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:58,880
because you're in the environment in

3353
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:01,119
which

3354
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:04,159
it's very similar

3355
01:52:01,118 --> 01:52:06,880
so so there's this one ied so this one

3356
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:08,319
ied i i still don't know what it was um

3357
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:09,760
went off

3358
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:11,118
my body flew

3359
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:12,239
the guy at the door

3360
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:14,079
um

3361
01:52:12,238 --> 01:52:18,559
he kicked out he was all broken and

3362
01:52:14,079 --> 01:52:18,559
bleeding and a mess um

3363
01:52:19,198 --> 01:52:24,000
at that point the radio started going

3364
01:52:21,039 --> 01:52:25,118
crazy like i could hear the guys yelling

3365
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,079
and screaming trying to figure it out

3366
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:27,198
and then you could hear the numbers

3367
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:29,519
being called

3368
01:52:27,198 --> 01:52:31,598
k.i.a number number number number

3369
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:33,840
i don't know anybody's service number i

3370
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:35,279
i don't know what's going on next you

3371
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,079
know mortar rounds start like coming

3372
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:37,279
down

3373
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:39,359
and like

3374
01:52:37,279 --> 01:52:42,238
live fire starts happening and i'm like

3375
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:43,598
holy [ __ ] things are popping off

3376
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:45,198
and i remember

3377
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:47,119
just looking at him being like we need

3378
01:52:45,198 --> 01:52:50,079
to go we need to go now and i just got

3379
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:51,920
this like like i was i was like we're

3380
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:54,000
going and they're like hold on burns and

3381
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:56,158
i'm like we're [ __ ] going like i

3382
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,679
wasn't dealing with it well and they're

3383
01:52:56,158 --> 01:52:59,598
like all right all right go go go go go

3384
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:01,279
go so we went

3385
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:02,560
and we um

3386
01:53:01,279 --> 01:53:03,840
and i

3387
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:06,320
helped out

3388
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,679
with that other individual kind of held

3389
01:53:06,319 --> 01:53:10,399
him down

3390
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:13,118
started doing medic work on him and he

3391
01:53:10,399 --> 01:53:14,479
just kept saying where's where's where's

3392
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:16,079
he was in such a state of shock i've

3393
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:18,238
never seen somebody's eyeball so big in

3394
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:19,198
my life she's like where's where's

3395
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:20,638
where's

3396
01:53:19,198 --> 01:53:22,960
the guy he's good buddy he's good he's

3397
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:24,880
good picture like a super thick scottish

3398
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:25,840
accent though because these guys were

3399
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,679
just

3400
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:28,880
oh and when they talk fast it's even

3401
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:30,800
worse

3402
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:32,719
and then so i ran over and we we jumped

3403
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:34,159
down into the ditch along the side of

3404
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:35,279
the road because the road hadn't been

3405
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:37,679
cleared

3406
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:39,359
and we're running through

3407
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:41,118
these tall

3408
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:43,279
they look like cannabis plants but

3409
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:46,238
they're not but it there's it's just

3410
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:47,840
very thick bush and i felt like i was

3411
01:53:46,238 --> 01:53:49,598
running in slow motion so if you picture

3412
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:51,039
one of your video games where like the

3413
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:53,679
tunnel vision and you're just you can

3414
01:53:51,039 --> 01:53:55,039
hear your breathing it's

3415
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:57,039
like that and you're running and you

3416
01:53:55,039 --> 01:54:00,158
can't move fast enough and you're like

3417
01:53:57,039 --> 01:54:01,920
trying to get there

3418
01:54:00,158 --> 01:54:03,598
and we hit the road

3419
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:05,118
and the rounds are coming down and

3420
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:06,880
mortars are coming down

3421
01:54:05,118 --> 01:54:08,559
and they're like okay on three run so we

3422
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:11,359
run on three and we run into the

3423
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:14,080
compound i mean into the great putt

3424
01:54:11,359 --> 01:54:17,118
and i remember looking around and very

3425
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:20,880
seriously going where is he

3426
01:54:17,118 --> 01:54:21,679
just genuinely asking i think it was

3427
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:24,480
been

3428
01:54:21,679 --> 01:54:25,599
messaging me he's been incredible he's

3429
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:26,718
one of the best soldiers i've ever

3430
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:28,960
served with

3431
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:30,719
he was a higher up so he was running

3432
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:33,198
part of this he he's messaged me and he

3433
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:34,960
was giving me some information and um

3434
01:54:33,198 --> 01:54:36,000
he's like i was in there with you

3435
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,359
and he goes i remember because you

3436
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,359
handed me the boot

3437
01:54:37,359 --> 01:54:41,198
and because i walked over and i all the

3438
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:43,759
rounds were like we were being shot at

3439
01:54:41,198 --> 01:54:46,158
mortars were coming down but it was this

3440
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:49,760
slow motion and i remember walking over

3441
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:53,359
to the hole in the ground

3442
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:53,360
and seeing his boot in the ground

3443
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:56,719
but it was

3444
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:59,118
his leg was still hanging like uh but

3445
01:54:56,719 --> 01:55:01,118
just below his knee was still in it

3446
01:54:59,118 --> 01:55:03,598
but the boot was perfectly laced up

3447
01:55:01,118 --> 01:55:05,920
like the boot was fine

3448
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:07,599
and i just

3449
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:09,199
i held it and i turned and i looked at

3450
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:11,679
the guys and i was like we could reuse

3451
01:55:09,198 --> 01:55:11,678
the boot

3452
01:55:13,279 --> 01:55:18,639
no that wasn't even

3453
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:21,359
what is what is that was that

3454
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:22,880
was that actually an intelligent attempt

3455
01:55:21,359 --> 01:55:26,399
at humor

3456
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:28,000
or was it some kind of deeply lost like

3457
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:29,759
you were completely just lost i think my

3458
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,920
brain broke

3459
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:34,880
i think my that's the moment i call my

3460
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:36,880
light switch went off

3461
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:39,118
did you understand that he was dead at

3462
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:42,639
that point like intellectually you were

3463
01:55:39,118 --> 01:55:42,639
just something is it just broke

3464
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:51,359
no emotion like it just broke it just

3465
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,359
shattered

3466
01:55:52,399 --> 01:55:55,839
it shattered

3467
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:59,079
i felt it happen

3468
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:59,079
i felt

3469
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:05,598
i didn't feel

3470
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:05,599
i didn't feel anything

3471
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,239
it just

3472
01:56:07,279 --> 01:56:09,920
broke

3473
01:56:08,238 --> 01:56:13,279
and at that moment

3474
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:15,520
because later there's some anger almost

3475
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:17,359
at that moment none of that

3476
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:19,599
i couldn't comprehend what happened i

3477
01:56:17,359 --> 01:56:21,279
knew he wasn't there anymore because

3478
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:22,560
they looked at me and said what's here

3479
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:24,800
is here

3480
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:26,080
start grabbing pieces we need to [ __ ]

3481
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,719
move

3482
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:30,880
and so um

3483
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:32,719
i handed the boot over they took it and

3484
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:34,400
then i started just grabbing anything

3485
01:56:32,719 --> 01:56:36,880
out of the walls because those little

3486
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:38,238
rectangulars just had flesh hanging from

3487
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:40,719
it

3488
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:43,519
and i didn't have my gloves on um

3489
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:45,118
suddenly used them to search and um so

3490
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:48,480
you want to bring

3491
01:56:45,118 --> 01:56:48,479
everything back

3492
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:52,800
this is what even if they're dead do you

3493
01:56:50,479 --> 01:56:55,118
want to save

3494
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:57,119
save those you served with

3495
01:56:55,118 --> 01:56:58,479
yeah because they deserve that they

3496
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:00,158
don't deserve to have a piece of them

3497
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:02,479
drugged behind a truck for propaganda

3498
01:57:00,158 --> 01:57:05,039
it's not it's not fair what are the

3499
01:57:02,479 --> 01:57:07,839
others i mean was there just a focus on

3500
01:57:05,039 --> 01:57:09,439
mission or was there a panic no panic

3501
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:10,880
with these guys these guys are the most

3502
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:12,399
switched on [ __ ] i've ever seen

3503
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:13,440
in my life

3504
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:15,198
they

3505
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:18,638
we started grabbing and

3506
01:57:15,198 --> 01:57:19,919
reminding me he said you know you uh

3507
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:20,960
that's how he goes when people say

3508
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,920
that's the worst part of your day that

3509
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,118
wasn't even the worst part of the day do

3510
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:25,840
you remember when you handed me the bag

3511
01:57:23,118 --> 01:57:25,839
of intestines

3512
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:32,880
no

3513
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:38,000
no i do though thank you for that

3514
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:41,679
so there's parts you don't even they're

3515
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,679
just not they don't register

3516
01:57:42,079 --> 01:57:45,439
because i had some people contact me and

3517
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:48,079
be like you didn't tell it right

3518
01:57:45,439 --> 01:57:50,079
and war is subjective and war is from

3519
01:57:48,079 --> 01:57:54,319
your perspective and war is

3520
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:54,319
messy and horrific and war is

3521
01:57:54,479 --> 01:57:58,718
graphic and

3522
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:01,359
violent and

3523
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:01,359
painful

3524
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:06,158
your brain remembers what it wants to

3525
01:58:04,479 --> 01:58:08,158
remember and your brain allows you to

3526
01:58:06,158 --> 01:58:09,279
remember what it allows you to remember

3527
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:12,079
and there's reasons that you don't

3528
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:12,079
remember everything

3529
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:16,079
and so

3530
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:17,759
we were getting

3531
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:19,679
we were really getting hit we were

3532
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:21,119
getting it was bad

3533
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:23,118
and some of the guys machine gunners had

3534
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:24,238
come up to cover fire

3535
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:25,118
and i know

3536
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:27,678
uh

3537
01:58:25,118 --> 01:58:30,158
we were calling in for air support

3538
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:32,560
to come pick up the guys uh because they

3539
01:58:30,158 --> 01:58:32,559
had to go

3540
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:37,279
and we

3541
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:38,719
we just collected everything we could

3542
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:39,840
but i did remember screaming like we

3543
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:40,880
didn't get them all we didn't get them

3544
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,560
all there's no way we got them all we

3545
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:43,920
did not [ __ ] get them all and i

3546
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:45,119
remember one of the guys looking at me

3547
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,480
like we got him we got him i'm like we

3548
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:48,960
didn't [ __ ] get him we didn't get him

3549
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:50,319
like no we got him and i couldn't say it

3550
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:52,560
enough

3551
01:58:50,319 --> 01:58:56,079
and

3552
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:57,679
so i grabbed as much as i could i i

3553
01:58:56,079 --> 01:59:00,079
i slung one of their weapons and it was

3554
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:02,239
just a twisted heap and i had

3555
01:59:00,079 --> 01:59:06,238
his helmet helmet someone else's helmet

3556
01:59:02,238 --> 01:59:08,638
in my arm and then i had um

3557
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:10,399
my weapon in front of me

3558
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:13,440
and i was carrying it and then we we

3559
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:15,279
piled everything we had onto a stretcher

3560
01:59:13,439 --> 01:59:17,439
those things are super [ __ ] flimsy

3561
01:59:15,279 --> 01:59:18,960
anyway and there was a couple guys in

3562
01:59:17,439 --> 01:59:20,479
front of us and there was a couple

3563
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,920
behind me and i was kind of in the

3564
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:23,919
middle

3565
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:24,960
and we we said okay we're just gonna

3566
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:25,920
have to run we're gonna have to [ __ ]

3567
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:28,960
run the road we're gonna just have to

3568
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:31,279
run it just chance it so we ran it and

3569
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,719
that was the close well that was i guess

3570
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:34,800
not the closest but it felt like it was

3571
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:36,079
the closest i could hear the

3572
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:38,719
the whiz

3573
01:59:36,079 --> 01:59:40,559
of the rounds going by me

3574
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:41,840
it's a weird noise when they're coming

3575
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,520
at you then when you're leave they're

3576
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:44,480
leaving you

3577
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:45,440
and

3578
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:46,479
so they

3579
01:59:45,439 --> 01:59:47,839
that

3580
01:59:46,479 --> 01:59:49,359
slowed everything down for me and then

3581
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:51,199
one of the guys accidentally dropped the

3582
01:59:49,359 --> 01:59:53,598
edge of the stretcher and everything

3583
01:59:51,198 --> 01:59:56,079
fell off into the ditch and then we had

3584
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:59,199
to go back down and get it back up

3585
01:59:56,079 --> 02:00:00,238
and so we kept running and we finally

3586
01:59:59,198 --> 02:00:01,919
got back into the compound that that

3587
02:00:00,238 --> 02:00:04,959
sniper was sitting off on the right-hand

3588
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:06,560
side and we got all in there

3589
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:09,118
and i know the

3590
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:10,080
i think said there was two flights i

3591
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:12,479
only thought there was one but

3592
02:00:10,079 --> 02:00:15,118
apparently there was two flights

3593
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:17,039
so he went on one his body went on one

3594
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:18,559
and then i think i think he said went on

3595
02:00:17,039 --> 02:00:20,319
the other

3596
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:21,599
and um

3597
02:00:20,319 --> 02:00:24,319
and then they took off and then when

3598
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:25,920
they leave though they reign held down

3599
02:00:24,319 --> 02:00:28,319
on anything they can see on the ground

3600
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:29,920
and that is a beautiful sight because

3601
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:32,799
they had mortar rounds coming down and

3602
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:34,239
it just it was getting really really bad

3603
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:35,760
and then

3604
02:00:34,238 --> 02:00:38,479
as soon as the blackhawks took off all

3605
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:40,960
of a sudden it just stopped

3606
02:00:38,479 --> 02:00:42,158
and went quiet

3607
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,399
like

3608
02:00:42,158 --> 02:00:46,319
deafening quiet

3609
02:00:44,399 --> 02:00:47,198
and we were sitting inside the compound

3610
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:48,479
and i

3611
02:00:47,198 --> 02:00:50,638
one of the medics looked at me and you

3612
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:52,399
could see and i still do it now and i'm

3613
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:54,560
working on not doing it but i do it when

3614
02:00:52,399 --> 02:00:56,559
i get really overwhelmed

3615
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:58,639
because i didn't have any gloves on

3616
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:01,199
i had blood all over my hands and just

3617
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:03,039
like body and stuff so he came over and

3618
02:01:01,198 --> 02:01:05,118
he just gave me like sanitizer and i

3619
02:01:03,039 --> 02:01:07,198
started rubbing rubbing

3620
02:01:05,118 --> 02:01:09,279
and so i rub i do this when i'm stressed

3621
02:01:07,198 --> 02:01:10,799
i'll rub my hands

3622
02:01:09,279 --> 02:01:11,519
um

3623
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:13,279
and

3624
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:15,040
i still can't

3625
02:01:13,279 --> 02:01:17,599
i still can't do

3626
02:01:15,039 --> 02:01:20,158
i i still can't eat food with skin on it

3627
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:21,920

02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,480
cutting it like i never touch it i can't

3634
02:01:33,039 --> 02:01:38,079
touch it

3635
02:01:34,479 --> 02:01:40,718
so there's something almost like um

3636
02:01:38,079 --> 02:01:43,198
the texture of the biology of a human

3637
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:45,840
flesh that just

3638
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:47,598
that's at the level of that's the level

3639
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:49,920
of your trauma

3640
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:51,199
yeah and it's been i mean it's 2021 this

3641
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,639
was an 09

3642
02:01:51,198 --> 02:01:55,118
and i've worked on this like and i mean

3643
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:56,800
i i've been in like treatment

3644
02:01:55,118 --> 02:01:58,719
religiously

3645
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,039
just to be able to keep me alive for

3646
02:01:58,719 --> 02:02:03,198
this this decade and so it's not like

3647
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:05,279
it's like oh i've never you never tried

3648
02:02:03,198 --> 02:02:07,118
to get better it's like i never used to

3649
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:09,039
leave my house i used to call people

3650
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:10,158
that look like that horrific names in

3651
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:12,238
public

3652
02:02:10,158 --> 02:02:14,559
i used to want to kill people on a

3653
02:02:12,238 --> 02:02:16,158
regular basis i'm a fairly happy

3654
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:18,400
individual now

3655
02:02:16,158 --> 02:02:20,559
what about

3656
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:21,519
so you're you're talking about sort of

3657
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:22,239
skin

3658
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:23,760
and

3659
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:25,439
parts and

3660
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:26,719
but there's also just the fact that

3661
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:28,319
we're mortal

3662
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:30,319
and there's somebody

3663
02:02:28,319 --> 02:02:32,880
close to you

3664
02:02:30,319 --> 02:02:34,880
who dies do you watch walk up and then

3665
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:37,679
never come back out again yeah it's like

3666
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:40,400
you're facing mortality in a very real

3667
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:42,719
way and if and uh

3668
02:02:40,399 --> 02:02:44,559
in a way that's not the same as somebody

3669
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:45,679
dying from cancer in the hospital

3670
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:47,599
although

3671
02:02:45,679 --> 02:02:49,520
it has echoes of that because that's

3672
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:50,480
also absurd and

3673
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:52,000
like

3674
02:02:50,479 --> 02:02:55,598
it doesn't feel like there's justice to

3675
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:59,279
it in any kind of way but it's so sudden

3676
02:02:55,599 --> 02:03:01,440
like have you been able to um

3677
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:03,679
make sense of that

3678
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:06,000
of your feelings about it like how do

3679
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:09,920
you feel about it or or is everything

3680
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,960
just shrouded in this like

3681
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,440
trauma

3682
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:15,520
that you're not able to just um

3683
02:03:13,439 --> 02:03:19,198
feel for the loss of a human being like

3684
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:19,199
mourn the loss of a human being

3685
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:22,880
i think i had

3686
02:03:21,198 --> 02:03:25,439
when he when

3687
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:29,599
i realized he wasn't there

3688
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:32,000
when i realized that he um that was

3689
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:33,840
the i that was what was left of him i

3690
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:36,319
found out afterwards there was other

3691
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:39,279
parts that were outside and

3692
02:03:36,319 --> 02:03:41,198
and went back i think i think he said

3693
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:44,079
went back and they got they end up

3694
02:03:41,198 --> 02:03:45,519
getting the rest of him so that made me

3695
02:03:44,079 --> 02:03:46,800
happy because i just found this out this

3696
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,239
week

3697
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:50,960
uh

3698
02:03:48,238 --> 02:03:52,638
so that that mean so that means you have

3699
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,480
a feeling like

3700
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:57,599
you still feel like parts of them were

3701
02:03:54,479 --> 02:04:00,238
left behind yeah

3702
02:03:57,599 --> 02:04:03,760
on the ramp ceremony

3703
02:04:00,238 --> 02:04:06,078
when i lost my mind literally i

3704
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:07,760
i lost my mind

3705
02:04:06,078 --> 02:04:10,799
and i was screaming

3706
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:13,119
that he wasn't all in there i'm happy

3707
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:16,880
now knowing that he was

3708
02:04:13,118 --> 02:04:16,880
but i held on to that for ten years

3709
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:22,880
yeah this um

3710
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:25,040
yeah the sandbags like like it's

3711
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:26,480
the bulk

3712
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:29,679
of the weight

3713
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:33,198
is is not from human flesh

3714
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:34,480
yeah he was a young kid too

3715
02:04:33,198 --> 02:04:36,319
it was i think it was his first

3716
02:04:34,479 --> 02:04:37,678
deployment as well like he was

3717
02:04:36,319 --> 02:04:39,519
he was a young kid

3718
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:41,359
and

3719
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:42,960
he was just

3720
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:45,679
just going to clear the road for the

3721
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:47,679
rest of us right like not like you know

3722
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:48,880
you're in war and you know that you're

3723
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:50,639
outside the wire and you know things

3724
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:53,199
could happen

3725
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:56,319
you understand that to the extent you

3726
02:04:53,198 --> 02:04:58,319
can understand that

3727
02:04:56,319 --> 02:04:59,279
when it's happening it's something very

3728
02:04:58,319 --> 02:05:02,960
different

3729
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:05,359
also maybe you can correct me but um

3730
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:07,039
there's something much more like brutal

3731
02:05:05,359 --> 02:05:08,639
about an ied

3732
02:05:07,039 --> 02:05:10,960
it's very vicious

3733
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:13,679
versus like a bullet

3734
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:15,840
because a bullet you still like

3735
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:18,560
watching somebody close to you die from

3736
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:20,719
a bullet you still get

3737
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:23,360
the basic humanity

3738
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:25,840
like so ied basically converted a human

3739
02:05:23,359 --> 02:05:26,799
being into sort of parts by biological

3740
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:28,880
parts

3741
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:32,480
a cheese crater yeah

3742
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:32,480
versus yeah i mean i don't

3743
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:37,760
that's that's tough

3744
02:05:35,198 --> 02:05:39,598
that's tough because it's like

3745
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:41,360
um

3746
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:43,360
because it's hard for you to remember

3747
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:47,039
them as a human

3748
02:05:43,359 --> 02:05:49,039
you remember them as parts for me

3749
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:51,279
that's how i remember him i would like

3750
02:05:49,039 --> 02:05:52,719
to i've i have a picture that i post

3751
02:05:51,279 --> 02:05:55,599
every year about them

3752
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:57,599
i see that

3753
02:05:55,599 --> 02:05:59,360
but i

3754
02:05:57,599 --> 02:06:01,119
don't

3755
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:02,960
put two and two to get does that make

3756
02:06:01,118 --> 02:06:05,439
sense yeah no it does

3757
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:06,880
so i even i listening to your story and

3758
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:08,399
you know um

3759
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:09,118
thank you for sharing it first of all

3760
02:06:08,399 --> 02:06:11,439
but

3761
02:06:09,118 --> 02:06:13,118
uh it's not my it's

3762
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:15,439
well i'm just the one to tell it i was

3763
02:06:13,118 --> 02:06:17,359
just involved one one set of eyes on

3764
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:18,799
this particular

3765
02:06:17,359 --> 02:06:22,078
human being

3766
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:24,000
um but even i get angry

3767
02:06:22,078 --> 02:06:26,479
i can't tell if it's exhaustion or anger

3768
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,560
i'm sorry i look always exhausted oh

3769
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:30,479
that's okay you're you're into robotics

3770
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:32,239
isn't that like your guys's thing

3771
02:06:30,479 --> 02:06:33,198
you guys are just always working

3772
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:35,678
i think

3773
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:37,359
because i feel so much for the world i

3774
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:38,800
just don't do we were talking about

3775
02:06:37,359 --> 02:06:41,039
resting [ __ ] face

3776
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:43,520
earlier i just don't feel the need to

3777
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:45,920
maintain um all the effort of the

3778
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:48,000
musculature for presenting myself to you

3779
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:50,000
visually exhausting it's exhausting so i

3780
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,840
just focus on the feeling no hey and

3781
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:54,800
then let the face show whatever the hell

3782
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:59,760
it shows fair enough okay

3783
02:06:54,800 --> 02:07:01,760
was there anger was there hate yes

3784
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:04,480
can you just talk to your feelings of

3785
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:07,679
what you remember yeah so

3786
02:07:04,479 --> 02:07:10,718
after that operation with the british i

3787
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:13,118
went back to the canadians

3788
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:15,920
and i didn't go back as even remotely

3789
02:07:13,118 --> 02:07:17,439
close to who i was when i left

3790
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,880
and

3791
02:07:17,439 --> 02:07:20,078
that was really troublesome for a lot of

3792
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,639
people around me

3793
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:24,000
because the level of anger and hate that

3794
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:27,199
came out of me

3795
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,479
was palpable when i just walked by

3796
02:07:27,198 --> 02:07:30,879
um

3797
02:07:28,479 --> 02:07:32,879
i got shockingly quiet

3798
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:34,560
and you understand how

3799
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,480
you're learning that'd be terrified if

3800
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:38,840
you were quiet

3801
02:07:36,479 --> 02:07:40,879
and i don't know if hate and

3802
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:43,199
anger do

3803
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:44,000
that justice i don't know another word

3804
02:07:43,198 --> 02:07:46,399
but

3805
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,639
i don't think those two words do it

3806
02:07:46,399 --> 02:07:50,078
justice to the extent that i was feeling

3807
02:07:48,639 --> 02:07:51,840
like

3808
02:07:50,078 --> 02:07:53,279
i got to a point when i got attacked by

3809
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:55,279
a woman

3810
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:57,439
um with some scissors like the i the

3811
02:07:55,279 --> 02:07:59,039
idea crossed my mind like i could boot

3812
02:07:57,439 --> 02:08:00,158
stomp her to death and not feel anything

3813
02:07:59,039 --> 02:08:01,599
about it in front of her all of her

3814
02:08:00,158 --> 02:08:04,158
family and her kids

3815
02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:06,000
was it more like just not recognizing

3816
02:08:04,158 --> 02:08:10,158
the basic humanity or was it legit

3817
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:12,399
hatred no it was legit hatred but also

3818
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:15,118
i no longer saw those people as humans

3819
02:08:12,399 --> 02:08:17,439
yeah it took one event and when that

3820
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:20,880
happened the rest of the operation that

3821
02:08:17,439 --> 02:08:23,678
was echoed in my in the way i was to

3822
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:24,880
those people but to what level can you

3823
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:26,800
see

3824
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:29,279
those people as human

3825
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:32,960
so this is where well like this is where

3826
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:32,960
like jocko shut down um

3827
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:39,440
i still think i'm right

3828
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:41,920
there's a dire straight song called uh

3829
02:08:39,439 --> 02:08:44,399
brothers in arms

3830
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:46,800
and um actually

3831
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:50,479
anyway we're fools to make war on our

3832
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:53,279
brothers and arms and i brought that up

3833
02:08:50,479 --> 02:08:54,238
to jocko because it's humans on both

3834
02:08:53,279 --> 02:08:55,599
sides

3835
02:08:54,238 --> 02:08:57,118
correct

3836
02:08:55,599 --> 02:08:58,159
but he said

3837
02:08:57,118 --> 02:09:00,639
not

3838
02:08:58,158 --> 02:09:03,839
in iraq

3839
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:06,400
like to him he's like no that's the

3840
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:09,840
enemy these are people who use the

3841
02:09:06,399 --> 02:09:12,000
civilians they rape they torture they

3842
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:13,920
they'll do anything

3843
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,359
and they put evil into the world and

3844
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:18,000
then it's like

3845
02:09:15,359 --> 02:09:20,000
so there there stood on at that moment

3846
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:22,800
like the these two

3847
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,158
were humans and it's politicians waging

3848
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:27,039
war and it's

3849
02:09:24,158 --> 02:09:28,479
it's kids on both sides but then jack

3850
02:09:27,039 --> 02:09:29,840
was like

3851
02:09:28,479 --> 02:09:31,759
no

3852
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:34,800
he's not wrong so

3853
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:36,159
which can you carry both things with you

3854
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:38,079
as a soldier

3855
02:09:36,158 --> 02:09:40,238
i think when i was a soldier i could

3856
02:09:38,078 --> 02:09:42,479
only carry one thing with me

3857
02:09:40,238 --> 02:09:44,000
i think my perspective has changed

3858
02:09:42,479 --> 02:09:44,799
drastically

3859
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,599
but

3860
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:48,159
not

3861
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:49,599
because i've lost the reality that they

3862
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:50,879
are the enemy

3863
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:53,760
but i've

3864
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:55,840
i've gained my humanity back again

3865
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:58,320
and that's what i lost when i was there

3866
02:09:55,840 --> 02:10:00,960
i lost all humanity i lost all hope for

3867
02:09:58,319 --> 02:10:02,639
humanity he's not wrong

3868
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:05,198
when he says

3869
02:10:02,639 --> 02:10:06,480
the taliban or like he was in iraq but

3870
02:10:05,198 --> 02:10:08,399
for me

3871
02:10:06,479 --> 02:10:11,519
the taliban are evil

3872
02:10:08,399 --> 02:10:13,679
i still hold a spot

3873
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:16,560
of hatred for them that could set this

3874
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:17,679
building on fire you you don't

3875
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:20,320
i don't know that anybody can fully

3876
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:21,840
understand that when you watch

3877
02:10:20,319 --> 02:10:23,439
what they do to women

3878
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:26,719
and do kids

3879
02:10:23,439 --> 02:10:28,960
and they do it in the name of god

3880
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:30,239
they are the enemy they are

3881
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:32,960
less than

3882
02:10:30,238 --> 02:10:36,078
they don't exist they're barely worth

3883
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:39,760
the bullets we put into them

3884
02:10:36,078 --> 02:10:43,279
but then because they use civilians

3885
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:45,520
dicey so like then everybody

3886
02:10:43,279 --> 02:10:47,359
uh it becomes the enemy and how are you

3887
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:48,400
supposed to make sense of that like what

3888
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:49,920
um

3889
02:10:48,399 --> 02:10:52,158
but here lex you can't make sense of it

3890
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:53,599
this is why they've done a really good

3891
02:10:52,158 --> 02:10:55,198
job of blending into the civilian

3892
02:10:53,599 --> 02:10:57,520
population they've done it intentionally

3893
02:10:55,198 --> 02:10:58,479
they've done it on purpose

3894
02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:00,239
so

3895
02:10:58,479 --> 02:11:01,519
they're brilliant this is why you guys

3896
02:11:00,238 --> 02:11:03,198
couldn't beat them this is why we

3897
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:05,360
couldn't [ __ ] beat them

3898
02:11:03,198 --> 02:11:08,158
they use their people

3899
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:10,319
so effectively they have no shame in

3900
02:11:08,158 --> 02:11:11,598
that they have no issue with that they

3901
02:11:10,319 --> 02:11:13,679
take

3902
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:15,599
no qualms with wiping a kid off the face

3903
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:17,359
of the earth if it means they can get

3904
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:20,000
close enough to a soldier to throw a

3905
02:11:17,359 --> 02:11:22,399
[ __ ] bomb into their tank

3906
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:24,639
this is why they're affected how do you

3907
02:11:22,399 --> 02:11:27,679
beat them then is this there's no

3908
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:31,039
winning that you just basically do

3909
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:33,039
policeman type work or you do your best

3910
02:11:31,039 --> 02:11:35,039
i mean that's one way

3911
02:11:33,039 --> 02:11:37,760
so the other

3912
02:11:35,039 --> 02:11:39,840
is uh you come from the artillery

3913
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:42,320
background a [ __ ] hellfire missile

3914
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:44,239
yeah the whole place off the face there

3915
02:11:42,319 --> 02:11:47,359
you can't beat radicalism like that

3916
02:11:44,238 --> 02:11:49,839
right now the problem is is we've

3917
02:11:47,359 --> 02:11:52,639
we've let it go unchecked we had it

3918
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:54,960
kind of in check for 20 years we just

3919
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:56,639
shot ourselves in the foot the chest and

3920
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:58,639
the face

3921
02:11:56,639 --> 02:12:00,560
so the the problem

3922
02:11:58,639 --> 02:12:03,679
with uh force

3923
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:04,960
is it creates long-term hate

3924
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:07,199
because

3925
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:09,920
young kids in propaganda and

3926
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:12,000
like propaganda works so you you see

3927
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:14,158
your father your brother died because of

3928
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,319
a bomb

3929
02:12:14,158 --> 02:12:19,039
it's very easy to convince that person

3930
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:20,639
that they died because of evil americans

3931
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:22,238
and tell whatever story you want about

3932
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:24,560
america or canada russia that's the

3933
02:12:22,238 --> 02:12:27,039
biggest problem so it seems like there

3934
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:29,520
got to be better solutions because um i

3935
02:12:27,039 --> 02:12:31,118
mean i talk about love but

3936
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:32,800
it's it's honestly

3937
02:12:31,118 --> 02:12:35,359
basically uh

3938
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:38,159
figuring out sneaky ways of empowering

3939
02:12:35,359 --> 02:12:40,639
women of educating people of like

3940
02:12:38,158 --> 02:12:43,039
yes and like and not in a

3941
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:47,760
not a cheesy way but not realistic like

3942
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:49,920
like in the same level of like mass

3943
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:53,199
warfare but with love so you're talking

3944
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:56,000
about darpa budgets dod budgets

3945
02:12:53,198 --> 02:12:57,359
but like do that where you educate and

3946
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,439
empower women

3947
02:12:57,359 --> 02:13:01,759
by force

3948
02:12:59,439 --> 02:13:04,000
they want to learn right i mean you're

3949
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:06,079
not like forcing anybody you're setting

3950
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,719
them free that's exactly it like combat

3951
02:13:06,078 --> 02:13:11,759
flip-flops does this they do this they

3952
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:14,399
give literacy they teach girls to read

3953
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:16,719
nothing else to read because as soon as

3954
02:13:14,399 --> 02:13:18,559
you can read you know what that happened

3955
02:13:16,719 --> 02:13:20,399
you know what happens then what's combat

3956
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:23,199
flip-flops that's the scarf right there

3957
02:13:20,399 --> 02:13:24,879
that's made in afghanistan

3958
02:13:23,198 --> 02:13:27,198
so when you buy something from them the

3959
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:29,359
proceeds go to literacy in afghanistan

3960
02:13:27,198 --> 02:13:31,198
for girls they've given literacy to 800

3961
02:13:29,359 --> 02:13:33,198
girls over there

3962
02:13:31,198 --> 02:13:34,879
yeah they're really cool uh griff owns

3963
02:13:33,198 --> 02:13:36,799
the one he was army ranger and his buddy

3964
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:38,400
but lee i think is his name

3965
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:40,960
they were on shark tank a long time ago

3966
02:13:38,399 --> 02:13:43,198
but they um they do shoes and

3967
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:44,399
i think they're called schmongs chamongs

3968
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:46,719
i don't know how to say it properly

3969
02:13:44,399 --> 02:13:48,238
built in afghanistan yes and then the

3970
02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:49,359
proceeds go back there

3971
02:13:48,238 --> 02:13:52,238
they do

3972
02:13:49,359 --> 02:13:54,000
great work for literacy and you know as

3973
02:13:52,238 --> 02:13:56,799
well as anyone if you can teach someone

3974
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:59,520
to read good color

3975
02:13:56,800 --> 02:14:01,279
dark like your soul x

3976
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:04,800
matches you on the inside just on the

3977
02:14:01,279 --> 02:14:06,319
inside all right the outside is just the

3978
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:07,599
it's just the suit

3979
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:10,559
i feel like you think that's your suit

3980
02:14:07,599 --> 02:14:12,719
of armor but i feel like it's it's

3981
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:12,719
there

3982
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:20,078
all right i think there is room if you

3983
02:14:19,039 --> 02:14:22,158
teach

3984
02:14:20,078 --> 02:14:24,719
education the problem is

3985
02:14:22,158 --> 02:14:26,960
we've taken a massive step backwards

3986
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:29,760
i know that the taliban have just

3987
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:32,239
instituted uh this week honor killings

3988
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:33,520
will be back stonings are back

3989
02:14:32,238 --> 02:14:35,919
and um

3990
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:37,199
uh dismemberment as well holly mckay is

3991
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:39,118
the reporter that's been reporting that

3992
02:14:37,198 --> 02:14:42,319
from the ground she's still there

3993
02:14:39,118 --> 02:14:43,439
the way to pull people in my opinion out

3994
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:44,960
of something like that is through

3995
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:46,319
education

3996
02:14:44,960 --> 02:14:48,319
well we just took

3997
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:50,158
all of that away

3998
02:14:48,319 --> 02:14:51,439
which is pretty horrific in my opinion

3999
02:14:50,158 --> 02:14:54,158
because

4000
02:14:51,439 --> 02:14:55,839
you've taught over 20 years

4001
02:14:54,158 --> 02:14:57,598
you're perfectly right lex when you say

4002
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:59,520
that

4003
02:14:57,599 --> 02:15:00,480
hate and violence won't work it won't

4004
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,679
because

4005
02:15:00,479 --> 02:15:03,359
you see dad get killed on the

4006
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:05,118
battlefield well that 14 year old little

4007
02:15:03,359 --> 02:15:06,639
boy is going to pick up an ak-47 and go

4008
02:15:05,118 --> 02:15:08,319
avenge dad's death that's just the way

4009
02:15:06,639 --> 02:15:10,319
it's going to be well we think about it

4010
02:15:08,319 --> 02:15:11,759
you were there for 20 years there's a

4011
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:13,439
couple of generations in there there's

4012
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:16,159
another generation that's either grown

4013
02:15:13,439 --> 02:15:18,399
up in this or has seen enough of this

4014
02:15:16,158 --> 02:15:20,319
so they're always going to be a subset

4015
02:15:18,399 --> 02:15:22,799
that think that we're the enemy

4016
02:15:20,319 --> 02:15:24,078
and fair we haven't done always the

4017
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,679
greatest things

4018
02:15:24,078 --> 02:15:27,679
but the one thing that we have done that

4019
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:29,520
i did participate in was

4020
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:31,679
giving literacy giving girls an

4021
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:33,599
opportunity letting them know that you

4022
02:15:31,679 --> 02:15:38,000
aren't second-class citizens

4023
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:40,400
you can do things too and that's why

4024
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:42,800
we have to look at war differently

4025
02:15:40,399 --> 02:15:45,198
there's times for violence oh ho ho

4026
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:47,279
there is time for violence and there is

4027
02:15:45,198 --> 02:15:50,719
time for

4028
02:15:47,279 --> 02:15:52,479
missiles and there is time for detainees

4029
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:54,158
and there's times for bag and tags and

4030
02:15:52,479 --> 02:15:55,678
double taps of the [ __ ] face there's

4031
02:15:54,158 --> 02:15:58,479
times for all of that

4032
02:15:55,679 --> 02:16:00,560
but there needs to be more time

4033
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:03,118
to educate the problem is you can't

4034
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:04,719
educate if you're in a country where

4035
02:16:03,118 --> 02:16:06,880
their culture doesn't believe in that

4036
02:16:04,719 --> 02:16:08,399
you're fighting so many different

4037
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:12,400
things that you

4038
02:16:08,399 --> 02:16:13,839
it's an almost an impossible situation

4039
02:16:12,399 --> 02:16:16,479
when you look at the 20 years in

4040
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:19,279
afghanistan and we just pulled out

4041
02:16:16,479 --> 02:16:20,879
there's a sudden pull out of troops

4042
02:16:19,279 --> 02:16:22,960
what do you think about those 20 years

4043
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:25,920
uh well let me ask

4044
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:27,039
a hard question which is uh was it worth

4045
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:30,639
it

4046
02:16:27,039 --> 02:16:30,639
going into afghanistan

4047
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:37,359
and you're sort of you're one person my

4048
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:39,679
limited capacity you have experienced

4049
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:41,200
specific set of extremely difficult

4050
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:43,760
things

4051
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:45,840
you've met a lot of humans

4052
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:47,760
you understand certain aspects of the

4053
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:49,040
way this war is carried out but if you

4054
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:50,960
zoomed out

4055
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:52,880
at the big story like

4056
02:16:50,959 --> 02:16:56,398
you like history too when you think of

4057
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:59,279
the history 100 years from now we look

4058
02:16:56,398 --> 02:17:00,638
at uh the invasion of afghanistan i

4059
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:03,679
don't even think you need to go far that

4060
02:17:00,638 --> 02:17:06,079
back to know that it was

4061
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:08,558
we went in on false pretenses

4062
02:17:06,079 --> 02:17:10,159
we did we that's not that's not a good

4063
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:13,920
start

4064
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:15,920
what's that saying future behavior is um

4065
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:18,159
a good was it past behavior is a good

4066
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:19,280
indicator of future behavior right

4067
02:17:18,159 --> 02:17:21,760
so

4068
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:23,439
i struggle with that because

4069
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:24,719
when i first found out that the pull-up

4070
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:27,439
was going to happen

4071
02:17:24,718 --> 02:17:27,438
i um

4072
02:17:27,679 --> 02:17:31,439
i got really angry

4073
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:33,040
because my government skated the whole

4074
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:34,880
situation because he

4075
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:38,000
he's having a snap canada's having a

4076
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:39,598
snap election it's happening on the 20th

4077
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,079
so that was

4078
02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:44,639
beautifully planned by my government to

4079
02:17:42,079 --> 02:17:46,478
hold no accountability

4080
02:17:44,638 --> 02:17:48,879
zero accountability

4081
02:17:46,478 --> 02:17:50,000
and um the media won't talk about it

4082
02:17:48,879 --> 02:17:51,358
they reached out to me to do an

4083
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,040
interview about afghanistan and then i

4084
02:17:51,359 --> 02:17:54,239
told them what was going on after i

4085
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:55,439
talked to my people that were on the

4086
02:17:54,239 --> 02:17:56,558
ground and then they canceled the

4087
02:17:55,439 --> 02:17:58,639
interview

4088
02:17:56,558 --> 02:18:01,119
when you say my government is america

4089
02:17:58,638 --> 02:18:03,119
any better at this that like it feels

4090
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:04,880
like there's no accountability

4091
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:06,240
no no the government no the american

4092
02:18:04,879 --> 02:18:07,438
government

4093
02:18:06,239 --> 02:18:09,840
is a is

4094
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:13,200
a dumpster fire i'm not saying i'm not

4095
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:14,799
saying that but what i am saying is

4096
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:17,920
at least

4097
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:20,079
they sent people to pull people

4098
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:21,840
or pull some people

4099
02:18:20,079 --> 02:18:24,159
we sent no one

4100
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:26,239
to pull anyone

4101
02:18:24,159 --> 02:18:28,000
and i know for a fact because i helped

4102
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:29,760
move a family i was fortunate enough to

4103
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,679
be given an opportunity to help move a

4104
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:33,040
high-value nine-person family out of

4105
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:34,719
that country

4106
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:35,920
that worked in the government that

4107
02:18:34,718 --> 02:18:37,598
worked in

4108
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:40,000
prosecuting the taliban that were on the

4109
02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:41,760
top of the list i learned really quickly

4110
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,439
the ins and outs of things and i'm

4111
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:44,960
really disgusted by it i learned that

4112
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:46,800
canada had

4113
02:18:44,959 --> 02:18:49,119
the one email address that all canadian

4114
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:51,518
afghani or visa holders were supposed to

4115
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:53,679
email ottawa put two people on that

4116
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:55,679
email address

4117
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:58,159
that's confirmed

4118
02:18:55,679 --> 02:18:59,519
canada put no more than 70 people on the

4119
02:18:58,159 --> 02:19:00,638
ground for that pull out and they were

4120
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:02,239
not allowed to leave the airport and

4121
02:19:00,638 --> 02:19:03,679
they left well before the pull-out date

4122
02:19:02,239 --> 02:19:07,039
they left on the thursday before the

4123
02:19:03,679 --> 02:19:09,439
tuesday that was the 31st

4124
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:10,880
there were high value canadian visa

4125
02:19:09,439 --> 02:19:12,398
holders that are still in that country

4126
02:19:10,879 --> 02:19:16,000
that are on the top of the kill list

4127
02:19:12,398 --> 02:19:16,879
canada's not doing anything about it

4128
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,558
um

4129
02:19:16,879 --> 02:19:21,039
i'm disgusted in the way my government

4130
02:19:18,558 --> 02:19:23,279
has acted because number one

4131
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:25,040
there's an active lawsuit with veterans

4132
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:26,639
against the supreme court of canada

4133
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:29,040
right now

4134
02:19:26,638 --> 02:19:30,239
um we are leaving our vets and our

4135
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:33,280
canadians

4136
02:19:30,239 --> 02:19:34,718
stranded over there and we are leaving

4137
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:36,399
the vets that have been maimed by this

4138
02:19:34,718 --> 02:19:37,759
war in canada

4139
02:19:36,398 --> 02:19:39,039
um

4140
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:40,079
they're turned down for everything i've

4141
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:42,240
been turned down for hearing loss

4142
02:19:40,079 --> 02:19:45,359
they're saying it's not military related

4143
02:19:42,239 --> 02:19:47,199
i they have pis follow me it's this is

4144
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:49,040
normal behavior

4145
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:49,920
there's a veteran named brock who was

4146
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:52,560
told

4147
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:54,239
by trudeau in a meeting that after he

4148
02:19:52,559 --> 02:19:55,920
lost his leg he was just trying to get a

4149
02:19:54,239 --> 02:19:56,959
new a new prosthetic because it was just

4150
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:58,159
killing him

4151
02:19:56,959 --> 02:20:00,398
trudeau stood up in a meeting and said

4152
02:19:58,159 --> 02:20:02,478
you're just asking for too much

4153
02:20:00,398 --> 02:20:04,879
less than six months later he gave 10.4

4154
02:20:02,478 --> 02:20:07,358
million dollars to an afghan terrorist

4155
02:20:04,879 --> 02:20:09,039
that was in the canadian prison system

4156
02:20:07,359 --> 02:20:10,960
he won

4157
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:12,880
and got 10.4 of our million taxpayer

4158
02:20:10,959 --> 02:20:14,318
dollars so i don't know that american

4159
02:20:12,879 --> 02:20:15,199
government's any better but what i do

4160
02:20:14,318 --> 02:20:17,119
know

4161
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:19,200
is that the absolute

4162
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:21,040
[ __ ] machines of human beings that

4163
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:23,600
stepped outside of the chain of command

4164
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:25,840
to pull my family out for me

4165
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:27,200
i know they were there the british that

4166
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:30,000
stayed on the ground that i could

4167
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:32,079
contact to literally confirm my

4168
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:33,680
biometric data and passports to get that

4169
02:20:32,079 --> 02:20:35,439
family moved they weren't there that

4170
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:36,800
family would still be there

4171
02:20:35,439 --> 02:20:38,239
that three-year-old that got the [ __ ]

4172
02:20:36,799 --> 02:20:42,398
kicked out of him by the taliban that i

4173
02:20:38,239 --> 02:20:42,398
was trying to ex-fill canada left him

4174
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:48,000
what what is it about

4175
02:20:45,439 --> 02:20:50,398
politicians and governments not

4176
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,840
willing to um

4177
02:20:50,398 --> 02:20:52,959
do their job

4178
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,639
well

4179
02:20:52,959 --> 02:20:56,959
doing

4180
02:20:54,639 --> 02:20:59,039
not willing to do that was a big part of

4181
02:20:56,959 --> 02:21:01,279
the job which is like

4182
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:03,040
you send

4183
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:04,640
people to war

4184
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:07,359
these are heroes

4185
02:21:04,639 --> 02:21:08,318
and then you should spend most of the

4186
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:10,479
time

4187
02:21:08,318 --> 02:21:13,680
repaying the debts

4188
02:21:10,478 --> 02:21:15,438
to those right well what is it about why

4189
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:17,760
can't we

4190
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:19,600
because we're disposable numbers

4191
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:21,040
and we hire them out of high school when

4192
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:23,920
they're stupid enough to understand what

4193
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:26,080
they're going to get themselves into

4194
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:28,719
and then we blame it on themselves for

4195
02:21:26,079 --> 02:21:30,799
making that decision by volunteering

4196
02:21:28,719 --> 02:21:32,000
yeah but i mean that that doesn't this

4197
02:21:30,799 --> 02:21:33,920
still doesn't make sense so it's a

4198
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:36,239
cop-out i mean trudeau

4199
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:39,760
would i feel like he is a good human

4200
02:21:36,239 --> 02:21:42,000
being that wants to do good for i mean i

4201
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:44,398
tend to i want to believe that leaders

4202
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,439
want to do good by the heroes of this

4203
02:21:44,398 --> 02:21:46,799
world

4204
02:21:45,439 --> 02:21:50,318
and

4205
02:21:46,799 --> 02:21:53,279
it doesn't like i i don't understand the

4206
02:21:50,318 --> 02:21:55,119
system of delusion you have to live in

4207
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:56,640
to not understand who the heroes are

4208
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:58,960
like i refuse to believe trudeau is

4209
02:21:56,639 --> 02:22:00,959
somehow a bad person you haven't met him

4210
02:21:58,959 --> 02:22:02,478
though i don't actually i'm speaking

4211
02:22:00,959 --> 02:22:03,519
about trudeau without

4212
02:22:02,478 --> 02:22:05,679
knowing

4213
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:08,159
but i mean in general think that way

4214
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:10,398
about leaders i just think they surround

4215
02:22:08,159 --> 02:22:12,719
themselves by people who delude them who

4216
02:22:10,398 --> 02:22:15,199
like they're yes people who yes people

4217
02:22:12,719 --> 02:22:17,679
that lead them into a kind of reality

4218
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:20,560
that uh becomes detached from actual

4219
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:23,040
reality and so they they misunderstand

4220
02:22:20,559 --> 02:22:25,439
the priorities of this world they think

4221
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:27,280
maybe some kind of special interest

4222
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:28,720
they focus on that versus like the

4223
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:30,479
humans

4224
02:22:28,719 --> 02:22:32,079
if you look back was there a way we

4225
02:22:30,478 --> 02:22:35,039
could have done something

4226
02:22:32,079 --> 02:22:38,239
uh better in afghanistan assuming we do

4227
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:41,040
the invasion so is it ultimately about

4228
02:22:38,239 --> 02:22:41,920
taking care of the veterans

4229
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:42,880
um

4230
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:45,520
like

4231
02:22:42,879 --> 02:22:47,358
investing more money in the um

4232
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:48,560
education

4233
02:22:47,359 --> 02:22:50,720
of women

4234
02:22:48,559 --> 02:22:53,279
and liberating

4235
02:22:50,719 --> 02:22:54,879
people who are uh suffering injustice in

4236
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:56,720
those parts of the world like what

4237
02:22:54,879 --> 02:22:58,159
what's the better way to do it and one

4238
02:22:56,719 --> 02:23:00,719
other aspect is

4239
02:22:58,159 --> 02:23:02,639
on the u.s side paid over six trillion

4240
02:23:00,719 --> 02:23:05,119
dollars for them for the wars in the

4241
02:23:02,639 --> 02:23:06,879
middle east since 9 11. so the financial

4242
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:09,200
side as well is there something you can

4243
02:23:06,879 --> 02:23:11,519
comment on

4244
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:13,520
things we could have done better

4245
02:23:11,520 --> 02:23:15,760
that's a loaded question because you're

4246
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:17,920
talking to someone who had no hand in

4247
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:20,079
what happened other than do this and do

4248
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:22,159
that so i can go from my perspective

4249
02:23:20,079 --> 02:23:23,359
which is there was probably plenty of

4250
02:23:22,159 --> 02:23:24,318
things that we could have been doing

4251
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:25,600
better

4252
02:23:24,318 --> 02:23:27,519
um i think there was a lack of

4253
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:29,200
leadership from the get-go

4254
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:30,560
i think

4255
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:33,439
the preparation that the canadian

4256
02:23:30,559 --> 02:23:34,478
military gave me was nowhere sufficient

4257
02:23:33,439 --> 02:23:36,960
for

4258
02:23:34,478 --> 02:23:39,599
a deployment of that level

4259
02:23:36,959 --> 02:23:41,358
mind you things happened they didn't

4260
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:43,520
realize things would happen but yet they

4261
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:46,880
happen

4262
02:23:43,520 --> 02:23:49,040
with little to absolutely no cultural

4263
02:23:46,879 --> 02:23:50,239
idea was that i was walking into

4264
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:52,880
um

4265
02:23:50,239 --> 02:23:54,478
like when the man one male in the family

4266
02:23:52,879 --> 02:23:55,679
grabbed the back of my vest because my

4267
02:23:54,478 --> 02:23:56,799
hair was tucked in he thought it was a

4268
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:58,720
man going into a room with a bunch of

4269
02:23:56,799 --> 02:24:02,159
women i couldn't understand why he was

4270
02:23:58,719 --> 02:24:04,478
attacking me there was no real breakdown

4271
02:24:02,159 --> 02:24:06,239
of this is what you're going into this

4272
02:24:04,478 --> 02:24:08,478
is the culture this is why they do what

4273
02:24:06,239 --> 02:24:09,920
they do this is how they do it

4274
02:24:08,478 --> 02:24:12,159
um this is how you should handle a

4275
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:14,079
situation like that there was

4276
02:24:12,159 --> 02:24:15,520
none of that and something i speak about

4277
02:24:14,079 --> 02:24:16,799
frequently and i think it's important to

4278
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:18,319
acknowledge is

4279
02:24:16,799 --> 02:24:20,159
when you're doing any of that training

4280
02:24:18,318 --> 02:24:22,318
we are giving none of our soldiers

4281
02:24:20,159 --> 02:24:25,760
proper mental health training

4282
02:24:22,318 --> 02:24:27,359
tools in that [ __ ] toolbox or ways or

4283
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:29,840
things to look for

4284
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:32,318
on their body because we've created a

4285
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:33,840
system and a problem where

4286
02:24:32,318 --> 02:24:36,719
if you say that you're ill or that

4287
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:38,239
you're struggling with ptsd you're done

4288
02:24:36,719 --> 02:24:39,840
no one's going to say that they're going

4289
02:24:38,239 --> 02:24:41,439
to keep struggling with it and that's

4290
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:43,920
when you get loose cannons when you get

4291
02:24:41,439 --> 02:24:45,200
problems happen so you get fractures

4292
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:46,719
start to happen

4293
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:49,200
in leadership

4294
02:24:46,719 --> 02:24:52,079
and that's being seen and has been seen

4295
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:53,439
now for a while so in terms of what we

4296
02:24:52,079 --> 02:24:55,359
could have done

4297
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:57,840
say for

4298
02:24:55,359 --> 02:24:59,680
a better um

4299
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:02,960
a better way to go into the country a

4300
02:24:59,680 --> 02:25:05,359
better way to help the country

4301
02:25:02,959 --> 02:25:06,639
i can't speak to that as much as i wish

4302
02:25:05,359 --> 02:25:08,239
i could

4303
02:25:06,639 --> 02:25:11,680
because i don't know that i would have

4304
02:25:08,239 --> 02:25:13,840
all the answers um what about withdrawal

4305
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:15,520
oh my god

4306
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:17,760
that's a cult

4307
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:19,680
do you think grab more gradual well you

4308
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:20,880
think it's you think it's better to

4309
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,840
maintain

4310
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:24,879
presence there for

4311
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:25,840
indefinitely like i don't know about

4312
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:27,679
that

4313
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:30,159
but i do know

4314
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:32,318
we have bases we i say weeks i serve

4315
02:25:30,159 --> 02:25:34,559
with them americans have bases in japan

4316
02:25:32,318 --> 02:25:36,639
americans have bases in korea americans

4317
02:25:34,559 --> 02:25:39,840
have bases in germany there's reasons

4318
02:25:36,639 --> 02:25:41,519
there's bases everywhere there's a smart

4319
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:43,760
there there's an intellectual way to

4320
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:46,079
look at this you want to be able to have

4321
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:48,000
eyes and ears you can't have eyes and

4322
02:25:46,079 --> 02:25:48,959
ears when you do things like you just

4323
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,398
did

4324
02:25:48,959 --> 02:25:52,879
the way that we pulled out of that

4325
02:25:50,398 --> 02:25:54,079
country that's right the way that i hate

4326
02:25:52,879 --> 02:25:55,679
saying american british because it puts

4327
02:25:54,079 --> 02:25:57,039
like a blame on them i say we because

4328
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:58,800
i'm a soldier i

4329
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:01,520
i'm a nato soldier

4330
02:25:58,799 --> 02:26:02,719
the way we pulled out of that country

4331
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:03,600
my five-year-old could have done it

4332
02:26:02,719 --> 02:26:05,840
better

4333
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:08,640
he could have said mommy why are we not

4334
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:10,799
keeping that bagram base mommy why are

4335
02:26:08,639 --> 02:26:12,719
we not keeping that base just until we

4336
02:26:10,799 --> 02:26:14,478
get everyone else that we need why are

4337
02:26:12,719 --> 02:26:16,239
we going to a civilian airport that we

4338
02:26:14,478 --> 02:26:17,679
don't control that we don't understand

4339
02:26:16,239 --> 02:26:20,559
mommy why are we doing this when there's

4340
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:21,920
only one road to it

4341
02:26:20,559 --> 02:26:24,478
my five-year-old would have that

4342
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:27,040
conversation with me

4343
02:26:24,478 --> 02:26:29,920
it was so poorly done

4344
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:31,120
it was so poorly executed and no fault

4345
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:34,318
of the soldiers on the ground on their

4346
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:36,319
own my god i can tell you there's

4347
02:26:34,318 --> 02:26:38,159
operators i just call him a i don't say

4348
02:26:36,318 --> 02:26:39,840
who he is because he's told me not to

4349
02:26:38,159 --> 02:26:42,079
there's a guy named a and there's

4350
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:43,439
another guy named r and there's a few

4351
02:26:42,079 --> 02:26:46,398
other named d

4352
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:46,398
and these guys

4353
02:26:47,359 --> 02:26:51,359
they gave

4354
02:26:48,398 --> 02:26:54,318
everything to try to pull my family when

4355
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:55,520
no one else would pull my family for me

4356
02:26:54,318 --> 02:26:56,398
they just got me on the phone and said i

4357
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:57,520

02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:13,359
and when they call you and say we can't

4366
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:15,840
go back to the gate my three-year-old

4367
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:17,600
just got beat up by the taliban and they

4368
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:20,318
say what do we do now

4369
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:23,120
i'm in vancouver

4370
02:27:20,318 --> 02:27:25,600
why am i being left to deal with this

4371
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:27,600
why is the civilian and ex-military

4372
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:29,920
population being left to deal with this

4373
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:31,760
why was this not thought out we knew

4374
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:34,159
this was coming

4375
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:36,559
we knew the time frame

4376
02:27:34,159 --> 02:27:38,000
yeah i ultimately blame it it almost

4377
02:27:36,559 --> 02:27:39,680
starts at the top oh is it the

4378
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,959
leadership sorry this is the civilian

4379
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:43,760
leadership

4380
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:46,398
uh i don't i think probably the generals

4381
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:47,920
know the right thing to do here um even

4382
02:27:46,398 --> 02:27:50,879
if they're sometimes overzealous in

4383
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:52,639
terms of being wanting to increase

4384
02:27:50,879 --> 02:27:54,639
i think the great generals understand

4385
02:27:52,639 --> 02:27:56,079
what's needed and then it takes great

4386
02:27:54,639 --> 02:27:58,879
leadership on the civilian side to

4387
02:27:56,079 --> 02:28:01,520
listen to the generals and understand

4388
02:27:58,879 --> 02:28:03,679
that war is not just about like it's not

4389
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:06,159
binary yeah and it's not about the

4390
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:08,639
invasion and saying mission accomplished

4391
02:28:06,159 --> 02:28:09,840
you know like it's it's not about the pr

4392
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:11,760
it's about

4393
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:14,318
um like the full complexity of

4394
02:28:11,760 --> 02:28:16,159
geopolitics can i ask you this can ask

4395
02:28:14,318 --> 02:28:17,600

02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:00,960
about each saying

4418
02:28:58,559 --> 02:29:03,279

show some [ __ ] passion

4423
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:15,359
finish the [ __ ] job that's right so

4424
02:29:12,079 --> 02:29:17,840
we should send that to biden so i um she

4425
02:29:15,359 --> 02:29:19,920
said that i didn't say it lex said it

4426
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:21,120
i didn't say it lex said it

4427
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:22,799
i'll say it i should also send it to

4428
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:24,000
trudeau as well so but i mean he

4429
02:29:22,799 --> 02:29:26,639
probably won't know how to read it he

4430
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,359
just taught drama instead so i'll send

4431
02:29:26,639 --> 02:29:30,879
it to the previous four presidents how

4432
02:29:29,359 --> 02:29:32,399
about that that's fine we can also send

4433
02:29:30,879 --> 02:29:34,318
it to them too because they're all just

4434
02:29:32,398 --> 02:29:36,159
as much at fault so and they most of

4435
02:29:34,318 --> 02:29:38,398
them have all the same last names but

4436
02:29:36,159 --> 02:29:38,398

4465
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:38,000
and i just think they're brilliant so i

4466
02:30:36,318 --> 02:30:40,079
got on the phone with them

4467
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,760
and i said hi i would like you to

4468
02:30:40,079 --> 02:30:44,079

02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:45,280
and they said cool what's your podcast

4470
02:30:44,079 --> 02:30:47,840
and i was like it's called brass

4471
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:49,760
immunity uh podcast and i want to work

4472
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:52,318
with you guys somewhere and they're like

4473
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:55,120
okay so like what are you thinking and i

4474
02:30:52,318 --> 02:30:56,639
said you know i'm i'm looking to do

4475
02:30:55,120 --> 02:30:57,760
i would love one day to do something

4476
02:30:56,639 --> 02:31:00,239
with you i don't know what it would be

4477
02:30:57,760 --> 02:31:02,079
but i would like it to be something and

4478
02:31:00,239 --> 02:31:03,600
they said you know we do like we have

4479
02:31:02,079 --> 02:31:05,120
this book but we also have like shirts

4480
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:07,359
and mugs with our sayings on them and

4481
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:09,920
prints and so i was thinking to myself i

4482
02:31:07,359 --> 02:31:11,920
was like well if i just did like a mug

4483
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:14,478
with them well then i could you know

4484
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:16,079
that could work for what my company does

4485
02:31:14,478 --> 02:31:17,920
which is it's a jewelry company and

4486
02:31:16,079 --> 02:31:20,239
sunglass company but it could be like an

4487
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:22,079
add-on kind of deal mm-hmm these guests

4488
02:31:20,239 --> 02:31:24,000
are really good designers

4489
02:31:22,079 --> 02:31:25,280
yeah i i knew you would like us why

4490
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,959
products i'm like certain people would

4491
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:29,359
appreciate this

4492
02:31:26,959 --> 02:31:32,159
and so my whole thing

4493
02:31:29,359 --> 02:31:33,520
my my like hashtag is work hard

4494
02:31:32,159 --> 02:31:35,280
help harder

4495
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:36,720
and that's the whole concept of what i

4496
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:38,800
do now and so we did a mug and it's

4497
02:31:36,719 --> 02:31:41,119
called [ __ ] help somebody that's

4498
02:31:38,799 --> 02:31:42,879
their like first tag and then the rest

4499
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:44,640
is

4500
02:31:42,879 --> 02:31:47,199
kindness is a wealth that increases at

4501
02:31:44,639 --> 02:31:48,799
it is given as it is given away

4502
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:50,880
what you get in return isn't passed

4503
02:31:48,799 --> 02:31:52,719
between hands but felt between hearts

4504
02:31:50,879 --> 02:31:53,839
it's precisely because you've been at

4505
02:31:52,719 --> 02:31:55,438
the bottom

4506
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:56,478
that you can raise others up it's

4507
02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:58,720
because

4508
02:31:56,478 --> 02:32:00,398
you've so i'm reading a photo here

4509
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:02,719
you've been lost in the dark you can

4510
02:32:00,398 --> 02:32:04,959
lead others to the light it's because

4511
02:32:02,719 --> 02:32:07,679
you fought with yourself that you can

4512
02:32:04,959 --> 02:32:09,438
bring peace to someone else

4513
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:12,159
you now have the strength because you've

4514
02:32:09,439 --> 02:32:14,318
once struggled the best you have

4515
02:32:12,159 --> 02:32:16,719
to come the best you have to come from

4516
02:32:14,318 --> 02:32:18,879
the [ __ ] worst you've had to take

4517
02:32:16,719 --> 02:32:20,239
so it's this is the mug there

4518
02:32:18,879 --> 02:32:22,159
and we're sold out of them we just got

4519
02:32:20,239 --> 02:32:24,959
it what does it say [ __ ] help [ __ ]

4520
02:32:22,159 --> 02:32:26,079
help somebody [ __ ] help somebody and

4521
02:32:24,959 --> 02:32:28,478
so

4522
02:32:26,079 --> 02:32:29,760
we did they were so gracious enough to

4523
02:32:28,478 --> 02:32:31,760
sit with me and be like what do you want

4524
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:33,120
the copy to be like and i said

4525
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:34,318
what do you think i want it to be like

4526
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,760
what would you if you could write one

4527
02:32:34,318 --> 02:32:37,359
for me would it be and they're like it's

4528
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:39,280
gonna be around lifting people up and i

4529
02:32:37,359 --> 02:32:40,559
was like okay cool and they're like do

4530
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:43,120
you want [ __ ] in the title and i was

4531
02:32:40,559 --> 02:32:44,639
like every other word if we can have it

4532
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:46,960
and they said we'll just do once and i

4533
02:32:44,639 --> 02:32:49,279
was like okay compromise and so we came

4534
02:32:46,959 --> 02:32:50,239
up with that copy and we put it on a mug

4535
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:53,760
and we're gonna be doing a shirt with

4536
02:32:50,239 --> 02:32:56,000
them but the the whole thing to me was

4537
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:58,398
that that embodied

4538
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:59,840
what i stand for now and the healing

4539
02:32:58,398 --> 02:33:01,760
i've gotten to now and the point i've

4540
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:03,439
gotten to now in my life

4541
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:06,639
because

4542
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:08,159
that [ __ ] sand pit almost broke me

4543
02:33:06,639 --> 02:33:10,719
like

4544
02:33:08,159 --> 02:33:12,719
off the face of the earth broke me

4545
02:33:10,719 --> 02:33:14,559
first of all can we go through the full

4546
02:33:12,719 --> 02:33:17,199
journey of that in terms of your

4547
02:33:14,559 --> 02:33:18,478
psychological development

4548
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:19,520
who were you

4549
02:33:18,478 --> 02:33:22,000
before

4550
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:24,560
who were you after can you think about

4551
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:26,639
that like what was your

4552
02:33:24,559 --> 02:33:28,719
yeah if you had to put a brain on the

4553
02:33:26,639 --> 02:33:32,000
table before and after and try to

4554
02:33:28,719 --> 02:33:34,318
analyze it well they both have cte so

4555
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:36,079
we know that they're both bruised and

4556
02:33:34,318 --> 02:33:38,398
gray matter is a little dicey on them

4557
02:33:36,079 --> 02:33:40,398
yeah um

4558
02:33:38,398 --> 02:33:42,318
and it may sound the same and it's it's

4559
02:33:40,398 --> 02:33:44,318
not so i'll try to explain it to you

4560
02:33:42,318 --> 02:33:45,600
before that

4561
02:33:44,318 --> 02:33:47,199
don't you laugh because i can i know

4562
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:48,960
it's coming

4563
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:51,840
i i was

4564
02:33:48,959 --> 02:33:53,119
even louder even more obnoxious even

4565
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:53,840
more outgoing i know it's hard to

4566
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:56,880
believe

4567
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:59,600
this is you humble and quiet right now

4568
02:33:56,879 --> 02:34:01,759
this is this is like this is you like

4569
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:03,920
this is normal me now this is who i am

4570
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:06,159
now and i love that but who i was before

4571
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:06,159
was

4572
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:10,800
you know

4573
02:34:08,799 --> 02:34:14,959
motocross taekwondo

4574
02:34:10,799 --> 02:34:16,239
tomboy uh i didn't know how to dress i

4575
02:34:14,959 --> 02:34:17,679
thought that if you just wore like the

4576
02:34:16,239 --> 02:34:19,520
same jeans and t-shirt all the time that

4577
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:22,318
was like acceptable behavior as a woman

4578
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:24,399
yeah um i wore skate shoes i went to a

4579
02:34:22,318 --> 02:34:26,959
catholic school that i refused to wear a

4580
02:34:24,398 --> 02:34:29,039
skirt at i wore pants i played hacky

4581
02:34:26,959 --> 02:34:31,119
sack i

4582
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:32,880
was so into sports i cut and split wood

4583
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:34,240
with my dad on weekends we heated our

4584
02:34:32,879 --> 02:34:37,039
house that way

4585
02:34:34,239 --> 02:34:38,719
um i would go in the transport i

4586
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:41,680
i stayed out of trouble for the most

4587
02:34:38,719 --> 02:34:41,679
part but

4588
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:44,719
i think i was a fairly good kid i was

4589
02:34:43,359 --> 02:34:47,200
pretty angry though for most of my

4590
02:34:44,719 --> 02:34:48,959
teenage life after my coach i lost my

4591
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:51,359
way a little bit there

4592
02:34:48,959 --> 02:34:54,318
um i was just

4593
02:34:51,359 --> 02:34:55,520
crazier but happy

4594
02:34:54,318 --> 02:34:58,639
i don't know if i was happy i'm

4595
02:34:55,520 --> 02:35:00,640
realizing that now i think i was

4596
02:34:58,639 --> 02:35:02,239
i think anger overtook who i was and i

4597
02:35:00,639 --> 02:35:03,599
think that's why i was such an angry

4598
02:35:02,239 --> 02:35:05,920
individual towards my parents when i was

4599
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:08,079
in high school so parents

4600
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:10,159
was a little rough relationship with

4601
02:35:08,079 --> 02:35:12,398
parents i mean yeah i mean my dad was

4602
02:35:10,159 --> 02:35:13,680
gone a couple a couple weeks at a time

4603
02:35:12,398 --> 02:35:15,279
so my mom

4604
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:16,639
stayed home mom had to handle me and my

4605
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:19,120
brother who were both competitive

4606
02:35:16,639 --> 02:35:21,039
athletes at the time by herself

4607
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:22,240
and when you come home and you have a

4608
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:24,319
daughter that just calls you like a

4609
02:35:22,239 --> 02:35:26,079
[ __ ] to your face because she can't

4610
02:35:24,318 --> 02:35:28,639
she's being bullied so bad that she

4611
02:35:26,079 --> 02:35:30,799
can't understand why

4612
02:35:28,639 --> 02:35:32,959
but also doesn't know how to fix it

4613
02:35:30,799 --> 02:35:34,879
but has no other outlet anymore to kind

4614
02:35:32,959 --> 02:35:36,799
of get rid of it

4615
02:35:34,879 --> 02:35:38,879
i was not nice i was a really mean

4616
02:35:36,799 --> 02:35:40,478
person i broke my mom i remember the day

4617
02:35:38,879 --> 02:35:42,478
she stopped yelling that's the day i

4618
02:35:40,478 --> 02:35:44,639
know i broke her i broke her did you

4619
02:35:42,478 --> 02:35:45,438
have a source of discipline in your life

4620
02:35:44,639 --> 02:35:47,760
like

4621
02:35:45,439 --> 02:35:50,960
what like maybe like where your dad

4622
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:52,880
somebody who says you're being a [ __ ]

4623
02:35:50,959 --> 02:35:54,478
like who would call me like yeah yeah oh

4624
02:35:52,879 --> 02:35:56,239
no no no my parents were incredible like

4625
02:35:54,478 --> 02:35:58,478
my dad came from like a family of like a

4626
02:35:56,239 --> 02:36:00,879
bajillion kids who lived in a farm with

4627
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:03,438
no running water with like super

4628
02:36:00,879 --> 02:36:04,719
my dad was brash and abrupt

4629
02:36:03,439 --> 02:36:06,800
so like i've caught myself doing that

4630
02:36:04,719 --> 02:36:09,279
once in a while so like if i did one

4631
02:36:06,799 --> 02:36:11,279
thing wrong if he was just in a mood

4632
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:13,920
i would know it

4633
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:15,920
so we you weren't okay so that that

4634
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:17,439
anger just took different forms it took

4635
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:19,520
different forms but it mostly would be

4636
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:21,920
directed at my mom got it because i know

4637
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:24,079
she would take it right and that was who

4638
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:25,520
i had and i i feel bad about it to the

4639
02:36:24,079 --> 02:36:27,359
day like i still

4640
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:28,800
she listened to the jocko podcast and so

4641
02:36:27,359 --> 02:36:30,159
did my dad and my mom promised me she

4642
02:36:28,799 --> 02:36:31,519
would never read my book because there's

4643
02:36:30,159 --> 02:36:33,119
certain parts i just

4644
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:35,040
my dad on my deployment when i called

4645
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:37,040
him and told him some of the stuff he

4646
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:38,560
started crying my dad doesn't cry and he

4647
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:40,240
just said please never tell your mother

4648
02:36:38,559 --> 02:36:42,318
this

4649
02:36:40,239 --> 02:36:44,318
don't do that to your mom my mom like my

4650
02:36:42,318 --> 02:36:45,840
grandfather came from hungary

4651
02:36:44,318 --> 02:36:49,199
he escaped when the not um when the

4652
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:52,000
nazis left when the soviets came in

4653
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:54,640
he wasn't great

4654
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,000
as a dad my mom went through a lot as a

4655
02:36:54,639 --> 02:36:57,039
kid

4656
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:59,600
and

4657
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:01,359
that was because her dad was in the war

4658
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:02,559
that was because her dad didn't know any

4659
02:37:01,359 --> 02:37:04,559
better

4660
02:37:02,559 --> 02:37:06,398
and

4661
02:37:04,559 --> 02:37:08,959
she knew she couldn't be like that so

4662
02:37:06,398 --> 02:37:10,079
her way would yet be yelling

4663
02:37:08,959 --> 02:37:12,000
um

4664
02:37:10,079 --> 02:37:14,318
and then i hit about 16

4665
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:16,398
and i wore her down i broke her

4666
02:37:14,318 --> 02:37:18,159
i shattered her ability to think that

4667
02:37:16,398 --> 02:37:20,000
she could

4668
02:37:18,159 --> 02:37:21,039
have any sort of relationship with me

4669
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,639
you wouldn't want to have had a

4670
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:24,880
relationship with me

4671
02:37:22,639 --> 02:37:27,920
but the the the funny thing is you've

4672
02:37:24,879 --> 02:37:30,799
rediscovered that now so she is she are

4673
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:33,200
you guys close now yeah she's she's so

4674
02:37:30,799 --> 02:37:35,199
funny she's coming out to help out again

4675
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:36,720
she comes out to help out um with jack

4676
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:37,840
all the time and

4677
02:37:36,719 --> 02:37:39,358
um

4678
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:40,639
my dad they're still they're still truck

team drive they have their little dogs

4681
02:37:42,239 --> 02:37:47,439
and they go and they do their thing and

4682
02:37:44,959 --> 02:37:49,519
i've had that relationship now it's it's

4683
02:37:47,439 --> 02:37:50,800
it's still strenuous like i still when

4684
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:52,640
i'm having a hard time she'll be the

4685
02:37:50,799 --> 02:37:54,239
person i'll take it out on because i

4686
02:37:52,639 --> 02:37:56,239
know she can take it even though i know

4687
02:37:54,239 --> 02:37:58,478
i shouldn't it's like she's my safe

4688
02:37:56,239 --> 02:38:01,039
space to be like

4689
02:37:58,478 --> 02:38:02,079
blah about everything and she'll just be

4690
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:04,160
like well that's not nice i'm like well

4691
02:38:02,079 --> 02:38:05,920
you're not [ __ ] it like i and i'll take

4692
02:38:04,159 --> 02:38:07,200
it out on she knows i don't mean it and

4693
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:08,398
i try

4694
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:10,319
um

4695
02:38:08,398 --> 02:38:12,959
but for whatever reason she just

4696
02:38:10,318 --> 02:38:15,600
she takes it and um and it brings it out

4697
02:38:12,959 --> 02:38:18,079
of you yeah can you describe sort of the

4698
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:21,040
various characteristics the the shape of

4699
02:38:18,079 --> 02:38:24,398
your ptsd the the trauma the how the

4700
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:27,359
anger and hate took shape in you in the

4701
02:38:24,398 --> 02:38:29,199
in the seconds minutes hours months

4702
02:38:27,359 --> 02:38:30,399
years after

4703
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:32,159
and after

4704
02:38:30,398 --> 02:38:34,799
the full trauma of all the things you've

4705
02:38:32,159 --> 02:38:36,318
experienced in afghanistan so it's funny

4706
02:38:34,799 --> 02:38:37,759
because draco asked me something and it

4707
02:38:36,318 --> 02:38:40,559
made me it's made me i've really been

4708
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:42,478
thinking a lot about it and he's like

4709
02:38:40,559 --> 02:38:44,959
do you think if somebody of a leadership

4710
02:38:42,478 --> 02:38:46,639
would have just sat you down

4711
02:38:44,959 --> 02:38:48,239
and said

4712
02:38:46,639 --> 02:38:50,159
hey burns

4713
02:38:48,239 --> 02:38:52,000
what you're feeling is okay

4714
02:38:50,159 --> 02:38:53,439
what you're feeling is normal what

4715
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,719
you're feeling is

4716
02:38:53,439 --> 02:38:56,720
what happens

4717
02:38:54,719 --> 02:38:58,559
when you're in something like this do

4718
02:38:56,719 --> 02:38:59,920
you think you would be where you are

4719
02:38:58,559 --> 02:39:01,600
and they said well

4720
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:03,280
i thought about it and i'm like you know

4721
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:04,559
i don't think i would be because i

4722
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:05,520
wouldn't have been medicated out of my

4723
02:39:04,559 --> 02:39:07,760
mind

4724
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:09,760
i wasn't able to process anything

4725
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:11,520
because i was just given medication

4726
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:13,200
right from the get so for me what

4727
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:14,399
happened was once that light switch was

4728
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:16,960
off

4729
02:39:14,398 --> 02:39:19,439
um i was sent back to kandahar

4730
02:39:16,959 --> 02:39:20,639
to well i once the operation was over we

4731
02:39:19,439 --> 02:39:22,159
flew back to kandahar like with the

4732
02:39:20,639 --> 02:39:24,398
brits

4733
02:39:22,159 --> 02:39:26,478
and then because there was deaths and we

4734
02:39:24,398 --> 02:39:28,398
lost people on that operation i had to

4735
02:39:26,478 --> 02:39:30,879
go to the british side for the next i

4736
02:39:28,398 --> 02:39:32,879
think three or four days and recant

4737
02:39:30,879 --> 02:39:34,879
word for word why

4738
02:39:32,879 --> 02:39:36,879
what happened to a british mp who hand

4739
02:39:34,879 --> 02:39:38,159
wrote statements but we had to do that

4740
02:39:36,879 --> 02:39:40,318
on repeat to make sure we all had the

4741
02:39:38,159 --> 02:39:42,159
same story and so nobody shot anybody in

4742
02:39:40,318 --> 02:39:44,079
the back

4743
02:39:42,159 --> 02:39:45,119
and so that i don't think is a great way

4744
02:39:44,079 --> 02:39:47,439
to

4745
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:49,760
do that after and after action after

4746
02:39:47,439 --> 02:39:52,000
action reports happen but i don't think

4747
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:54,000
beating a dead horse and having somebody

4748
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:55,680
repeat repeat repeat and then just

4749
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:57,040
imprint more and more and more i don't i

4750
02:39:55,680 --> 02:39:58,398
don't know that that is a great way of

4751
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:01,120
doing that

4752
02:39:58,398 --> 02:40:02,559
um and especially from a perspective of

4753
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:04,319
what are they uh

4754
02:40:02,559 --> 02:40:06,079
liability almost like

4755
02:40:04,318 --> 02:40:06,799
that kind of that perspective as opposed

4756
02:40:06,079 --> 02:40:08,000
to

4757
02:40:06,799 --> 02:40:10,398
the full

4758
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:11,520
perspective i mean so for for people who

4759
02:40:10,398 --> 02:40:15,358
don't know

4760
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:18,000
uh one is the the over medication

4761
02:40:15,359 --> 02:40:19,680
and that you had to undergo

4762
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,959
and then the other is the social

4763
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:23,040
isolation

4764
02:40:20,959 --> 02:40:24,719
in terms of yeah i mean

4765
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:26,880
more than what jaco

4766
02:40:24,719 --> 02:40:29,519
what you just mentioned

4767
02:40:26,879 --> 02:40:31,358
you also kind of uh mentioned that just

4768
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:33,200
being with um

4769
02:40:31,359 --> 02:40:36,159
with other soldiers you're close with

4770
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:38,159
just sitting there in silence and

4771
02:40:36,159 --> 02:40:41,359
um just sitting in that shared

4772
02:40:38,159 --> 02:40:44,159
understanding even that

4773
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:45,680
in itself communicates like

4774
02:40:44,159 --> 02:40:48,239
these feelings are normal like you don't

4775
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:50,318
have to talk

4776
02:40:48,239 --> 02:40:51,680
and you were robbed of that as well

4777
02:40:50,318 --> 02:40:53,119
essentially

4778
02:40:51,680 --> 02:40:55,120
yeah because i was because i was

4779
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:56,960
borrowed i think jacob had a name for us

4780
02:40:55,120 --> 02:40:58,560
when we get borrowed it was like there

4781
02:40:56,959 --> 02:40:59,839
was like a i don't know what they call

4782
02:40:58,559 --> 02:41:00,959
us but it's like when you take a person

4783
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:02,159
and you put them in another unit there's

4784
02:41:00,959 --> 02:41:02,959
a name for it i don't remember what it

4785
02:41:02,159 --> 02:41:05,279
was

4786
02:41:02,959 --> 02:41:07,358
you never see those people again but

4787
02:41:05,279 --> 02:41:10,000
because i was in kandahar the doctors

4788
02:41:07,359 --> 02:41:11,520
gave me the medication because i i think

4789
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,120
i was the one who said i don't this

4790
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:15,840
isn't right i don't feel right this is

4791
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:16,880
wrong because when i got back that night

4792
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:18,079
there was supposed to be somebody there

4793
02:41:16,879 --> 02:41:20,000
to pick me up to take me the other side

4794
02:41:18,079 --> 02:41:22,959
of the base and no one showed

4795
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:24,239
so i humped on my kit back to the

4796
02:41:22,959 --> 02:41:26,318
canada house and i remember getting in

4797
02:41:24,239 --> 02:41:28,159
the shower

4798
02:41:26,318 --> 02:41:32,478
and the rule was

4799
02:41:28,159 --> 02:41:34,079
quick [ __ ] showers there's no water

4800
02:41:32,478 --> 02:41:37,760
i must have sat on that floor of that

4801
02:41:34,079 --> 02:41:40,079
shower for half an hour 45 minutes

4802
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:41,359
i just held myself and cried

4803
02:41:40,079 --> 02:41:43,359
i didn't even know why i was crying i

4804
02:41:41,359 --> 02:41:47,120
just knew i needed to cry

4805
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:47,120
and i still this day i

4806
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:51,200
and

4807
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:53,359
when they sent me back to the fall they

4808
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:56,000
sent me back with all this medication

4809
02:41:53,359 --> 02:41:57,520
after spending that time with the brits

4810
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:59,439
um

4811
02:41:57,520 --> 02:42:01,359
and they put me back on the guns

4812
02:41:59,439 --> 02:42:03,279
medicated out of my [ __ ] tree i

4813
02:42:01,359 --> 02:42:04,800
almost shot someone

4814
02:42:03,279 --> 02:42:06,800
but they didn't tell my staff that it

4815
02:42:04,799 --> 02:42:08,879
was on meds

4816
02:42:06,799 --> 02:42:10,318
so when the artillery gun was going off

4817
02:42:08,879 --> 02:42:12,478
and i didn't run to the gun and i was

4818
02:42:10,318 --> 02:42:14,639
still asleep inside the tent with the

4819
02:42:12,478 --> 02:42:16,879
gun beside my head

4820
02:42:14,639 --> 02:42:18,639
they didn't know i was just drugged they

4821
02:42:16,879 --> 02:42:20,079
just thought i was [ __ ] off somewhere

4822
02:42:18,639 --> 02:42:22,079
hanging out with some americans they

4823
02:42:20,079 --> 02:42:23,760
just thought i wasn't doing any of what

4824
02:42:22,079 --> 02:42:25,439
i should be doing

4825
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:28,079
and then i remember the moment my

4826
02:42:25,439 --> 02:42:29,279
sergeant we did a night shoot and he

4827
02:42:28,079 --> 02:42:31,760
he's so funny because he called me goes

4828
02:42:29,279 --> 02:42:34,239
ah [ __ ] burn zach go alist i remember

4829
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:36,559
this yes you were standing there with me

4830
02:42:34,239 --> 02:42:37,680
and i look at you and go hey barnes are

4831
02:42:36,559 --> 02:42:41,840
you okay

4832
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:41,840
cause your eyes are all [ __ ]

4833
02:42:42,079 --> 02:42:46,559
and i i looked at sergeant leblanc i

4834
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:48,799
just remember going yeah like i'm good

4835
02:42:46,559 --> 02:42:49,760
like just huh

4836
02:42:48,799 --> 02:42:51,119
yeah

4837
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:53,359
he's like i still remember that and i'm

4838
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:55,840
like i know because they never tell me

4839
02:42:53,359 --> 02:42:57,520
anything [ __ ] burns i did not know the

4840
02:42:55,840 --> 02:42:58,960
drugs you were on

4841
02:42:57,520 --> 02:43:01,040
and as i was on all of them he goes i

4842
02:42:58,959 --> 02:43:03,199
know i walk in you show me the bottles

4843
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:05,120
that [ __ ] burns you shouldn't have been

4844
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:06,840
there

4845
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:09,760
i guarantee you sounds just like

4846
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:12,799
that that's great he's brilliant he's

4847
02:43:09,760 --> 02:43:15,120
brilliant yeah so uh what i mean i

4848
02:43:12,799 --> 02:43:16,398
suppose this is a

4849
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:19,279
lazy

4850
02:43:16,398 --> 02:43:21,599
way of dealing with trauma yeah and it's

4851
02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:23,520
for the military in some sense if you

4852
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:24,640
don't have a good program in place this

4853
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:26,000
makes sense

4854
02:43:24,639 --> 02:43:28,398
but you should have a good program in

4855
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:30,079
place just like you said on the prep on

4856
02:43:28,398 --> 02:43:32,959
the mental prep side

4857
02:43:30,079 --> 02:43:34,639
like just any prep like training people

4858
02:43:32,959 --> 02:43:36,398
training people on the

4859
02:43:34,639 --> 02:43:38,559
as opposed to

4860
02:43:36,398 --> 02:43:40,159
i guess train the fact that you're going

4861
02:43:38,559 --> 02:43:42,959
to have

4862
02:43:40,159 --> 02:43:44,799
somebody close to you blow up

4863
02:43:42,959 --> 02:43:46,478
like you have to probably visualize that

4864
02:43:44,799 --> 02:43:48,478
you have to think to that you have to

4865
02:43:46,478 --> 02:43:50,559
have a process of how to deal with

4866
02:43:48,478 --> 02:43:54,000
something like that with that kind of

4867
02:43:50,559 --> 02:43:54,000
trauma and then that's it

4868
02:43:54,079 --> 02:43:59,520
exactly i mean and it's not like

4869
02:43:56,398 --> 02:44:00,398
weakness it's actually strength it's uh

4870
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:02,319
like

4871
02:44:00,398 --> 02:44:03,680
you have to be mentally strong enough to

4872
02:44:02,318 --> 02:44:05,680
process that

4873
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:07,840
that probably takes

4874
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:10,960
a lot of training but it's a great

4875
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:13,680
training right well worth it to to

4876
02:44:10,959 --> 02:44:16,239
protect your investment training right

4877
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:18,479
that's a very cold but correct way to

4878
02:44:16,239 --> 02:44:20,559
put it i mean it's called i thought you

4879
02:44:18,478 --> 02:44:24,079
would appreciate the coldness of the way

4880
02:44:20,559 --> 02:44:28,079
i articulated that well yeah i mean i'm

4881
02:44:24,079 --> 02:44:28,079
of two minds in this i i don't

4882
02:44:28,559 --> 02:44:32,000
i sometimes wonder

4883
02:44:30,239 --> 02:44:33,840
like what i would be like as a soldier

4884
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:35,840
actually i don't know because i love

4885
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:38,079
country and i love all the things you're

4886
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:40,239
mentioning like i could see myself

4887
02:44:38,079 --> 02:44:42,879
probably dying from my country

4888
02:44:40,239 --> 02:44:46,398
and also enjoying the skill of it the

4889
02:44:42,879 --> 02:44:49,519
the the very like ocd

4890
02:44:46,398 --> 02:44:51,920
like very proficient yeah but then also

4891
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:53,600
the human side

4892
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:56,079
i fall in love with people i fall in

4893
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:58,559
love with everything so i don't know

4894
02:44:56,079 --> 02:44:59,840
i don't i i suppose you have to shut off

4895
02:44:58,559 --> 02:45:01,519
the part of your brain when you're

4896
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:03,760
executing a mission

4897
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:07,680
that cares about the hu about other

4898
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:09,359
humans uh outside your close-knit

4899
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:10,880
group

4900
02:45:09,359 --> 02:45:12,960
but like there's no time for

4901
02:45:10,879 --> 02:45:14,719
philosophical thinking i don't know i i

4902
02:45:12,959 --> 02:45:15,919
suppose that's why it's better to be

4903
02:45:14,719 --> 02:45:17,438
young

4904
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:19,439
young and dumb

4905
02:45:17,439 --> 02:45:22,000
you're not necessarily dumb it's just

4906
02:45:19,439 --> 02:45:25,439
like you were over

4907
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:26,959
that energy of excitement of proficiency

4908
02:45:25,439 --> 02:45:29,840
and excellence

4909
02:45:26,959 --> 02:45:31,039
is is just higher than it is later in

4910
02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:34,880
life sure

4911
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:39,040
it's you're not dumb i was not dumb but

4912
02:45:34,879 --> 02:45:41,679
i was naive uneducated

4913
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:43,840
not well trained

4914
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:43,840
and

4915
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:50,079
had an arrogance because we were told we

4916
02:45:47,359 --> 02:45:53,439
were the [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah you're

4917
02:45:50,079 --> 02:45:56,239
amazing okay i'm amazing so i wonder do

4918
02:45:53,439 --> 02:45:58,479
they think if we do mental training that

4919
02:45:56,239 --> 02:46:01,039
makes you weak do you think they the the

4920
02:45:58,478 --> 02:46:02,559
military thinks that makes you weak well

4921
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:04,080
yes and the reason i can say that is

4922
02:46:02,559 --> 02:46:06,079
because it's it's obvious in the way

4923
02:46:04,079 --> 02:46:07,920
that they handle it now right so like if

4924
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:09,520
a soldier says hey i'm really struggling

4925
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:11,760
with that last stop we were on man it's

4926
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:13,600
just really it's getting to me i'm just

4927
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:15,279
having a hard time sleeping they're

4928
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:16,720
gonna go

4929
02:46:15,279 --> 02:46:18,880
okay well

4930
02:46:16,719 --> 02:46:20,559
how how hard of a time sleeping are you

4931
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:22,639
having and then you get that wreath and

4932
02:46:20,559 --> 02:46:24,398
you go oh no i'm not it's not that bad

4933
02:46:22,639 --> 02:46:25,358
i'm not i don't need anything for it

4934
02:46:24,398 --> 02:46:27,519
like i'm just like once in a while i'm

4935
02:46:25,359 --> 02:46:29,840
losing some sleep like okay because you

4936
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:31,520
know that pen moves it's all getting

4937
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:32,639
written down and then you're dead right

4938
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:34,319
you're dead red which means you're not

4939
02:46:32,639 --> 02:46:35,680
deploying again yeah and then you're not

4940
02:46:34,318 --> 02:46:37,760
able to do the thing you love the most

4941
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:39,359
with the people you love the most right

4942
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:41,760
i mean but also

4943
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:44,640
this is really difficult and i i'd love

4944
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:49,040
to talk to you about ptsd but like sorry

4945
02:46:44,639 --> 02:46:49,039
yes i keep going off no please no but

4946
02:46:50,639 --> 02:46:55,439
so i'm i'm hoping to

4947
02:46:53,279 --> 02:46:57,200
um

4948
02:46:55,439 --> 02:46:59,200
like

4949
02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:01,359
launch a company you know in the

4950
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:04,880
engineering space and the and i

4951
02:47:01,359 --> 02:47:08,159
currently leave i've led a few people

4952
02:47:04,879 --> 02:47:08,159
and it's always this kind of

4953
02:47:08,478 --> 02:47:11,278
like how much are you supposed to push

4954
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:13,760
people

4955
02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:15,120
because people are everyone is weak and

4956
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:16,639
lazy

4957
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:18,960
are you quoting our text messages from

4958
02:47:16,639 --> 02:47:21,039
earlier yeah exactly exactly i'm quoting

4959
02:47:18,959 --> 02:47:23,438
this all i have is just quotes from you

4960
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:26,640
it's okay uh it tells you how much we've

4961
02:47:23,439 --> 02:47:28,639
spoken in the past week or so

4962
02:47:26,639 --> 02:47:31,039
i just i don't know what to do because

4963
02:47:28,639 --> 02:47:32,879
sometimes people are really struggling

4964
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:36,000
like really struggling in a way they're

4965
02:47:32,879 --> 02:47:37,679
being they're like it's the the goggins

4966
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:39,200
thing is like

4967
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:41,920
where's the line to where you're

4968
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:43,120
actually breaking the human being versus

4969
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:45,520
where you're

4970
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:47,520
breaking them at the places where they

4971
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:51,359
will grow back stronger

4972
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:53,200
like so and that line is tricky uh to

4973
02:47:51,359 --> 02:47:55,920
truly understand i think the military

4974
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:58,640
errors on the side of like

4975
02:47:55,920 --> 02:48:01,279
they you know like push them beyond all

4976
02:47:58,639 --> 02:48:02,959
limits physical limits physical but

4977
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:04,880
mental they don't they need to respect

4978
02:48:02,959 --> 02:48:06,639
the mental more uh they [ __ ] with the

4979
02:48:04,879 --> 02:48:08,239
brain a little bit i mean in basic

4980
02:48:06,639 --> 02:48:10,079
training they like scream in your face

4981
02:48:08,239 --> 02:48:11,920
and to see who's gonna crack and

4982
02:48:10,079 --> 02:48:13,359
they they put you on sleep deprivation

4983
02:48:11,920 --> 02:48:15,680
to see who's weak enough that they can't

4984
02:48:13,359 --> 02:48:17,439
handle sleep death they'll they do stuff

4985
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:19,120
to you like i know if you're a downed

4986
02:48:17,439 --> 02:48:20,639
pilot you have to go

4987
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:22,399
and you have to do this training and

4988
02:48:20,639 --> 02:48:24,398
like it's you get captured it's like

4989
02:48:22,398 --> 02:48:26,000
this whole thing and

4990
02:48:24,398 --> 02:48:27,599
they [ __ ] with your brain

4991
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:29,439
but there's a line

4992
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:31,840
there's a line

4993
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:34,720
my issue is

4994
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:37,040
go to the line cross the line

4995
02:48:34,719 --> 02:48:38,398
give them the tools to come back from

4996
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:41,040
the line right

4997
02:48:38,398 --> 02:48:43,199
yeah we don't do that we don't

4998
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:44,880
we we know there's ptsd

4999
02:48:43,200 --> 02:48:45,920
we know there's such a thing we

5000
02:48:44,879 --> 02:48:47,199
understand there's anxiety and

5001
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:49,439
depression we understand there's major

5002
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:51,279
depressive disorder we understand

5003
02:48:49,439 --> 02:48:54,559
that there are precursors there are

5004
02:48:51,279 --> 02:48:56,560
signs and symptoms we understand that so

5005
02:48:54,559 --> 02:48:58,639
why are we not building

5006
02:48:56,559 --> 02:49:00,159
enough of a toolkit

5007
02:48:58,639 --> 02:49:02,318
whether that be i'm not talking

5008
02:49:00,159 --> 02:49:03,840
medication i'm talking

5009
02:49:02,318 --> 02:49:06,398
it sounds

5010
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:10,000
but [ __ ] trust me it works i'm

5011
02:49:06,398 --> 02:49:12,079
talking meditation i'm talking yoga i'm

5012
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:13,840
talking about peer group support i'm

5013
02:49:12,079 --> 02:49:16,159
talking about if you go to your doctor

5014
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:17,680
and report this there's you're not

5015
02:49:16,159 --> 02:49:18,799
automatically going to be losing your

5016
02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:20,559
job

5017
02:49:18,799 --> 02:49:22,799
why aren't we giving the proper tools

5018
02:49:20,559 --> 02:49:24,799
and the education needed these things

5019
02:49:22,799 --> 02:49:26,559
are not difficult to teach they don't

5020
02:49:24,799 --> 02:49:28,478
take a lot of time they don't take a lot

5021
02:49:26,559 --> 02:49:30,398
of money the only time it takes a lot of

5022
02:49:28,478 --> 02:49:32,639
money is when you want to medicate we

5023
02:49:30,398 --> 02:49:34,079
don't need to medicate you yet you only

5024
02:49:32,639 --> 02:49:36,000
need to be medicated if you're a danger

5025
02:49:34,079 --> 02:49:37,680
to someone else or yourself and most of

5026
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:39,520
the time because of the way the system

5027
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:41,359
is set you'll lie about it through your

5028
02:49:39,520 --> 02:49:43,920
[ __ ] teeth just so that no one

5029
02:49:41,359 --> 02:49:45,760
touches you so from the perspective of

5030
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:48,799
the military do you think you can

5031
02:49:45,760 --> 02:49:50,639
still be a bad [ __ ] and do all

5032
02:49:48,799 --> 02:49:51,840
the mental work yes

5033
02:49:50,639 --> 02:49:54,799
some of the

5034
02:49:51,840 --> 02:49:57,359
baddest dudes i've ever known are like

5035
02:49:54,799 --> 02:49:59,679
i gotta go to yoga i gotta go meditate

5036
02:49:57,359 --> 02:50:01,840
yeah i go do aya with those guys why

5037
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:04,639
because they know that that's not okay

5038
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:07,040
to be like that in your life

5039
02:50:04,639 --> 02:50:09,599
can you answer the ridiculously big

5040
02:50:07,040 --> 02:50:12,000
question of what is ptsd

5041
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:14,559
like do you understand the basic

5042
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:16,079
characteristics of it is there universal

5043
02:50:14,559 --> 02:50:17,278
characteristics

5044
02:50:16,079 --> 02:50:19,600
from your own

5045
02:50:17,279 --> 02:50:22,000
unique experience like from what you've

5046
02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:23,600
understood about it yeah of course there

5047
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:25,439
are so there's you know there's the the

5048
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:27,439
basic things that a doctor looks for

5049
02:50:25,439 --> 02:50:28,960
when when they're diagnosing ptsd i'm

5050
02:50:27,439 --> 02:50:31,920
not a doctor let me make that [ __ ]

5051
02:50:28,959 --> 02:50:34,879
clear but there are things that you look

5052
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:36,799
for you look for insomnia you look for

5053
02:50:34,879 --> 02:50:39,438
anger and aggression you look for people

5054
02:50:36,799 --> 02:50:41,599
to fly off the handle you look for

5055
02:50:39,439 --> 02:50:44,159
avoidance you can tell in somebody's

5056
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:45,920
body people who can't sleep if you can't

5057
02:50:44,159 --> 02:50:47,600
sleep you you know that after a certain

5058
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:49,279
amount of time they're just gonna

5059
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:52,079
deteriorate

5060
02:50:49,279 --> 02:50:53,840
you know sleeplessness uh triggers

5061
02:50:52,079 --> 02:50:55,840
when you say avoidance do you mean

5062
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:58,000
avoidance so like when i first got back

5063
02:50:55,840 --> 02:51:00,559
to canada i avoided everybody that was

5064
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:02,239
middle eastern at all costs

5065
02:51:00,559 --> 02:51:03,920
no matter how much of a difference it

5066
02:51:02,239 --> 02:51:05,279
made in my day if i had to not go

5067
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:07,439
somewhere for one of the greatest events

5068
02:51:05,279 --> 02:51:09,279
of my life i wouldn't have went

5069
02:51:07,439 --> 02:51:11,439
but isn't there some aspect there

5070
02:51:09,279 --> 02:51:14,000
combined with the triggers like maybe

5071
02:51:11,439 --> 02:51:15,840
it's wise to avoid triggers even like

5072
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:18,079
for your own personal health well-being

5073
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:20,000
well that's it it's for me that was one

5074
02:51:18,079 --> 02:51:22,000
of my triggers so that you have triggers

5075
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:23,439
so and then you also deal with things

5076
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:25,520
like um

5077
02:51:23,439 --> 02:51:26,880
sounds and smells you can tell you can

5078
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:29,040
tell when someone's triggered a lot of

5079
02:51:26,879 --> 02:51:31,358
vets don't like fireworks it's like okay

5080
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:33,600
we'll remove yourself from the situation

5081
02:51:31,359 --> 02:51:34,960
so there's there's other things within

5082
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:36,800
ptsd

5083
02:51:34,959 --> 02:51:39,199
that kind of rear its head

5084
02:51:36,799 --> 02:51:40,639
that with ptsd kind of

5085
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:42,800
attach other things so like when i was

5086
02:51:40,639 --> 02:51:44,318
diagnosed with ptsd it was like four

5087
02:51:42,799 --> 02:51:47,119
years later i was diagnosed with major

5088
02:51:44,318 --> 02:51:49,119
depressive disorder and that was kind of

5089
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:51,200
a compilation of things that was just

5090
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:54,560
like a [ __ ] show there what is major

5091
02:51:51,200 --> 02:51:54,560
depressive good question

5092
02:51:54,719 --> 02:51:59,199
is there an answer i don't have one i

5093
02:51:56,959 --> 02:52:01,199
was told i had it

5094
02:51:59,200 --> 02:52:02,800
okay so

5095
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:05,520
i mean um

5096
02:52:02,799 --> 02:52:08,639
what does your mind go through where are

5097
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:10,800
the places that my mind goes your mind

5098
02:52:08,639 --> 02:52:12,159
goes like the dark places when i get

5099
02:52:10,799 --> 02:52:13,039
triggered and when it was like really

5100
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:16,239
bad

5101
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:17,439
yeah okay yeah so um you thought about

5102
02:52:16,239 --> 02:52:19,840
suicide

5103
02:52:17,439 --> 02:52:21,840
every minute of every day

5104
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:24,559
what are the pros of suicide in your

5105
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:26,318
mind at that time what at that time the

5106
02:52:24,559 --> 02:52:28,719
pros were

5107
02:52:26,318 --> 02:52:30,959
no one has to deal with this anymore

5108
02:52:28,719 --> 02:52:33,760
i don't have to feel this way anymore

5109
02:52:30,959 --> 02:52:36,719
i'm a burden to my family i'm a burden

5110
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:40,000
to the military system i'm

5111
02:52:36,719 --> 02:52:42,559

my my parents don't deserve to watch me

5116
02:52:48,079 --> 02:52:51,680
go through this the guy i was dating

5117
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:54,000
didn't deserve to put up with the

5118
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:55,279
[ __ ] i put him through

5119
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,799
the

5120
02:52:55,279 --> 02:52:59,200
people who drive with me in cars didn't

5121
02:52:56,799 --> 02:53:02,639
deserve to almost hit medians because i

5122
02:52:59,200 --> 02:53:04,880
swerved because of a piece of garbage

5123
02:53:02,639 --> 02:53:06,879
people didn't deserve my racist outburst

5124
02:53:04,879 --> 02:53:09,278
people didn't deserve

5125
02:53:06,879 --> 02:53:11,119
people didn't i did not deserve to be

5126
02:53:09,279 --> 02:53:14,640
breathing anymore i should have died

5127
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:14,640
there and i wished i died there

5128
02:53:14,879 --> 02:53:19,199
so um self-hate there too oh

5129
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:24,719
not even a big deal though right

5130
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:27,120
that's at the core of it that that's

5131
02:53:24,719 --> 02:53:28,639
like this um

5132
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:30,399
and so uh

5133
02:53:28,639 --> 02:53:32,079
how do you escape from that place how do

5134
02:53:30,398 --> 02:53:33,039
you overcome that

5135
02:53:32,079 --> 02:53:34,879
those

5136
02:53:33,040 --> 02:53:37,200
that depression essentially at the core

5137
02:53:34,879 --> 02:53:39,119
of the desire to kill yourself

5138
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:41,600
what um

5139
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:43,439
what basic principles i mean we could

5140
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:45,680
talk about ayahuasca but

5141
02:53:43,439 --> 02:53:48,720
basically principles of like literally

5142
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:51,120
like how do you escape that moment yeah

5143
02:53:48,719 --> 02:53:53,920
previous to any of that i i did from

5144
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:56,800
2009 i got out so i was medically i was

5145
02:53:53,920 --> 02:53:59,120
3b medical honorable discharge in 2011

5146
02:53:56,799 --> 02:54:01,599
may 23rd 2011. so i left the military

5147
02:53:59,120 --> 02:54:03,840
then and so it's been 10 years

5148
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:06,159
just over 10 years oh my god it's 10 and

5149
02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:09,359
a half years i just realized

5150
02:54:06,159 --> 02:54:11,520
happy anniversary thanks man awesome

5151
02:54:09,359 --> 02:54:13,680
so i've been out for 10 years and i

5152
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:14,640
would say the reason i didn't kill

5153
02:54:13,680 --> 02:54:16,398
myself

5154
02:54:14,639 --> 02:54:17,840
for the longest time was the individual

5155
02:54:16,398 --> 02:54:19,599
i was dating

5156
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:21,120
that that was that was straight across

5157
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:22,079
the board that was it

5158
02:54:21,120 --> 02:54:23,279
um

5159
02:54:22,079 --> 02:54:26,959
for me

5160
02:54:23,279 --> 02:54:29,439
there was no relief for about

5161
02:54:26,959 --> 02:54:31,199
six years of the

5162
02:54:29,439 --> 02:54:32,318
the thought of just kill yourself kill

5163
02:54:31,200 --> 02:54:34,159
yourself kill her it's easier if you

5164
02:54:32,318 --> 02:54:36,478
just do it like that voice was so strong

5165
02:54:34,159 --> 02:54:38,478
for that long there was really no relief

5166
02:54:36,478 --> 02:54:39,438
what there was though

5167
02:54:38,478 --> 02:54:43,039
was

5168
02:54:39,439 --> 02:54:45,439
implementation of different medications

5169
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:47,439
realizing they weren't working trying

5170
02:54:45,439 --> 02:54:48,880
different things

5171
02:54:47,439 --> 02:54:50,720
getting myself to a point where i could

5172
02:54:48,879 --> 02:54:53,199
leave my house comfortably comfortably

5173
02:54:50,719 --> 02:54:54,959
ish again and i wasn't triggered which

5174
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:56,399
then allowed me to travel which then

5175
02:54:54,959 --> 02:54:58,478
allowed me to

5176
02:54:56,398 --> 02:55:00,159
slowly try to go back to school which by

5177
02:54:58,478 --> 02:55:02,559
the way was a very bad idea that was a

5178
02:55:00,159 --> 02:55:04,879
bad idea that was that was bad

5179
02:55:02,559 --> 02:55:06,559
i went too early

5180
02:55:04,879 --> 02:55:08,719
they started practicing active shooter

5181
02:55:06,559 --> 02:55:11,278
drills in our school it was it was a it

5182
02:55:08,719 --> 02:55:13,599
was bad my professors understood

5183
02:55:11,279 --> 02:55:16,720
school is full of triggers it turns out

5184
02:55:13,600 --> 02:55:18,318
um it is when you live in vancouver

5185
02:55:16,719 --> 02:55:21,760
there's a theme to this conversation

5186
02:55:18,318 --> 02:55:24,559
about your love for canada i look at me

5187
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:26,159
i love my [ __ ] country i am one of

5188
02:55:24,559 --> 02:55:28,559
the most patriotic people you will meet

5189
02:55:26,159 --> 02:55:31,600
in it i think canada is one of the

5190
02:55:28,559 --> 02:55:34,318
greatest [ __ ] places on the earth

5191
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:37,920
i think in the past two years or three

5192
02:55:34,318 --> 02:55:42,680
years i have seen what i loved so deeply

5193
02:55:37,920 --> 02:55:42,680
so proudly preached about so

5194
02:55:50,239 --> 02:55:54,559
i'm so proud of what i did there

5195
02:55:54,799 --> 02:55:59,840
and i'm so proud of the country i got to

5196
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:59,840
represent

5197
02:56:00,478 --> 02:56:05,679
because i was good at my job

5198
02:56:03,520 --> 02:56:07,760
being being great at your job for a

5199
02:56:05,680 --> 02:56:09,600
country you love you just don't like

5200
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:11,840
some of the politicians some of the time

5201
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:14,479
it's not even the politicians anymore

5202
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:16,079
it's the state of the country

5203
02:56:14,478 --> 02:56:17,679
i'm a second class citizen in my own

5204
02:56:16,079 --> 02:56:19,600
country right now

5205
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:21,040
i can't travel to see my parents within

5206
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:22,960
my own country

5207
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:24,560
i'm not allowed to step foot in my son's

5208
02:56:22,959 --> 02:56:27,119
school

5209
02:56:24,559 --> 02:56:28,959
i am not allowed to go to a restaurant

5210
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:32,720
with my family

5211
02:56:28,959 --> 02:56:34,239
i'm not allowed to leave canada without

5212
02:56:32,719 --> 02:56:35,679
i told you all the stuff i have to do to

5213
02:56:34,239 --> 02:56:38,159
get here

5214
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:40,639
to even get home i have to do the same

5215
02:56:38,159 --> 02:56:42,559
i'm watched by the rcmp

5216
02:56:40,639 --> 02:56:44,478
i'm

5217
02:56:42,559 --> 02:56:46,559
neighbors rat you out

5218
02:56:44,478 --> 02:56:49,278
so so for somebody who fought for their

5219
02:56:46,559 --> 02:56:52,639
country i hate it it makes me so sad to

5220
02:56:49,279 --> 02:56:54,560
be to go through this process of uh

5221
02:56:52,639 --> 02:56:56,559
what many considered to be power

5222
02:56:54,559 --> 02:56:59,039
overreach by government in the face of

5223
02:56:56,559 --> 02:57:00,318
uh this particular pandemic

5224
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:02,160
yeah

5225
02:57:00,318 --> 02:57:03,920
yeah i always knew i had a hard time

5226
02:57:02,159 --> 02:57:05,840
with like i loved canada the day i got

5227
02:57:03,920 --> 02:57:06,639
spit on when i got home was not ideal

5228
02:57:05,840 --> 02:57:08,590
but

5229
02:57:06,639 --> 02:57:10,879
yes spit on yeah um

5230
02:57:08,590 --> 02:57:12,318
[Music]

5231
02:57:10,879 --> 02:57:15,679
but the thing was

5232
02:57:12,318 --> 02:57:17,278
i knew long enough that if i

5233
02:57:15,680 --> 02:57:19,040
just put one foot in front of the other

5234
02:57:17,279 --> 02:57:20,399
and kept going to treatment

5235
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:23,040
and kept

5236
02:57:20,398 --> 02:57:25,599
doing what my doctor told me to do

5237
02:57:23,040 --> 02:57:28,000
that i could pull out of this

5238
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:29,600
if i if i tried i i was told that i

5239
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:31,200
could do anything in my life

5240
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:33,600
it didn't matter

5241
02:57:31,200 --> 02:57:35,600
as long as i tried was trying really

5242
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:38,318
hard

5243
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:38,318
trying was

5244
02:57:38,959 --> 02:57:45,199
trying was harder than breathing

5245
02:57:41,200 --> 02:57:45,200
it it was exhausting it was

5246
02:57:46,478 --> 02:57:50,799
i would be awake for like half a day and

5247
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:53,439
every minute of that day i just stare at

5248
02:57:50,799 --> 02:57:55,119
the wall and just want to kill myself

5249
02:57:53,439 --> 02:57:57,120
yeah that's what i've

5250
02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:59,920
had people close to me who suffer from

5251
02:57:57,120 --> 02:58:02,479
depression and it was like

5252
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:04,318
it's unclear how to escape but it's

5253
02:58:02,478 --> 02:58:05,840
clear that you need to try some

5254
02:58:04,318 --> 02:58:08,159
something

5255
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:10,639
and they didn't want to even try because

5256
02:58:08,159 --> 02:58:12,799
you have no try in you yeah you have no

5257
02:58:10,639 --> 02:58:15,760
no i'm watching a person who has no

5258
02:58:12,799 --> 02:58:18,639
energy essentially to like do any of it

5259
02:58:15,760 --> 02:58:20,880
and it's like so hopeless but you have

5260
02:58:18,639 --> 02:58:21,760
to try and i think some of that has to

5261
02:58:20,879 --> 02:58:23,519
do

5262
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:25,120
with all the different physical feats

5263
02:58:23,520 --> 02:58:27,439
you have to do like when you have

5264
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:29,359
nothing left you still keep going that

5265
02:58:27,439 --> 02:58:31,920
same like weird

5266
02:58:29,359 --> 02:58:32,960
drive when you're empty you still keep

5267
02:58:31,920 --> 02:58:36,079
going

5268
02:58:32,959 --> 02:58:39,039
um i wanted to give up i tried i

5269
02:58:36,079 --> 02:58:41,200
it's i did i'm really lucky because it

5270
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:42,720
really was the one person that

5271
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:43,840
i'd wake up to next

5272
02:58:42,719 --> 02:58:46,959
every day

5273
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:48,559
and he'd be like hey so that new drug

5274
02:58:46,959 --> 02:58:49,919
you're on fun fact if you don't go to

5275
02:58:48,559 --> 02:58:52,799
sleep right away you talk and when you

5276
02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:55,760
talk you just don't [ __ ] stop and you

5277
02:58:52,799 --> 02:58:57,438
go off about everything that's horrible

5278
02:58:55,760 --> 02:58:58,960
and i'm like what are you talking about

5279
02:58:57,439 --> 02:59:00,479
no last night yeah you took that pill

5280
02:58:58,959 --> 02:59:03,119
guess what you just you just you didn't

5281
02:59:00,478 --> 02:59:05,039
stop i have no recollection i'd get up

5282
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:06,640
in the middle of the night i would cook

5283
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:09,600
food

5284
02:59:06,639 --> 02:59:11,519
like on a stove and it would be

5285
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:13,040
hopefully we don't die because i would

5286
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:14,640
have no recollection because of the

5287
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:16,479
drugs

5288
02:59:14,639 --> 02:59:18,079
the idea that

5289
02:59:16,478 --> 02:59:20,239
when people say well just pull yourself

5290
02:59:18,079 --> 02:59:24,159
out of depression

5291
02:59:20,239 --> 02:59:24,159
i'm a highly motivated individual

5292
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:30,800
the idea of lifting my head up to turn

5293
02:59:29,040 --> 02:59:32,319
over

5294
02:59:30,799 --> 02:59:34,478
was daunting

5295
02:59:32,318 --> 02:59:37,519
that's terrifying it's like for somebody

5296
02:59:34,478 --> 02:59:38,719
so as driven as you to completely lose

5297
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:41,279
all of that

5298
02:59:38,719 --> 02:59:43,119
for moments of time for for stretches of

5299
02:59:41,279 --> 02:59:45,279
time

5300
02:59:43,120 --> 02:59:46,560
[ __ ] the mind is a [ __ ] this is

5301
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:48,399
uh it is

5302
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:51,278
i i can't

5303
02:59:48,398 --> 02:59:53,599
um for somebody like i can't

5304
02:59:51,279 --> 02:59:55,120
i can't i'm so i'm so grateful for

5305
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:56,479
people like you to be able to pull out

5306
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:58,720
of that i i've

5307
02:59:56,478 --> 03:00:00,239
i've been always the opposite

5308
02:59:58,719 --> 03:00:03,840
like

5309
03:00:00,239 --> 03:00:05,680
i've been very fortunate to just

5310
03:00:03,840 --> 03:00:07,840
always find joy and meaning in

5311
03:00:05,680 --> 03:00:09,359
everything even the stupidest [ __ ] can i

5312
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:12,079
ask you something yeah

5313
03:00:09,359 --> 03:00:15,520
do you think that's because you of how

5314
03:00:12,079 --> 03:00:15,520
you're raised where you came from

5315
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:19,920
no

5316
03:00:16,959 --> 03:00:23,358
no it was my own person i i honestly

5317
03:00:19,920 --> 03:00:26,559
think it's uh the the biology the the

5318
03:00:23,359 --> 03:00:28,960
uh this because i had my parents i'm

5319
03:00:26,559 --> 03:00:31,039
very cognizant of had nothing to

5320
03:00:28,959 --> 03:00:33,438
uh do with that they they never

5321
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:35,760
understood this little engine i had i

5322
03:00:33,439 --> 03:00:37,520
just i always liked just sitting looking

5323
03:00:35,760 --> 03:00:39,840
at people and just enjoying how amazing

5324
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:41,680
they are and just like looking at

5325
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:44,000
like it's i think it's straight up just

5326
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:46,559
biology whatever the neurochemistry is

5327
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:48,398
like i'm just getting like a good drug

5328
03:00:46,559 --> 03:00:51,039
you're just getting hit yeah i'm getting

5329
03:00:48,398 --> 03:00:53,680
hit all the time from stupid [ __ ] and i

5330
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:54,720
love that and it doesn't

5331
03:00:53,680 --> 03:00:56,639
and

5332
03:00:54,719 --> 03:00:58,478
yeah so that's why i can be sometimes

5333
03:00:56,639 --> 03:01:00,639
i'll talk like so very self-critically

5334
03:00:58,478 --> 03:01:01,438
about myself because that's almost makes

5335
03:01:00,639 --> 03:01:03,439
me

5336
03:01:01,439 --> 03:01:05,120
it makes life more fun it challenges

5337
03:01:03,439 --> 03:01:06,479
stuff it makes you more productive but

5338
03:01:05,120 --> 03:01:07,760
ultimately it's because i'm getting that

5339
03:01:06,478 --> 03:01:09,599
like

5340
03:01:07,760 --> 03:01:11,600
i'm getting the good stuff all the time

5341
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:13,040
i wondered about that i was thinking

5342
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:14,399
about that when i listened to you for

5343
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:16,319
the first time on i think when you're on

5344
03:01:14,398 --> 03:01:18,000
rogan for the first time water shouldn't

5345
03:01:16,318 --> 03:01:19,920
do that

5346
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:21,359
oh it's not water you shouldn't trust

5347
03:01:19,920 --> 03:01:22,799
see this is the thing it's don't buy

5348
03:01:21,359 --> 03:01:24,159
coca-cola

5349
03:01:22,799 --> 03:01:27,039
well no i had to

5350
03:01:24,159 --> 03:01:29,119
oh well i resealed i mean

5351
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:30,880
i didn't go that far but now i'm really

5352
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:33,120
starting to question what's in this but

5353
03:01:30,879 --> 03:01:36,239
that's okay if i offered you tea should

5354
03:01:33,120 --> 03:01:37,359
really be worried but yeah why

5355
03:01:36,239 --> 03:01:38,959
i mean that's just

5356
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:40,720
no that's the the

5357
03:01:38,959 --> 03:01:43,199
like the more famous way that russians

5358
03:01:40,719 --> 03:01:45,438
usually assassinate to put poison in the

5359
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:46,159
tea because a lot of russians drink tea

5360
03:01:45,439 --> 03:01:48,639
and

5361
03:01:46,159 --> 03:01:50,639
you know all right well i mean

5362
03:01:48,639 --> 03:01:52,719

5415
03:03:24,639 --> 03:03:27,199
more

5416
03:03:25,600 --> 03:03:29,520
he's

5417
03:03:27,200 --> 03:03:31,520
he's much more actually and the focus is

5418
03:03:29,520 --> 03:03:33,439
always on um

5419
03:03:31,520 --> 03:03:36,159
how to help how that

5428
03:03:51,279 --> 03:03:54,560
a couple weeks in austin we just hang

5429
03:03:52,799 --> 03:03:56,239
out and it's like

5430
03:03:54,559 --> 03:03:57,680
you think that was like a teleprompter

5431
03:03:56,239 --> 03:03:58,639
or something like the way he does this

5432
03:03:57,680 --> 03:04:00,639
podcast

5433
03:03:58,639 --> 03:04:02,318
yeah but like in person he's the same

5434
03:04:00,639 --> 03:04:06,079
like all right

5435
03:04:02,318 --> 03:04:07,519
this is this is intense but i like it

5436
03:04:06,079 --> 03:04:09,200
anyway uh

5437
03:04:07,520 --> 03:04:11,200
why did we bring him up i don't know a

5438
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:13,600
lot of knives we were talking about he

5439
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:14,880
gave it to me that's right ptsd

5440
03:04:13,600 --> 03:04:16,880
and then you talk about poison and how

5441
03:04:14,879 --> 03:04:18,559
you were poisoning me and i said knives

5442
03:04:16,879 --> 03:04:20,000
we're talking about russians and then we

5443
03:04:18,559 --> 03:04:21,278
were kind of talking about the brain and

5444
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:24,559
ptsd

5445
03:04:21,279 --> 03:04:26,079
yeah i think for for most people though

5446
03:04:24,559 --> 03:04:27,760
the biggest thing

5447
03:04:26,079 --> 03:04:29,840
when they see somebody who's struggling

5448
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:32,239
with ptsd their their first you know

5449
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:34,960
reaction is how do i help them

5450
03:04:32,239 --> 03:04:36,239
well often just saying hey

5451
03:04:34,959 --> 03:04:37,119
i'm here when you're ready to talk i

5452
03:04:36,239 --> 03:04:38,239
know you're going through something

5453
03:04:37,120 --> 03:04:40,640
whether you want to talk about it right

5454
03:04:38,239 --> 03:04:42,959
now or not i'm here and then keeping a

5455
03:04:40,639 --> 03:04:46,318
close eye on behaviors when you start to

5456
03:04:42,959 --> 03:04:48,799
see somebody having you know four five

5457
03:04:46,318 --> 03:04:51,278
six beers at night

5458
03:04:48,799 --> 03:04:52,719
let's ask why when you see somebody you

5459
03:04:51,279 --> 03:04:53,840
can tell they're not sleeping hey buddy

5460
03:04:52,719 --> 03:04:55,519
you're sleeping no i just i'm not

5461
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:58,398
sleeping

5462
03:04:55,520 --> 03:05:00,560
instead of just going oh that sucks

5463
03:04:58,398 --> 03:05:02,639
hey why aren't you sleeping you having

5464
03:05:00,559 --> 03:05:04,559
nightmares are you you just having

5465
03:05:02,639 --> 03:05:06,559
insomnia are you just eating sugar

5466
03:05:04,559 --> 03:05:08,239
before bed like

5467
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:09,199
care enough about your people to just

5468
03:05:08,239 --> 03:05:11,039
ask

5469
03:05:09,200 --> 03:05:12,880
one follow-up question because often

5470
03:05:11,040 --> 03:05:14,399
that's really all it takes because then

5471
03:05:12,879 --> 03:05:17,199
somebody goes somebody cares enough to

5472
03:05:14,398 --> 03:05:19,599
ask and then they'll just

5473
03:05:17,200 --> 03:05:21,040
yeah just showing that you care it's

5474
03:05:19,600 --> 03:05:23,760
honestly

5475
03:05:21,040 --> 03:05:25,920
grocery store lineup i'll say oh i like

5476
03:05:23,760 --> 03:05:28,478
your dress oh thank you and then i'll go

5477
03:05:25,920 --> 03:05:30,478
how's your day going they'll be like

5478
03:05:28,478 --> 03:05:32,000
actually it's going all right it's not

5479
03:05:30,478 --> 03:05:33,599
as great as i thought it would be today

5480
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:35,520
but i'm doing okay but like they'll give

5481
03:05:33,600 --> 03:05:37,279
you instead of could you instead of just

5482
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:39,760
giving you this fake false reaction if

5483
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:42,640
you just show

5484
03:05:39,760 --> 03:05:44,840
any effort in somebody that you care at

5485
03:05:42,639 --> 03:05:47,599
all about someone's well-being you'd be

5486
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:49,439
amazed amazed

5487
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:51,680

5502
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:21,200
brief period of no masks in canada like

5503
03:06:20,239 --> 03:06:23,039
just like a

5504
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:24,720
brief like five minutes oh yeah it was

5511
03:06:32,719 --> 03:06:36,159
and i didn't know what was happening and

5512
03:06:34,159 --> 03:06:37,680
she got closer and then she just grabbed

5513
03:06:36,159 --> 03:06:40,719
my arm like this

5514
03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:42,479

5515
03:06:40,719 --> 03:06:44,079

amazing it doesn't take much yeah at

5521
03:06:52,318 --> 03:06:57,760
that little moment of genuine care

5522
03:06:54,959 --> 03:06:59,919
maybe you can tell me actually the

5523
03:06:57,760 --> 03:07:01,439
the journey you took with ayahuasca like

5524
03:06:59,920 --> 03:07:03,040
what

5525
03:07:01,439 --> 03:07:05,439
that's such a fascinating journey so

5526
03:07:03,040 --> 03:07:07,520
like uh letting your mind go to

5527
03:07:05,439 --> 03:07:09,359
different places in order to rediscover

5528
03:07:07,520 --> 03:07:10,880
itself like like

5529
03:07:09,359 --> 03:07:12,559
what is it like a rocket ship to

5530
03:07:10,879 --> 03:07:13,839
somewhere else so you can land in a

5531
03:07:12,559 --> 03:07:15,519
better place

5532
03:07:13,840 --> 03:07:17,840
here how about i show you something

5533
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:19,279
that'll help your brain okay yes

5534
03:07:17,840 --> 03:07:20,719
this is not for you to lift up either

5535
03:07:19,279 --> 03:07:22,239
and show on the camera because there's

5536
03:07:20,719 --> 03:07:24,398
leaves in it like there's leaves and

5537
03:07:22,239 --> 03:07:25,680
some pages so just don't dump it out

5538
03:07:24,398 --> 03:07:28,159
cause it'll go all [ __ ] everywhere

5539
03:07:25,680 --> 03:07:32,239
got it got it instructions i like this

5540
03:07:28,159 --> 03:07:32,239
yeah well you feel like you need them um

5541
03:07:32,639 --> 03:07:37,199
ayahuasca is

5542
03:07:34,959 --> 03:07:39,358
a beautiful psychedelic that we have

5543
03:07:37,200 --> 03:07:41,920
been so blessed to have on this earth

5544
03:07:39,359 --> 03:07:43,279
that we have so underutilized

5545
03:07:41,920 --> 03:07:45,680
and could be

5546
03:07:43,279 --> 03:07:46,960
i don't say saving humanity but just you

5547
03:07:45,680 --> 03:07:48,398
ever hear that saying if you could just

5548
03:07:46,959 --> 03:07:50,079
give everyone mushrooms one time the

5549
03:07:48,398 --> 03:07:50,879
world would be a better place

5550
03:07:50,079 --> 03:07:54,000
okay

5551
03:07:50,879 --> 03:07:57,438
so psilocybin is

5552
03:07:54,000 --> 03:08:00,159
i use for microdosing uh for depression

5553
03:07:57,439 --> 03:08:01,359
i did ayahuasca in january of this year

5554
03:08:00,159 --> 03:08:04,398
um

5555
03:08:01,359 --> 03:08:06,399
and i've at that point that was the last

5556
03:08:04,398 --> 03:08:08,879
time i was on a pharmaceutical drug i've

5557
03:08:06,398 --> 03:08:10,799
been off everything ever since 10

5558
03:08:08,879 --> 03:08:13,438
different ones so if you backtrack a

5559
03:08:10,799 --> 03:08:16,079
little bit just to so you'll understand

5560
03:08:13,439 --> 03:08:17,520
my doctor gave me the opportunity dr um

5561
03:08:16,079 --> 03:08:20,159
greg passi

5562
03:08:17,520 --> 03:08:22,479
he is a veteran himself served in bosnia

03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:27,920
right in the face for that he's high up

5566
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:29,920
officer um

03:08:27,920 --> 03:08:32,000
he's one of my saviors he's like my old

03:08:29,920 --> 03:08:33,200
i call him my old man he's my favorite

5569
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,719

5571
03:08:34,719 --> 03:08:39,119
nice yeah and um

5572
03:08:37,279 --> 03:08:41,520
he said you know kels this is i just

5573
03:08:39,120 --> 03:08:43,840
don't i was hitting a wall i wasn't

5574
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:45,439
getting any better and he goes how do

5575
03:08:43,840 --> 03:08:47,680
you feel about cannabis

5576
03:08:45,439 --> 03:08:50,800
and i was like i don't feel good about

5577
03:08:47,680 --> 03:08:52,479
it because family histories or my

5578
03:08:50,799 --> 03:08:54,879
parents always told me if i smoked weed

5579
03:08:52,478 --> 03:08:57,199
you know it's just this this perception

5580
03:08:54,879 --> 03:08:58,959
because i just want you to try it just

5581
03:08:57,200 --> 03:09:01,279
would you be willing to try it so i was

5582
03:08:58,959 --> 03:09:02,398
like okay so i was willing to try it

5583
03:09:01,279 --> 03:09:04,560
then i started going to these groups

5584
03:09:02,398 --> 03:09:06,159
called women grow and um

5585
03:09:04,559 --> 03:09:08,159
learning about it

5586
03:09:06,159 --> 03:09:09,200
and then i realized

5587
03:09:08,159 --> 03:09:10,079
oh

5588
03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:12,479
i'm

5589
03:09:10,079 --> 03:09:14,639
starting to sleep a little bit

5590
03:09:12,478 --> 03:09:16,398
i don't feel groggy in the morning

5591
03:09:14,639 --> 03:09:17,840
i don't feel like a bag of [ __ ]

5592
03:09:16,398 --> 03:09:19,119
and i also want to have a baby one day

5593
03:09:17,840 --> 03:09:20,799
and i can't have all this stuff in my

5594
03:09:19,120 --> 03:09:22,800
system

5595
03:09:20,799 --> 03:09:24,719
so i started using cannabis

5596
03:09:22,799 --> 03:09:26,719
and then i started using it

5597
03:09:24,719 --> 03:09:30,039
as a main medication

5598
03:09:26,719 --> 03:09:32,398
and i'd been using it now since

5599
03:09:30,040 --> 03:09:34,960
2014 got married

5600
03:09:32,398 --> 03:09:38,719
jack was born in 60

5601
03:09:34,959 --> 03:09:40,559
15 2015 i started using it um

5602
03:09:38,719 --> 03:09:43,760
and i've been using it ever since

5603
03:09:40,559 --> 03:09:45,840
and that was the way i got off of all

5604
03:09:43,760 --> 03:09:48,159
the pharmaceutical drugs was keeping

5605
03:09:45,840 --> 03:09:50,799
cannabis the constant finding the right

5606
03:09:48,159 --> 03:09:53,520
strains for me and then slowly with the

5607
03:09:50,799 --> 03:09:56,159
doctor's advice and under supervision

5608
03:09:53,520 --> 03:09:59,439
going off of those medications

5609
03:09:56,159 --> 03:10:02,238
cut to january of 2021

5610
03:09:59,439 --> 03:10:03,920
i had hit a really bad spell last year

5611
03:10:02,238 --> 03:10:06,079
um and the year before was a really big

5612
03:10:03,920 --> 03:10:08,478
struggle uh i almost lost my company

5613
03:10:06,079 --> 03:10:10,478
last year due to covet just like many

5614
03:10:08,478 --> 03:10:11,599
many millions of people did

5615
03:10:10,478 --> 03:10:13,599
um

5616
03:10:11,600 --> 03:10:14,880
and instead of me just laying down and

5617
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:17,439
taking it

5618
03:10:14,879 --> 03:10:18,719
i pivoted really quickly and

5619
03:10:17,439 --> 03:10:20,238
called the factory and said you guys

5620
03:10:18,719 --> 03:10:22,159
make masks they're like yeah we're

5621
03:10:20,238 --> 03:10:23,199
making masks i was like

5622
03:10:22,159 --> 03:10:24,799
i'm going to call the canadian

5623
03:10:23,200 --> 03:10:26,800
government i'm going to get my medical

5624
03:10:24,799 --> 03:10:28,318
license and i'm gonna try to sell the

5625
03:10:26,799 --> 03:10:30,559
masks and see if we can do that and so

5626
03:10:28,318 --> 03:10:34,318
we did that and so we did

5627
03:10:30,559 --> 03:10:36,559
200 000 masks for ontario hospitals um

5628
03:10:34,318 --> 03:10:38,159
which ironically

5629
03:10:36,559 --> 03:10:39,600
went to my entire community i was born

5630
03:10:38,159 --> 03:10:41,520
and raised in

5631
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:44,000
so it was really weird

5632
03:10:41,520 --> 03:10:46,800
and that kept us afloat long enough

5633
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:48,799
um we lost 200 retail locations that i

5634
03:10:46,799 --> 03:10:51,199
all single-handedly spent five years

5635
03:10:48,799 --> 03:10:52,959
going like door-to-door getting myself

5636
03:10:51,200 --> 03:10:55,279
um i would just say this is brass and

5637
03:10:52,959 --> 03:10:56,719
unity jewelry yeah the jewelry and

5638
03:10:55,279 --> 03:11:00,560
sunglass company

5639
03:10:56,719 --> 03:11:00,559
and um i started a witch

5640
03:11:00,639 --> 03:11:04,719
it looks like a serious community

5641
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:06,160
i mean sunglasses you do look good in

5642
03:11:04,719 --> 03:11:07,760
them i won't lie to you thank you well

5643
03:11:06,159 --> 03:11:09,200
okay we'll call them deluxe that's those

5644
03:11:07,760 --> 03:11:11,520
are now called the lex [ __ ] the gun or

5645
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:12,880
they're the lux i like it deluxe i'm

5646
03:11:11,520 --> 03:11:15,520
jumping around here but just bear with

5647
03:11:12,879 --> 03:11:17,519
me i i started my doctor suggested art

5648
03:11:15,520 --> 03:11:19,600
therapy dr passi did and that's really

5649
03:11:17,520 --> 03:11:20,880
how the company started i bought beads

5650
03:11:19,600 --> 03:11:22,960
and a pipe cutter and a hammer and a

5651
03:11:20,879 --> 03:11:25,039
drill and i [ __ ] up our kitchen table

5652
03:11:22,959 --> 03:11:26,238
and i taught myself how to build jewelry

5653
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:28,399
because my husband was like you can do

5654
03:11:26,238 --> 03:11:30,238
it go for it so i was like okay he says

5655
03:11:28,398 --> 03:11:32,719
i can believe in me so i guess i can do

5656
03:11:30,238 --> 03:11:33,760
it no idea what i'm doing

5657
03:11:32,719 --> 03:11:35,278
and then

5658
03:11:33,760 --> 03:11:37,279
got to this point

5659
03:11:35,279 --> 03:11:39,120
um you know where covet hit and people

5660
03:11:37,279 --> 03:11:40,479
lost companies and we pivoted and we did

5661
03:11:39,120 --> 03:11:42,000
what we could

5662
03:11:40,478 --> 03:11:44,318
and then

5663
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:46,478
i really started to go downhill

5664
03:11:44,318 --> 03:11:48,879
psychologically i've

5665
03:11:46,478 --> 03:11:52,318
found purpose again with this company

5666
03:11:48,879 --> 03:11:54,398
i found a way to help again i found

5667
03:11:52,318 --> 03:11:55,840
myself again

5668
03:11:54,398 --> 03:11:58,318
and then that was in danger of being

5669
03:11:55,840 --> 03:12:00,960
gone again

5670
03:11:58,318 --> 03:12:02,719
so the company is 2015

5671
03:12:00,959 --> 03:12:05,438
we started i started

5672
03:12:02,719 --> 03:12:07,039
building jewelry in 2015 under like a

5673
03:12:05,439 --> 03:12:08,880
just it was called her wearables and it

5674
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:11,439
was really small and it was just

5675
03:12:08,879 --> 03:12:13,199
i was just trying to make stuff it

5676
03:12:11,439 --> 03:12:14,960
wasn't supposed to be a company and you

5677
03:12:13,200 --> 03:12:17,439
were on a ton of medication throughout

5678
03:12:14,959 --> 03:12:20,559
the whole process

5679
03:12:17,439 --> 03:12:22,720
and my mom being the tenacious truck

5680
03:12:20,559 --> 03:12:24,879

and so she got she just harassed them

5683
03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:30,559
and was like you need to meet my

5684
03:12:28,799 --> 03:12:32,000
daughter yeah so he finally saw the

5685
03:12:30,559 --> 03:12:33,680
picture of you and kevin hart that's

5686
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,799
cool but he just gave me a good piece of

5687
03:12:33,680 --> 03:12:36,238
advice hey if you're gonna make this

5688
03:12:34,799 --> 03:12:37,679
something you can't really if you want

5689
03:12:36,238 --> 03:12:39,680
it to be for everyone you can't call it

5690
03:12:37,680 --> 03:12:40,960
her wearables i was like cool

5691
03:12:39,680 --> 03:12:43,359
and then we drove home that night and

5692
03:12:40,959 --> 03:12:45,438
then he tweeted it out to people wow to

5693
03:12:43,359 --> 03:12:47,600
24 million people this was before he was

5694
03:12:45,439 --> 03:12:49,680
like who is now yeah

5695
03:12:47,600 --> 03:12:50,960
and um that was a giant deal and then my

5696
03:12:49,680 --> 03:12:52,559
husband kind of looked at me and being

5697
03:12:50,959 --> 03:12:54,159
he's so [ __ ] brilliant he looked at

5698
03:12:52,559 --> 03:12:55,760
me goes all right yeah we got to come up

5699
03:12:54,159 --> 03:12:57,119
with that rename let me start thinking

5700
03:12:55,760 --> 03:12:58,238
let me start brainstorming like let's

5701
03:12:57,120 --> 03:12:59,359
make you want to make this real let's

5702
03:12:58,238 --> 03:13:00,799
make this real

5703
03:12:59,359 --> 03:13:02,159
and so we did

5704
03:13:00,799 --> 03:13:03,840
and he was like what do you think about

5705
03:13:02,159 --> 03:13:05,840
like we were doing like grass collective

5706
03:13:03,840 --> 03:13:07,120

03:13:05,840 --> 03:13:08,079
brass in the name

5708
03:13:07,120 --> 03:13:09,680
and then he said what about brass and

5709
03:13:08,079 --> 03:13:11,600
unity you're trying to like unify people

5710
03:13:09,680 --> 03:13:13,200
like why wouldn't you do i'm like

5711
03:13:11,600 --> 03:13:14,640

5712
03:13:13,200 --> 03:13:16,319
it like everything else that's a great

5713
03:13:14,639 --> 03:13:19,039
name well he's a brilliant person it's

5714
03:13:16,318 --> 03:13:20,799

5715
03:13:19,040 --> 03:13:22,880
thing that we had just built and just

5716
03:13:20,799 --> 03:13:24,639

03:16:04,959 --> 03:16:09,599
just withdrawals it was like

5805
03:16:07,840 --> 03:16:10,880
you were at a rock concert and your head

5806
03:16:09,600 --> 03:16:12,960
was banging up and down but you were

5807
03:16:10,879 --> 03:16:14,000
sitting perfectly still

5808
03:16:12,959 --> 03:16:16,398
it was

5809
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:17,920
horrible but you had like a thing to

5810
03:16:16,398 --> 03:16:19,760
look forward to with the sidewalk i had

5811
03:16:17,920 --> 03:16:22,238
a light at the end of the tunnel

5812
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:23,520
and i knew if i got to the light

5813
03:16:22,238 --> 03:16:25,600
what's the worst that's gonna happen

5814
03:16:23,520 --> 03:16:27,439
just get to the light but at that point

5815
03:16:25,600 --> 03:16:28,960
like i again

5816
03:16:27,439 --> 03:16:30,318
i had a son i had a husband i had a

5817
03:16:28,959 --> 03:16:33,278
great company i have a great house i

5818
03:16:30,318 --> 03:16:34,879
have a nice car i have everything

5819
03:16:33,279 --> 03:16:36,640
why did i want to die every minute of

5820
03:16:34,879 --> 03:16:38,559
the day

5821
03:16:36,639 --> 03:16:39,920
i was at that point again

5822
03:16:38,559 --> 03:16:41,039
and i'm like this has got it something's

5823
03:16:39,920 --> 03:16:42,799
got to give

5824
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:44,399
and so i went

5825
03:16:42,799 --> 03:16:46,318
and i got there

5826
03:16:44,398 --> 03:16:48,079
and

5827
03:16:46,318 --> 03:16:48,959
she

5828
03:16:48,079 --> 03:16:51,359
is

5829
03:16:48,959 --> 03:16:51,358
um

5830
03:16:54,159 --> 03:17:00,559
the most intense

5831
03:16:57,120 --> 03:17:00,560
beautiful divine

5832
03:17:00,879 --> 03:17:05,759
deity or entity or

5833
03:17:04,238 --> 03:17:08,879
visualization

5834
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:11,359
whatever you want to deem ayahuasca as

5835
03:17:08,879 --> 03:17:14,799
mama i is real

5836
03:17:11,359 --> 03:17:16,720
and she takes no prisoners

5837
03:17:14,799 --> 03:17:18,079
she shows you exactly what you need to

5838
03:17:16,719 --> 03:17:19,519
see

5839
03:17:18,079 --> 03:17:22,120
to help yourself

5840
03:17:19,520 --> 03:17:24,720
but she does not

5841
03:17:22,120 --> 03:17:26,560
discriminate against

5842
03:17:24,719 --> 03:17:30,318
whether you're ready or not if you've

5843
03:17:26,559 --> 03:17:32,799
ingested it she's coming for you

5844
03:17:30,318 --> 03:17:35,039
she's gonna be either gentle or she's

5845
03:17:32,799 --> 03:17:37,039
gonna beat your ass and sometimes it's

5846
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:40,040
what you need but she does it in a way

5847
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:40,040
that

5848
03:17:40,079 --> 03:17:45,520
is profound

5849
03:17:43,040 --> 03:17:47,920
so what were some memorable profound

5850
03:17:45,520 --> 03:17:50,079
moments for you what uh what what are

5851
03:17:47,920 --> 03:17:54,159
the places it took you

5852
03:17:50,079 --> 03:17:56,559
people had you meet for the first time i

5853
03:17:54,159 --> 03:17:59,200
got to be in a group of people who

5854
03:17:56,559 --> 03:18:01,119
didn't judge me or question my service

5855
03:17:59,200 --> 03:18:02,800
they just respected me

5856
03:18:01,120 --> 03:18:04,800
that was number one

5857
03:18:02,799 --> 03:18:07,039
so that group i lost

5858
03:18:04,799 --> 03:18:08,959
i just found again

5859
03:18:07,040 --> 03:18:10,319
um

5860
03:18:08,959 --> 03:18:12,079
big shocker i was the only woman there

5861
03:18:10,318 --> 03:18:13,359
again

5862
03:18:12,079 --> 03:18:15,680
seems to be the

5863
03:18:13,359 --> 03:18:17,439
the thing for me

5864
03:18:15,680 --> 03:18:18,880
and so i was surrounded by all these

5865
03:18:17,439 --> 03:18:20,639
special operators like these aren't like

5866
03:18:18,879 --> 03:18:22,559
normal soldiers like these guys that i'm

5867
03:18:20,639 --> 03:18:27,199
with are like

5868
03:18:22,559 --> 03:18:29,439
bronze star [ __ ] purple heart just

5869
03:18:27,200 --> 03:18:31,040
the coolest people

5870
03:18:29,439 --> 03:18:33,200
people i've always wanted to be like

5871
03:18:31,040 --> 03:18:35,359
that's my buddy now i can be like those

5872
03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:37,279
are my buddies like those [ __ ]

5873
03:18:35,359 --> 03:18:38,960
will go to bat for me they will bend

5874
03:18:37,279 --> 03:18:41,040
over backwards they will x fill me out

5875
03:18:38,959 --> 03:18:42,478
of anywhere they will take a bullet for

5876
03:18:41,040 --> 03:18:44,560
me

5877
03:18:42,478 --> 03:18:46,478
and these guys welcomed me in in a way i

5878
03:18:44,559 --> 03:18:48,799
didn't i didn't expect so that hit me

5879
03:18:46,478 --> 03:18:50,639
weird right off the get i was nervous

5880
03:18:48,799 --> 03:18:51,920
and now i was just felt at home for a

5881
03:18:50,639 --> 03:18:54,478
minute

5882
03:18:51,920 --> 03:18:56,799
and then when i stepped into ceremony

5883
03:18:54,478 --> 03:18:56,799
um

5884
03:18:57,040 --> 03:19:01,040
the first night because you do you do

5885
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:03,760
three nights over like over like friday

5886
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:06,479
saturday sunday the first night

5887
03:19:03,760 --> 03:19:09,200
i was so nervous and so anxious

5888
03:19:06,478 --> 03:19:11,119
because you go up in ceremony and your

5889
03:19:09,200 --> 03:19:13,439
the shamans come in and they they

5890
03:19:11,120 --> 03:19:14,880
cleanse themselves and then you get

5891
03:19:13,439 --> 03:19:17,520
served the

5892
03:19:14,879 --> 03:19:18,959
ayah individually you go up they give it

5893
03:19:17,520 --> 03:19:20,000
to you you can take your time and pray

5894
03:19:18,959 --> 03:19:21,358
you can do whatever you want then you

5895
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:24,559
drink it

5896
03:19:21,359 --> 03:19:27,520
i was so just like

5897
03:19:24,559 --> 03:19:30,000
i got back to my mat and i sat there

5898
03:19:27,520 --> 03:19:31,520
and i was like trying to keep it in but

5899
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:33,520
i could feel that like

5900
03:19:31,520 --> 03:19:34,560
heat come from my toes all the way up

5901
03:19:33,520 --> 03:19:35,520
and you're like your mouth starts to

5902
03:19:34,559 --> 03:19:36,959
water my

5903
03:19:35,520 --> 03:19:38,479
throat i'm gonna throw up

5904
03:19:36,959 --> 03:19:41,278
and i looked over to griff and i looked

5905
03:19:38,478 --> 03:19:41,278
at bishop and they're like

5906
03:19:41,600 --> 03:19:45,040
swallow it and i was like

5907
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:47,359
okay

5908
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:49,040
and you can't talk or anything

5909
03:19:47,359 --> 03:19:51,200
so i like

5910
03:19:49,040 --> 03:19:53,600
my buddy um we call him the viking or

5911
03:19:51,200 --> 03:19:55,760
soul viking he looks like a viking his

5912
03:19:53,600 --> 03:19:57,120
head's tattooed he's

5913
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:59,600
he's been on the show

5914
03:19:57,120 --> 03:20:01,120
he's so cool he's sitting directly

5915
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:02,800
across like you and i and he can see me

5916
03:20:01,120 --> 03:20:04,880
he's looking at me and i'm throwing up

5917
03:20:02,799 --> 03:20:07,358
and

5918
03:20:04,879 --> 03:20:08,959
and i do it about three times and then

5919
03:20:07,359 --> 03:20:10,000
the last time he just saw me i couldn't

5920
03:20:08,959 --> 03:20:11,839
do it i just

5921
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:13,040
i threw it up

5922
03:20:11,840 --> 03:20:14,799
and so

5923
03:20:13,040 --> 03:20:17,600
i like to think that was her way of

5924
03:20:14,799 --> 03:20:19,840
easing me in so i didn't get like a full

5925
03:20:17,600 --> 03:20:21,439
punch to the face but i gotta let me

5926
03:20:19,840 --> 03:20:23,040
take your hand and show you what i'm

5927
03:20:21,439 --> 03:20:24,800
gonna show you we're gonna make you

5928
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:26,479
better we're gonna take the pain away

5929
03:20:24,799 --> 03:20:28,478
aren't you supposed to eventually throw

5930
03:20:26,478 --> 03:20:30,719
up no matter what it's not supposed to

5931
03:20:28,478 --> 03:20:32,159
some people don't you purge yeah if

5932
03:20:30,719 --> 03:20:33,679
something's happening you're going

5933
03:20:32,159 --> 03:20:35,200
through something yeah you purge but it

5934
03:20:33,680 --> 03:20:37,359
doesn't have to happen but this i mean

5935
03:20:35,200 --> 03:20:39,200
within like the first 20 minutes no

5936
03:20:37,359 --> 03:20:40,318
okay this takes like you got to sit and

5937
03:20:39,200 --> 03:20:42,319
meditate

5938
03:20:40,318 --> 03:20:44,398
for or sit still basically and meditate

5939
03:20:42,318 --> 03:20:46,719
in the pitch black for about 45 minutes

5940
03:20:44,398 --> 03:20:48,079
before the effects even before you even

5941
03:20:46,719 --> 03:20:49,920
feel her

5942
03:20:48,079 --> 03:20:51,920
so it's very

5943
03:20:49,920 --> 03:20:52,799
so here she figured out the right dose

5944
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:54,238
you need

5945
03:20:52,799 --> 03:20:55,358
well because i did the same dose as

5946
03:20:54,238 --> 03:20:56,959
everyone else

5947
03:20:55,359 --> 03:20:59,200
i think it was 20 mils which doesn't

5948
03:20:56,959 --> 03:21:02,079
seem like a lot

5949
03:20:59,200 --> 03:21:03,600
but when you've never done ayatus

5950
03:21:02,079 --> 03:21:05,520
oh my god

5951
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:07,840
so um

5952
03:21:05,520 --> 03:21:09,279
i felt like such a [ __ ] god i felt like

5953
03:21:07,840 --> 03:21:10,960
such a [ __ ]

5954
03:21:09,279 --> 03:21:12,960
okay that was the thought going through

5955
03:21:10,959 --> 03:21:14,959
your mind oh you just [ __ ] it all up

5956
03:21:12,959 --> 03:21:16,959
you ruined it you ruined this again you

5957
03:21:14,959 --> 03:21:18,478
couldn't do this right yeah

5958
03:21:16,959 --> 03:21:19,839
and so

5959
03:21:18,478 --> 03:21:22,318
at that point

5960
03:21:19,840 --> 03:21:24,719
um we we went through the meditation

5961
03:21:22,318 --> 03:21:26,879
part and the shamans were they literally

5962
03:21:24,719 --> 03:21:28,238
sing for like six hours straight so you

5963
03:21:26,879 --> 03:21:30,478
said that you take it and then there's

5964
03:21:28,238 --> 03:21:32,879
just you just you're quietly listening

5965
03:21:30,478 --> 03:21:33,679
to them meditate and you wait and you

5966
03:21:32,879 --> 03:21:35,358
wait

5967
03:21:33,680 --> 03:21:37,439
and you're in pitch black like can't see

5968
03:21:35,359 --> 03:21:39,200
this far in front of your face cool and

5969
03:21:37,439 --> 03:21:40,880
you have a little puke bucket

5970
03:21:39,200 --> 03:21:42,479
and then you have a little light that

5971
03:21:40,879 --> 03:21:43,599
has a red filter on it you have to get

5972
03:21:42,478 --> 03:21:45,199
up to go to the bathroom to get out of

5973
03:21:43,600 --> 03:21:46,880
the you use that so you don't turn

5974
03:21:45,200 --> 03:21:48,239
lights on

5975
03:21:46,879 --> 03:21:50,000
and um

5976
03:21:48,238 --> 03:21:52,398
me i brought like what

5977
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:54,559
no it's just a cool visual of just a

5978
03:21:52,398 --> 03:21:56,318
puke bucket and a little light for the

5979
03:21:54,559 --> 03:21:57,680
like i can imagine these like little

5980
03:21:56,318 --> 03:21:59,359
lights going every once in a while and

5981
03:21:57,680 --> 03:22:01,200
then the rest is just in darkness

5982
03:21:59,359 --> 03:22:02,960
meditating with this

5983
03:22:01,200 --> 03:22:04,960
with the singing

5984
03:22:02,959 --> 03:22:07,039
it's it's so beautiful it's cool i'll

5985
03:22:04,959 --> 03:22:08,000
take you some time because trust me you

5986
03:22:07,040 --> 03:22:08,720

after

6004
03:22:36,959 --> 03:22:40,799
the thing with

6005
03:22:38,318 --> 03:22:42,318
this group is

6006
03:22:40,799 --> 03:22:44,079
there's such

6007
03:22:42,318 --> 03:22:45,920
care

6008
03:22:44,079 --> 03:22:47,920
it's not like go do aya and like you're

6009
03:22:45,920 --> 03:22:49,359
done there's like integration coaches

6010
03:22:47,920 --> 03:22:51,680
and there's like doctors and there's

6011
03:22:49,359 --> 03:22:53,520
like people to make sure that

6012
03:22:51,680 --> 03:22:56,159
you're doing the work because i is just

6013
03:22:53,520 --> 03:22:58,000
this is just the gate now you have to

6014
03:22:56,159 --> 03:22:59,439
take it and you have to implement it

6015
03:22:58,000 --> 03:23:01,359
into your life

6016
03:22:59,439 --> 03:23:02,960
people don't do that though did you do

6017
03:23:01,359 --> 03:23:04,880
uh like integration did you do

6018
03:23:02,959 --> 03:23:07,278
conversations with somebody did you talk

6019
03:23:04,879 --> 03:23:09,438
to you like is there a process to

6020
03:23:07,279 --> 03:23:11,680
because i've uh similar with philosophy

6021
03:23:09,439 --> 03:23:13,279
you mentioned i i've

6022
03:23:11,680 --> 03:23:15,840
as i understand it's exceptionally

6023
03:23:13,279 --> 03:23:18,079
beneficial for when you also do like

6024
03:23:15,840 --> 03:23:20,000
talk therapy like you couple that with

6025
03:23:18,079 --> 03:23:22,079
the integration in some form where you

6026
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:23,600
talk through your experience you talk

6027
03:23:22,079 --> 03:23:25,600
through different things like that that

6028
03:23:23,600 --> 03:23:27,920
seems to be a really you know i need to

6029
03:23:25,600 --> 03:23:29,840
do that more with uh basically every

6030
03:23:27,920 --> 03:23:32,000
substance i take like if i get which

6031
03:23:29,840 --> 03:23:34,960
have been every once in a while known to

6032
03:23:32,000 --> 03:23:37,439
do a bit of vodka or whiskey or whatever

6033
03:23:34,959 --> 03:23:38,879
like do integration the next day

6034
03:23:37,439 --> 03:23:40,159
well what did you learn what did you get

6035
03:23:38,879 --> 03:23:41,679
from that what did you get because you

6036
03:23:40,159 --> 03:23:43,359
you learn a lot but you sometimes kind

6037
03:23:41,680 --> 03:23:45,200
of just move on and you celebrate that

6038
03:23:43,359 --> 03:23:47,279
that happened but like really kind of

6039
03:23:45,200 --> 03:23:48,720
think through it write it down yeah

6040
03:23:47,279 --> 03:23:49,920
that's important because that's what

6041
03:23:48,719 --> 03:23:52,639
this was

6042
03:23:49,920 --> 03:23:53,520
so the first night i'll give like a very

6043
03:23:52,639 --> 03:23:55,199
cause

6044
03:23:53,520 --> 03:23:56,880
trust me we could spend a whole podcast

6045
03:23:55,200 --> 03:23:58,720
on both of the all three of those nights

6046
03:23:56,879 --> 03:24:00,159
but the first night the biggest thing

6047
03:23:58,719 --> 03:24:01,519
that happened for me is i got to see my

6048
03:24:00,159 --> 03:24:03,680
daughter

6049
03:24:01,520 --> 03:24:06,560
which was my first baby

6050
03:24:03,680 --> 03:24:09,040
and so people say well you know blah

6051
03:24:06,559 --> 03:24:10,398
blah blah [ __ ] you that was my daughter

6052
03:24:09,040 --> 03:24:12,479
and i'm very aware it was i'm very

6053
03:24:10,398 --> 03:24:15,199
conscious that it was

6054
03:24:12,478 --> 03:24:16,398
and at that point she just eased me in

6055
03:24:15,200 --> 03:24:18,880
enough

6056
03:24:16,398 --> 03:24:20,398
to let me know and showed me enough that

6057
03:24:18,879 --> 03:24:22,159
this wasn't it

6058
03:24:20,398 --> 03:24:24,398
this wasn't

6059
03:24:22,159 --> 03:24:26,799
the end-all be-all where you are right

6060
03:24:24,398 --> 03:24:28,398
now on this plane on this dimension in

6061
03:24:26,799 --> 03:24:31,119
this life this is

6062
03:24:28,398 --> 03:24:34,478
this is a flip and it is

6063
03:24:31,120 --> 03:24:36,720
it is so minuscule to the big picture

6064
03:24:34,478 --> 03:24:40,079
and so she really did that by she showed

6065
03:24:36,719 --> 03:24:41,840
me just a black and then like a crack

6066
03:24:40,079 --> 03:24:43,200
and then these vibrant colors that i

6067
03:24:41,840 --> 03:24:47,200
can't describe because there aren't

6068
03:24:43,200 --> 03:24:49,040
words alex gray does really great um

6069
03:24:47,200 --> 03:24:50,960
art and that is like been the closest

6070
03:24:49,040 --> 03:24:53,200
thing i've been able to find colors

6071
03:24:50,959 --> 03:24:54,639
um he's a famous uh guy who does

6072
03:24:53,200 --> 03:24:55,680
ayahuasca

6073
03:24:54,639 --> 03:24:57,439
and

6074
03:24:55,680 --> 03:24:58,960
he's an artist i think he's got stuff in

6075
03:24:57,439 --> 03:25:01,200
new york as well

6076
03:24:58,959 --> 03:25:03,438
but um

6077
03:25:01,200 --> 03:25:05,840
she just she eased me in

6078
03:25:03,439 --> 03:25:08,559
and gave me some relief

6079
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:10,079
and showed me enough that i could go

6080
03:25:08,559 --> 03:25:12,559
i could wake up the next day and not

6081
03:25:10,079 --> 03:25:14,559
want to die the next day

6082
03:25:12,559 --> 03:25:15,760
and so what heroic hearts did because

6083
03:25:14,559 --> 03:25:18,159
they gave us all these journals they're

6084
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:19,359
like you know the next day you kind of

6085
03:25:18,159 --> 03:25:20,639
wake up

6086
03:25:19,359 --> 03:25:21,760
and you

6087
03:25:20,639 --> 03:25:23,760
you do

6088
03:25:21,760 --> 03:25:25,680
a meet like a meeting you do like a

6089
03:25:23,760 --> 03:25:26,639
circle all of us sit in a room and talk

6090
03:25:25,680 --> 03:25:27,680
about what just happened the night

6091
03:25:26,639 --> 03:25:29,439
before

6092
03:25:27,680 --> 03:25:31,520
people are crying and people are quiet

6093
03:25:29,439 --> 03:25:33,200
and you just listen and that's what you

6094
03:25:31,520 --> 03:25:35,520
do and

6095
03:25:33,200 --> 03:25:36,880
then you write on your free time so

6096
03:25:35,520 --> 03:25:38,079
after that it's like up to you what you

6097
03:25:36,879 --> 03:25:40,559
want to do do you want to just go walk

6098
03:25:38,079 --> 03:25:43,279
in the woods well i chose to go find a

6099
03:25:40,559 --> 03:25:44,719
fence post and lie on it for an hour

6100
03:25:43,279 --> 03:25:47,200
i'm not kidding i lied there and stared

6101
03:25:44,719 --> 03:25:48,478
up at these two eagles that were just in

6102
03:25:47,200 --> 03:25:49,439
like the i'll tell you where we were

6103
03:25:48,478 --> 03:25:52,959
after and you look you'll be like oh

6104
03:25:49,439 --> 03:25:54,800
okay i get it and then i found a forest

6105
03:25:52,959 --> 03:25:57,278
and i just walked up with my book

6106
03:25:54,799 --> 03:25:57,278
and i just

6107
03:25:57,840 --> 03:26:01,680
lied there

6108
03:25:59,200 --> 03:26:03,359
for hours

6109
03:26:01,680 --> 03:26:05,600
and then she all of a sudden started

6110
03:26:03,359 --> 03:26:07,359
giving me what you call your downloads

6111
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:08,559
so the stuff you learn

6112
03:26:07,359 --> 03:26:09,840
the stuff that you were all of a sudden

6113
03:26:08,559 --> 03:26:11,680
you're remembering and these messages

6114
03:26:09,840 --> 03:26:13,120
that come through and that's what this

6115
03:26:11,680 --> 03:26:17,279
is

6116
03:26:13,120 --> 03:26:17,279
what kind of things are we talking about

6117
03:26:17,359 --> 03:26:21,200
so my biggest thing that she tried to

6118
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:22,479
reiterate to me at the beginning of

6119
03:26:21,200 --> 03:26:24,640
that first night was that i don't

6120
03:26:22,478 --> 03:26:26,959
breathe

6121
03:26:24,639 --> 03:26:29,278
i just

6122
03:26:26,959 --> 03:26:31,679
i don't

6123
03:26:29,279 --> 03:26:34,319
i don't breathe i don't [ __ ] breathe

6124
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:35,200
at all i just one thing the next thing

6125
03:26:34,318 --> 03:26:36,959
the next thing the next thing the next

6126
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:38,880
thing just to survive i don't take a

6127
03:26:36,959 --> 03:26:40,398
minute and breathe

6128
03:26:38,879 --> 03:26:41,920
and so she made

6129
03:26:40,398 --> 03:26:43,439
when i say she and i say it because it's

6130
03:26:41,920 --> 03:26:44,719
hard for people to understand but i

6131
03:26:43,439 --> 03:26:46,880
showed this to my husband i showed it to

6132
03:26:44,719 --> 03:26:48,398
my doctors and they're like uh [ __ ]

6133
03:26:46,879 --> 03:26:49,839
that's not you you don't write like that

6134
03:26:48,398 --> 03:26:51,680
you don't talk like that

6135
03:26:49,840 --> 03:26:54,478
so like you can flip through it

6136
03:26:51,680 --> 03:26:54,479
but it was like

6137
03:26:56,000 --> 03:26:59,120

6188
03:29:03,200 --> 03:29:07,359
a walk by myself

6189
03:29:05,279 --> 03:29:09,520
i would just hear like

6190
03:29:07,359 --> 03:29:10,720
take this like just almost like as if a

6191
03:29:09,520 --> 03:29:12,079
voice was standing there like you need

6192
03:29:10,719 --> 03:29:14,159
this take it take it with you and keep

6193
03:29:12,079 --> 03:29:16,318
it in your book keep it

6194
03:29:14,159 --> 03:29:18,318
ground you

6195
03:29:16,318 --> 03:29:20,799
and it just goes off this is from there

6196
03:29:18,318 --> 03:29:23,039
yeah it's cool to have

6197
03:29:20,799 --> 03:29:24,879
sort of it's almost like time travel

6198
03:29:23,040 --> 03:29:27,520
i have poppies from france too when i

6199
03:29:24,879 --> 03:29:29,839
did uh i did a 75th anniversary d-day

6200
03:29:27,520 --> 03:29:31,840
ride in france where we rode 600

6201
03:29:29,840 --> 03:29:34,000
kilometers on our road bikes for charity

6202
03:29:31,840 --> 03:29:36,799
and we landed on the beaches of juno on

6203
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:37,840
the 75th and we got to go buy the poppy

6204
03:29:36,799 --> 03:29:40,478
fields

6205
03:29:37,840 --> 03:29:42,960
and i'm like covered in poppies

6206
03:29:40,478 --> 03:29:45,119
and i i have some in a in a book i don't

6207
03:29:42,959 --> 03:29:46,879
know why i do that i just

6208
03:29:45,120 --> 03:29:48,720
i do that

6209
03:29:46,879 --> 03:29:50,398
that's cool because like these are your

6210
03:29:48,719 --> 03:29:52,639
thoughts and those are the physical

6211
03:29:50,398 --> 03:29:54,959
items as it really helps transport to

6212
03:29:52,639 --> 03:29:58,639
that place somehow

6213
03:29:54,959 --> 03:29:58,639
let the light in let her in

6214
03:30:00,879 --> 03:30:05,759
and she would show me these visuals so

6215
03:30:02,799 --> 03:30:05,759
my drawings are just like

6216
03:30:07,920 --> 03:30:14,559
yeah there's drawings here

6217
03:30:10,639 --> 03:30:16,079
and you're seeing this stuff oh yeah

6218
03:30:14,559 --> 03:30:18,159
i can't draw either so that's why

6219
03:30:16,079 --> 03:30:20,238
they're so i wish i could draw because

6220
03:30:18,159 --> 03:30:21,039
if only i could translate what i could

6221
03:30:20,238 --> 03:30:24,318
see

6222
03:30:21,040 --> 03:30:27,040
visually onto paper

6223
03:30:24,318 --> 03:30:31,639
and you're talking to her yeah

6224
03:30:27,040 --> 03:30:31,640
it's time i'm here to listen

6225
03:30:31,840 --> 03:30:36,079
is this

6226
03:30:33,520 --> 03:30:37,359
mama aya yeah we call her mama aya mama

6227
03:30:36,079 --> 03:30:40,799
aya

6228
03:30:37,359 --> 03:30:42,159
mama i see what who who are you seeing

6229
03:30:40,799 --> 03:30:44,559
is this a woman

6230
03:30:42,159 --> 03:30:47,119
so for me at first it was just eyes

6231
03:30:44,559 --> 03:30:49,600
floating in the sky these unbelievably

6232
03:30:47,120 --> 03:30:51,359
gorgeous beautiful eyes that i and i was

6233
03:30:49,600 --> 03:30:52,960
like literally looking up at the top of

6234
03:30:51,359 --> 03:30:54,720
the year and i kept going to myself is

6235
03:30:52,959 --> 03:30:56,959
that anyone else seeing this

6236
03:30:54,719 --> 03:30:58,879
there's eyes in the sky

6237
03:30:56,959 --> 03:31:00,000
yeah

6238
03:30:58,879 --> 03:31:02,318
and so

6239
03:31:00,000 --> 03:31:04,478
there's these eyes floating and they

6240
03:31:02,318 --> 03:31:06,238
just kept looking at me and i remember

6241
03:31:04,478 --> 03:31:07,519
when i kept telling myself like oh don't

6242
03:31:06,238 --> 03:31:09,439
worry there's nothing there she would

6243
03:31:07,520 --> 03:31:12,479
get angry

6244
03:31:09,439 --> 03:31:13,520
i'm right here pay attention to me and

6245
03:31:12,478 --> 03:31:16,159
i'd be like

6246
03:31:13,520 --> 03:31:18,159
okay like forceful

6247
03:31:16,159 --> 03:31:20,238
like very forceful so at first it was

6248
03:31:18,159 --> 03:31:23,439
just the eyes

6249
03:31:20,238 --> 03:31:23,439
the second night

6250
03:31:23,760 --> 03:31:27,840
is i'm crazy when i say this

6251
03:31:30,719 --> 03:31:33,438
great that's gonna be my clipping down

6252
03:31:32,318 --> 03:31:35,600
crazy

6253
03:31:33,439 --> 03:31:38,398
it's what i do when i get uncomfortable

6254
03:31:35,600 --> 03:31:41,520
i do weird hand gestures and movements

6255
03:31:38,398 --> 03:31:43,199
um voices i like it yeah i do yeah

6256
03:31:41,520 --> 03:31:44,560
uh you would hate to be in my office

6257
03:31:43,200 --> 03:31:46,079
because most of the day it's just

6258
03:31:44,559 --> 03:31:48,238
[Music]

6259
03:31:46,079 --> 03:31:51,520
this i love it weird lunges and

6260
03:31:48,238 --> 03:31:54,559
uncomfortable moments um she

6261
03:31:51,520 --> 03:31:56,479
turned me into a wolf

6262
03:31:54,559 --> 03:32:00,799
i i know i said it out loud i said i

6263
03:31:56,478 --> 03:32:04,559
hear it i said it yeah head to toe

6264
03:32:00,799 --> 03:32:06,879
and her takeaway for me was

6265
03:32:04,559 --> 03:32:08,478
i'm trying to be this pack leader i'm

6266
03:32:06,879 --> 03:32:10,639
trying to be this leader in my life i'm

6267
03:32:08,478 --> 03:32:13,599
trying to do these things but i'm going

6268
03:32:10,639 --> 03:32:15,119
about them the whole wrong way

6269
03:32:13,600 --> 03:32:17,279
so like when the shamans call you up to

6270
03:32:15,120 --> 03:32:18,880
do their special prayer over you

6271
03:32:17,279 --> 03:32:20,159
you go up you don't touch them they

6272
03:32:18,879 --> 03:32:22,000
flash their little light you see the

6273
03:32:20,159 --> 03:32:23,760
little light spot you walk to the light

6274
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:25,760
you sit down on the light

6275
03:32:23,760 --> 03:32:27,439
and then my shaman he's so funny because

6276
03:32:25,760 --> 03:32:28,719
he's got this great tone in his voice he

6277
03:32:27,439 --> 03:32:31,200
goes

6278
03:32:28,719 --> 03:32:32,478
uh how you doing kelsey

6279
03:32:31,200 --> 03:32:33,359
and i'm like

6280
03:32:32,478 --> 03:32:34,159
um

6281
03:32:33,359 --> 03:32:34,880
so

6282
03:32:34,159 --> 03:32:38,000
hi

6283
03:32:34,879 --> 03:32:39,358
yeah i have a problem um i'm a wolf and

6284
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:41,439
i need it to stop

6285
03:32:39,359 --> 03:32:43,520
and he'd be like don't you worry girl i

6286
03:32:41,439 --> 03:32:45,760
got you you ready and i was like

6287
03:32:43,520 --> 03:32:47,359
uh-huh uh-huh and so i'm sitting there

6288
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:48,159
cross-legged i've got my palms out like

6289
03:32:47,359 --> 03:32:49,680
this

6290
03:32:48,159 --> 03:32:51,520
and i had a really traumatic shoulder

6291
03:32:49,680 --> 03:32:53,040
injury so i don't just sit slanted like

6292
03:32:51,520 --> 03:32:54,479
this my shoulders actually permanently

6293
03:32:53,040 --> 03:32:56,640
detached and no one in the world will

6294
03:32:54,478 --> 03:32:58,879
touch it or fix it my collarbone comes

6295
03:32:56,639 --> 03:33:01,680
out my back here nice and i don't have

6296
03:32:58,879 --> 03:33:04,159
any collarbone here okay so nobody will

6297
03:33:01,680 --> 03:33:05,760
fix it no one will touch it even i've

6298
03:33:04,159 --> 03:33:07,039
had specialists i've had surgeries no

6299
03:33:05,760 --> 03:33:08,639
one will do anything with it so i'm

6300
03:33:07,040 --> 03:33:10,399
permanently

6301
03:33:08,639 --> 03:33:11,519
down and forward so i

6302
03:33:10,398 --> 03:33:13,278
slouch

6303
03:33:11,520 --> 03:33:14,720
um

6304
03:33:13,279 --> 03:33:17,040
it's horrible

6305
03:33:14,719 --> 03:33:18,318
so before i well functionally too oh

6306
03:33:17,040 --> 03:33:20,800
there's nothing i can't do a pull-up

6307
03:33:18,318 --> 03:33:22,238
anymore oh

6308
03:33:20,799 --> 03:33:23,679
so weak

6309
03:33:22,238 --> 03:33:25,039
oh wow oh you should i'll show you how

6310
03:33:23,680 --> 03:33:26,720
to do a push-up after you'll [ __ ]

6311
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:29,200
throw up an embarrassment

6312
03:33:26,719 --> 03:33:31,438
yeah it's bad so before i though chronic

6313
03:33:29,200 --> 03:33:33,040
pain like had to drink a bottle of cbd

6314
03:33:31,439 --> 03:33:35,359
every day just the pain is so bad

6315
03:33:33,040 --> 03:33:37,840
because the trauma in it was so bad the

6316
03:33:35,359 --> 03:33:39,840
surgery went wrong

6317
03:33:37,840 --> 03:33:41,920
the collarbone dissipated and no longer

6318
03:33:39,840 --> 03:33:43,840
exists like there's just and they're not

6319
03:33:41,920 --> 03:33:45,439
sure how i lift things with it and do

6320
03:33:43,840 --> 03:33:47,920
stuff with it it's like over

6321
03:33:45,439 --> 03:33:50,079
compensation everywhere like my

6322
03:33:47,920 --> 03:33:52,799
the my back fli like um

6323
03:33:50,079 --> 03:33:54,959
my trap my scapula like flares out where

6324
03:33:52,799 --> 03:33:57,358
it's i'm all messed up from it and so i

6325
03:33:54,959 --> 03:33:58,079
was in chronic pain so he's praying over

6326
03:33:57,359 --> 03:34:00,720
me

6327
03:33:58,079 --> 03:34:02,159
and all of a sudden all i feel is this

6328
03:34:00,719 --> 03:34:03,119
arm just start

6329
03:34:02,159 --> 03:34:05,039
just

6330
03:34:03,120 --> 03:34:07,439
[ __ ] vibrating and my hair is really

6331
03:34:05,040 --> 03:34:10,239
long and i feel somebody grab the back

6332
03:34:07,439 --> 03:34:11,760
of my ponytail and snap my head back

6333
03:34:10,238 --> 03:34:13,840
like this

6334
03:34:11,760 --> 03:34:17,040
and it felt like something was coming

6335
03:34:13,840 --> 03:34:18,639
out of my throat like being pulled

6336
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:20,640
out of me

6337
03:34:18,639 --> 03:34:21,840
and the takeaway that i end up in the

6338
03:34:20,639 --> 03:34:23,519
whole the rest of the night there was a

6339
03:34:21,840 --> 03:34:25,760
million other things but the takeaway

6340
03:34:23,520 --> 03:34:25,760
was

6341
03:34:27,359 --> 03:34:33,359
you no longer need to bite you may only

6342
03:34:30,959 --> 03:34:35,119
show your teeth you can be the leader

6343
03:34:33,359 --> 03:34:37,680
that you want to be

6344
03:34:35,120 --> 03:34:39,439
you do not always have to

6345
03:34:37,680 --> 03:34:41,359
be the traditional type of leader you

6346
03:34:39,439 --> 03:34:44,000
can be in the back of the pack you have

6347
03:34:41,359 --> 03:34:46,720
to watch the rest around you

6348
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:49,279
be mindful of those around you instead

6349
03:34:46,719 --> 03:34:51,039
of just being up front be

6350
03:34:49,279 --> 03:34:52,800
be behind as well make sure that

6351
03:34:51,040 --> 03:34:54,319
everything that you're doing is all

6352
03:34:52,799 --> 03:34:56,079
being looked after

6353
03:34:54,318 --> 03:34:57,600
because my thing was i will rip your

6354
03:34:56,079 --> 03:34:59,520
[ __ ] head off if you just say the

6355
03:34:57,600 --> 03:35:01,279
wrong thing to me before

6356
03:34:59,520 --> 03:35:03,520
the whole thing was you can just show

6357
03:35:01,279 --> 03:35:05,439
your teeth and that is more than enough

6358
03:35:03,520 --> 03:35:07,359
stop trying to be

6359
03:35:05,439 --> 03:35:09,120
stop trying to overcompensate you don't

6360
03:35:07,359 --> 03:35:11,120
need to do that any longer

6361
03:35:09,120 --> 03:35:13,439
and then i had this weird astral

6362
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:15,920
projection thing happen

6363
03:35:13,439 --> 03:35:18,159
like where i was in my house

6364
03:35:15,920 --> 03:35:19,760
and there were these flyers all over my

6365
03:35:18,159 --> 03:35:22,879
husband and my son

6366
03:35:19,760 --> 03:35:26,079
and like i went ham on them i like

6367
03:35:22,879 --> 03:35:27,599
shredded them to pieces like i was this

6368
03:35:26,079 --> 03:35:28,799
protector

6369
03:35:27,600 --> 03:35:30,559
and

6370
03:35:28,799 --> 03:35:32,159
it's crazy because the guys told me

6371
03:35:30,559 --> 03:35:34,719
after like someone would be like

6372
03:35:32,159 --> 03:35:36,159
there were flyers all over you the whole

6373
03:35:34,719 --> 03:35:38,238
night they were just all over you and

6374
03:35:36,159 --> 03:35:39,760
i'm like i was snarling when i was

6375
03:35:38,238 --> 03:35:40,719
sitting there like the shaman had to be

6376
03:35:39,760 --> 03:35:43,120
like

6377
03:35:40,719 --> 03:35:45,599
i need you to try to calm your breathing

6378
03:35:43,120 --> 03:35:48,079
after i could but before like i was like

6379
03:35:45,600 --> 03:35:50,559
attacking things beside me

6380
03:35:48,079 --> 03:35:51,520
that people could see and i could see

6381
03:35:50,559 --> 03:35:52,799
but

6382
03:35:51,520 --> 03:35:54,960
couldn't wrap my brain around that they

6383
03:35:52,799 --> 03:35:56,799
were real like it was

6384
03:35:54,959 --> 03:35:59,278
[ __ ] weird

6385
03:35:56,799 --> 03:36:00,478
this is crazy man that's day two that's

6386
03:35:59,279 --> 03:36:03,120
day two

6387
03:36:00,478 --> 03:36:06,478
and so what's so what's the big takeaway

6388
03:36:03,120 --> 03:36:07,920
there my takeaway was i needed to be

6389
03:36:06,478 --> 03:36:09,840
i needed to

6390
03:36:07,920 --> 03:36:11,920
stop trying to

6391
03:36:09,840 --> 03:36:14,880
stop trying to push everything too hard

6392
03:36:11,920 --> 03:36:17,200
stop trying to force everything it's all

6393
03:36:14,879 --> 03:36:18,559
going to come it's all going to happen

6394
03:36:17,200 --> 03:36:21,680
but you are

6395
03:36:18,559 --> 03:36:23,439
you are too aggressive you are too

6396
03:36:21,680 --> 03:36:26,000
you're trying so hard that you're

6397
03:36:23,439 --> 03:36:26,880
missing you're missing everything else

6398
03:36:26,000 --> 03:36:28,639
got it

6399
03:36:26,879 --> 03:36:32,478
that's just uh trying to be a better

6400
03:36:28,639 --> 03:36:32,478
human kind of thing right

6401
03:36:32,559 --> 03:36:36,879
this is this is getting intense

6402
03:36:35,040 --> 03:36:39,680
aggressive

6403
03:36:36,879 --> 03:36:42,398
yeah i get to grasp

6404
03:36:39,680 --> 03:36:44,479
i mean there's love and light still it

6405
03:36:42,398 --> 03:36:46,238
gets loving light

6406
03:36:44,478 --> 03:36:48,478
love and light the warrior within is

6407
03:36:46,238 --> 03:36:51,920
calm

6408
03:36:48,478 --> 03:36:53,199
she will test you daily show her respect

6409
03:36:51,920 --> 03:36:55,200
so that's what i mean you've read my

6410
03:36:53,200 --> 03:36:56,960
book you know i don't write like that

6411
03:36:55,200 --> 03:36:59,279
yeah this is strange

6412
03:36:56,959 --> 03:37:00,478
see god you get it

6413
03:36:59,279 --> 03:37:02,319
because people don't understand what i

6414
03:37:00,478 --> 03:37:05,039
say i didn't

6415
03:37:02,318 --> 03:37:07,600
i don't feel like i wrote that i feel

6416
03:37:05,040 --> 03:37:10,080
like she gave me like i re reread this

6417
03:37:07,600 --> 03:37:12,640
all of the time

6418
03:37:10,079 --> 03:37:13,760
so i i wonder i mean well not obviously

6419
03:37:12,639 --> 03:37:16,478
but

6420
03:37:13,760 --> 03:37:18,159
this is somehow part of you i think it's

6421
03:37:16,478 --> 03:37:20,398
a part of me obviously reconnect

6422
03:37:18,159 --> 03:37:22,799
reconnecting you somehow to that part it

6423
03:37:20,398 --> 03:37:24,478
kind of is incredible to think of what

6424
03:37:22,799 --> 03:37:26,719
are the things that are part of us that

6425
03:37:24,478 --> 03:37:28,639
we haven't really explored you know and

6426
03:37:26,719 --> 03:37:31,438
well there's so many

6427
03:37:28,639 --> 03:37:34,238
we just get nature to connect to her

6428
03:37:31,439 --> 03:37:36,960
feel her flow through them

6429
03:37:34,238 --> 03:37:40,238
use them for the strength for each day

6430
03:37:36,959 --> 03:37:43,039
and your challenge will present itself

6431
03:37:40,238 --> 03:37:44,799
love light breathe

6432
03:37:43,040 --> 03:37:46,720
sorry i have too much hair

6433
03:37:44,799 --> 03:37:50,159
never enough i used to have long hair

6434
03:37:46,719 --> 03:37:52,398
what about day three so day three is the

6435
03:37:50,159 --> 03:37:55,039
the stuff i talked about on jocko

6436
03:37:52,398 --> 03:37:57,039
when i got taken over to the other side

6437
03:37:55,040 --> 03:37:59,040
i almost missed that night too

6438
03:37:57,040 --> 03:38:02,239
i almost missed that ceremony

6439
03:37:59,040 --> 03:38:03,760
i got a false positive on my covet test

6440
03:38:02,238 --> 03:38:05,760
and i got a call

6441
03:38:03,760 --> 03:38:08,079
from the medical clinic that night

6442
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:10,559
being like you need to come in you got a

6443
03:38:08,079 --> 03:38:12,799
false positive on your kova test and

6444
03:38:10,559 --> 03:38:14,159
if you're gonna travel you have to

6445
03:38:12,799 --> 03:38:16,478
we've got to figure this out you got to

6446
03:38:14,159 --> 03:38:18,238
come do blood work you got to come do

6447
03:38:16,478 --> 03:38:19,599
you know whatever it is you need to do

6448
03:38:18,238 --> 03:38:23,119
if you want to get home but you got to

6449
03:38:19,600 --> 03:38:24,318
come do something and so

6450
03:38:23,120 --> 03:38:27,520
i didn't think i was going to be in

6451
03:38:24,318 --> 03:38:28,559
ceremony i had to leave so i left

6452
03:38:27,520 --> 03:38:30,319
and

6453
03:38:28,559 --> 03:38:32,959
you know

6454
03:38:30,318 --> 03:38:35,359
they waited

6455
03:38:32,959 --> 03:38:36,719
they waited for me

6456
03:38:35,359 --> 03:38:38,880
and so

6457
03:38:36,719 --> 03:38:41,198
i think the biggest takeaway from all of

6458
03:38:38,879 --> 03:38:43,278
this for me was

6459
03:38:41,199 --> 03:38:47,120
this isn't it it

6460
03:38:43,279 --> 03:38:49,279
this isn't everything this isn't

6461
03:38:47,120 --> 03:38:51,279
the end-all be-all

6462
03:38:49,279 --> 03:38:53,680
you can fight through this this is

6463
03:38:51,279 --> 03:38:57,120
possible it's gonna take work it's gonna

6464
03:38:53,680 --> 03:38:58,159
be [ __ ] hard it's worth it though

6465
03:38:57,120 --> 03:39:00,560
and if you just keep going the right

6466
03:38:58,159 --> 03:39:04,719
direction everything that i wrote down

6467
03:39:00,559 --> 03:39:06,799
everything every goal it'll happen

6468
03:39:04,719 --> 03:39:09,278
what about love

6469
03:39:06,799 --> 03:39:12,478
what about love

6470
03:39:09,279 --> 03:39:15,760
tell me about your husband okay

6471
03:39:12,478 --> 03:39:18,639
what role did he play in your life

6472
03:39:15,760 --> 03:39:21,199
the most pivotal role he kept me alive

6473
03:39:18,639 --> 03:39:22,959
and made me feel worthy enough to

6474
03:39:21,199 --> 03:39:24,880
until i knew that i was worthy enough to

6475
03:39:22,959 --> 03:39:26,478
be alive

6476
03:39:24,879 --> 03:39:29,438
can you dissect that a little bit like

6477
03:39:26,478 --> 03:39:30,959
what i mean what role does love play in

6478
03:39:29,439 --> 03:39:33,760
the human condition

6479
03:39:30,959 --> 03:39:36,959
i think love is the only reason that we

6480
03:39:33,760 --> 03:39:40,478
haven't destroyed ourselves

6481
03:39:36,959 --> 03:39:43,039
i mean we humans in general yes i think

6482
03:39:40,478 --> 03:39:45,278
there is a subset of people where

6483
03:39:43,040 --> 03:39:47,279
love will always be

6484
03:39:45,279 --> 03:39:49,439
you know love conquers all you know but

6485
03:39:47,279 --> 03:39:52,000
that's not always the reality

6486
03:39:49,439 --> 03:39:54,079
the reality is life is messy and

6487
03:39:52,000 --> 03:39:55,760
humans are messy

6488
03:39:54,079 --> 03:39:57,279
and the way we choose to deal with

6489
03:39:55,760 --> 03:39:59,199
things are messy and complicated and

6490
03:39:57,279 --> 03:40:02,319
difficult but

6491
03:39:59,199 --> 03:40:05,600
at the root of all good is love i think

6492
03:40:02,318 --> 03:40:07,920
and for me i was fortunate enough to

6493
03:40:05,600 --> 03:40:08,960
meet my husband

6494
03:40:07,920 --> 03:40:10,478
through

6495
03:40:08,959 --> 03:40:12,159
a friend

6496
03:40:10,478 --> 03:40:14,238
would you listen to that podcast so i

6497
03:40:12,159 --> 03:40:15,760
don't know that we need to

6498
03:40:14,238 --> 03:40:19,039
unless you really want to go into that

6499
03:40:15,760 --> 03:40:20,398
story again how i met my husband well i

6500
03:40:19,040 --> 03:40:21,520
the only part of that story i like

6501
03:40:20,398 --> 03:40:23,119
people should just go listen to the

6502
03:40:21,520 --> 03:40:25,439
jocko podcast how you made them

6503
03:40:23,120 --> 03:40:27,359
uncomfortable i love it i well okay so

6504
03:40:25,439 --> 03:40:28,800
how it works let me explain in the super

6505
03:40:27,359 --> 03:40:30,479
cross and motocross industry it's really

6506
03:40:28,799 --> 03:40:32,000
small the people who are professional

6507
03:40:30,478 --> 03:40:34,639
there's it's a small subset of people

6508
03:40:32,000 --> 03:40:36,079
it's kind of like formula one 21 cars

6509
03:40:34,639 --> 03:40:38,159
that's what there is that's the amount

6510
03:40:36,079 --> 03:40:40,639
of riders and we should say your husband

6511
03:40:38,159 --> 03:40:42,159
is uh as a motocross guy my husband was

6512
03:40:40,639 --> 03:40:45,439
a professional supercross and motocross

6513
03:40:42,159 --> 03:40:46,398
racer um for his whole life and

6514
03:40:45,439 --> 03:40:48,720
he

6515
03:40:46,398 --> 03:40:51,039
raced for kawasaki and suzuki he lived

6516
03:40:48,719 --> 03:40:52,719
in california and raced still down there

6517
03:40:51,040 --> 03:40:54,080
and when i met him i met him at the tail

6518
03:40:52,719 --> 03:40:55,358
end of his career

6519
03:40:54,079 --> 03:40:58,159
and so

6520
03:40:55,359 --> 03:40:59,279
i went to montreal with a friend of mine

6521
03:40:58,159 --> 03:41:01,359
to see

6522
03:40:59,279 --> 03:41:03,760
somebody that i was currently sleeping

6523
03:41:01,359 --> 03:41:05,199
with who was a friend of mine

6524
03:41:03,760 --> 03:41:06,800
and

6525
03:41:05,199 --> 03:41:09,600
end up

6526
03:41:06,799 --> 03:41:12,238
meeting brady instead yeah and the funny

6527
03:41:09,600 --> 03:41:14,238
moment in jacob's was saying that i was

6528
03:41:12,238 --> 03:41:16,398
[ __ ] him instead of just sleeping

6529
03:41:14,238 --> 03:41:18,879
with him and then jocko's face exploded

6530
03:41:16,398 --> 03:41:20,879
and jocko was like oh sleeping so like

6531
03:41:18,879 --> 03:41:23,039
he was he was trying to get details of

6532
03:41:20,879 --> 03:41:24,799
the sleeping quarters that you're he was

6533
03:41:23,040 --> 03:41:26,720
trying to get you to define as a good

6534
03:41:24,799 --> 03:41:29,289
interviewer would oh sleeping okay and

6535
03:41:26,719 --> 03:41:31,039
then you're like it's [ __ ] jocko

6536
03:41:29,290 --> 03:41:32,960
[Laughter]

6537
03:41:31,040 --> 03:41:35,120
or something like that that's great

6538
03:41:32,959 --> 03:41:37,599
it was great but that's true because in

6539
03:41:35,120 --> 03:41:41,279
that industry it's like we it's small we

6540
03:41:37,600 --> 03:41:42,880
all share trust me this is what it is

6541
03:41:41,279 --> 03:41:46,479
anyway so i met him there and he had

6542
03:41:42,879 --> 03:41:48,478
broken his wrist real really bad and um

6543
03:41:46,478 --> 03:41:51,599
i was this was before i deployed

6544
03:41:48,478 --> 03:41:54,000
so i met him and i we stayed in touch

6545
03:41:51,600 --> 03:41:56,159
and just became friends and just texted

6546
03:41:54,000 --> 03:41:57,439
that was it nothing weird and um i was

6547
03:41:56,159 --> 03:41:58,559
deploying though

6548
03:41:57,439 --> 03:42:00,000
so

6549
03:41:58,559 --> 03:42:01,278
we just agreed you know we'd be friends

6550
03:42:00,000 --> 03:42:03,760
we weren't actually talking about

6551
03:42:01,279 --> 03:42:06,960
anything romantically at all

6552
03:42:03,760 --> 03:42:08,719
and then uh i deployed and we got

6553
03:42:06,959 --> 03:42:10,398
talking and to know each other a little

6554
03:42:08,719 --> 03:42:12,238
more a little more

6555
03:42:10,398 --> 03:42:13,760
and then we decided that we liked each

6556
03:42:12,238 --> 03:42:16,000
other and we wanted to try to give it at

6557
03:42:13,760 --> 03:42:17,600
least a semi shot and so when i got home

6558
03:42:16,000 --> 03:42:20,478
from afghanistan

6559
03:42:17,600 --> 03:42:23,840
i went and watched him race

6560
03:42:20,478 --> 03:42:26,318
his last one of his last two races that

6561
03:42:23,840 --> 03:42:28,478
he did professionally before he retired

6562
03:42:26,318 --> 03:42:29,600
excuse me and it was a montreal when was

6563
03:42:28,478 --> 03:42:31,278
in vegas

6564
03:42:29,600 --> 03:42:32,800
and

6565
03:42:31,279 --> 03:42:34,159
i hadn't seen him

6566
03:42:32,799 --> 03:42:36,318
and he didn't really

6567
03:42:34,159 --> 03:42:38,559
know me we didn't really know each other

6568
03:42:36,318 --> 03:42:40,318
we you know we met i slept in the bed

6569
03:42:38,559 --> 03:42:41,359
beside him because my girlfriend didn't

6570
03:42:40,318 --> 03:42:43,119
want to get in trouble from her

6571
03:42:41,359 --> 03:42:44,720
boyfriend from sleeping beside a random

6572
03:42:43,120 --> 03:42:48,319
dude

6573
03:42:44,719 --> 03:42:51,278
and then um yeah we just we we started

6574
03:42:48,318 --> 03:42:51,278
dating and

6575
03:42:51,520 --> 03:42:56,238
he really slowly became my rock and

6576
03:42:53,840 --> 03:42:59,439
he understands trauma he had some stuff

6577
03:42:56,238 --> 03:43:00,719
happen in his life in his family that

6578
03:42:59,439 --> 03:43:03,359
he went through a lot of therapy he went

6579
03:43:00,719 --> 03:43:05,519
through a lot of [ __ ] he went he saw

6580
03:43:03,359 --> 03:43:07,439
what traumatic situations can do to a

6581
03:43:05,520 --> 03:43:09,199
family and to people and those that are

6582
03:43:07,439 --> 03:43:11,120
suffering with it

6583
03:43:09,199 --> 03:43:12,720
and so he was well equipped

6584
03:43:11,120 --> 03:43:14,960
to handle me

6585
03:43:12,719 --> 03:43:16,719
um thankfully

6586
03:43:14,959 --> 03:43:18,000
and it got to a point where we were

6587
03:43:16,719 --> 03:43:19,198
doing the long distance back and forth

6588
03:43:18,000 --> 03:43:20,478
back and forth and back and forth and i

6589
03:43:19,199 --> 03:43:22,479
finally got the call that i was going to

6590
03:43:20,478 --> 03:43:24,639
be released from the military

6591
03:43:22,478 --> 03:43:25,599
and i wanted to live near him but i

6592
03:43:24,639 --> 03:43:27,278
couldn't afford to live in british

6593
03:43:25,600 --> 03:43:29,760

6595
03:43:29,760 --> 03:43:32,318

trust me it was fine

6602
03:43:40,238 --> 03:43:43,119
so i was like okay

6603
03:43:42,159 --> 03:43:44,719
and so

6604
03:43:43,120 --> 03:43:46,239
i went from like dating this guy long

6605
03:43:44,719 --> 03:43:48,318

6608
03:43:49,520 --> 03:43:51,680
forth

6609
03:43:50,559 --> 03:43:53,119
and then finally his parents were like

6611
03:43:53,120 --> 03:43:58,160

6613
03:43:58,159 --> 03:44:03,039
word just as a love oh like it was just

6614
03:44:00,639 --> 03:44:03,760
like you guys didn't say uh for a long

6615
03:44:03,040 --> 03:44:05,040
time

6616
03:44:03,760 --> 03:44:07,279
for a long time

6617
03:44:05,040 --> 03:44:08,960
because i was dead inside

6618
03:44:07,279 --> 03:44:10,880
wow i didn't know what that meant

6619
03:44:08,959 --> 03:44:12,879
because i did i couldn't feel i didn't

6620
03:44:10,879 --> 03:44:15,119
feel anything he loved it because he

6621
03:44:12,879 --> 03:44:17,358
like we'd be go we go do something you

6622
03:44:15,120 --> 03:44:19,760

03:44:17,359 --> 03:44:21,920
wouldn't say a [ __ ] word you would

6624
03:44:19,760 --> 03:44:23,680
just sit there and now

6625
03:44:21,920 --> 03:44:25,920
you got all your feelings back and your

6626
03:44:23,680 --> 03:44:27,600
emotions back and now you're too hot and

6627
03:44:25,920 --> 03:44:30,000
you're too cold

6628
03:44:27,600 --> 03:44:31,600
anyways so yeah he loved it i was numb

6629
03:44:30,000 --> 03:44:33,199
and dead inside seriously when when i

6630
03:44:31,600 --> 03:44:34,479
called him back were you still able to

6631
03:44:33,199 --> 03:44:36,239
have fun together that kind of thing

6632
03:44:34,478 --> 03:44:38,238
like uh like when you say there's no

6633
03:44:36,238 --> 03:44:40,959
emotion there's more emotion around the

6634
03:44:38,238 --> 03:44:42,639
basics of like everyday life

6635
03:44:40,959 --> 03:44:44,879
uh but you're still able to just like

6636
03:44:42,639 --> 03:44:46,799
enjoy [ __ ] together i was enjoying stuff

6637
03:44:44,879 --> 03:44:47,759
but i wasn't

6638
03:44:46,799 --> 03:44:51,679
like

6639
03:44:47,760 --> 03:44:54,238
feeling yeah i was like this is fun yeah

6640
03:44:51,680 --> 03:44:57,840
right that was it that was surface level

6641
03:44:54,238 --> 03:44:59,600
like lex this is fun like it wasn't uh

6642
03:44:57,840 --> 03:45:00,880
there's nothing there yeah no there's

6643
03:44:59,600 --> 03:45:02,159
nothing there's hey

6644
03:45:00,879 --> 03:45:03,519
yeah nothing

6645
03:45:02,159 --> 03:45:05,199
and so we went through that for a long

6646
03:45:03,520 --> 03:45:06,319
time and then i lived with his parents

6647
03:45:05,199 --> 03:45:08,640

6648
03:45:06,318 --> 03:45:10,398

6660
03:45:30,959 --> 03:45:34,079
accepting

6661
03:45:32,159 --> 03:45:36,238

6662
03:45:34,079 --> 03:45:39,120

freaked me out for a long time

6667
03:45:46,398 --> 03:45:50,238
and then i finally said it and then that

6668
03:45:48,318 --> 03:45:51,278
[ __ ] said it like a month later and

6669
03:45:50,238 --> 03:45:52,559

yeah

6676
03:46:03,680 --> 03:46:07,680
and um then we moved out we bought a

6677
03:46:05,680 --> 03:46:09,840
house and then he took a sweet ass time

6678
03:46:07,680 --> 03:46:12,238
we were dating for four years before we

6679
03:46:09,840 --> 03:46:14,639
were engaged because just to be sure the

6680
03:46:12,238 --> 03:46:17,279
crazy wasn't too crazy he waited four

6681
03:46:14,639 --> 03:46:18,959
years on that smart man right yeah or

6682
03:46:17,279 --> 03:46:21,040
you can you could say he's just a

6683
03:46:18,959 --> 03:46:23,039
terrified commitment but both a little

6684
03:46:21,040 --> 03:46:25,279
bit of both hey when you were the guy on

6685
03:46:23,040 --> 03:46:26,960
the posters that all the girls sign up

6686
03:46:25,279 --> 03:46:28,399
to that sent all the dirty pictures

6687
03:46:26,959 --> 03:46:30,318
[ __ ] why are you giving that up it's

6688
03:46:28,398 --> 03:46:33,358
easy yeah commitment is a real

6689
03:46:30,318 --> 03:46:37,600
commitment then yeah

6690
03:46:33,359 --> 03:46:39,439
okay this is the jaco reset

6691
03:46:37,600 --> 03:46:42,318
we talked about brass and unity a little

6692
03:46:39,439 --> 03:46:45,199
bit what's the long-term mission goal

6693
03:46:42,318 --> 03:46:47,519
and dream of your company and the

6694
03:46:45,199 --> 03:46:49,840
podcast of the same name

6695
03:46:47,520 --> 03:46:52,960
so for me what i've been trying to do

6696
03:46:49,840 --> 03:46:54,398
with this company is create a community

6697
03:46:52,959 --> 03:46:56,639
that

6698
03:46:54,398 --> 03:46:59,198
can really work together to not only

6699
03:46:56,639 --> 03:47:00,478
help vets first responders but to really

6700
03:46:59,199 --> 03:47:02,560
bridge the gap with the civilian

6701
03:47:00,478 --> 03:47:05,039
population and letting them know what we

6702
03:47:02,559 --> 03:47:07,278
kind of go through and why it is such a

6703
03:47:05,040 --> 03:47:10,000
epidemic and why there is over 22

6704
03:47:07,279 --> 03:47:11,600
suicides a day and we are losing people

6705
03:47:10,000 --> 03:47:13,279
like it's going out of style like the

6706
03:47:11,600 --> 03:47:15,760
amount of vets that are questioning the

6707
03:47:13,279 --> 03:47:16,840
last 20 years of their life right now is

6708
03:47:15,760 --> 03:47:19,199
is

6709
03:47:16,840 --> 03:47:21,040
terrifying the you know i work with

6710
03:47:19,199 --> 03:47:22,239
organizations that are doing this

6711
03:47:21,040 --> 03:47:24,080
outreach and they're overloaded right

6712
03:47:22,238 --> 03:47:26,079
now like they have never seen before

6713
03:47:24,079 --> 03:47:28,959
because this whole thing is just

6714
03:47:26,079 --> 03:47:31,039
it's hit ahead here and so what brass

6715
03:47:28,959 --> 03:47:32,799
and unity tries to do is

6716
03:47:31,040 --> 03:47:34,000
it is really just a vehicle to get the

6717
03:47:32,799 --> 03:47:36,000
money in the hands of the people that

6718
03:47:34,000 --> 03:47:37,760
are doing the work with it i couldn't

6719
03:47:36,000 --> 03:47:39,760
start a non-profit because i'm not good

6720
03:47:37,760 --> 03:47:41,120
at fundraising i'm not good at being

6721
03:47:39,760 --> 03:47:42,719
like give me your money i'm gonna do

6722
03:47:41,120 --> 03:47:44,479
this with it

6723
03:47:42,719 --> 03:47:46,478
the least i could do was come up with a

6724
03:47:44,478 --> 03:47:48,398
product that i know i could give to

6725
03:47:46,478 --> 03:47:50,318
people or people could purchase

6726
03:47:48,398 --> 03:47:52,398
and if i gave

6727
03:47:50,318 --> 03:47:55,278
pretty much all of the pro like the the

6728
03:47:52,398 --> 03:47:57,920
actual um profit from it to those

6729
03:47:55,279 --> 03:48:01,199
organizations and i give them something

6730
03:47:57,920 --> 03:48:02,559
to wear that is a touch piece or if

6731
03:48:01,199 --> 03:48:04,640
they're out and somebody sees a bullet

6732
03:48:02,559 --> 03:48:07,278
on their wrist they go hey what is that

6733
03:48:04,639 --> 03:48:08,799
it's a conversation starter and that's

6734
03:48:07,279 --> 03:48:10,880
exactly what it's been

6735
03:48:08,799 --> 03:48:12,959
and it's it's done its job as that and

6736
03:48:10,879 --> 03:48:14,478
so we like i said we are a way to get

6737
03:48:12,959 --> 03:48:15,919
the vehicle we're the vehicle we're the

6738
03:48:14,478 --> 03:48:17,358
money in the hands of the people people

6739
03:48:15,920 --> 03:48:19,279
don't always want to just get a tax

6740
03:48:17,359 --> 03:48:20,238
receipt it's great to donate to

6741
03:48:19,279 --> 03:48:22,238
something

6742
03:48:20,238 --> 03:48:24,559
great on you to do that but most people

6743
03:48:22,238 --> 03:48:27,119
have a selfish aspect right and that's

6744
03:48:24,559 --> 03:48:29,278
okay but if you can tap into that you

6745
03:48:27,120 --> 03:48:30,960
can then fund these charities properly

6746
03:48:29,279 --> 03:48:33,120
and give them the tools to do their jobs

6747
03:48:30,959 --> 03:48:34,559
effectively up until this point they

6748
03:48:33,120 --> 03:48:36,000
just count on people's goodness of their

6749
03:48:34,559 --> 03:48:37,760
hearts

6750
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:39,520
i hate to break it to you humanity's

6751
03:48:37,760 --> 03:48:41,600
rough right now we need to look at

6752
03:48:39,520 --> 03:48:43,600
something a little differently so these

6753
03:48:41,600 --> 03:48:45,920
things spark like a jewelry sparks

6754
03:48:43,600 --> 03:48:47,840
conversations and then and then do you

6755
03:48:45,920 --> 03:48:50,318
work with charities yes oh god yeah

6756
03:48:47,840 --> 03:48:52,799
that's what i do so my whole mission

6757
03:48:50,318 --> 03:48:55,359
every day is i get up i push jewelry and

6758
03:48:52,799 --> 03:48:57,198
sunglasses on people and say

6759
03:48:55,359 --> 03:48:59,199
but now that you're going to wear that

6760
03:48:57,199 --> 03:49:01,120
now you're a part of the bnu army now

6761
03:48:59,199 --> 03:49:03,279
you're a part of this community speaking

6762
03:49:01,120 --> 03:49:05,840
of which let me uh let me

6763
03:49:03,279 --> 03:49:08,238
put it put it right back on branded this

6764
03:49:05,840 --> 03:49:10,478
is uh organic product placement yeah

6765
03:49:08,238 --> 03:49:13,119
this isn't like marketing at all nothing

6766
03:49:10,478 --> 03:49:14,799
weird about this at all and so we work

6767
03:49:13,120 --> 03:49:16,880
with a lot of organizations and i'm very

6768
03:49:14,799 --> 03:49:18,959
particular about where we send our money

6769
03:49:16,879 --> 03:49:21,358
because there are it feels like

6770
03:49:18,959 --> 03:49:22,238
thousands of vet organizations right now

6771
03:49:21,359 --> 03:49:24,238
and

6772
03:49:22,238 --> 03:49:25,840
if we were able to consolidate it would

6773
03:49:24,238 --> 03:49:27,439
be more ideal i spoke about that on

6774
03:49:25,840 --> 03:49:29,199
another show but that's not currently

6775
03:49:27,439 --> 03:49:31,199
happening so i try to work with the

6776
03:49:29,199 --> 03:49:33,279
non-profits i know number one are not

6777
03:49:31,199 --> 03:49:34,640
paying six-figure salaries which trust

6778
03:49:33,279 --> 03:49:35,840
me there's lots

6779
03:49:34,639 --> 03:49:37,599
a lot

6780
03:49:35,840 --> 03:49:39,359
number two i look at the actual

6781
03:49:37,600 --> 03:49:40,479
resources that they're providing and if

6782
03:49:39,359 --> 03:49:42,559
they're going to be something that are

6783
03:49:40,478 --> 03:49:44,000
going to be useful in my opinion whether

6784
03:49:42,559 --> 03:49:45,198
or not they're actually useful and i

6785
03:49:44,000 --> 03:49:46,959
just don't think they are that's a

6786
03:49:45,199 --> 03:49:48,640
that's up for debate i know it's worked

6787
03:49:46,959 --> 03:49:50,559
for me so i try to fund the things that

6788
03:49:48,639 --> 03:49:52,478
i know have been helpful for me and the

6789
03:49:50,559 --> 03:49:53,439
people i associate with

6790
03:49:52,478 --> 03:49:54,799
so

6791
03:49:53,439 --> 03:49:56,559
that's why i brought all the paper

6792
03:49:54,799 --> 03:49:58,079
because i didn't want to be

6793
03:49:56,559 --> 03:49:59,840
an idiot and forget anybody that's

6794
03:49:58,079 --> 03:50:01,120
really important because i get caught up

6795
03:49:59,840 --> 03:50:05,040
in things and i think it's important to

6796
03:50:01,120 --> 03:50:07,920
acknowledge so number one heroic hearts

6797
03:50:05,040 --> 03:50:09,680
we just started working um to

6798
03:50:07,920 --> 03:50:11,120
talk about them and really make them

6799
03:50:09,680 --> 03:50:13,520
known but we're going to be donating to

6800
03:50:11,120 --> 03:50:15,680
them as well are they doing uh more

6801
03:50:13,520 --> 03:50:17,840
stuff than the ayahuasca things yeah so

6802
03:50:15,680 --> 03:50:19,120
their points are i got jesse to actually

6803
03:50:17,840 --> 03:50:20,559
i'm like what are your talking points

6804
03:50:19,120 --> 03:50:21,600
because i need people to know exactly

6805
03:50:20,559 --> 03:50:23,119
what you do

6806
03:50:21,600 --> 03:50:24,640
so veterans have had to take their

6807
03:50:23,120 --> 03:50:25,920
mental and general health into their own

6808
03:50:24,639 --> 03:50:27,760
hands due to the failure of the

6809
03:50:25,920 --> 03:50:30,159
government system so that is why they

6810
03:50:27,760 --> 03:50:31,520
were created but heroic hearts is a peer

6811
03:50:30,159 --> 03:50:33,920
supported mental health network

6812
03:50:31,520 --> 03:50:35,439
involving full preparation integration

6813
03:50:33,920 --> 03:50:37,279
coaching and connection to vetted

6814
03:50:35,439 --> 03:50:39,600
psychedelic treatments so they don't

6815
03:50:37,279 --> 03:50:42,720
just do aya they deal with psilocybin

6816
03:50:39,600 --> 03:50:44,800
ketamine um ibogaine but they've got

6817
03:50:42,719 --> 03:50:46,879
protocols in place they've got locations

6818
03:50:44,799 --> 03:50:49,840
you go to that are safely vetted and

6819
03:50:46,879 --> 03:50:51,839
they work they've got over right now

6820
03:50:49,840 --> 03:50:53,760
jesse said they have over 800 veterans

6821
03:50:51,840 --> 03:50:55,920
on a waiting list for treatment that's

6822
03:50:53,760 --> 03:50:56,880
just before the spike of the end of this

6823
03:50:55,920 --> 03:50:57,760
war

6824
03:50:56,879 --> 03:50:59,599
um

6825
03:50:57,760 --> 03:51:01,920
they have over a hundred they've helped

6826
03:50:59,600 --> 03:51:04,079
over 100 veterans including dozens of

6827
03:51:01,920 --> 03:51:06,238
special operation vets find effective

6828
03:51:04,079 --> 03:51:08,639
care they've now got branches in the u.s

6829
03:51:06,238 --> 03:51:10,318
uk and canada and the the biggest thing

6830
03:51:08,639 --> 03:51:11,439
about them and why we talk about them is

6831
03:51:10,318 --> 03:51:13,600
because

6832
03:51:11,439 --> 03:51:16,000
the problem of psychedelics and the

6833
03:51:13,600 --> 03:51:17,600
stigma around it is so significant but

6834
03:51:16,000 --> 03:51:19,120
because of great universities that are

6835
03:51:17,600 --> 03:51:21,359
now stepping up and doing the research

6836
03:51:19,120 --> 03:51:23,520
behind it it is being legitimized so

6837
03:51:21,359 --> 03:51:25,600
like they're doing that in canada

6838
03:51:23,520 --> 03:51:26,880
there's a group called therasil

6839
03:51:25,600 --> 03:51:28,640
they are currently fighting the

6840
03:51:26,879 --> 03:51:31,519
government to get the rights for

6841
03:51:28,639 --> 03:51:34,079
canadians under section 56 of our laws

6842
03:51:31,520 --> 03:51:37,040
to get compassionate care for psilocybin

6843
03:51:34,079 --> 03:51:39,120
use i've done a panel with them on that

6844
03:51:37,040 --> 03:51:41,359
really great base of victoria really

6845
03:51:39,120 --> 03:51:42,880
smart people one of the other bigger

6846
03:51:41,359 --> 03:51:45,120
charities that we work with and they're

6847
03:51:42,879 --> 03:51:46,639
honestly they were my first and foremost

6848
03:51:45,120 --> 03:51:48,720
charity that i ever worked with and

6849
03:51:46,639 --> 03:51:50,559
they're a big component in the veteran

6850
03:51:48,719 --> 03:51:52,478
community in canada

6851
03:51:50,559 --> 03:51:54,159
um they're called honor house and honor

6852
03:51:52,478 --> 03:51:56,238
house was started by

6853
03:51:54,159 --> 03:51:58,639
honoree colonel

6854
03:51:56,238 --> 03:52:00,398
al dijanova it was started because of a

6855
03:51:58,639 --> 03:52:02,639
guy named trevor greene he was a

6856
03:52:00,398 --> 03:52:05,198
canadian soldier who deployed

6857
03:52:02,639 --> 03:52:07,599
and he was so captain trevor green sorry

6858
03:52:05,199 --> 03:52:09,359
trevor captain trevor green

6859
03:52:07,600 --> 03:52:10,479
um he got an axe in the middle of his

6860
03:52:09,359 --> 03:52:12,238
head

6861
03:52:10,478 --> 03:52:13,519
a taliban member came up and put an axe

6862
03:52:12,238 --> 03:52:15,840
directly into his head when his helmet

6863
03:52:13,520 --> 03:52:18,560
was off and he survived

6864
03:52:15,840 --> 03:52:20,478
he's done work with uh invictus games

6865
03:52:18,559 --> 03:52:22,879
and prince harry he has an exoskeleton

6866
03:52:20,478 --> 03:52:24,799
he uses on the island he's the he's so

6867
03:52:22,879 --> 03:52:27,438
cool he hasn't changed one bit from like

6868
03:52:24,799 --> 03:52:28,799
the infantry captain he you expect him

6869
03:52:27,439 --> 03:52:31,439
to be

6870
03:52:28,799 --> 03:52:33,438
and it was al saw there was a need for

6871
03:52:31,439 --> 03:52:34,398
vets and first responders to get

6872
03:52:33,439 --> 03:52:36,318
treatment

6873
03:52:34,398 --> 03:52:38,639
because there's no real home away from

6874
03:52:36,318 --> 03:52:40,959
home for people picture ronald mcdonald

6875
03:52:38,639 --> 03:52:43,760
for cancer and families this is vets and

6876
03:52:40,959 --> 03:52:44,959
first responders and so their whole

6877
03:52:43,760 --> 03:52:46,079
thing and i'll read it so i say it

6878
03:52:44,959 --> 03:52:47,919
exactly right because i used to be on

6879
03:52:46,079 --> 03:52:49,840
the board of their charity but i ran out

6880
03:52:47,920 --> 03:52:50,960
of time so now i just consult

6881
03:52:49,840 --> 03:52:52,639
but um

6882
03:52:50,959 --> 03:52:54,238
they are a home away from home for

6883
03:52:52,639 --> 03:52:56,238
members of the canadian armed force

6884
03:52:54,238 --> 03:52:58,639
forces veterans and first responders and

6885
03:52:56,238 --> 03:53:00,398
their families to stay completely free

6886
03:52:58,639 --> 03:53:02,159
of charge while they're receiving

6887
03:53:00,398 --> 03:53:04,478
medical care and treatment in the

6888
03:53:02,159 --> 03:53:06,318
vancouver area but since then they've

6889
03:53:04,478 --> 03:53:08,318
expanded since i've come on board and

6890
03:53:06,318 --> 03:53:09,840

03:53:37,040 --> 03:53:41,680
they have those they go directly to them

6907
03:53:39,359 --> 03:53:43,760
which is really amazing they've been

6908
03:53:41,680 --> 03:53:45,680
near and dear to my heart for a long

6909
03:53:43,760 --> 03:53:48,079
time you've got the all secure

6910
03:53:45,680 --> 03:53:49,600
foundation which is these guys are these

6911
03:53:48,079 --> 03:53:51,279
guys are super dope i'm going to read

6912
03:53:49,600 --> 03:53:53,120
exactly because jen texts me so jen and

6913
03:53:51,279 --> 03:53:54,479
tom satterly i've had them both on the

6914
03:53:53,120 --> 03:53:57,760
podcast

6915
03:53:54,478 --> 03:54:00,719
tom was involved in black hawk down

6916
03:53:57,760 --> 03:54:02,318
tom is a delta have you heard of them

6917
03:54:00,719 --> 03:54:03,119
no

6918
03:54:02,318 --> 03:54:04,639
no

6919
03:54:03,120 --> 03:54:05,680
so okay so tom was involved in black

6920
03:54:04,639 --> 03:54:08,398
hawk down it was one of his first

6921
03:54:05,680 --> 03:54:09,760
operations he's a delta operator and i

6922
03:54:08,398 --> 03:54:10,959
asked her i said listen i'm going to be

6923
03:54:09,760 --> 03:54:12,398
doing these shows and i think it's great

6924
03:54:10,959 --> 03:54:15,278
that we talk about you more so i said

6925
03:54:12,398 --> 03:54:17,278
give me your three points of importance

6926
03:54:15,279 --> 03:54:18,960
so the all secure foundation

6927
03:54:17,279 --> 03:54:20,479
serves special operations combat

6928
03:54:18,959 --> 03:54:22,000
families in healing from post-traumatic

6929
03:54:20,478 --> 03:54:23,840
stress injury and secondary

6930
03:54:22,000 --> 03:54:25,520
post-traumatic stress so that's often

6931
03:54:23,840 --> 03:54:27,920
what the wife or the other husband or

6932
03:54:25,520 --> 03:54:29,279
the other spouse suffers from we're

6933
03:54:27,920 --> 03:54:31,040
starting to see that be more and more of

6934
03:54:29,279 --> 03:54:32,960
an issue now

6935
03:54:31,040 --> 03:54:34,640
so they also are devoted to rebuilding

6936
03:54:32,959 --> 03:54:36,559
the couple's relationships on the home

6937
03:54:34,639 --> 03:54:39,358
front after the separations of war and

6938
03:54:36,559 --> 03:54:41,600
80 of their warriors went on

6939
03:54:39,359 --> 03:54:43,600
went um

6940
03:54:41,600 --> 03:54:44,720
yeah 80 of their warriors want their

6941
03:54:43,600 --> 03:54:47,760
families to be more involved with the

6942
03:54:44,719 --> 03:54:50,639
healing the problem is is very often

6943
03:54:47,760 --> 03:54:52,000
vets don't realize that they can have or

6944
03:54:50,639 --> 03:54:53,519
just because the system doesn't pay for

6945
03:54:52,000 --> 03:54:55,359
it actually have their spouse as a part

6946
03:54:53,520 --> 03:54:57,120
of things and the biggest thing that we

6947
03:54:55,359 --> 03:55:00,159
find with special operations families i

6948
03:54:57,120 --> 03:55:02,800
think the divorce rate's like 95

6949
03:55:00,159 --> 03:55:04,318
and so they work so hard with these

6950
03:55:02,799 --> 03:55:05,519
families they take them on retreats

6951
03:55:04,318 --> 03:55:06,879
these husbands and wives and they get

6952
03:55:05,520 --> 03:55:08,479
them to connect again after being

6953
03:55:06,879 --> 03:55:09,358
separated over such a long period of

6954
03:55:08,478 --> 03:55:10,959
time

6955
03:55:09,359 --> 03:55:13,040
there's other places like children the

6956
03:55:10,959 --> 03:55:16,238
fallen patriots out of dc where they

6957
03:55:13,040 --> 03:55:18,080
fund education um university for people

6958
03:55:16,238 --> 03:55:19,279
who have lost their parents um in

6959
03:55:18,079 --> 03:55:21,199
deployments

6960
03:55:19,279 --> 03:55:22,880
whether their kids even born yet if

6961
03:55:21,199 --> 03:55:25,199
they're still in utero they still pay

6962
03:55:22,879 --> 03:55:28,398
they do not care then you've got people

6963
03:55:25,199 --> 03:55:30,399
like um in canada you've got vets canada

6964
03:55:28,398 --> 03:55:34,159
you've got in the states you've you know

6965
03:55:30,398 --> 03:55:35,680
you got true patriot love you've got um

6966
03:55:34,159 --> 03:55:37,279
who else in the states is really great

6967
03:55:35,680 --> 03:55:39,199
that we've worked with i know there's a

6968
03:55:37,279 --> 03:55:41,600
green beret foundation that's great one

6969
03:55:39,199 --> 03:55:42,479
more wave gives amputees teaches them to

6970
03:55:41,600 --> 03:55:44,079
surf

6971
03:55:42,478 --> 03:55:45,840
with it with amputees like they're

6972
03:55:44,079 --> 03:55:48,559
really great there's so many

6973
03:55:45,840 --> 03:55:51,680
organizations but at the end of the day

6974
03:55:48,559 --> 03:55:54,159
i focus on a small subset because

6975
03:55:51,680 --> 03:55:56,079
you cannot fix everyone's problems the

6976
03:55:54,159 --> 03:55:57,760
least thing the least you can do for

6977
03:55:56,079 --> 03:55:59,680
people is focus

6978
03:55:57,760 --> 03:56:01,279
if you can provide focus you can provide

6979
03:55:59,680 --> 03:56:02,398
the proper amount of funding proper

6980
03:56:01,279 --> 03:56:04,720
amount of funding can get the proper

6981
03:56:02,398 --> 03:56:07,358
amount of tools those tools can actually

6982
03:56:04,719 --> 03:56:09,278
be implemented properly and then those

6983
03:56:07,359 --> 03:56:11,439
people can go on to hopefully have

6984
03:56:09,279 --> 03:56:13,279
successful marriages and families

6985
03:56:11,439 --> 03:56:14,800
and we don't have to watch our parents

6986
03:56:13,279 --> 03:56:16,640
drink themselves to death and wonder why

6987
03:56:14,799 --> 03:56:18,478
daddy's yelling at mommy all the time

6988
03:56:16,639 --> 03:56:20,079
and daddy storms out and leaves well

6989
03:56:18,478 --> 03:56:21,840
daddy had some [ __ ] happen in his life

6990
03:56:20,079 --> 03:56:24,398
and mommy had some [ __ ] happen but that

6991
03:56:21,840 --> 03:56:27,680
does not mean that's who they are and

6992
03:56:24,398 --> 03:56:29,119
yes so trauma has completely destructive

6993
03:56:27,680 --> 03:56:31,359
effects on

6994
03:56:29,120 --> 03:56:33,359
family and relationships and like

6995
03:56:31,359 --> 03:56:35,600
correcting that as like

6996
03:56:33,359 --> 03:56:38,318
ripple effects oh

6997
03:56:35,600 --> 03:56:41,600
yeah astronomical ripple effects because

6998
03:56:38,318 --> 03:56:44,079
the problem is we are so quick to tell

6999
03:56:41,600 --> 03:56:45,920
people they're suffering from ptsd we're

7000
03:56:44,079 --> 03:56:48,079
so quick to give them drugs we're so

7001
03:56:45,920 --> 03:56:49,680
quick to kick them out of the military

7002
03:56:48,079 --> 03:56:51,039
we're so quick to let them be homeless

7003
03:56:49,680 --> 03:56:53,040
on the street we're so quick to let them

7004
03:56:51,040 --> 03:56:54,640
[ __ ] kill themselves we're so quick

7005
03:56:53,040 --> 03:56:56,640
and then all of a sudden when when a

7006
03:56:54,639 --> 03:56:58,639
politician goes veteran suicide's an

7007
03:56:56,639 --> 03:57:00,159
issue that's when it's a problem

7008
03:56:58,639 --> 03:57:01,760
well if you prevent the problem from

7009
03:57:00,159 --> 03:57:03,199
happening in the first place or you give

7010
03:57:01,760 --> 03:57:07,520
people the right funding and tools to do

7011
03:57:03,199 --> 03:57:10,159
the job you won't have this problem

7012
03:57:07,520 --> 03:57:12,159
do you have advice for young people i

7013
03:57:10,159 --> 03:57:13,600
think high school students

7014
03:57:12,159 --> 03:57:15,760
maybe uh

7015
03:57:13,600 --> 03:57:17,199
undergrads college students

7016
03:57:15,760 --> 03:57:19,040
about career

7017
03:57:17,199 --> 03:57:20,960
life how to live a life they can be

7018
03:57:19,040 --> 03:57:24,479
proud of

7019
03:57:20,959 --> 03:57:24,478
you've had one heck of a life

7020
03:57:25,439 --> 03:57:28,960
some of them are really cheesy but

7021
03:57:26,559 --> 03:57:28,959
they're true

7022
03:57:29,040 --> 03:57:32,399
live a life you can be proud of

7023
03:57:31,199 --> 03:57:33,520
number one

7024
03:57:32,398 --> 03:57:35,439
if you wake up every morning and you

7025
03:57:33,520 --> 03:57:37,359
hate what you do change

7026
03:57:35,439 --> 03:57:39,680
the [ __ ] station

7027
03:57:37,359 --> 03:57:41,199
do not live and stay in that perpetual

7028
03:57:39,680 --> 03:57:43,760
cycle of [ __ ]

7029
03:57:41,199 --> 03:57:45,680
it's not worth it it's not

7030
03:57:43,760 --> 03:57:47,600
it's not what you're on this planet for

7031
03:57:45,680 --> 03:57:50,079
you're worth more than that than the

7032
03:57:47,600 --> 03:57:51,600
monotony of waking up going to work

7033
03:57:50,079 --> 03:57:53,920
hating your life drinking yourself to

7034
03:57:51,600 --> 03:57:55,920
sleep and functioning

7035
03:57:53,920 --> 03:57:58,639
do yourself a favor the thing i scream

7036
03:57:55,920 --> 03:58:02,398
about on the show so much is move your

7037
03:57:58,639 --> 03:58:05,760
[ __ ] body move your body

7038
03:58:02,398 --> 03:58:08,238
get your blood moving allow your body to

7039
03:58:05,760 --> 03:58:10,639
to do what it's here for go for a run go

7040
03:58:08,238 --> 03:58:12,799
for a walk if you can't run walk to the

7041
03:58:10,639 --> 03:58:15,278
fridge three times more than maybe you

7042
03:58:12,799 --> 03:58:19,679
did before but you're moving

7043
03:58:15,279 --> 03:58:22,079
pay attention to the [ __ ] you look at

7044
03:58:19,680 --> 03:58:24,639
more now than ever we are seeing uh our

7045
03:58:22,079 --> 03:58:27,039
younger generation just be force-fed

7046
03:58:24,639 --> 03:58:28,959
information from one side or the other

7047
03:58:27,040 --> 03:58:30,960
and none of it makes sense none of it's

7048
03:58:28,959 --> 03:58:32,559
understandable it just causes chaos in

7049
03:58:30,959 --> 03:58:34,639
the brain

7050
03:58:32,559 --> 03:58:36,478
really pay attention to what you you

7051
03:58:34,639 --> 03:58:39,599
listen to

7052
03:58:36,478 --> 03:58:42,079
something i've had to learn to do is

7053
03:58:39,600 --> 03:58:43,439
make time for myself

7054
03:58:42,079 --> 03:58:46,398
all of this

7055
03:58:43,439 --> 03:58:47,840
working 18 hours a day not sleeping just

7056
03:58:46,398 --> 03:58:49,439
work work record that doesn't work

7057
03:58:47,840 --> 03:58:51,120
that's not sustainable it's not healthy

7058
03:58:49,439 --> 03:58:55,120
and it's not it's not anything anyone

7059
03:58:51,120 --> 03:58:57,600
should be doing balance is important

7060
03:58:55,120 --> 03:58:59,760
but if you're going to take the time

7061
03:58:57,600 --> 03:59:01,359
to do something for yourself

7062
03:58:59,760 --> 03:59:03,359
don't make it sitting in front of the tv

7063
03:59:01,359 --> 03:59:04,880
for six hours eating a bag of chips

7064
03:59:03,359 --> 03:59:07,040

03:59:57,439 --> 03:59:59,920
knowing that they have a friend that

7093
03:59:58,639 --> 04:00:02,238
they can call on the other line that

7094
03:59:59,920 --> 04:00:04,318
isn't just like how's it going that can

7095
04:00:02,238 --> 04:00:06,719
actually have a conversation a

7096
04:00:04,318 --> 04:00:09,600
meaningful intelligent

7097
04:00:06,719 --> 04:00:11,920
caring conversation

7098
04:00:09,600 --> 04:00:14,960
we are just breeding these kids to be

7099
04:00:11,920 --> 04:00:17,199
followers who digest [ __ ] who

7100
04:00:14,959 --> 04:00:19,679
reverberate things they don't fully

7101
04:00:17,199 --> 04:00:22,960
understand and have opinions on stuff

7102
04:00:19,680 --> 04:00:26,000
they have no business talking about

7103
04:00:22,959 --> 04:00:28,000
yeah uh with an open mind humbly think

7104
04:00:26,000 --> 04:00:28,959
deeply about the world

7105
04:00:28,000 --> 04:00:31,840
correct

7106
04:00:28,959 --> 04:00:34,478
how has your relationship with death

7107
04:00:31,840 --> 04:00:37,600
changed this is a russian program i have

7108
04:00:34,478 --> 04:00:39,599
to ask you so you've considered suicide

7109
04:00:37,600 --> 04:00:41,840
throughout your life you have been in

7110
04:00:39,600 --> 04:00:42,880
the line of fire you have witnessed

7111
04:00:41,840 --> 04:00:46,478
death

7112
04:00:42,879 --> 04:00:49,679
you as a human being immortal one

7113
04:00:46,478 --> 04:00:52,559
do you think about your death these days

7114
04:00:49,680 --> 04:00:55,359
now that you have begun the journey with

7115
04:00:52,559 --> 04:00:58,159
dealing with your trauma

7116
04:00:55,359 --> 04:01:01,120
do you think about your death are you

7117
04:00:58,159 --> 04:01:04,238
afraid of your death

7118
04:01:01,120 --> 04:01:06,800
well you don't die so that's why what do

7119
04:01:04,238 --> 04:01:08,559
you mean you don't die you move on

7120
04:01:06,799 --> 04:01:10,799
where do you go

7121
04:01:08,559 --> 04:01:13,198
to another plane and another vibration

7122
04:01:10,799 --> 04:01:15,759
and another whatever you want to call it

7123
04:01:13,199 --> 04:01:17,199
this isn't it this isn't all of it

7124
04:01:15,760 --> 04:01:20,478
this is a blip

7125
04:01:17,199 --> 04:01:21,920
this is a moment this is uh

7126
04:01:20,478 --> 04:01:24,559
i used to be afraid of death before the

7127
04:01:21,920 --> 04:01:26,000
military i was always afraid of dying i

7128
04:01:24,559 --> 04:01:28,159
don't know why i had this irrational

7129
04:01:26,000 --> 04:01:30,238
fear that i was gonna be kidnapped in my

7130
04:01:28,159 --> 04:01:33,039
room like seriously like irrational fear

7131
04:01:30,238 --> 04:01:36,000
like afraid um and it's funny because i

7132
04:01:33,040 --> 04:01:38,080
talked to michaela um yesterday and she

7133
04:01:36,000 --> 04:01:39,760
said the same thing and i was like oh my

7134
04:01:38,079 --> 04:01:41,680
god i know what you're talking being

7135
04:01:39,760 --> 04:01:42,960
afraid of being kidnapped yeah she had

7136
04:01:41,680 --> 04:01:45,680
this like fear that someone was going to

7137
04:01:42,959 --> 04:01:48,559
come in and take her out of her room

7138
04:01:45,680 --> 04:01:50,079
i had the same fear but a human being

7139
04:01:48,559 --> 04:01:51,920
or some kind no i think like by a human

7140
04:01:50,079 --> 04:01:53,439
being and i had this irrational fear

7141
04:01:51,920 --> 04:01:55,359
that i was that's like something was

7142
04:01:53,439 --> 04:01:56,238
going to happen to me and like i said i

7143
04:01:55,359 --> 04:01:57,600
don't know if it's because like my

7144
04:01:56,238 --> 04:01:59,198
parents were always made me aware of my

7145
04:01:57,600 --> 04:02:01,199
surroundings like people take people

7146
04:01:59,199 --> 04:02:02,880
this is a real thing that happens yeah

7147
04:02:01,199 --> 04:02:05,279
that was really small so and i looked

7148
04:02:02,879 --> 04:02:07,119
like a little boy my hair was like that

7149
04:02:05,279 --> 04:02:08,960
when i was training i had short no hair

7150
04:02:07,120 --> 04:02:10,720
i know flat as a board you would have

7151
04:02:08,959 --> 04:02:12,478
thought i was a 12 year old boy

7152
04:02:10,719 --> 04:02:14,639
and so my mom's like people take people

7153
04:02:12,478 --> 04:02:15,840
sweetie that's just the reality of life

7154
04:02:14,639 --> 04:02:17,920
you need to be aware so i don't know if

7155
04:02:15,840 --> 04:02:19,920
i had this ingrained in my mind

7156
04:02:17,920 --> 04:02:21,840
i was always like training to protect

7157
04:02:19,920 --> 04:02:22,559
myself or fight someone off so i was

7158
04:02:21,840 --> 04:02:25,040
like

7159
04:02:22,559 --> 04:02:26,799
afraid of like this irrational thing

7160
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:28,239
and then i went overseas and then i

7161
04:02:26,799 --> 04:02:29,599
realized that i could just be literally

7162
04:02:28,238 --> 04:02:30,719
there talking you having a conversation

7163
04:02:29,600 --> 04:02:32,000
and i could just be taken off the face

7164
04:02:30,719 --> 04:02:34,559
of the earth

7165
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:36,159
and there's nothing i can do about it

7166
04:02:34,559 --> 04:02:38,559
and then i adapted this idea that when

7167
04:02:36,159 --> 04:02:42,238
it's my time it'll be my time but

7168
04:02:38,559 --> 04:02:45,359
the difference is now

7169
04:02:42,238 --> 04:02:47,840
at least i know that

7170
04:02:45,359 --> 04:02:50,159
if i do go

7171
04:02:47,840 --> 04:02:53,120
and i do cross and i am

7172
04:02:50,159 --> 04:02:53,119
and i do move on

7173
04:02:54,559 --> 04:02:58,159
i know that i live my life the way that

7174
04:02:56,238 --> 04:03:01,600
i i always

7175
04:02:58,159 --> 04:03:01,600
hoped i would be proud to live

7176
04:03:02,559 --> 04:03:05,359
can i ask you a dark question yeah

7177
04:03:04,398 --> 04:03:07,519
because we

7178
04:03:05,359 --> 04:03:09,920
you mentioned robin williams you

7179
04:03:07,520 --> 04:03:12,079
mentioned anthony bourdain and your own

7180
04:03:09,920 --> 04:03:13,840
struggle with suicide

7181
04:03:12,079 --> 04:03:15,039
why do you think

7182
04:03:13,840 --> 04:03:17,840
they

7183
04:03:15,040 --> 04:03:19,199
ultimately lost about that battle

7184
04:03:17,840 --> 04:03:21,520
why do you think they took their lives

7185
04:03:19,199 --> 04:03:22,880
man that's a that's a loaded question

7186
04:03:21,520 --> 04:03:25,040
because you could look at everything

7187
04:03:22,879 --> 04:03:27,519
from from

7188
04:03:25,040 --> 04:03:29,120
biomarkers in the brain to know if their

7189
04:03:27,520 --> 04:03:30,560
serotonin and dopamine levels were

7190
04:03:29,120 --> 04:03:33,359
crashed in the ground like there's

7191
04:03:30,559 --> 04:03:35,680
there's biological reasonings for some

7192
04:03:33,359 --> 04:03:36,640
people where they're born bipolar and

7193
04:03:35,680 --> 04:03:39,760
they have or you know they're

7194
04:03:36,639 --> 04:03:43,519
schizophrenic there's so many things

7195
04:03:39,760 --> 04:03:45,680
we don't fully grasp about the brain

7196
04:03:43,520 --> 04:03:48,720
but what we do know from my perspective

7197
04:03:45,680 --> 04:03:48,720
for me at least

7198
04:03:51,040 --> 04:03:56,479
there really is no rhyme or reason why i

7199
04:03:53,439 --> 04:03:59,040
survived and others didn't

7200
04:03:56,478 --> 04:04:02,000
stuff and things don't make you happy

7201
04:03:59,040 --> 04:04:03,520
people don't always

7202
04:04:02,000 --> 04:04:06,000
know why they're feeling the way they're

7203
04:04:03,520 --> 04:04:08,399
feeling but they also are also are not

7204
04:04:06,000 --> 04:04:08,398
always

7205
04:04:09,199 --> 04:04:13,680
willing to talk about it or

7206
04:04:12,238 --> 04:04:15,680
be

7207
04:04:13,680 --> 04:04:18,159
they put on a good front and if nobody

7208
04:04:15,680 --> 04:04:20,079
knows any different what do you expect

7209
04:04:18,159 --> 04:04:22,559
and it's especially clear with the the

7210
04:04:20,079 --> 04:04:23,680
two of them that on the surface they're

7211
04:04:22,559 --> 04:04:25,359
you know

7212
04:04:23,680 --> 04:04:27,680
exceptionally successful in so many

7213
04:04:25,359 --> 04:04:31,279
dimensions right and still that means

7214
04:04:27,680 --> 04:04:34,000
nothing material possessions

7215
04:04:31,279 --> 04:04:35,359
anything really is not uh doesn't

7216
04:04:34,000 --> 04:04:38,559
guarantee you

7217
04:04:35,359 --> 04:04:39,920
happiness no it doesn't

7218
04:04:38,559 --> 04:04:41,840
well scary

7219
04:04:39,920 --> 04:04:44,639
that's terrifying

7220
04:04:41,840 --> 04:04:48,238
but uh when it's good

7221
04:04:44,639 --> 04:04:50,879
that's what makes it

7222
04:04:48,238 --> 04:04:53,520
joyful like that's what happiness is

7223
04:04:50,879 --> 04:04:55,920
it's like holy [ __ ] somehow amidst all

7224
04:04:53,520 --> 04:04:58,079
the absurdity all the things that you

7225
04:04:55,920 --> 04:04:59,680
can't predict you you nevertheless feel

7226
04:04:58,079 --> 04:05:02,318
really good that's why i feel really

7227
04:04:59,680 --> 04:05:04,000
fortunate to to be getting this feat of

7228
04:05:02,318 --> 04:05:06,719
happiness all the time

7229

um well

7230
04:05:06,719 --> 04:05:12,000
to be or not to be that's a good place
