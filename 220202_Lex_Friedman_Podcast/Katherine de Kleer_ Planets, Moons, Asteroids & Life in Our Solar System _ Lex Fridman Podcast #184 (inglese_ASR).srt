00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,520
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,520
catherine declare a professor of

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,640
planetary science and astronomy at

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,558
caltech

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:10,480
her research is on the surface

6
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,959
environments atmospheres

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,240
and thermochemical histories of the

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
planets and moons

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,600
in our solar system quick mention of our

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,118
sponsors

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,439
fund rise blinkist expressvpn

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:25,679
and magic spoon check them out in the

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,198
description to support this podcast

14
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,439
as a side note let me say that this

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,279
conversation and a few others

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,840
quite big ones actually that are coming

17
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:35,920
up were filmed in a studio where i was

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,760
trying to outsource some of the work

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,920
like all experiments it was a learning

20
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,000
experience for me it had some positives

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,280
and negatives ultimately i decided to

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
return back to doing it the way i was

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,399
doing before

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,280
but hopefully with a team who can help

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,160
me out

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,239
and work with me long term the point is

27
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,640
i will always keep challenging myself

28
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,399
trying stuff out learning growing and

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,000
hopefully improving over time

30
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,079
my goal is to surround myself with

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,719
people who love what they do

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,799
are amazing at it and are obsessed with

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,560
doing the best work of their lives

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
to me there's nothing more energizing

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,320
and fun than that

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
in fact i'm currently hiring a few folks

37
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,478
to work with me on various small

38
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,719
projects

39
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,560
if this is something of interest to you

40
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,798
go to lexfriedman.com

41
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
hiring that's where i will always post

42
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,720
opportunities for

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,599
working with me this is the lex friedman

44
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,519
podcast

45
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,759
and here is my conversation with

46
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,078
catherine to clear

47
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,239
why is pluto not a planet anymore does

48
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:36,078
this upset you or

49
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:36,078
has justice finally been served

50
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,798
so i get asked this all the time i think

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,040
all planetary scientists get asked about

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
pluto especially by kids who

53
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,159
would just love for pluto to still be a

54
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:50,478
planet um

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,880
but the the reality is um when we first

56
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,560
discovered pluto it was it was a unique

57
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,118
object in the outer solar system and we

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,280
thought

59
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,959
you know we were adding a planet to the

60
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
inventory of planets that we had and

61
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,839
then

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,040
over time it became clear that pluto was

63
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,280
not

64
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,880
a unique large object in the outer solar

65
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,520
system that there were actually

66
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,878
many of these and as we started

67
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,879
discovering more and more of them we

68
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,159
realized that the concept of pluto being

69
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,199
a planet

70
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,959
um didn't make sense unless maybe we

71
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,079
added all the rest of them as planets so

72
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,439
you know you could have imagined

73
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,000
actually a different direction that this

74
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,239
could have gone

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
where all the other objects that were

76
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,360
discovered in that belt

77
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,879
or at least all the ones let's say above

78
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,040
above a certain size

79
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,199
became planets instead of pluto being

80
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,919
declassified

81
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,439
but we were now aware of many objects

82
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,759
out there in the outer solar system and

83
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,919
what's called the kuiper belt that are

84
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,359
of the same size or in some cases even

85
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,318
larger than pluto

86
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,080
um so the the declassification was

87
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,359
really just a realization that it was

88
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,200
not

89
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
in the same category as the other

90
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,560
planets in the solar system and we

91
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,680
basically needed to refine our

92
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,280
definition

93
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,879
in such a way that took into account

94
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,759
that there's this this

95
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,280
belt of debris out there in the outer

96
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,239
solar system of things with a range of

97
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,640
sizes

98
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,840
um is there a hope for clear

99
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,158
categorization

100
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
of what is a planet and not give us or

101
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,439
is it all just gray area

102
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,519
when you study planets when you study

103
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,400
moons satellites of those planets

104
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,200
is there lines that are cl that could be

105
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,599
cleanly drawn or is it just a giant mess

106
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,679
this is all like a fluid let's say not

107
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,679
mess but it's like fluid

108
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,439
uh of what is a planet what is the moon

109
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,640
of a planet what is debris

110
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,039
what is asteroids all that kind of so

111
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,279
there

112
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,199
are technically clear definitions that

113
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,239
were set down by the iau

114
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:43,439
the international astronomy union

115
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,280
um is it size related like what are the

116
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,598
parameters based on so the parameters

117
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,919
are

118
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,679
that it has to orbit the sun which was

119
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,798
essentially to rule out satellites of

120
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,560
course this was a

121
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,000
not very forward-thinking definition

122
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,598
because it technically means that all

123
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,438
extrasolar planets according to that

124
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,158
definition are not planets

125
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,959
um so it has to order uh orbit the sun

126
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,959
it has to be

127
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,598
large enough that its gravity has caused

128
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,120
it to become spherical in shape

129
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,119
which also applies to satellites and

130
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560
also applies to pluto the third part of

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,840
the definition is the thing that really

132
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,640
rules out everything else which is that

133
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,680
it has to has

134
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,839
have cleared out its orbital path um

135
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,519
and because pluto orbits in a belt of

136
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,239
material it doesn't satisfy

137
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,600
that stipulation why didn't it clear out

138
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,319
the path it's not big enough

139
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,080
right knock everybody out of the way um

140
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,279
and this actually is not the first time

141
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,279
it has happened so

142
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,638
series when it was discovered ceres is

143
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,198
the largest asteroid in the asteroid

144
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,720
belt

145
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
and it was originally considered a

146
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,520
planet when it was first discovered and

147
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,199
it went through

148
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,120
exactly the same story history where

149
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,720
people actually realized that it was

150
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,478
just one of many asteroids in the

151
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,320
asteroid belt region and then it got

152
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,000
declassified to an asteroid and now it's

153
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,319
back to a dwarf planet

154
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,478
so there is a lot of reclassification so

155
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,918
to me as somebody who studies

156
00:04:54,478 --> 00:05:00,399
solar system objects i

157
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,079
just personally don't care my level of

158
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,478
interest and something has nothing to do

159
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,199
with

160
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,478
what it's classified as so my favorite

161
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,160
objects in the solar system are all

162
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,599
moons and frequently when i

163
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,759
talk about them i refer to them as

164
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
planets because to me they are

165
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,439
planets they have volcanoes they have

166
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
geology they have atmospheres they're

167
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,800
planet-like

168
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,000
worlds and so the distinction is not

169
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,879
super meaningful to me

170
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but i it is important just for having a

171
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,800
general framework

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,560
for for understanding and talking about

173
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,879
things to have a precise definition

174
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,038
so you don't have a special romantic

175
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,959
like appreciation of a moon versus a

176
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,560
planet versus an asteroid it's just an

177
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,198
object that flies out there and doesn't

178
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,199
really matter

179
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,199
what the categorization is because

180
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,800
there's movies about asteroids and stuff

181
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,240
and then there's like and then there's

182
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,079
movies about you know

183
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
the moon whatever it's a really good

184
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,478
movie

185
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,160
you know there's something about moons

186
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:57,439
that uh that's almost like

187
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,479
an outlier like you think of a moon

188
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,360
as a thing that's the secret part and

189
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,478
the planet

190
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,280
is like the more like vanilla regular

191
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,560
part

192
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,038
none of that you don't have any of that

193
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,478
no i actually do i really satellites are

194
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,399
the moons are my favorite things in the

195
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:15,599
solar system and i think part of

196
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,120
what you're saying i agree from

197
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,319
maybe a slightly different perspective

198
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,360
which is from the perspective of

199
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,840
exploration

200
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,919
we've spent a lot of time sending

201
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,359
spacecraft missions to planets we had a

202
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:26,799
mission to jupiter we had a mission to

203
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,479
saturn we have plenty of missions to

204
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,560
mars and missions to venus

205
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,079
i think that exploration of the moons in

206
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,839
the outer solar system is

207
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,359
the next frontier of solar system

208
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,679
exploration

209
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,199
the belt of debris just real quick

210
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
that's out there

211
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,560
is there something incredible to be

212
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,560
discovered there

213
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,959
again we tend to focus on the planets

214
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,319
and the moons but it feels like

215
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,879
there's probably a lot of stuff out

216
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,120
there and it probably

217
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,399
what is it it's like a garbage collector

218
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,639
from

219
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,239
outside of the solar system isn't it

220
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
like doesn't it protect

221
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,400
from other objects that kind of fly in

222
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,839
and what it just feels like

223
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,359
it's a cool you know you know when you

224
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,159
like walk along the beach and look for

225
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,598
stuff

226
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,439
and like look for sure it feels like

227
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,240
that's that kind of place where you can

228
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,519
find cool

229
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,199
cool weird things or it i guess

230
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,519
in our conversation today when we think

231
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,360
about tools and what science is

232
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,038
studying is there something to be

233
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,879
studied out there or we just don't have

234
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,159
maybe the tools yet or there's nothing

235
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,918
to be found

236
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,280
there's there's absolutely a lot to be

237
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,000
found so the material that's out there

238
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,758
is remnant

239
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
material from the formation of our solar

240
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,520
system it's we don't think it comes from

241
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,160
outside the solar system at least not

242
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,159
most of it

243
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,280
but there are so many

244
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
fascinating objects out there and i i

245
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,799
think what you fit on is exactly right

246
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,560
that we just don't have the tools to

247
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
study them in detail

248
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,478
but we we can look out there and we can

249
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,478
see there are different species of ice

250
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,038
on their surface that tells us about

251
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,800
you know the chemical composition of the

252
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,560
disc that formed our solar system

253
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
some of these objects are way brighter

254
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,319
than they should be meaning they have

255
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,840
some kind of geological activity people

256
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,840
have hypothesized that some of these

257
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,519
objects have subsurface oceans

258
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,878
you could even stretch your imagination

259
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,240
and say some of those oceans could be

260
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,960
habitable

261
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,160
but we can't get very detailed

262
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,079
information about them because they're

263
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,520
so far away and so i think

264
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,519
if any of those objects were in the

265
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,839
inner solar system it would be studied

266
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,719
intently and would be very interesting

267
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:29,758
so would you be able to design a probe

268
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,360
in that like very dense debris field

269
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,158
be able to like hop from one place to

270
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,639
another is that just outside the

271
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,120
realm of like how would you even design

272
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:42,319
devices or sensors that go out there

273
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,480
and take pictures and and land do you

274
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,720
have to land to truly understand

275
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,600
a little piece of rock or can you

276
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,639
understand it from

277
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,399
remotely like fly up close and remotely

278
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,559
observe

279
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,240
you can learn quite a lot from just a

280
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,679
flyby and that's all we're currently

281
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,159
capable of doing in the outer solar

282
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,359
system

283
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:04,000
um the new horizons mission is a recent

284
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,399
example which flew by pluto and then

285
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,839
they had searched for another object

286
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,000
that was out there in the kuiper belt

287
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,080
any object that was basically

288
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
somewhere that they could deflect their

289
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,278
trajectory to actually fly by and so

290
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,879
they did fly by

291
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,879
another object out there in the kuiper

292
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,639
belt and they take pictures and they do

293
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,519
what they can do and if you've seen the

294
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,319
images from

295
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,480
that mission of pluto you can see just

296
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,399
how much detail we have compared to just

297
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,440
the sort of reddish dot that we knew of

298
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,600
before

299
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,040
so you do get an amazing amount of

300
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,519
information actually from just

301
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,159
essentially a high speed flyby it always

302
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,639
makes me

303
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,519
sad to think about flybys that we might

304
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,399
be able to

305
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,839
we might fly by a piece of rock take a

306
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,519
picture

307
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
and think oh that looks pretty and cool

308
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,720
whatever and that you could study

309
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,799
certain like composition of the surface

310
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,120
and so on but it's actually

311
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,240
teeming with life and we won't be able

312
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,278
to see it

313
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,560
at first it's sad because

314
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,320
you know like when you're on a deserted

315
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,599
island you wave your hands and the thing

316
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,600
flies by and you're

317
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,639
trying to get their attention and they

318
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,440
probably do the same

319
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,480
well in their own way bacteria probably

320
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,519
right but

321
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,720
and we we miss it i don't know some

322
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,159
reason it makes me it's a

323
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,160
it's the fomo it's fear of missing out

324
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,000
it makes me sad that there might be life

325
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,278
out there

326
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,559
and we don't we're not in touch with it

327
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:30,159
we're not talking yeah well

328
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:32,399
okay uh a sad uh

329
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,559
pause uh russian philosophical pause

330
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,679
okay what are the tools available to us

331
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,518
to study planets and their moons

332
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,359
oh my goodness that is such a big

333
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,320
question um

334
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,399
so among the fields of astronomy so

335
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,879
planetary science broadly speaking

336
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,240
well it falls kind of at the border of

337
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,958
astronomy

338
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,320
geology climate science chemistry and

339
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,399
even biology so it's kind of on the

340
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,839
border of many things but

341
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,440
part of it falls under the heading of

342
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,399
astronomy and among the things that you

343
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,399
can study

344
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,320
with telescopes like solar system moons

345
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,078
um and planets

346
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,399
the solar system is really unique in

347
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,319
that we can actually send

348
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,000
spacecraft missions to the objects and

349
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,160
study them in detail and so i think

350
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
that's that's the kind of type of tool

351
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,278
that is that people are most aware of

352
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,879
this most popular eyes

353
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,958
these amazing nasa missions that either

354
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,559
you fly by the object you orbit the

355
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,399
object you land on the object

356
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,239
potentially you can

357
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,120
talk about digging into it drilling um

358
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,839
trying to detect tectonic tremors on its

359
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,879
surface

360
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,760
um the types of tools that i use

361
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,360
are primarily telescopes and so i my

362
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,360
background is in

363
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,200
astrophysics and so i actually got into

364
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,680
solar system science from

365
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,200
astronomy not from you know a childhood

366
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,719
fascination with spacecraft missions

367
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,639
which is actually what

368
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,079
a lot of planetary scientists became

369
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,759
planetary scientists because of

370
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,919
childhood fascination with spacecraft

371
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,838
missions which is kind of interesting

372
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,679
for me to talk to people and see that

373
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,600
trajectory i kind of came at it from the

374
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,599
fascination with telescope's angle

375
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,120
do you like telescopes not rockets or at

376
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,680
least when i was a

377
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,959
kid it was looking at the stars and

378
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,559
playing with telescopes that really

379
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,919
fascinated me and that's how i got into

380
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,119
this

381
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,360
but telescopes it's

382
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,200
amazing how much detail and how much

383
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,278
information you can get from

384
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,839
telescopes today you can resolve

385
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,159
individual cloud features and watch them

386
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,519
kind of sheer out in the atmosphere of

387
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,480
titan you can

388
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,560
literally watch volcanoes on io change

389
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,480
from day to day as the the lava flows

390
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,278
expand

391
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,959
so and then you know with spectroscopy

392
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:43,919
you get compositional information on all

393
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:48,078
these things and

394
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:49,439
it's when i started doing solar system

395
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,359
astronomy i was

396
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,880
surprised by how much detail and how

397
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
much information you can get

398
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,120
even from earth and then as well as from

399
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,440
orbit like the hubble space telescope or

400
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,959
the james webb

401
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,200
so with the telescope you can

402
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,879
i mean how much information can you get

403
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,920
about volcanoes about

404
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:13,039
storms about sort of weather

405
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:15,278
just so we kind of get a sense like what

406
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,240
a resolution we're talking about

407
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:20,000
well in terms of resolution so at a you

408
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,000
know on a given night if i go and take a

409
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,320
picture of io and it's volcanoes you can

410
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,399
sometimes see

411
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,000
at least a dozen different volcanoes you

412
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,720
can see the infrared emission coming off

413
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,399
of them and

414
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,720
resolve them separate them from one

415
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,639
another on the surface

416
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,360
and and actually watch how how the heat

417
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,278
coming off of them changes with time

418
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,959
and i think this time variability aspect

419
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,639
is one of the big advantages we get from

420
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,679
telescopes so you send a spacecraft

421
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,360
mission there

422
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:46,958
and you get an incredible amount of

423
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,000
information over a very short time

424
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,239
period but for some

425
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,919
science questions you need to observe

426
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,560
something for

427
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,679
30 years 40 years like let's say you

428
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,039
want to look at the moon

429
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,039
titan which has one of the most

430
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,319
interesting atmospheres in the solar

431
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,679
system

432
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,920
it's orbital period is 29

433
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,039
30 years and so if you want to look at

434
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,039
how

435
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,639
its atmospheric seasons work you have to

436
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,000
observe it over that long of a time

437
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,120
period and you're not going to do that

438
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
with a spacecraft

439
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,320
but you can do it with telescopes can we

440
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,079
uh just

441
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,240
zoom in on certain things like let's

442
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,759
talk about io which is the moon of

443
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,839
uh jupiter right okay it's like epic

444
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,120
there's like volcanoes all over the

445
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,880
place

446
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,519
it's um from a distance it's awesome

447
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,000
so can you tell me about this moon and

448
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,039
you're

449
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,519
sort of uh a scholar of many planets and

450
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,159
moons

451
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,240
but that one kind of stood out to me so

452
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,198
why is that an interesting one

453
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,879
for so many reasons but uh io is it is

454
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,399
the most volcanically active object in

455
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,000
the solar system it has hundreds of

456
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,360
active volcanoes on it

457
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,120
um it has volcanic plumes that go

458
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,959
hundreds of kilometers up above its

459
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,720
surface it puts out

460
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:04,159
more volume of magma per volcano than

461
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,720
volcanoes on earth today um but

462
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,919
i think to me the reason that it's most

463
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,240
interesting is be

464
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,639
is as a laboratory for understanding

465
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,278
planetary processes

466
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,720
so one of the broad goals of planetary

467
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,720
science is to put together

468
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,920
a sort of more general and coherent

469
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,399
framework for how planets work in

470
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,159
general

471
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,919
our current framework you know it

472
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,159
started out very earth-centric we start

473
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,159
to understand how earth volcanoes work

474
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,919
um but then when you try to transport

475
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,399
that to somewhere like io that doesn't

476
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,919
have an atmosphere which makes it

477
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,278
has a very tenuous atmosphere which

478
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,360
makes a big difference for how the the

479
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,879
magma d gases

480
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,000
for something that's really small for

481
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,679
something that has a different heat

482
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,919
source for something that's embedded in

483
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,359
another object's magnetic field

484
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,838
the kind of intuition we have from earth

485
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,959
doesn't apply and so broadly

486
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,839
planetary sciences is trying to broaden

487
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,518
that framework

488
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,519
so that you have a kind of narrative

489
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,039
that all you can understand how each

490
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,278
planet became different from

491
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,879
every other planet and i'm already

492
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,159
making a mistake when i say planet i

493
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,278
mean planets and moons

494
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:11,439
like i said i see the moons as planets

495
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,759
yeah i actually already noticed that you

496
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,399
didn't introduce io as the moon of

497
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,440
jupiter

498
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,278
you you completely you uh you kind of

499
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,720
ignored the fact that jupiter exists

500
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:25,120
it's like let's focus on this

501
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,399
yeah okay so uh and you also didn't

502
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,078
mention europa

503
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,958
which i think is the is that the most

504
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,399
famous moon of jupiter

505
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,000
it's like no one gets attention because

506
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,720
it might have life exactly

507
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,440
yeah but you're but to you i o is also

508
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,879
beautiful

509
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,959
i what's the difference between

510
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,278
volcanoes on io

511
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,719
versus earth you said atmosphere makes a

512
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,838
difference

513
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,360
what uh yeah um the heat source plays a

514
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,759
big role so

515
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,639
um many of the moons in the outer solar

516
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,680
system are heated

517
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,159
from gravitationally by tidal heating um

518
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,638
and i'm

519
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,360
happy to describe what that is or well

520
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,399
yeah please

521
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,919
okay um yes so tidal heating

522
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,880
is it's if you want to understand and

523
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,319
contextualize

524
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,919
planets and moons you have to understand

525
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,798
their heat sources

526
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,400
um so for earth we have radioactive

527
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,240
decay in our interior as well as

528
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,360
residual heat of formation

529
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,720
but for satellites tidal heating plays a

530
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,759
really significant role and in

531
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,360
particular in

532
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,959
driving geological activity on

533
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,958
satellites

534
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,360
and potentially making those subsurface

535
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,558
oceans in places like europa enceladus

536
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,558
habitable and so the way that that works

537
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,839
is if you have multiple moons

538
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,519
and their orbital periods are integer

539
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,359
multiples of one another

540
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,558
that means that they're always

541
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,240
encountering each other

542
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:48,240
at the same point in the orbit

543
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,359
so if they were on just random orbits

544
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,200
they'd be encountering each other at

545
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,279
random places and the gravitational

546
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,360
effect between the two moons would be

547
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,960
canceling out over time but because

548
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,038
they're always meeting each other at the

549
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,279
same point in the orbit

550
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,240
those gravitational interactions add up

551
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,798
coherently

552
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,759
um and so that tweaks them into

553
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,759
eccentric orbits

554
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,038
so eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit

555
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,038
it just means

556
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,879
non-circular so a deviation from a

557
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,720
circular orbit and that means that you

558
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,240
know for io or europa

559
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,079
it's some points in their orbit they're

560
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,160
closer to jupiter and at some points in

561
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:25,199
the orbit they're farther away

562
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,320
and so when they're closer they're

563
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,160
stretched out in a sense but but

564
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,439
literally just not very stretched out

565
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
like a couple hundred meters something

566
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,919
like that

567
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,599
and then when they're farthest away

568
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,000
they're less stretched out and so you

569
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,000
actually have the shape of the object

570
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,440
deforming over the course of the orbit

571
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,400
and these orbits are like just a couple

572
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,038
of days

573
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,160
and so that in the case of io that is

574
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,879
literally

575
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,720
sufficient friction in its mantle to

576
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,080
melt the rock of its mantle

577
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,839
and that's what generates the magma

578
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:58,159
that's that's the source of the

579
00:18:53,839 --> 00:19:01,038
the okay so why is your so europa

580
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,960
is i thought there was like ice and

581
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,319
oceans underneath kind of thing

582
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,400
so why is europe and not getting the

583
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,918
friction it is it's just a little bit

584
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,038
farther away from jupiter and then

585
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,600
ganymede is also

586
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,960
in the orbital resonance so it's a three

587
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,599
object orbital resonance

588
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,600
in the jupiter system but we have these

589
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,480
sorts of orbital resonances all over the

590
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,558
solar system and also in exoplanets

591
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,720
so for europa basically because it's

592
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,279
farther from jupiter the effect is not

593
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,279
as extreme but you do still have heat

594
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,359
generated in its interior in this way

595
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,279
and that may be driving

596
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,719
could be driving hydrothermal activity

597
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,119
at the base of its ocean

598
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,558
which obviously would be a really

599
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,798
valuable thing for life

600
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:41,759
cool so it's like heating up the ocean a

601
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,839
little bit

602
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,839
heating up the ocean a little bit and

603
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,918
specifically in these like hydrothermal

604
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,480
vents where we see really interesting

605
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,038
uh life evolve in the bottom of earth's

606
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,480
oceans

607
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,480
that's cool okay so what's uh what's io

608
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,919
um what else so we know the source is

609
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,000
this friction

610
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,840
but there's no atmosphere i'm trying to

611
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,960
get a sense of what it's like if

612
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,480
if you and i were to visit io

613
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,640
like what would that look like what

614
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,798
would it feel like

615
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,320
is it is the entire thing covered in

616
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,359
basically

617
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,439
uh volcanoes um

618
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,359
so it's it's interesting because there's

619
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,798
very little atmosphere the surface is

620
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,879
actually really cold

621
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,480
very far below freezing on the surface

622
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,080
when you're away from a volcano but the

623
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,400
volcanoes themselves

624
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,759
are over a thousand degrees or the the

625
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,679
magma when it comes out is over a

626
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,200
thousand degrees and so

627
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,519
but it does come to the surface the

628
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,159
magma it does yeah

629
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,960
in particular places oh that probably

630
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,720
looks beautiful

631
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,038
so like so it's frozen not ice like what

632
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,159
is

633
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:49,359
uh is rock it's really cold rock

634
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,960
and then you just have this like uh

635
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,279
what is what does that look what would

636
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,880
that look like with no atmosphere

637
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,798
would that uh would it be smoke

638
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,320
what does it look like was it's just

639
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:03,839
magma like just red

640
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:06,319
yellow like liquidy things uh it's

641
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,519
it's black it's black and red i guess

642
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,240
like think of

643
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,599
the type of magma that you see in hawaii

644
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,240
so different types of magma

645
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,158
flow in different ways for example so in

646
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,640
somewhere like io the magma is really

647
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,640
hot and so it will flow out in

648
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,000
sheets because it has really low

649
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,360
viscosity

650
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,079
um and i think the the lava flows that

651
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,678
we've been having

652
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,720
in hawaii over the past couple years are

653
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,080
probably a decent analogy although um

654
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,279
ios magmas lavas are even more fluid and

655
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,158
and faster moving like what uh how fat

656
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,918
like

657
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,200
if you oh by the way sorry through the

658
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,600
telescope

659
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,679
are you tracking at what time scale like

660
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,319
what the for every frame

661
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,919
is how far apart if you're looking for a

662
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,399
telescope are we talking about

663
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,120
seconds or we're talking about days

664
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,280
months

665
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,719
when you kind of track try to get a

666
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,678
picture of what the surface might look

667
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,240
like

668
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,400
what's the frequency so it depends a

669
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,240
little bit on what you want to do

670
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,559
i ideally every night

671
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,319
but you could take a frame every second

672
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,480
and see how things are changing

673
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,839
the the problem with that is that for

674
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,880
things to change on a one

675
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:18,158
second time scale you to actually see

676
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,159
something change that fast you have to

677
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,600
have super high resolution the spatial

678
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,120
resolution we have is a couple hundred

679
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,839
kilometers and so

680
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,918
okay things are not changing on those

681
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,558
scales over one second unless you have

682
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,559
something really crazy happening

683
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,158
so if you get you if you get a telescope

684
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,200
closer to io

685
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,400
if you get uh or a camera closer to io

686
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,640
would you be able to understand

687
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,120
something is that something of interest

688
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
to you

689
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,319
it would you be able to understand

690
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,280
something deeper about

691
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:48,480
these volcanic eruptions and how magma

692
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,678
flows and

693
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,558
just the like the rate of the magmas or

694
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,200
is it basically

695
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,000
enough to have the kilometer resolution

696
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,400
no way

697
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,679
we want to go there you want to go you

698
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,120
want to go to iowa i mean i don't want

699
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,320
to go there personally but i want to

700
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,959
send a spacecraft mission there

701
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,839
absolutely

702
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,319
why why are you scared why am i scared

703
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:11,119
oh you mean you don't

704
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,519
like i don't want to go there as a human

705
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,199
human

706
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,639
i want to send a robot there to look at

707
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,480
it this is again everybody's

708
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,038
discriminating against robots this is

709
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,400
not but it's fine uh but it's not

710
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,480
hospitable to uh

711
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,559
humans in any way right so it's very

712
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,159
cold and very hot

713
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:30,079
it's very cold um the atmosphere is

714
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,919
composed of sulfur dioxide

715
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,359
so you couldn't breathe it there's no

716
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,640
pressure i mean it's kind of all the

717
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,519
same things you talk about

718
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,200
one talks about about mars only worse

719
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,558
the atmosphere is still a thousand times

720
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,400
less dense than mars's

721
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,839
and the radiation environment is

722
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,480
terrible because you're embedded

723
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,079
deep within jupiter's magnetic field and

724
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,120
jupiter's magnetic field is

725
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,519
full of charged particles that have all

726
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,959
come

727
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,639
out of ios volcanoes actually um so

728
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,919
juveder's magnetic field strips all this

729
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,520
material out of ios atmosphere

730
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,200
and that populates its entire

731
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,119
magnetosphere and then that material

732
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,720
comes back around and hits io and

733
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,439
spreads throughout the system actually

734
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,839
it's just

735
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,400
it's like a io is the massive polluter

736
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:17,439
of the jupiter system

737
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,640
okay cool uh so what uh what is studying

738
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,600
io

739
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,120
uh teach you about volcanoes on earth or

740
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,639
vice versa

741
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:32,639
is in the difference of the two

742
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:34,640
what uh insights can you mine out

743
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,159
that might be interesting in some way

744
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,520
yeah it's

745
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,520
we try to port the tools that we use to

746
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,798
study earth volcanism to io and it works

747
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,400
to some extent but

748
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:48,480
it is challenging because the

749
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,919
situations are so different and the

750
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,640
compositions are really different when

751
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,880
you talk about

752
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
outgassing you know earth volcanoes

753
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,880
outgas primarily

754
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,640
water and carbon dioxide and then sulfur

755
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,919
dioxide is the the third

756
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,600
most abundant gas and and on io the

757
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:08,240
water and carbon dioxide are not there

758
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,240
either it didn't form with them or it

759
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,240
lost them we don't know and so so the

760
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,679
chemistry of how the magma outgasses is

761
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,759
completely different

762
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:20,400
um but the the kind of one to me

763
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,200
most interesting analogy to earth is

764
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,798
that

765
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,720
um so io as i've said it has these

766
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,278
really low viscosity magmas the

767
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,000
the lava spreads really quickly across

768
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,480
its surface

769
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,240
it can put out massive volumes of magma

770
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,319
in relatively short periods of time

771
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,759
and that sort of volcanism is not

772
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,879
happening anywhere else in the solar

773
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,919
system today

774
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,799
but literally every terrestrial planet

775
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,559
and the moon

776
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:49,038
um had this what we call very effusive

777
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,558
volcanism early in their history okay so

778
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,400
this is almost like a little glimpse

779
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,038
into the early history of earth yeah

780
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,360
okay cool so uh what are the chances

781
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:59,919
that uh a volcano on earth destroys all

782
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:01,678
of human civilization

783
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,360
maybe i wanted to sneak in that question

784
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,120
yeah a volcano on earth

785
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,839
um do you think about that kind of stuff

786
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,038
when you just

787
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,639
study volcanoes elsewhere because in it

788
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:13,278
kind of humbling to see something so

789
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,320
powerful

790
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,759
and so hot like so unpleasant for humans

791
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,519
and then you realize we're sitting on

792
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,240
many of them here right

793
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,519
yeah yellowstone as a classic example i

794
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,079
i don't

795
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,079
know what the chances are of that

796
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,678
happening my intuition would be that the

797
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,879
chances of that are lower than the

798
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,200
chances of

799
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,960
us getting wiped out by some other means

800
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,640
so that in the time

801
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,840
you know that maybe it'll happen

802
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,278
eventually that there will be one of

803
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,959
these massive volcanoes on earth but

804
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,000
we'll probably be gone by then by some

805
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,720
other means

806
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,599
not to sound bleak but it's very

807
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,960
comforting

808
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:55,359
okay so can we talk about um europa

809
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,440
is there um so maybe can you talk about

810
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,839
the intuition the hope that people have

811
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,720
about life being in europa

812
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,519
maybe also what are the things we know

813
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,880
about it

814
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,879
what are things to you that are

815
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,480
interesting about that particular moon

816
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,760
of jupiter

817
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,120
sure yeah europa is from many

818
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:14,319
perspectives one of the really

819
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,918
interesting

820
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:19,200
places in the solar system among the

821
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,320
solar system moons so there are a few

822
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,720
there has there's a lot of interest in

823
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,158
looking for or understanding the

824
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,600
potential for life to evolve in the

825
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,240
subsurface oceans

826
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:32,158
i think it's fairly widely accepted that

827
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,120
the chances of life evolving on the

828
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,520
surfaces of really anything in the solar

829
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:42,798
system is very low

830
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:44,720
the radiation environment is too harsh

831
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,839
and there's there's just not liquids on

832
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,679
the surface of most of these things and

833
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:51,038
it's canonically accepted that liquids

834
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,360
are required for life

835
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,119
um and so the subsurface oceans in

836
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,839
addition to maybe titan's atmosphere the

837
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:00,479
subsurface oceans of the icy satellites

838
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:03,278
uh are one of the most plausible places

839
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,440
in the solar system for life to evolve

840
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,519
europa and enceladus are interesting

841
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,240
because for many of the big satellites

842
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,558
so

843
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,839
ganymede and callisto also satellites of

844
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,440
jupiter also are thought to have

845
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,798
subsurface oceans

846
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,080
but um they are so they have these ice

847
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:19,200
shells and then there's an ocean

848
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,359
underneath the ice shell

849
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,720
but on those moons around ganymede we

850
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,519
think that there's another ice shell

851
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,159
underneath

852
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,879
and then there's rock and the reason

853
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,960
that that is a problem for life is that

854
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,480
your ocean is probably just pure water

855
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,919
because it's trapped between two

856
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,159
big shells of ice uh so europa

857
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,759
doesn't have this ice shell at the

858
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,080
bottom of the ocean we think

859
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,079
and so the water and rock are in direct

860
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,240
interaction and so that means that you

861
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,759
can basically dissolve a lot of material

862
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,519
out of the rock you potentially have

863
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,798
this hydrothermal activity that's

864
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,759
injecting

865
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,960
energy and nutrients for life to survive

866
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,440
and so this

867
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,480
water interface is is considered really

868
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,320
important

869
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,798
for the potential habitability

870
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,480
as a small aside you kind of said that

871
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,519
it's canonically assumed that

872
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,399
uh light water is required for life

873
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,839
is it possible to have life uh like in

874
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,798
the volcano

875
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,839
i remember people are at that like in

876
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,480
that

877
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,158
national geographic program or something

878
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,079
kind of hypothesizing that you can

879
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,600
really have life anywhere so as long as

880
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,439
there's a source of heat

881
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,719
a source of energy do you think it's

882
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,080
possible to have

883
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,079
life in a volcano like no water

884
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,399
i think anything's possible

885
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,119
i think it's so water it doesn't have to

886
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,079
be

887
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,439
water that's sort of you can tell as you

888
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,678
identified i phrased that really

889
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,399
carefully it's canonically accepted that

890
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,000
um because we recognize that you know

891
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:52,798
scientists recognize that we have no

892
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,558
idea

893
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,079
what broad range of life could be out

894
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,079
there and all we really have is our

895
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,678
biases of life as we know it

896
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,000
but for life as we know it it's very

897
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,440
helpful to have or even necessary to

898
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,519
have some kind of

899
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,038
liquid and preferably a polar solvent

900
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,639
that can actually dissolve molecules

901
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:12,480
something like water so the case of

902
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
liquid methane on titan is less ideal

903
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,120
from that perspective

904
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,678
but you know liquid magma if it stays

905
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:19,839
liquid

906
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,679
long enough for life to evolve you have

907
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,439
a heat source you have a liquid you have

908
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,399
nutrients in theory that checks your

909
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,440
three

910
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,759
classic astrobiology boxes

911
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,440
um that'd be fascinating i mean it'd be

912
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:32,480
fascinating if it's possible to detect

913
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,960
it easily

914
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,440
how would we detect if there is life on

915
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,240
europa

916
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,440
is um is it possible to do in a

917
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,278
non-contact way

918
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,360
from a distance through telescopes and

919
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:49,200
so on

920
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:51,038
or do we need to send robots and do some

921
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,960
drilling

922
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,319
i think realistically you need to do the

923
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,399
drilling um

924
00:30:54,319 --> 00:31:00,319
there's so europa also has these long

925
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,319
tectonic features on its surface where

926
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,079
it's thought that

927
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,079
there's potential for water from the

928
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,960
ocean to be somehow making its way

929
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,798
up onto the surface and you could

930
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,399
imagine some out there scenario where

931
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:13,839
there's bacteria in the ocean it's

932
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:14,398
somehow working its way up through the

933
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,240
ice shell

934
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,558
it's spilling out on the surface it's

935
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,960
being killed by the radiation

936
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,359
but your instrument could detect some

937
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,880
spectroscopic signature of that

938
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,798
dead bacterium but that's you know

939
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,559
that's many ifs and assumptions

940
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:29,918
that's a hope because then you don't

941
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,720
have to do that much drilling you can

942
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,240
collect from the surface right or even

943
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,919
i'm thinking even remotely oh remotely

944
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,240
yeah that's sad that there's a

945
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,080
single cell civilization living

946
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,720
underneath all that ice

947
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,278
trying trying trying to get up trying to

948
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,120
get out

949
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,919
so enceladus gives you a slightly better

950
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,239
chance of that

951
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,200
because enceladus is a is a moon of

952
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,038
saturn

953
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,720
and it's broadly similar to europa in

954
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,558
some ways it's an icy satellite it has a

955
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,600
subsurface ocean that's probably

956
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,720
in touch with the rocky interior but it

957
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,319
has these massive

958
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,399
geysers at its south pole where it's

959
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,720
spewing out material that appears to be

960
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:16,000
originating all the way from the ocean

961
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,880
and so in that case you could

962
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,880
potentially fly through that plume and

963
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,480
scoop up that material and hope that at

964
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,159
the velocities you'd be scooping it up

965
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,720
you're not destroying any signature of

966
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,880
the life you're looking for

967
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,558
but let's say that you have some

968
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,039
ingenuity and can come up with a way to

969
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,599
do that

970
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:36,158
you know it potentially gives you a more

971
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:39,439
direct opportunity at least to try to

972
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,480
measure those bacteria directly

973
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,038
can you tell me a little more on uh how

974
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,000
do you pronounce it

975
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,599
enceladus enceladus can you tell me a

976
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,240
little bit more about enceladus

977
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,079
like uh we've been talking about way too

978
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,278
much about jupiter

979
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,278
saturn doesn't get enough

980
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,840
uh saturn doesn't get as much love so

981
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,080
what's what's enceladus uh

982
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,879
is that the most exciting moon of uh

983
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,759
saturn

984
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,360
depends on your perspective um it's it's

985
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:11,679
very exciting from a

986
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,798
astrobiology perspective i think

987
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,278
enceladus and

988
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,798
titan are the two most unique and

989
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,558
interesting moons of saturn that

990
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,440
definitely both get the most

991
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,240
attention also from the life perspective

992
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,880
um

993
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,000
so what's more likely uh titan or

994
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,000
enceladus for life

995
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,158
if you were to uh bet all your money in

996
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,759
terms of like investing

997
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,360
wish to investigate what what are the

998
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:38,480
difference between the two

999
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:40,879
that are interesting to you yeah so

1000
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,558
the potential for life in each of those

1001
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,278
two places is very

1002
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,519
different so titan is the the one place

1003
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,119
in the solar system where you might

1004
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,880
imagine again all of this is so

1005
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,678
speculative but you might imagine

1006
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,640
life evolving in the atmosphere so the

1007
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,480
from

1008
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,919
a biology perspective titan is

1009
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,000
interesting because

1010
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,519
it forms complex organic molecules in

1011
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,119
its atmosphere

1012
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,120
it has a dense atmosphere it's actually

1013
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,079
denser than earth's it's the only moon

1014
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,878
that has what

1015
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,480
an atmosphere denser than earth it's got

1016
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,159
tons of methane in it what happens is

1017
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,000
that methane gets irradiated it breaks

1018
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,280
up and it reforms with other things in

1019
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,398
the atmosphere

1020
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,119
it makes these complex organic molecules

1021
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:23,199
and it's effectively doing prebiotic

1022
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,240
chemistry in the atmosphere

1023
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:29,519
while still being freezing cold uh

1024
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,000
yes okay what what would that be like

1025
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,039
would that be pleasant for humans to

1026
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,719
hang out there

1027
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,320
it's just really cold there's nowhere in

1028
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,039
the solar system that would be pleasant

1029
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,119
for humans

1030
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,398
um it would be cold you couldn't breathe

1031
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,639
the air um

1032
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,719
but colonization wise if there's an

1033
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,159
atmosphere isn't that a big plus

1034
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:52,000
or still a ton of radiation

1035
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,358
so okay so titan

1036
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,639
that that's a really nice feature that

1037
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,239
the light could be in the atmosphere

1038
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,039
because then it's it's that might be

1039
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,559
remotely observable or certainly is more

1040
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:05,599
accessible if you visit okay

1041
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,639
so uh what about enceladus so that would

1042
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,039
be

1043
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,679
still in the ocean right and enceladus

1044
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,000
has

1045
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,519
the advantage like i said of spewing

1046
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,119
material out of its south pole so you

1047
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,960
could collect it but it has

1048
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,200
the disadvantage of the fact that we

1049
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,240
don't actually really understand

1050
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:25,199
how its ocean could

1051
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,000
stay froze or sorry could stay globally

1052
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,239
liquid

1053
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,239
over the age of the solar system and so

1054
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,759
there are some models that say

1055
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,799
that it's going through this um cyclical

1056
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,119
evolution

1057
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,519
where the ocean freezes completely and

1058
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,838
thaws completely and the orbit sort of

1059
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:45,838
um oscillates in and out of these

1060
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:48,239
eccentricities um and in that case

1061
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,000
the potential for life ever occurring

1062
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,279
there in the first place is a lot lower

1063
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,320
because if you only have an ocean for

1064
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,760
100 million years

1065
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,440
is that enough time and it also

1066
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,800
means there might be mass extinction

1067
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,920
events if it does occur

1068
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,839
right it just freezes again very sad man

1069
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,960
this is very depressing all the like

1070
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:09,039
slaughter of

1071
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:12,800
life elsewhere how unlikely do you think

1072
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:14,960
life is on earth so when you look

1073
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,160
when you study other planets and you

1074
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,199
study the contents of other planets

1075
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:23,759
does that give you a perspective on

1076
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,039
the origin of life on earth which again

1077
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,960
is full of mystery

1078
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,079
in itself not the evolution but the

1079
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,519
origin

1080
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,320
the first springing to life like from

1081
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,960
from nothing to life from the basic

1082
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,960
ingredients to life

1083
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,720
and i guess another way of asking it is

1084
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,000
how unique are we

1085
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,319
yeah it's a great question and it's one

1086
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,159
that

1087
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,440
just scientifically we don't have an

1088
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,078
answer to

1089
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,400
we don't even know how many times life

1090
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,160
evolved on earth if it was only once or

1091
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,160
if it happened independently a thousand

1092
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,679
times in different places

1093
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,440
uh we don't know whether it's happened

1094
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:01,759
anywhere else

1095
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,559
in the universe although it feels absurd

1096
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,280
to believe

1097
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,639
that we are the only life that evolved

1098
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,040
in the entire universe but

1099
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:13,118
it's conceivable we just have just no

1100
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,719
real information we don't understand

1101
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,079
really how life came about in the first

1102
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,000
place on earth

1103
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,519
i mean so if you look at the drake

1104
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,880
equation

1105
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:25,358
that tries to estimate how many alien

1106
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,160
civilizations are out there

1107
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,519
planets have a big part to play in that

1108
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,559
equation

1109
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:35,280
if you were to bet money uh

1110
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,078
in terms of the odds of origins of life

1111
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,519
on earth

1112
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,000
i mean this all has to do with how

1113
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,599
special and unique is earth

1114
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,920
what you land in terms of the number of

1115
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,559
civilizations has to do with

1116
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,519
how unique their rare earth hypothesis

1117
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,159
is how

1118
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,480
rare special is earth how rare and

1119
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,199
special is the solar system

1120
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,599
like if you had to bet all your money on

1121
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:57,679
a

1122
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,800
on a completely unscientific question

1123
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:00,480
well no actually it's actually

1124
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,680
rigorously scientific we just don't know

1125
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,599
a lot of things

1126
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,879
in that equation there's a lot of

1127
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,280
mysteries about that

1128
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,119
and it's slowly becoming better and

1129
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,000
better understood in terms of exoplanets

1130
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,000
in terms of

1131
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,159
how many solar systems are out there

1132
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,960
where there's planets their earth-like

1133
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,399
planets is

1134
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,639
getting better and better understood

1135
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,519
what's your sense

1136
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:23,679
from that perspective um how many alien

1137
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,159
civilizations out there

1138
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,039
so zero or one you're right that the

1139
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:29,598
equation

1140
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,039
is is being better understood but you're

1141
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,720
really only talking about the first

1142
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,239
three parameters in the equation or

1143
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:36,319
something you know how many stars are

1144
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:38,319
there how many planets per star

1145
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,760
and then we're just barely scratching

1146
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,599
the surface of what fraction of those

1147
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,119
planets might be habitable

1148
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,680
the rest of the terms in the equation

1149
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,519
are like how likely is life to evolve

1150
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,598
give inhabitable conditions how likely

1151
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,800
is it to survive all these things

1152
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,119
um they're all these huge unknowns

1153
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,680
actually i i remember when i first

1154
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,720
saw that equation i think i was i think

1155
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,559
it was my first year

1156
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:02,319
of college and i thought this is

1157
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,719
ridiculous this is

1158
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,680
a common sense that didn't need to give

1159
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,799
a given name

1160
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,000
you know um and b just a bunch of

1161
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,599
unknowns it's like

1162
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,280
putting our ignorance together in one

1163
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,519
equation but i've actually

1164
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,320
now i understand this equation you know

1165
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,400
it's not

1166
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,599
something we ever necessarily have the

1167
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,440
answer to it's

1168
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,880
it just gives us a framework for having

1169
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,679
the exact conversation we're having

1170
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,519
right now

1171
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:27,118
and i think that's how it was intended

1172
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,800
in the first place when it was was put

1173
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,720
into writing was to to give people a

1174
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,039
language to communicate about

1175
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,279
the factors that go into the potential

1176
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,599
for aliens to

1177
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,040
be out there and for us to find them um

1178
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,240
i i would

1179
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:45,519
put money on there being aliens i

1180
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:47,919
would not put money on

1181
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,559
us having definitive evidence of them in

1182
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,200
my lifetime

1183
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,759
well definitive is a funny is a funny

1184
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,639
word

1185
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,680
because uh my sense is this is the

1186
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,480
saddest part

1187
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:03,598
for me is my sense in terms of

1188
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,440
intelligent alien civilizations

1189
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,720
i feel like we're so

1190
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,039
we're so self-obsessed that we literally

1191
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,439
would not be able to detect them

1192
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,318
even when they're like in front of us

1193
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,440
like like

1194
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:21,759
trees could be aliens but just their

1195
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,440
intelligence could be

1196
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,280
realized on a scale on a time scale

1197
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,559
or physical scale that we're not

1198
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,880
appreciating

1199
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,599
like trees could be way more intelligent

1200
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,440
than us

1201
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,200
i don't know it's just a dumb example it

1202
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,720
could be rocks rock

1203
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:40,399
or it could be things like

1204
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,559
this i love this this is the dawkins

1205
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,519
memes it could be that ideas

1206
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,119
are the like ideas we have like where do

1207
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,759
ideas come from where do thoughts come

1208
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,280
from

1209
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,000
maybe thoughts are the aliens or

1210
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,839
maybe thoughts is the actual mechanisms

1211
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,400
of communication

1212
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,679
in uh physics right this is like we

1213
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,838
think of thoughts as something that

1214
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:05,118
springs up from neurons

1215
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:08,239
firing where the hell they come from

1216
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,400
and now what about consciousness maybe

1217
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:13,519
consciousness is the communication

1218
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,079
it sounds like ridiculous but like

1219
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,838
we're so self-centered on this uh

1220
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,160
space-time

1221
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,239
communication and physical space using

1222
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,679
like written language

1223
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:27,679
like spoken with audio

1224
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,919
on a time scale that's very specific on

1225
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:34,159
a physical scale it's very specific

1226
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,240
uh so so i i tend to think that uh but

1227
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,000
bacteria will probably recognize like

1228
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,159
like moving organisms will probably

1229
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,440
recognize but when that forms itself

1230
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,358
into intelligence

1231
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,800
most likely it'll be robots of some kind

1232
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:46,239
because we won't be making

1233
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,920
the origins we'll be meeting the

1234
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,919
creations of those

1235
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,680
intelligences we just would not be able

1236
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,119
to to appreciate it and that's the

1237
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,318
saddest thing to me

1238
00:41:53,119 --> 00:42:00,559
that uh we we

1239
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:03,759
yeah we when we're too dumb

1240
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:05,679
to see aliens uh like we're two

1241
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,280
we kind of think like look at the

1242
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,318
progress of science we've accomplished

1243
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,760
so much

1244
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,239
the sad thing it could be that we're

1245
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,680
just like in the first point zero zero

1246
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,679
zero one percent of understanding

1247
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:16,399
anything it's humbling i hope that's

1248
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,519
true

1249
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,160
because i feel like we're very ignorant

1250
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,838
as a species and i hope that our current

1251
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:25,199
level of knowledge only represents the

1252
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,358
0.001

1253
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,598
of what we will someday achieve that

1254
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,920
actually feels optimistic to me

1255
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,480
well that i feel like that's easier for

1256
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,318
us to comprehend in the space of biology

1257
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,079
and not as easy to comprehend in the

1258
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:39,759
space of physics for example

1259
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,119
because we have a sense that like we

1260
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,960
have

1261
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,800
it like if you if you talk to

1262
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,559
theoretical physicists

1263
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,079
they have a sense that we understand the

1264
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:52,078
basic laws

1265
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:55,359
that form the nature of reality

1266
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,640
of our universe but so there's much more

1267
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:57,759
complex physicists and much more

1268
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,199
confident

1269
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,200
biologists are like uh

1270
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,800
this is a squishy mess we're doing our

1271
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,520
best

1272
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,039
uh physicists but i would be it'd be

1273
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,559
fascinating to see if physicists

1274
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:13,519
themselves would also be humble

1275
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,519
by their being like what the hell is

1276
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:18,400
dark matter in dark energy

1277
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,199
what what the hell is the not just the

1278
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,920
origin of the

1279
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:24,078
not just the big bang but uh everything

1280
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,358
that happened since the big bang

1281
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,960
a lot of things that happened since the

1282
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:28,719
big bang we have no ideas about except

1283
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,960
basic models of physics right

1284
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,318
what happened before the big bang yeah

1285
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,599
yeah what happened before

1286
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,119
or what's happening inside the black

1287
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,240
hole why is there a black hole at the

1288
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,079
center of our galaxy

1289
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,279
can somebody answer this a super massive

1290
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,519
black hole

1291
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,119
nobody knows how it started and they

1292
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,559
seem to be like in the middle of all

1293
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,960
galaxies

1294
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,960
um so that could be a portal for aliens

1295
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:53,039
to communicate through conscious okay

1296
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,039
um all right back to planets how um

1297
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,440
what's your favorite outside of earth

1298
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:00,000
what's your favorite planet or moon

1299
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,679
maybe outside of the ones well first

1300
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,800
have we talked about it already

1301
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,000
or and then if we did mention it what's

1302
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,680
the one outside of that

1303
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,679
oh gosh and to come up with another

1304
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,358
favorite that's not io oh iowa's the

1305
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,480
favorite oh absolutely why is iowa the

1306
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,719
favorite

1307
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,880
i mean basically everything i've i've

1308
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,919
already said it's just such an amazing

1309
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,960
and unique

1310
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,240
object um but

1311
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,679
on i guess a personal note it's probably

1312
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,479
the object that

1313
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,799
made me become a planetary scientist

1314
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,800
it's

1315
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,318
the first thing in the solar system that

1316
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:39,119
really deeply captured my interest

1317
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,440
um and when i started my phd i wanted to

1318
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,640
be

1319
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,240
an astrophysicist working on things like

1320
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,039
galaxy evolution

1321
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,879
um and sort of slowly i had done some

1322
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,800
projects in the solar system but io was

1323
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,760
the thing that like really caught me

1324
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,800
in to doing solar system science okay

1325
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,440
let's let's leave

1326
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,720
uh moons aside what's your favorite

1327
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,159
planet

1328
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:02,078
it sounds like you like moons better

1329
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:05,039
than planets so it's uh

1330
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,359
that's accurate but the planets are are

1331
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,199
fascinating i think

1332
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:11,119
you know i find the planets in the solar

1333
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,239
system really fascinating what i like

1334
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,838
about the moons

1335
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,399
is that they there's so much less that

1336
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,318
is

1337
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,400
known there's still a lot more discovery

1338
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:23,358
space and the questions that we can ask

1339
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,000
are still the the bigger questions

1340
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:27,598
which you know i and maybe i'm being

1341
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
unfair to the planets because we're

1342
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,079
still

1343
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,440
trying to understand things like was

1344
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,599
there ever life on mars

1345
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,800
and that is a huge question and one that

1346
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:38,000
we've sent numerous

1347
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,680
robots to mars to try to answer so maybe

1348
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,159
i'm being unfair to the planets but but

1349
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:42,399
there is

1350
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:43,920
certainly quite a bit more information

1351
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,880
that we have about the planets than the

1352
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,599
moons

1353
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,200
but i mean venus is is a fascinating

1354
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,000
object so

1355
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,199
i like the objects that lie at the

1356
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,039
extremes

1357
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,919
i think that if we can make a sort of

1358
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,440
theory or

1359
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,440
like i've been saying framework for

1360
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,440
understanding planets and moons that can

1361
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,880
incorporate even the most extreme ones

1362
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,920
then you know those are the things that

1363
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,160
really test your

1364
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,159
theory and test your understanding and

1365
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,000
so they've always really fascinated me

1366
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:13,118
not so much the nice habitable places

1367
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,440
like earth but

1368
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,400
these extreme places like venus that

1369
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,400
have

1370
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:23,358
um sulfuric acid clouds and

1371
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,480
just incredibly hot and dense surfaces

1372
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,519
and venus of course

1373
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,079
i love volcanism for some reason and

1374
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,358
venus

1375
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:34,000
has probably has volcanic activity

1376
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:37,519
definitely has in the recent past maybe

1377
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,920
has ongoing today what do you

1378
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:42,159
make of the news maybe you can update it

1379
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,039
in terms of life being discovered in the

1380
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:46,159
atmosphere of

1381
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,599
venus is that sorry okay

1382
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,480
you have opinion i can already tell you

1383
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,200
have opinions was that fake news

1384
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,880
i got excited i saw that what's the

1385
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:56,799
what's the final uh

1386
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,640
is there a life on venus so the

1387
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,039
detection that was reported was the

1388
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:04,960
detection of the molecule phosphine

1389
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:07,599
um and they said

1390
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,400
that they tried every other mechanism

1391
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:13,440
they could think of to produce phosphine

1392
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,800
and they none of no mechanism worked

1393
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,200
and then they said well we know that

1394
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,680
life produces phosphine and so that was

1395
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,919
sort of

1396
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:23,759
the train of logic and um

1397
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,358
i don't personally believe that

1398
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,160
phosphene was detected in the first

1399
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:28,639
place

1400
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:29,519
okay so i mean this is just one study

1401
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,960
but i

1402
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:36,400
as a layman i'm skeptical

1403
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:39,838
a little bit about tools that

1404
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:43,920
sense the contents of an atmosphere like

1405
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:45,838
contents of an atmosphere from remotely

1406
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,119
and making conclusive statements about

1407
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,039
life

1408
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,720
oh yeah well that connection that you

1409
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:51,679
just made the contents of the atmosphere

1410
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:54,719
to the life

1411
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:57,519
yeah is is a tricky one and

1412
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,118
yeah i know that that claim received a

1413
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,519
lot of criticism for

1414
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,720
the lines of logic that went from

1415
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,920
detection to

1416
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:07,279
uh to claim of life even the detection

1417
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,079
itself though

1418
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,040
did doesn't doesn't meet the sort of

1419
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,480
historical

1420
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:17,920
scientific standards of of a detection

1421
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,679
um the it was a very tenuous detection

1422
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,480
and only one line of the species was

1423
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,358
detected

1424
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,800
and a lot of really complicated data

1425
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,759
analysis methods had to be

1426
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,240
applied to even make that weak detection

1427
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,880
yeah

1428
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,558
um so it could be it could be noise it

1429
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,318
could be polluted data it could be all

1430
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,760
those things and so it doesn't have it

1431
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,000
doesn't meet the

1432
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,960
the level of rigor that you would hope

1433
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,199
but of course

1434
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,358
i mean we're doing our best and it's

1435
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:46,078
clear that uh

1436
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:46,960
the human species are hopeful to find

1437
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,599
life

1438
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,039
clearly yes everyone is so excited about

1439
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,599
that possibility

1440
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:56,000
all right let's uh let me ask you about

1441
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,000
mars

1442
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:05,279
so um there's a guy named elon musk

1443
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,200
and uh he seems to want to take

1444
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,000
something called dogecoin there

1445
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:11,759
first of the moon i'm just i'm just

1446
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,639
kidding about the tushcoin i

1447
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,240
i even know what the what the heck is uh

1448
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:20,159
up with that whole uh

1449
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:24,078
i think uh i think humor

1450
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:27,118
has power in the 21st century

1451
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,839
in a way to spread ideas in the most

1452
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,480
positive way

1453
00:49:28,838 --> 00:49:35,759
so i love that kind of humor

1454
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,800
because it makes people smile but it

1455
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,880
also kind of

1456
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,559
sneak it's like a trojan horse for cool

1457
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,519
ideas

1458
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,920
you you open with humor and you uh like

1459
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,440
the humor is the appetizer and then the

1460
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,880
main meal is the science and the

1461
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,639
engineering

1462
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:56,838
anyway uh do you think

1463
00:49:52,639 --> 00:50:00,078
it's possible to colonize

1464
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:01,519
mars or other planets in the solar

1465
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,640
system but we're

1466
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,880
especially uh looking to mars is there

1467
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,799
something about planets that make them

1468
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,160
very harsh to humans

1469
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,000
is there something in particular you

1470
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,480
think about and maybe

1471
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,838
in a high like big picture perspective

1472
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,079
do you have a hope we

1473
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,679
we do in fact become a multi-planetary

1474
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:23,359
species

1475
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:26,000
i do think that if our species

1476
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,759
survives long enough and we don't wipe

1477
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,559
ourselves out or get wiped out by some

1478
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,240
other means

1479
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:33,599
that we will eventually be able to

1480
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,439
colonize other planets

1481
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,960
i do not expect that to happen in my

1482
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,200
lifetime i mean

1483
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,079
tourists may go to mars tourists people

1484
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,000
who commit

1485
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,920
years of their life to going to mars as

1486
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,318
a tourist may go to mars

1487
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,358
um i don't think that we will colonize

1488
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:49,599
it um

1489
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:51,598
is there a sense why it's just too harsh

1490
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,559
of an environment

1491
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,880
to uh to to like it's too costly to

1492
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,240
build something habitable there

1493
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:03,280
for a large population

1494
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,838
i think that we need to do a lot of work

1495
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,040
and learning how to use the resources

1496
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:08,880
that are

1497
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:10,318
on the planet already to do the things

1498
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,800
we need so if you're talking about

1499
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:17,358
someone going there for a few months

1500
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:19,599
um so back up a little bit

1501
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:20,639
there are many things that make mars not

1502
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,720
hospitable

1503
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,078
temperature you can't breathe air you

1504
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:25,519
need a pressure suit

1505
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,760
even if you're on the surface the

1506
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,960
radiation environment is you know even

1507
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,640
in all those things the radiation

1508
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,519
environment is too harsh for the human

1509
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,000
body

1510
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,000
um all of those things seem like they

1511
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,199
could eventually have

1512
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,239
technological solutions

1513
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:44,799
the challenge the the real

1514
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,159
significant challenge to me seems to be

1515
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,359
the the creation

1516
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:50,000
of a self-sustaining civilization there

1517
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,400
you know you

1518
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,159
can bring pressure suits you can bring

1519
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,599
oxygen to breathe but those are all in

1520
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:57,679
limited supply and if we're going to

1521
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,079
colonize it we need to find

1522
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,919
ways to make use of the resources that

1523
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,318
are there to do things like

1524
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,920
produce food produce the air the humans

1525
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:07,199
need to keep breathing just in order to

1526
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,880
make it self-sustaining there's a

1527
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,439
tremendous amount of work that has to be

1528
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,838
done

1529
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,800
and people are working on these problems

1530
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:14,960
but

1531
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,640
i think that's going to be a major

1532
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,240
obstacle in going from

1533
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,318
visiting where we can bring everything

1534
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,719
we need to survive in the short term to

1535
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:26,558
actually colonizing

1536
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:29,199
yeah i find that whole project

1537
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,400
of the human species quite inspiring

1538
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:34,960
these like huge

1539
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:37,200
moonshot projects somebody i was reading

1540
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,800
something um in terms of the source of

1541
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,480
food that's that may be the most

1542
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,960
effective on mars

1543
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,719
is you could farm insects that's the

1544
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,000
easiest thing to farm

1545
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:50,239
so would be eating like cockroaches

1546
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,760
if we're living on mars because that's

1547
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:55,118
the easiest thing to actually

1548
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,720
um as a source of protein so growing a

1549
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,200
source of protein is the easiest thing

1550
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,879
is

1551
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:02,879
as insects i just imagine this giant

1552
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,800
for people who are afraid of insects

1553
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,559
this is not a pleasant

1554
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,318
maybe you're not supposed to even think

1555
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,680
of it that way it'll be like a cockroach

1556
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,920
milkshake or something like that

1557
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,480
right i wonder if have people been

1558
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:18,079
working on the genetic engineering of

1559
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,639
of insects to make them more radiation

1560
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,039
friendly

1561
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:22,318
right or pressure resistant or whatever

1562
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,880
it makes them

1563
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:26,719
what can possibly go wrong cockroaches

1564
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,480
make them radiation resistant

1565
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:30,480
they're already like survived all

1566
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,880
everything plus i um

1567
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,559
i took an allergy test i'm in austin so

1568
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,800
there's everybody's alert is like the

1569
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,839
allergy levels are super high there

1570
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,760
uh and one of the things apparently i'm

1571
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:44,799
not allergic to any insects

1572
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:47,839
except cockroaches it's hilarious so

1573
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,440
maybe uh um well

1574
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:52,000
i'm gonna use that as you know people

1575
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,519
use an excuse that i'm allergic to cats

1576
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,880
to not have cats i'm gonna use that as

1577
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:56,880
an excuse to uh

1578
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,960
not go to mars as one of the first batch

1579
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,960
of people otherwise i was gonna ask if

1580
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,318
you had the opportunity would you go

1581
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,000
yeah i'm joking about the cockroach

1582
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:08,159
thing and i would definitely go

1583
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,000
i love challenges i love i love things

1584
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:13,039
i love doing things where the

1585
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,119
possibility of death

1586
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:21,358
is is uh not insignificant

1587
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,358
because it makes me appreciate it more

1588
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,440
meditating on death makes me appreciate

1589
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:31,039
life

1590
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,679
and uh when the meditation on death is

1591
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:35,519
forced on you because of how difficult

1592
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,838
the task is

1593
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,759
i enjoy those kinds of things most

1594
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:41,440
people don't it seems like

1595
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,680
but i love the idea of difficult

1596
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,400
journeys

1597
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,000
for no purpose whatsoever except

1598
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,240
exploration

1599
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
going into the unknown seeing what the

1600
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:54,479
limits of the human mind and the human

1601
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,318
body are it's like what the hell else is

1602
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,039
this whole journey that we're on for

1603
00:54:56,318 --> 00:55:00,960
i i uh but it could be because i grew up

1604
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,318
in the soviet union there's a kind of

1605
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,760
love

1606
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:07,119
for space like the the space race the

1607
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,520
cold war created

1608
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,358
i don't know if still it permeates

1609
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:13,199
american culture as much

1610
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:14,880
but especially with the dad as a

1611
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:18,078
scientist

1612
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,358
i think i've i've loved the idea of

1613
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,160
humans striving

1614
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,759
out towards the stars always like from

1615
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:25,118
the engineering perspective

1616
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,559
has been really exciting i don't know if

1617
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,519
people love that as much in america

1618
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,319
anymore i think

1619
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:32,400
elon is bringing that back a little bit

1620
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:35,679
that excitement about rockets and

1621
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,119
going out there but uh so that's that's

1622
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,919
hopeful but for me i always loved that

1623
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,960
idea

1624
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,079
from uh alien scientist perspective if

1625
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,199
you were to look

1626
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,200
back on earth

1627
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:49,838
is there something interesting you could

1628
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:51,598
say about earth like how would you

1629
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:53,199
summarize earth

1630
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,880
like in a report you know like uh

1631
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:57,598
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

1632
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,798
like if you had to report like write a

1633
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,400
paper on earth

1634
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:04,400
or like a letter like a like a one pager

1635
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,920
um summarizing the contents of the

1636
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,039
surface and the atmosphere is there is

1637
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,079
there something interesting

1638
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:10,960
like do you ever take that kind of

1639
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,960
perspective on it

1640
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:14,880
i know you like volcanism so volcanoes

1641
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,400
that will probably be in the report

1642
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,079
and i was gonna say that's where i was

1643
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,680
gonna go first uh there are a few things

1644
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,798
to say about the atmosphere but in terms

1645
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,078
of the volcano so

1646
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:27,440
one of the really interesting

1647
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,798
puzzles to me in planetary sciences

1648
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,039
so we can we can look out there and

1649
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:32,798
we've been talking about surfaces and

1650
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,679
volcanoes and atmospheres and things

1651
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:35,920
like that

1652
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:37,279
but that is just you know this tiny

1653
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,280
little veneer on the outside of the

1654
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,440
planet and most of the planet is

1655
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,280
completely sort of inaccessible to

1656
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,039
telescopes or to spacecraft missions you

1657
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,280
can drill a meter into the surface but

1658
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:50,558
you know that's still really the veneer

1659
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,079
um and one of the cool puzzles is

1660
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,798
looking at what's going on

1661
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,680
on the surface and trying to figure out

1662
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:58,719
what's happening

1663
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:00,239
underneath or just any kind of indirect

1664
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,159
means that you have to study the

1665
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,000
interior because you can't

1666
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:06,558
dig into it directly even on earth you

1667
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,039
can't dig deep into earth

1668
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,200
so from that perspective looking at

1669
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:13,279
earth

1670
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,598
one thing that you would be able to tell

1671
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,960
from orbit given enough time

1672
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:20,000
is that earth has tectonic plates so you

1673
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,039
would see

1674
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,480
that volcanoes follow the edges if you

1675
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,159
trace where all the volcanoes are on

1676
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,159
earth they follow these

1677
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:29,679
lines that trace the edges of the plates

1678
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:32,798
and similarly you would see

1679
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:34,399
things like the hawaiian string of

1680
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:36,798
volcanoes that

1681
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,519
you could infer just like you know we

1682
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:39,119
did

1683
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:41,280
as people actually living on earth that

1684
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,039
the plates are moving over some plume

1685
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,839
that's coming up through the mantle

1686
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,599
and so you could use that to say if the

1687
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:48,000
aliens could look at where the volcanoes

1688
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,760
are

1689
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,039
are happening on earth and say something

1690
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,200
about the fact that earth has plate

1691
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:55,838
tectonics which makes it really unique

1692
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:56,639
in the solar system okay so the other

1693
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:57,838
plants don't have

1694
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,558
it's the only one that has plate

1695
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,719
tectonics yeah what about io

1696
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,160
and the the friction and all that that's

1697
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:05,838
not play tech what's the difference

1698
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,759
between

1699
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:08,960
so oh it's plate tectonics like another

1700
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,599
layer of like

1701
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,639
solid rock that moves around and there's

1702
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:15,920
cracks

1703
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:16,318
yeah so so earth has plates of solid

1704
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,480
rock

1705
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,719
sitting on top of a partially molten

1706
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:24,639
layer and those plates are kind of

1707
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:26,719
shifting around on io

1708
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,920
it doesn't have that and the volcanism

1709
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:30,239
is what we call heat pipe

1710
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,159
volcanism it's the magma just punches a

1711
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:33,199
hole through the crust and comes out on

1712
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:34,960
the surface i mean that's a

1713
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:36,000
simplification but that's effectively

1714
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,280
what's happening

1715
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,920
through the freezing cold crust yes very

1716
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,640
cold

1717
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,200
very rigid crust yeah how do you how

1718
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:47,118
does that look like by the way

1719
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:48,318
i don't think we've mentioned so the gas

1720
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,838
that's expelled

1721
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,759
like if we were to look at it does it

1722
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:54,558
look beautiful does it look boring

1723
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,920
the gas like the whole thing like the

1724
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,240
the magma punching through

1725
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,680
oh my gosh i see yes i'm sure it would

1726
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:00,558
be beautiful and the pictures we've seen

1727
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:03,519
of it are beautiful

1728
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,000
you have so the the magma will come out

1729
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:06,480
of

1730
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,440
the lava will come out of these fissures

1731
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,440
and

1732
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,760
you have these curtains of lava that are

1733
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,880
maybe even a kilometer high so if you

1734
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,640
looked at videos

1735
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,760
i don't know how many volcano videos

1736
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:19,679
you've looked at on earth but you

1737
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,119
sometimes see a tiny tiny version of

1738
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,358
this in iceland you see just these

1739
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,400
sheets of magma coming out of a fissure

1740
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:27,920
when you have this really low viscosity

1741
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,000
magma sort of water-like

1742
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,280
coming out at these sheets and the

1743
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,920
plumes that come out

1744
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,480
because there's no atmosphere all the

1745
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,318
plume

1746
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:40,639
molecules are just plume particles

1747
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:42,000
where they end up is is just a function

1748
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,759
of the

1749
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,199
direction that they left the vent so

1750
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,400
they're all following ballistic

1751
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:48,318
trajectories

1752
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,680
um and you end up with these umbrella

1753
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,199
plumes you don't get these sort of

1754
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:52,000
complicated plumes that you have on

1755
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:54,159
earth

1756
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,358
that are occurring because of how that

1757
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:56,558
material is interacting with the

1758
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,558
atmosphere that's there

1759
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,720
you just have these huge umbrellas and

1760
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:03,119
it's been hypothesized actually that

1761
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:05,439
the atmosphere is made of sulfur dioxide

1762
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,440
and

1763
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,318
that you could have these kind of ash

1764
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,838
particles from the volcano and the

1765
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:13,039
sulfur dioxide

1766
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:15,199
would condense onto these particles and

1767
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:17,838
you'd have sulfur dioxide snow coming

1768
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:20,639
out of these volcanic plumes

1769
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:21,199
and uh there's not much light though

1770
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:22,558
right

1771
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:23,919
so you wouldn't be able to like it would

1772
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,480
make a good it would not make a good

1773
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,519
instagram photo because you have to

1774
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,079
would you see the snow sure there's

1775
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:32,318
light

1776
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,760
it depends okay so you could you could

1777
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:35,519
still okay it depends what angle you're

1778
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,240
looking at it where the sun is all the

1779
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:37,838
things like that

1780
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,798
you know the sunlight is much weaker but

1781
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:43,838
it's still there it's still there

1782
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,679
and uh how big is io in terms of gravity

1783
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:47,519
is is it smaller is it a pretty small

1784
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:49,358
moon

1785
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,759
it's quite a bit smaller than earth

1786
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:54,000
anyway it's smaller than earth okay

1787
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,079
okay cool so they float out for a little

1788
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,440
bit so it floats well then yeah

1789
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,200
no you're right that would be that would

1790
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,318
be that'll be gorgeous

1791
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:04,000
um yeah what else about earth

1792
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:05,838
is interesting besides volcanic so plate

1793
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,798
tectonics and i didn't realize that that

1794
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:11,838
was the unique

1795
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:11,838
element of a planet in the solar system

1796
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,640
because that i wonder what i mean we

1797
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,079
experience it as human beings it's quite

1798
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,598
painful because of earthquakes and all

1799
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,720
those kinds of things but

1800
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:25,280
i wonder if there's nice features to it

1801
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:25,838
yeah so coming back to habitability

1802
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,400
again

1803
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:29,199
um things like tectonics and plate

1804
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,200
tectonics

1805
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:33,118
are are thought to play an important

1806
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:34,480
role in the surface being habitable and

1807
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,599
that's because

1808
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,358
you have a way of recycling material so

1809
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,960
if you have a stagnant surface

1810
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:42,960
everything you know you use up all the

1811
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,400
free oxygen everything reacts until you

1812
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,280
no longer have

1813
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,838
reactants that life can extract energy

1814
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,200
from

1815
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:50,639
and so if nothing's changing on your

1816
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:52,318
surface you kind of reach this

1817
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:55,920
stagnation point

1818
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:58,239
um but something like plate tectonics

1819
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,838
recycles material you bring up new fresh

1820
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:00,639
material from the interior you bring

1821
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:02,798
down

1822
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:03,838
material that's up on the surface and

1823
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:06,239
and that can

1824
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:08,400
kind of refresh your your nutrient

1825
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,639
supply in a sense or the the sort of raw

1826
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,838
materials that the surface has to work

1827
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:16,239
with

1828
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:17,920
so um from a kind of astrobiologist's

1829
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:18,719
perspective looking at earth you would

1830
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,559
see

1831
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,719
that recycling of material because the

1832
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,960
plate tectonics you would also see

1833
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,639
how much oxygen is in earth's atmosphere

1834
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,480
and between those two things you would

1835
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:30,879
identify earth as a

1836
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,920
reasonable candidate for a habitable

1837
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,920
environment

1838
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,079
in addition to of course the you know

1839
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,798
pleasant temperature and liquid water

1840
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,240
um but the abundance of oxygen and the

1841
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:42,798
the plate tectonics both

1842
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:44,879
play a role as well and also see like

1843
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:47,519
tiny dot satellites flying around

1844
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,119
well sure yes i wonder if they would be

1845
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:50,880
able to i really think about that like

1846
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:54,798
if they if aliens were to

1847
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:57,838
visit and would they really see humans

1848
01:02:54,798 --> 01:03:00,960
as the thing they should be focusing on

1849
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:03,838
i think it would take a while right

1850
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,838
because it's so obvious that that should

1851
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:08,239
because there's like so much incredible

1852
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:09,920
in terms of biomass humans are a tiny

1853
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:12,558
tiny tiny fraction

1854
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,559
there's like ants they would probably

1855
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,000
detect ants

1856
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,760
right or they probably would focus on

1857
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,920
the water and the fish

1858
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,280
because there's like a lot of water i

1859
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,559
don't i was surprised to learn that

1860
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,119
there's more species

1861
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,000
on land than there is in the sea like

1862
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,318
there's 90

1863
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,358
i think 90 to 95 percent of the species

1864
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,679
are on

1865
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:32,558
or on land on land not in the sea not in

1866
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:34,159
the sea

1867
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,240
i i thought like there's so much going

1868
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:38,318
on in the sea but no the

1869
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:39,759
the variety that like the branches

1870
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:42,159
created by evolution

1871
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,839
apparently it's probably a good answer

1872
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:44,159
from evolutionary biology perspective

1873
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:46,000
why

1874
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:47,920
land created so much diversity but it

1875
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,639
did so like the sea

1876
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,358
there's so much not known about the sea

1877
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:57,199
about the oceans but

1878
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:59,838
it's not um it's not diversity friendly

1879
01:03:57,199 --> 01:04:01,279
what can i say he's uh it needs to he

1880
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:02,719
needs to improve his diversity

1881
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,920
what can you do do you think the aliens

1882
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:04,558
would come i mean the first thing they

1883
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,480
would see is

1884
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:09,280
i suppose our cities assuming that they

1885
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,000
had some idea of what a natural world

1886
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,280
looked like they would see cities and

1887
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,199
say these don't belong

1888
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,119
which of these many species created

1889
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:20,558
these yeah i mean there's

1890
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:23,200
i if i were to guess it would

1891
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,880
it's a good question i don't know if you

1892
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:26,000
do this when you look at the telescope

1893
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,920
whether you look at

1894
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:33,039
uh geometric shapes like

1895
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:35,760
if it's uh good because to me like

1896
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,839
hard corners like what do we think is

1897
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,599
engineered

1898
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:41,759
things that are like have kind of

1899
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,440
straight lines and corners and so on

1900
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,440
they will probably detect those in terms

1901
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,599
of buildings would stand out to them

1902
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,200
because that's that goes against the

1903
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:54,000
basic natural

1904
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:55,679
physics of the world but

1905
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,599
i don't know if the electricity and

1906
01:04:55,679 --> 01:05:01,038
lights and so on it could be i

1907
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,440
honestly it could be the plate tectonics

1908
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,039
it could be like that uh the like the

1909
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,039
volcanoes that'd be okay that's the

1910
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,520
source of heat and then they would focus

1911
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,280
they might literally i mean depending on

1912
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:14,559
how alien life forms are

1913
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:17,599
they might notice the microorganisms

1914
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:20,000
before they notice the big like notice

1915
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,559
the ant before the elephant

1916
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
because like there's a lot more of them

1917
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,640
depending what they're measuring device

1918
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,798
we think like size matters but maybe

1919
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,000
with their tools of measurement they

1920
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:33,038
would look for

1921
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,480
quantity versus size like why focus on

1922
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,720
the big thing

1923
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,318
focus on the thing that there's a lot of

1924
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:40,399
and when they see humans depending on

1925
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:43,519
their measurement devices they might see

1926
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,599
we're made up of billions of organisms

1927
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:46,639
like the fact that we have we're very

1928
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,039
human centered we think

1929
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:49,759
we're one organism but that may not be

1930
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,440
the case

1931
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,160
they might see in fact they might also

1932
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:57,679
see like a human city

1933
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:58,960
as one organism like what is this thing

1934
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:02,318
that like

1935
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:04,480
clearly this organism gets um

1936
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:06,000
aroused at night because the lights go

1937
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,199
on

1938
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,358
and then uh and then it like it sleeps

1939
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:13,919
during the day

1940
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:16,159
i don't know how like what perspective

1941
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,000
you take on the city

1942
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:19,598
is there something interesting about

1943
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,639
earth or other planets in terms of

1944
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:24,798
weather patterns

1945
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:27,598
so we talked a lot about volcanic

1946
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:29,119
patterns is there something else about

1947
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,160
weather

1948
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:34,318
that's interesting like storms or

1949
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,199
variations in temperature

1950
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:37,199
all those kinds of things

1951
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,559
yeah so there's sort of every

1952
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,839
planet and moon has a kind of

1953
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:48,400
interesting and unique weather pattern

1954
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:50,480
and those weather patterns are really

1955
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,519
we don't have a good understanding of

1956
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,639
them we don't even have a good

1957
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,920
understanding of the

1958
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:59,038
the global circulation patterns

1959
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,400
of many of these atmospheres why the

1960
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:04,400
storm systems occur

1961
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:06,639
so the the

1962
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,720
composition and occurrence of storms and

1963
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:10,000
clouds and these objects is another one

1964
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:12,000
of these

1965
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,838
kind of windows into the interior that i

1966
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,039
was talking about with surfaces one of

1967
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:16,480
these

1968
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,400
ways that we can get perspective and

1969
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,639
what the composition is of the interior

1970
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,400
and

1971
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,159
how the circulation is working so

1972
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:25,519
circulation will

1973
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:27,199
bring some species up from deeper in the

1974
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:28,798
atmosphere of the planet to some

1975
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:30,639
altitude that's a little bit colder and

1976
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,400
that species will condense out and form

1977
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:35,598
a cloud at that altitude

1978
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:38,798
and we can detect in some cases what

1979
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:42,880
those clouds are composed of

1980
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:45,358
and looking at where those occur

1981
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,160
can tell you how the circulation cells

1982
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:48,000
are whether

1983
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:49,838
the atmospheric circulation is say

1984
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,798
coming up at the equator and going down

1985
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:52,318
at the poles

1986
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:53,920
or whether you have multiple cells in

1987
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,960
the atmosphere and

1988
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,880
i mean jupiter's atmosphere is is

1989
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,318
just insane there's so much going on you

1990
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,640
look at these pictures and there's all

1991
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:04,159
these vortices and anti-vortices and you

1992
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:05,118
have these different bands that are

1993
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,679
moving in

1994
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:08,559
in opposite directions that may be

1995
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:12,000
giving you

1996
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:14,480
information about the the deep

1997
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,079
proper like deep in the atmosphere um

1998
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,119
physically deep properties

1999
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:22,559
of um jupiter's

2000
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:24,880
interior and in circulation

2001
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,600
what are the these vortices wha what's

2002
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,440
the basic material of the storms

2003
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,759
it's condensed molecules from the

2004
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:34,318
atmosphere so ammonia ice particles

2005
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,000
um in the case of jupiter it's methane

2006
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:38,319
ice in the case of let's say

2007
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,920
uranus and neptune and other species you

2008
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,839
can kind of construct

2009
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,000
a chemical model for which species can

2010
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:44,880
condense where and so you see a cloud at

2011
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,479
a certain

2012
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,079
altitude within the atmosphere and you

2013
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,879
can make a guess at what that cloud is

2014
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:50,798
made of

2015
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,079
and sometimes measure it directly and

2016
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:53,920
you know different species make

2017
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:57,119
different colors as well

2018
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:59,199
oh cool ice storms okay

2019
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,278
i mean the climate of uranus has always

2020
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:04,838
been fascinating to me because

2021
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:07,920
it orbits on its side and it has a

2022
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:09,519
42-year orbital period and so

2023
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,359
you know with earth our seasons are

2024
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,040
because our equator is tipped just a

2025
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,560
little bit to the plane that we orbit in

2026
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:15,838
so sometimes the sun lights a little bit

2027
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,199
above the equator and sometimes it's a

2028
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:20,798
little bit below the equator

2029
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:22,479
but on uranus it's like for for 10 years

2030
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:23,838
the sunlight is directly on the north

2031
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,278
pole and then it's directly on the

2032
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:26,479
equator and then it's directly on the

2033
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,120
south pole

2034
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:31,119
and it's it's actually kind of amazing

2035
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:31,920
that the atmosphere doesn't look crazier

2036
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:35,198
than

2037
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:37,279
it does but understanding how taking

2038
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:38,479
again like one of these extreme examples

2039
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,560
if we can understand

2040
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,519
why that atmosphere behaves in the way

2041
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,039
it does

2042
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,880
it's kind of a test of our our

2043
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:47,679
understanding of how

2044
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,000
how atmospheres so like heats up one

2045
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,279
side

2046
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:55,279
of the planet for 10 years and then

2047
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:57,280
freezes it the next like

2048
01:09:55,279 --> 01:10:00,238
and that you're saying would should

2049
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:02,719
probably lead to some chaos

2050
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,639
and it doesn't the fact that it doesn't

2051
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,158
tells you something about the atmosphere

2052
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,600
so atmospheres have a property that

2053
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:09,119
surfaces don't have which is that they

2054
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,560
can redistribute heat a lot more

2055
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:12,519
effectively right

2056
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,760
so they're a stabilizing like

2057
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,600
self-regulating

2058
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,640
aspect to them that they're able to deal

2059
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,640
with extreme conditions

2060
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:26,559
but predicting how that complex system

2061
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:28,000
unrolls is is very difficult as we know

2062
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,400
about predicting the weather on earth

2063
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,560
even

2064
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:32,000
oh my goodness yeah the little variation

2065
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,880
we have on earth you know people have

2066
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,800
tried to

2067
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,000
put together global circulation models

2068
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,279
so you know we've done this for earth

2069
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,479
people have tried to do these for other

2070
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:41,599
planets as well

2071
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:43,599
and it is a really hard problem um

2072
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,360
so titan for example like i said it's

2073
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,520
it's one of the best studied atmospheres

2074
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:49,119
in the solar system and people have

2075
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,040
tried to make these global circulation

2076
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:51,599
models and actually predict what's going

2077
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:54,000
to

2078
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,760
to happen moving into sort of the next

2079
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,840
season of titan and those predictions

2080
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,400
have ended up being wrong and so then

2081
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,920
you know

2082
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:01,519
i i don't know it's always exciting when

2083
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,158
a prediction is wrong because it means

2084
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:03,520
that

2085
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:05,759
there's something more to learn like

2086
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,120
your theory wasn't sufficient

2087
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,880
and then you get to go back and learn

2088
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:12,000
something by how you have to modify the

2089
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,679
theory to make it fit

2090
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,359
excited by the possibility of one day

2091
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:17,760
there'll be for various moons and

2092
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:20,479
planets there'll be uh

2093
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,239
like news programs reporting the weather

2094
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:25,359
with the fake confidence of

2095
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:27,198
like as if you can predict the weather

2096
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:29,279
uh we talked quite a bit about plants

2097
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:32,238
and moons can we talk

2098
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:34,238
a little bit about asteroids for sure

2099
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:36,959
what is uh what's an asteroid

2100
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:37,839
and what kind of asteroids are there so

2101
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,158
the asteroids

2102
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,159
let's talk about just the restricted to

2103
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:42,879
the main asteroid belt which is the

2104
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:46,079
region

2105
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,719
it's a region of debris basically

2106
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:51,279
between

2107
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,279
mars and jupiter and

2108
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,800
the these sort of belts of debris

2109
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:58,399
throughout the solar system the outer

2110
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,679
solar system

2111
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:01,279
you know the kuiper belt that we talked

2112
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:03,039
about the asteroid belt as well as

2113
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,319
certain other populations where they

2114
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:07,359
accumulate because they're

2115
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:10,719
gravitationally more favored

2116
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:12,238
our remnant objects from the origin of

2117
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,119
the solar system and so one of the

2118
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:16,238
reasons

2119
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:17,599
that we are so interested in them aside

2120
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:19,919
from potentially the fact that they

2121
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:23,280
could come hit earth but

2122
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:26,960
scientifically it's

2123
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:28,238
um it gives us a window into

2124
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,840
understanding the

2125
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:33,439
composition uh of the material from

2126
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,239
which earth and the other plant is

2127
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:36,399
formed

2128
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:38,158
and how that material was kind of

2129
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:40,399
redistributed over the

2130
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:41,759
the history of the solar system so the

2131
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:43,679
asteroids

2132
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,159
one could classify them in two different

2133
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:49,679
ways some of them are ancient objects so

2134
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:52,960
they accreted

2135
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,719
out of the the sort of disk of material

2136
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,600
that the whole solar system formed out

2137
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:01,439
of um and have kind of

2138
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,920
remained ever since more or less the

2139
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,839
same

2140
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,279
um they've probably collided with each

2141
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,640
other and we see the all these

2142
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,759
collisional fragments and you can

2143
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,880
actually

2144
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:13,119
look and um based on their orbits say

2145
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:16,159
you know like these 50 objects

2146
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:17,599
originated as the same object

2147
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,319
you can see them kind of dynamically

2148
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:23,920
moving apart after some big collision

2149
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:25,359
um and so some of them are these ancient

2150
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,480
objects maybe that have undergone

2151
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,079
collisions and then

2152
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,238
there's this other category of object

2153
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:32,380
that is the one that i personally find

2154
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:33,439
really interesting which is um

2155
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:36,560
[Music]

2156
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:39,759
remnants of objects that could have been

2157
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:42,400
planets so

2158
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,679
early on a bunch of potential planets

2159
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:45,839
secreted that we call

2160
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,279
planetesimals and they formed and they

2161
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,119
formed with a lot of energy and they had

2162
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,719
enough time to actually differentiate so

2163
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:53,359
some of these objects differentiated

2164
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:56,000
into cores and mantles and crests

2165
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:57,599
and then they were subsequently

2166
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,198
disrupted in these

2167
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,760
massive collisions and they now we have

2168
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:03,759
these

2169
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,679
fragments we think fragments floating

2170
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,760
around the asteroid belt that are like

2171
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:09,359
bits of mantle bits of core bits of

2172
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,520
crust basically

2173
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:13,359
um so it's like puzzle pieces you might

2174
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,800
be able to stitch together

2175
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:18,639
or i guess it's it's all uh

2176
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,880
it's all mixed up so you can't stitch

2177
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:24,079
together the original planet

2178
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,920
candidates or is that possible to try to

2179
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,600
see if they kind of

2180
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,520
i mean there's too many there's too many

2181
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,120
objects in there too i think that there

2182
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,440
are cases where people have

2183
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:35,119
have kind of looked at objects and by

2184
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:36,879
looking at their orbits they say these

2185
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:37,920
objects should have originated together

2186
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,719
but they have very different

2187
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,640
compositions and so then you can

2188
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:44,640
hypothesize maybe they were different

2189
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,239
fragments of a differentiated object

2190
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,840
but one of the really cool things about

2191
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:49,359
this is you know we've been talking

2192
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,520
about

2193
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:52,399
getting clues into the interiors of

2194
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,920
planets

2195
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:56,879
we've never seen a planetary core or

2196
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,560
deep mantle

2197
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,920
directly some mantle material comes up

2198
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,480
on earth's surface and then we can see

2199
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,600
it but

2200
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:05,039
you know in sort of in bulk um

2201
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,679
we haven't seen these things directly

2202
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:09,119
and these asteroids potentially give us

2203
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,359
a chance to like

2204
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:12,960
look at what our own core and mantle is

2205
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:14,559
like or at least

2206
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,399
would be like if it had been also

2207
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,039
floating through space for a few billion

2208
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:19,920
years and

2209
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:20,399
and getting irradiated and all that uh

2210
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,199
but it's

2211
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:25,359
it's a cool potential window or like

2212
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:26,319
analogy into the interior of our own

2213
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:28,158
planet

2214
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:30,399
well how do you begin studying some of

2215
01:15:28,158 --> 01:15:32,079
these asteroids

2216
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:33,519
what uh if you were to put together a

2217
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:35,439
study like what are the interesting

2218
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,280
questions to ask

2219
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:39,039
that a little bit more specific do you

2220
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:41,119
find a favorite

2221
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:44,640
asteroid that could be tracked and try

2222
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:47,920
to try to track it through telescopes

2223
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:50,560
or do you uh is it has to be

2224
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,600
you have to land on those things to

2225
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,600
study it

2226
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,440
so when it comes to the asteroids

2227
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,880
there's so many of them and the big

2228
01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:02,238
pictures or the the big questions

2229
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:06,719
are answered

2230
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:08,718
um so some questions can be answered by

2231
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,640
zooming in in detail on individual

2232
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:14,399
object but mostly you're trying to do a

2233
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:16,480
statistical study so you want to look at

2234
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:18,079
thousands of objects even hundreds of

2235
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:21,279
thousands of objects

2236
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:24,640
and figure out what their composition is

2237
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:26,000
and look at you know how many

2238
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,760
big asteroids there are of this

2239
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,198
composition versus how many small

2240
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,719
asteroids of this other composition and

2241
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:33,439
put together these kind of

2242
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:35,439
statistical properties of the asteroid

2243
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:38,238
belt and those properties can be

2244
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:40,319
directly compared with the results of

2245
01:16:38,238 --> 01:16:42,079
simulations for the the formation of the

2246
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,599
solar system

2247
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:45,439
what do we know about the surfaces of

2248
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,400
asteroids or the con

2249
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,319
the the contents of the insides of

2250
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:53,519
asteroids

2251
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:56,319
and what are still open questions so

2252
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,360
i would say that we don't know a whole

2253
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:01,198
lot about their

2254
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:04,158
compositions um most of them are small

2255
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:05,599
and so you can't study them in such

2256
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:07,920
detail with

2257
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,880
telescopes as as you could you know a

2258
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,560
planet or moon

2259
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,159
and at the same time because there are

2260
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,679
so many of them you could send a

2261
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:16,079
spacecraft to a few

2262
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,440
uh but you can't really like get a

2263
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,719
statistical survey

2264
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:22,319
with spacecraft and so a lot of

2265
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:24,319
what we a lot of what has been done

2266
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:25,119
comes down to sort of classification you

2267
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:27,759
look at

2268
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:28,479
how bright they are you look at uh

2269
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,119
whether

2270
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:33,119
they're red or blue simply you know

2271
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:34,960
whether their spectrum is sloped towards

2272
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:38,559
long wavelengths or short wavelengths

2273
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:40,719
there are certain uh if you if you

2274
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,159
point a spectrograph at their surfaces

2275
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,600
there are certain features you can see

2276
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,359
so you can tell that some of them have

2277
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,560
silicates on them

2278
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:50,158
um and but these are the sort of

2279
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,400
they're pretty basic questions we're

2280
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:54,719
still trying to classify them based on

2281
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:56,238
fairly basic information in kind of

2282
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:57,600
combination with our general

2283
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:59,119
understanding of

2284
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,039
the material the solar system formed

2285
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:02,399
from and so you're sort of you can't

2286
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:04,079
you're coming in with prior knowledge

2287
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:05,359
which is that you more or less know what

2288
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:06,960
the materials are the solar system

2289
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:09,279
formed from and then you're trying to

2290
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,198
classify them into these categories

2291
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:13,519
there's still

2292
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:15,119
a huge amount of room for for

2293
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,199
understanding them better

2294
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,399
um and for understanding how their

2295
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:20,799
surfaces are changing

2296
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:22,960
in the space environment is it hard to

2297
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:26,079
land on an asteroid

2298
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,198
is this uh is this a dumb question it

2299
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:30,479
feels like uh

2300
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:33,678
it would be quite difficult

2301
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:39,359
to actually operate a spacecraft

2302
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:41,840
in such a uh dense field of debris

2303
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:43,519
oh the asteroid belt um there's a ton of

2304
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,600
material there but it's actually not

2305
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:48,400
that dense it is mostly open space

2306
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,679
okay uh so so mentally do picture like

2307
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:52,399
mostly open space with

2308
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:53,119
with some rocks uh the problem is some

2309
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,119
of them are not

2310
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:57,039
thought to be solid so some of these

2311
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:58,719
asteroids especially these these core

2312
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:00,479
mantle fragments you can think of as

2313
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:02,319
sort of solid like a planet

2314
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:03,759
but some of them are just kind of

2315
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:06,639
aggregates of

2316
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:09,520
material we call them rubble piles and

2317
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,840
so there's not necessarily

2318
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,679
might look like a rock but do a lot of

2319
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:16,159
them have kind of

2320
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,960
clouds around them like a dust cloud

2321
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:19,679
thing

2322
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:22,719
or like do you know what you're stepping

2323
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:25,119
on when you try to land on it

2324
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:27,039
like what are we supposed to be

2325
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:28,880
visualizing here this is like very few

2326
01:19:27,039 --> 01:19:30,399
have water right

2327
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,319
there's some water in the outer part of

2328
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:35,439
the asteroid belt but they're not

2329
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:36,799
quite like comets okay um

2330
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:38,639
in the in the sense of having clouds

2331
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,480
around them there are some crazy

2332
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,400
asteroids that do become active like

2333
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:43,839
comets that's the whole other

2334
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:45,599
category of thing that we don't

2335
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,279
understand um

2336
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,880
but they're surfaces i mean we have

2337
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,479
visited some you can

2338
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,600
you know find pictures that spacecraft

2339
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:52,718
have taken of them we've actually

2340
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,159
scooped up material

2341
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:56,079
off of the surface of some of these

2342
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:58,960
objects we're bringing it back

2343
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:00,880
to analyze it in the lab um and there's

2344
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,960
a mission that's launching

2345
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,159
next year to land on one of these

2346
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,719
supposedly

2347
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:07,599
core fragment objects to try to figure

2348
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,079
out what the heck

2349
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,440
it is and what's going on with it but

2350
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:14,639
the surfaces

2351
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:17,439
you know they're they're you can picture

2352
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:18,000
a solid surface with some little grains

2353
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:21,279
of sand

2354
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,560
or pebbles on it and occasional boulders

2355
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:26,158
maybe some fine dusty regions dust kind

2356
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:30,159
of collecting in certain places

2357
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:32,879
but is is there does do you worry about

2358
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:36,638
this is there any chance

2359
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:38,079
that one of these fellas destroys all of

2360
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:42,079
human civilization

2361
01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:43,679
by um an asteroid kind of

2362
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:45,840
colliding with something changing his

2363
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,199
trajectory and heading its way towards

2364
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,440
earth

2365
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:50,638
that is definitely possible and it

2366
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:52,799
doesn't even

2367
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:54,000
have to necessarily collide and change

2368
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,560
its trajectory

2369
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,840
we're not tracking all of them we can't

2370
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,800
track all of them yet you know they're

2371
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,480
still

2372
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,079
a lot of them people are people are

2373
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:05,599
tracking a lot of them and we are doing

2374
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:06,800
our best to track more of them but there

2375
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,280
are a lot of them out there

2376
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,920
and it would be potentially catastrophic

2377
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:13,519
if one of them

2378
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:15,199
impacted earth um have you are you aware

2379
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:18,480
of this um

2380
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:19,359
apophis object so there's an asteroid a

2381
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:21,439
near-earth

2382
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:23,839
object called apophis that people

2383
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:24,638
thought had a decent probability of

2384
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,760
hitting

2385
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:29,760
earth in 2029 and then potentially again

2386
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,600
in 2036 so they did a lot of studies

2387
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,880
it's not actually going to hit earth

2388
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:37,360
but it is going to come very close

2389
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,560
it's going to be visible in the sky and

2390
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:40,960
a relatively dark

2391
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,080
i mean not even that dark probably not

2392
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,119
visible from los

2393
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:48,719
angeles but um

2394
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:51,599
and it's gonna come a tenth of

2395
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,719
the way between the earth and the moon

2396
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,400
it's going to come closer

2397
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:56,000
apparently than some geosynchronous

2398
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:59,039
communication satellites

2399
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,279
oh wow so that is a close call

2400
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:02,639
but people have studied it and then

2401
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:04,238
apparently you're very confident it's

2402
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:04,880
not actually going to hit us but it was

2403
01:22:04,238 --> 01:22:07,519
gonna have to look

2404
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,359
into this because i i'm very sure i'm

2405
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,719
very sure what's gonna happen

2406
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:16,079
if an asteroid actually hits earth

2407
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:21,679
that the scientific community

2408
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:24,000
and government will confidently say

2409
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:26,158
that we have nothing to worry about it's

2410
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,920
going to be a close call

2411
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:30,238
and then last minute they'd be like

2412
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:32,000
there was a miscalculation

2413
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,919
they're not lying it's just like the

2414
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,119
space of possibilities

2415
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,119
because it's very difficult to track

2416
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:38,719
these kinds of things and there's a lot

2417
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:40,319
of kind of

2418
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,840
there's complexities involved in this

2419
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:45,359
there's a lot of uncertainties

2420
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:47,600
i just something tells me that

2421
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:49,359
human civilization will end with we'll

2422
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,679
see it coming

2423
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:52,479
and then last minute there will be uh

2424
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,158
oops

2425
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:55,839
well like we'll see it coming and we'll

2426
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:57,759
be like no it's this is

2427
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,279
this is threatening but no problem no

2428
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,960
problem and last minute it would be like

2429
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:02,880
oops that was a miscalculation

2430
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:05,439
and then it's all over in a matter of

2431
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,440
like a week

2432
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,239
uh is we're just very positive and

2433
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:12,079
optimistic today

2434
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:13,519
is there any chance that bruce willis

2435
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:16,399
can save us

2436
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:18,840
in the sense that from what you know

2437
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:20,158
about asteroids is there something that

2438
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:24,000
um

2439
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:28,719
you can catch them early enough to uh

2440
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:30,960
change volcanic eruptions right

2441
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:32,158
sort of drill put a nuclear weapon

2442
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,399
inside and

2443
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:36,960
break up the asteroid or change its

2444
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:39,679
trajectory

2445
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,800
there is potential for that if you catch

2446
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:44,319
it early enough

2447
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:47,520
in advance i think

2448
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:52,238
in theory if you knew

2449
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,239
five years in advance ibm um

2450
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,719
depending on the object and how close

2451
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,560
how much you would need to deflect it

2452
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:02,960
um you could deflect it a little bit

2453
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,080
i don't know that it would be sufficient

2454
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,399
in all cases

2455
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:08,559
um and this is definitely not my

2456
01:24:06,399 --> 01:24:10,479
specific area of expertise but

2457
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,400
my understanding is that there is

2458
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:15,198
something you could do

2459
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:16,079
but it also how you would carry that out

2460
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:17,519
depends a lot

2461
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,000
on the properties of the asteroid if

2462
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:23,440
it's a solid object versus a rubble pile

2463
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:26,479
so let's say you planted some bomb

2464
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:28,238
in the middle of it and it blew up but

2465
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:30,079
it was just kind of a pile of material

2466
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:31,678
anyway and then that material comes back

2467
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:33,198
together and then you kind of just have

2468
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,880
the same thing

2469
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:36,559
presumably its trajectory would be

2470
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,719
altered but

2471
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:40,400
it's it's like terminator 2 when it's

2472
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:42,399
like the thing that's just like

2473
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:44,638
you shoot it and splashes and then comes

2474
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:46,158
back together will be very useless

2475
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,480
that's fascinating and what's

2476
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:51,679
fascinating

2477
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:55,439
i've gotten a lot of hope

2478
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:56,639
from watching uh spacex rockets that

2479
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:59,279
land

2480
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:00,880
there's so much it's like oh wow from my

2481
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:02,000
ai perspective from a robotics

2482
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,359
perspective

2483
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,920
that wow we can do a hell of an amazing

2484
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:08,960
job

2485
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:12,000
with control

2486
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,520
and but then we have an

2487
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,760
understanding about surfaces here on

2488
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,360
earth we can map up a lot of things

2489
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,880
i wonder if we can do that some kind of

2490
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,839
detail

2491
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,800
of being able to have that same level of

2492
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,960
precision

2493
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:29,279
in landing on surfaces with as wide of

2494
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,399
a variety as asteroids have so be able

2495
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:33,279
to understand

2496
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:34,158
the exact properties of the surface and

2497
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:36,158
be able to

2498
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:38,319
encode that into whatever rocket that

2499
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:41,439
lands sufficiently to i presume

2500
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:44,639
humans unlike them unlike the movies

2501
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:47,119
humans would likely get in the way like

2502
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:51,600
it should all be done by robots

2503
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:54,079
and like land drill place the

2504
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,039
the explosive that should all be done to

2505
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:57,359
control

2506
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:59,840
the robots and then you should be able

2507
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:02,079
to dynamically adjust to um

2508
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,159
to the surface the flip side of that for

2509
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:05,439
a robotics person

2510
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:07,439
i don't know if you've seen these it's

2511
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:10,399
been very heartbreaking

2512
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:12,799
uh somebody i know well russ tedrick at

2513
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:13,599
mit led the darpa robotics challenge

2514
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,600
team

2515
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,960
uh for the humanoid robot challenge for

2516
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,280
darpa i don't know if you've seen videos

2517
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:21,039
of robots on two feet falling

2518
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:23,119
but you're talking about millions you

2519
01:26:21,039 --> 01:26:24,719
know several years of work from with

2520
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:25,760
some of the most brilliant roboticists

2521
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:27,679
in the world

2522
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,440
millions of dollars and the final thing

2523
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,480
is a highlight video on youtube of

2524
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:32,638
robots falling

2525
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:34,238
but they had a lot of trouble with

2526
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:35,920
uneven surfaces that's basically you

2527
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:37,839
have to do

2528
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,199
the challenge involves you're mostly

2529
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,360
autonomous with some

2530
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:43,119
partial human communication but that

2531
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:45,439
human communication is broken up

2532
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:46,559
like you don't get a you get a noisy

2533
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:48,960
channel so you can

2534
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,600
humans can which is very similar to what

2535
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,480
it would be

2536
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,880
like in humans remotely operating a

2537
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:56,158
thing

2538
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:57,119
on an asteroid and so with that robots

2539
01:26:56,158 --> 01:26:59,759
really struggle

2540
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:00,880
there's some hilarious painful videos of

2541
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,360
like a robot

2542
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,600
not able to like open the door and then

2543
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,920
it tries to open the door without like

2544
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:09,440
misses the handle and in doing so like

2545
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:12,719
falls

2546
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:14,719
it's um it's painful to watch so

2547
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:17,679
like that there's that and then there's

2548
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:19,279
spacex so i have hope from spacex

2549
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:21,359
and then i have less hope from bipeda

2550
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:23,679
robotics

2551
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:25,198
but it's fun it's fun to kind of imagine

2552
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:27,039
and i think the planetary

2553
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:28,479
side of it comes into play in

2554
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:30,399
understanding the surfaces of these

2555
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:32,879
asteroids more and more

2556
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:34,319
that you know forget sort of destruction

2557
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,239
of human civilization

2558
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:38,158
it'd be cool to have like spacecraft

2559
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:39,039
just landing on all these asteroids to

2560
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:41,279
study them

2561
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:42,800
at scale and being able to figure out

2562
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:45,119
dynamically

2563
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,520
what you know whether it's a rubble pile

2564
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:49,840
or whether it's

2565
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,360
a solid objects do you see that kind of

2566
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,840
future of science

2567
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:54,880
maybe 100 200 300 years from now where

2568
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,239
there's just

2569
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,119
robots expanding out through the solar

2570
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:01,279
system like

2571
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:02,639
sensors essentially some of it taking

2572
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:04,399
pictures from a distance some of them

2573
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,039
landing just exploring and giving us

2574
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:06,319
data

2575
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:09,439
because it feels like we're working with

2576
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:09,439
very little data right now

2577
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:16,000
sure i i do see exploration going

2578
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,560
that way i think um

2579
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,600
[Music]

2580
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:23,280
the way that nasa's currently

2581
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,960
or historically has been doing missions

2582
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:25,920
is putting together these these really

2583
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,520
large

2584
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,119
missions that do a lot of things that

2585
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,199
are extremely well tested and have a

2586
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:35,198
very low rate of failure but

2587
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:38,079
now that these sort of cubesat

2588
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:39,919
technologies are are becoming easier to

2589
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:41,920
build easier to launch

2590
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,760
they're they're very cheap and you know

2591
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:45,039
nasa is getting involved in this as well

2592
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,039
there's there's

2593
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:48,479
a lot of interest in these missions that

2594
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:50,479
are relatively small

2595
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:53,039
relatively cheap and just do one thing

2596
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:54,559
so you can really optimize it to

2597
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:56,158
just do this one thing and maybe you

2598
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,520
could build 100 of them and send them to

2599
01:28:56,158 --> 01:28:59,279
different asteroids and they would just

2600
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,880
collect this one piece of information

2601
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,599
from each asteroid

2602
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:05,840
it's a kind of different more

2603
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,400
distributed way of doing science i guess

2604
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,960
um and there's a ton of potential there

2605
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:13,759
i agree

2606
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:15,119
let me ask you about objects or one

2607
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,760
particular object from

2608
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:19,519
outside our solar system we don't get to

2609
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,520
study many of these right

2610
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,120
they don't we don't get stuff that just

2611
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,040
flies in out of nowhere

2612
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:27,840
from outside the solar system and flies

2613
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:30,560
through apparently there's been two

2614
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,520
recently in the past few years one of

2615
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:35,120
them

2616
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,520
is amor more what are your thoughts

2617
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:39,198
about

2618
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:41,280
amor more so fun to say

2619
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:43,519
could it could it be space junk from a

2620
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:46,639
distant alien civilization or is it just

2621
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,639
a weird shaped comet

2622
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:53,600
i like the way that's freezed um so

2623
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:55,279
umua is is a fascinating object just the

2624
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,079
fact that we have started discovering

2625
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:57,359
things

2626
01:29:56,079 --> 01:29:59,198
that are coming in from outside our

2627
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:01,920
solar system is amazing

2628
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:02,879
uh and can can start to study them and

2629
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,399
now that we have seen

2630
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:09,119
some we can

2631
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:11,119
design now kind of thinking in advance

2632
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:12,479
the next time we see one we will be much

2633
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:14,158
more ready for it we will know which

2634
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:16,479
telescopes we want to point at it we

2635
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:18,319
will have explored whether we could even

2636
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:20,799
launch a fast turnaround mission to

2637
01:30:18,319 --> 01:30:22,559
actually like get to it before it leaves

2638
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:26,719
the solar system

2639
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:28,400
um in terms of a muammua yeah it's

2640
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,319
for an object in our solar system it's

2641
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:33,519
really unusual

2642
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:36,319
in two particular ways

2643
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,840
one is the dimensions that we don't see

2644
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:38,399
natural things in our solar system that

2645
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,480
are

2646
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:41,839
kind of long and skinny we see the

2647
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:43,759
things we see in our solar system don't

2648
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:46,880
deviate from spherical by

2649
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:48,320
that much um and then that it showed

2650
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,239
these strange properties

2651
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:52,000
of accelerating as it was leaving the

2652
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:53,198
solar system which was not understood at

2653
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,039
first

2654
01:30:53,198 --> 01:31:00,158
so in terms of the

2655
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:03,279
alien space junk you know as a scientist

2656
01:31:00,158 --> 01:31:03,839
i cannot rule out that possibility i

2657
01:31:03,279 --> 01:31:06,960
have no

2658
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:09,039
evidence to the contrary um

2659
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,480
however so you're saying there's a

2660
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:13,119
chance

2661
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:15,519
i cannot i cannot as a scientist

2662
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:18,559
honestly say that i can rule out

2663
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,280
that it's alien space junk however i i

2664
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,480
see

2665
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:26,079
the kind of alien explanation

2666
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:27,359
as following this uh the sagan's

2667
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:29,359
extraordinary claims

2668
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:31,359
require extraordinary evidence if you

2669
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:32,719
are going to actually claim that

2670
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:37,279
something is

2671
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:38,800
aliens um you need to carefully evaluate

2672
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:41,039
one needs to carefully evaluate the

2673
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,760
other options and see whether

2674
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:45,039
it could just be something that we know

2675
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:48,239
exists that makes sense

2676
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:48,238
in the case of a muammua

2677
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:52,079
there are explanations that fit well

2678
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:54,239
within

2679
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:55,679
our our understanding of how things work

2680
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:58,399
so there are a couple

2681
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:59,920
there are two hypotheses for what it

2682
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:02,319
could be made of they're both

2683
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:04,319
both basically just ice shards in one

2684
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:05,920
case it's a nitrogen ice shard that came

2685
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:07,279
off of something like pluto in another

2686
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,520
solar system

2687
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:11,039
that pluto got hit with something and

2688
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,199
broke up into pieces and one of those

2689
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:17,119
pieces came through our solar system

2690
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:20,559
in the other scenario it's a bit of a

2691
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:21,439
failed solar system so our solar system

2692
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,719
formed out of a

2693
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:26,319
collapsing molecular cloud sometimes

2694
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,880
those molecular clouds are not massive

2695
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:29,599
enough

2696
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:31,279
and they sort of collapse into bits but

2697
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,039
they don't actually form a solar system

2698
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:34,880
but you end up with these kind of chunks

2699
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:37,439
of hydrogen ice apparently

2700
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,639
and so one of those chunks of hydrogen

2701
01:32:37,439 --> 01:32:39,678
ice could have got ejected and passed

2702
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,199
through our solar system

2703
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:45,600
so both cases explain

2704
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:46,399
these properties in about the same way

2705
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,960
so

2706
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:50,559
those ices will sublimate once they've

2707
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,239
passed the sun and so as they're moving

2708
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,639
away from the sun you have the hydrogen

2709
01:32:52,238 --> 01:32:56,559
or nitrogen ice sublimating off

2710
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:58,800
the sunward part of it and so that is

2711
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:01,520
responsible for the acceleration

2712
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,760
the shape also because you have all this

2713
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:06,560
ice sublimating off the surface

2714
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,639
uh if you take something the the analogy

2715
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:10,400
that um

2716
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:12,480
works pretty well here is for a bar of

2717
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:14,319
soap your bar of soap

2718
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:16,959
starts out sort of close to spherical at

2719
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:18,559
least from a physicist's perspective

2720
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,719
and as you use it over time you

2721
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:23,520
eventually end up with this long thin

2722
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:24,239
shard because it's been just by sort of

2723
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,010
weathering

2724
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:27,839
as we would call it um

2725
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:29,440
[Music]

2726
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,520
and so in the same way if you just

2727
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:33,119
sublimate material off of one of these

2728
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,040
ice shards it ends up

2729
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:36,800
long and thin and it ends up

2730
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,479
accelerating out of the solar system

2731
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,480
and so given that these properties can

2732
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:44,158
be reasonably well explained that way

2733
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:45,919
um you know we should be

2734
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:47,198
extremely skeptical about attributing

2735
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,000
things to

2736
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:52,000
yeah aliens see the reason i like to

2737
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,158
think that it's aliens

2738
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
is because it puts a lot of priority on

2739
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:58,479
us not being lazy

2740
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,920
and we need to catch this thing next

2741
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:02,319
time it comes around

2742
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,359
i like the idea that there's objects not

2743
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:05,359
like i

2744
01:34:03,359 --> 01:34:06,399
it's almost saddens me they they come

2745
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:09,119
out of the darkness

2746
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:10,399
really fast they just fly by and go and

2747
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:12,319
leave

2748
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:14,319
it just seems like a wasted opportunity

2749
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:19,039
not to study them

2750
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:21,439
it's like uh it's the easiest ways to do

2751
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:23,279
space travel outside of the solar system

2752
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:25,519
it's having the things come to us

2753
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:26,719
right i like that way of putting it and

2754
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:30,000
like it would be nice to just

2755
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:32,960
land on it like and first of all

2756
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,880
really importantly detect it early yes

2757
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:38,000
and then land on it

2758
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:40,960
like with a really nice

2759
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,560
like spacecraft and study the hell out

2760
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,920
of it

2761
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:48,400
and you know i because

2762
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,679
yeah it uh if there's a chance it's

2763
01:34:48,399 --> 01:34:53,519
aliens

2764
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:57,279
alien life it just feels like

2765
01:34:53,520 --> 01:35:00,719
such a cheap way inexpensive way

2766
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:01,279
to get information about alien life or

2767
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:03,359
something

2768
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:05,359
interesting that's out there and i'm not

2769
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:08,238
sure if a nice shard from another

2770
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:09,359
planetary system will be interesting but

2771
01:35:08,238 --> 01:35:10,799
it very well could be

2772
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:12,479
it could be totally new sets of

2773
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,360
materials it could be to tell us about

2774
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:16,399
composition of

2775
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:18,000
of planets we don't quite understand

2776
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:19,679
and it's just nice one especially in the

2777
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,800
case of a momoi i guess it was pretty

2778
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:23,520
close to earth

2779
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,520
it would have been nice to uh to uh you

2780
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,440
know it's like

2781
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:29,199
don't go there they come to us i don't

2782
01:35:27,439 --> 01:35:31,198
know that's what makes me

2783
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:33,039
uh that that's what makes me quite a sad

2784
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:35,279
it's a missed opportunity

2785
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:36,639
well yeah and whether whether you think

2786
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:38,719
it's aliens or not it's

2787
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:40,159
it's a missed opportunity but you know

2788
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:40,960
we weren't prepared and we will be

2789
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:44,238
prepared for

2790
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:46,639
the next ones and um as

2791
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:48,479
so there's been a movement in astronomy

2792
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:50,639
more towards what's called time domain

2793
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:52,238
astronomy so kind of monitoring

2794
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,840
the whole sky all the time at all

2795
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:55,678
wavelengths that's kind of the goal and

2796
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:57,440
so we expect to detect

2797
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:59,199
many more of these in the future even

2798
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:00,960
though these were the first two we saw

2799
01:35:59,198 --> 01:36:02,559
our potential to detect them is only

2800
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,600
increasing with time and so there will

2801
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,239
be more

2802
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,480
opportunities and you know based on

2803
01:36:06,238 --> 01:36:10,079
these two we now can

2804
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:11,759
actually sit and think about what we'll

2805
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:14,319
do when the next one shows up

2806
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,880
i also what it made me realize i i know

2807
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:16,799
i didn't

2808
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:19,359
really think through this but it made me

2809
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,480
realize if there is alien civilizations

2810
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:22,799
out there

2811
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:24,559
the thing we're most likely to see first

2812
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:28,159
would be space junk

2813
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:32,400
my stupid understanding of it

2814
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:32,399
the second would be really dumb kind of

2815
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:36,639
you could think of maybe like relay

2816
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:40,238
nodes or something objects

2817
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:42,639
that you need to have a whole lot of

2818
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:44,079
for particular purposes of like space

2819
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:46,000
travel and so on

2820
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:48,000
like uh speed limit signs or something i

2821
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,118
don't know whatever we have on earth a

2822
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,679
lot of

2823
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:52,399
that's dumb it's not alien aliens in

2824
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:55,199
themselves

2825
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:56,158
it's like artifacts that are useful to

2826
01:36:55,198 --> 01:36:57,599
the engineering

2827
01:36:56,158 --> 01:37:00,559
in the systems that are engineered by

2828
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:03,760
alien civilizations so like

2829
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:05,360
it would we would see a lot of stuff

2830
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,960
in terms of setting in terms of looking

2831
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:07,759
for alien life and trying to communicate

2832
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:12,000
with it

2833
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:15,119
maybe we should be looking not for like

2834
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:17,679
smart creatures

2835
01:37:15,118 --> 01:37:18,559
or systems to communicate with maybe we

2836
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:22,158
should be

2837
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:25,360
looking for artifacts or even as dumb as

2838
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:25,759
like space junk it just kind of reframed

2839
01:37:25,359 --> 01:37:27,759
my

2840
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,800
perspective of like what are we looking

2841
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,600
for as signs

2842
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,360
is there there could be a lot of stuff

2843
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,159
that doesn't have intelligence but gives

2844
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:36,238
us really strong

2845
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:37,519
signs that there's somewhere is life or

2846
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:41,359
intelligent life

2847
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:43,520
and um yeah that made me kind of

2848
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:45,118
i know it might be dumb to say but

2849
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:47,199
reframe the kind of thing that we should

2850
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:50,319
be looking for

2851
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:52,319
yeah it's so the the benefit of looking

2852
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:55,039
for intelligent life is that we perhaps

2853
01:37:52,319 --> 01:37:57,118
have a better chance of recognizing it

2854
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:58,960
um yeah we couldn't necessarily

2855
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:00,479
recognize what an alien stop sign look

2856
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,639
like

2857
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:03,839
um that's true and maybe you know the

2858
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,359
the theorists are

2859
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,760
the people who sort of model and try to

2860
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:09,519
understand solar system objects are

2861
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,679
are pretty good at coming up with models

2862
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,800
for anything i mean if maybe umua was a

2863
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:15,118
stop sign

2864
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,079
but we're clever enough that we could

2865
01:38:15,118 --> 01:38:18,158
come up with

2866
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:19,840
some physical explanations for it and

2867
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:21,198
then you know we all want to go with the

2868
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,880
simplest possible

2869
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:25,678
we all want to believe the sort of most

2870
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,520
skeptical uh possible explanation and so

2871
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:29,118
we missed it because we're too good at

2872
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:31,520
coming up with alternate explanations

2873
01:38:29,118 --> 01:38:33,599
for things and it's such an outlier such

2874
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,360
a rare phenomenon that we can't

2875
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,039
we can't study you know a hundred or a

2876
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:39,599
thousand of these objects we have

2877
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:41,359
we had just one and so the science

2878
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,880
almost destroys uh

2879
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:44,799
the possibility of something special

2880
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,800
being there it's like a

2881
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,480
uh johnny ive this designer of apple i

2882
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,079
don't know if you know who that is he's

2883
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:52,158
the lead designer he's the

2884
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:53,439
person who designed the iphone and all

2885
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:55,759
the major things

2886
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:57,519
and he talked about he's brilliant one

2887
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,199
of my favorite humans on earth

2888
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,920
and one of the best designers in the

2889
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:04,079
history of earth

2890
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,359
he talked about like when he had this

2891
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:07,519
origins of an idea

2892
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:09,599
like in his baby stages he would not

2893
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,840
tell steve jobs because steve would

2894
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,840
usually like trample all over it he

2895
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,039
would say this is dumb idea

2896
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:16,800
and so i sometimes think of the

2897
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:18,000
scientific community in that sense

2898
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,199
because

2899
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,560
the the weapon of the scientific method

2900
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:25,919
is so strong

2901
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,239
at its best that it sometimes crushes

2902
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,158
the

2903
01:39:26,238 --> 01:39:31,599
out of the box outlier evidence

2904
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:33,920
you know we don't get a lot of that

2905
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,440
evidence because we don't have um

2906
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,960
we're not lucky enough to have a lot of

2907
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:40,079
evidence so we have to deal with just

2908
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:43,520
special cases and special cases could

2909
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:44,319
present an inkling of something much

2910
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,239
bigger

2911
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:48,000
but the scientific method user tramples

2912
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:48,638
all over and it's hard to know what to

2913
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,118
do

2914
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:51,920
with that because the scientific method

2915
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:53,519
works

2916
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:55,039
but at the same time every once in a

2917
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,119
while it's like a balance

2918
01:39:55,039 --> 01:39:59,519
you have to do 99 of the time you have

2919
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:01,039
to do like scientific rigor

2920
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,560
but every once in a while this is not

2921
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:05,840
you saying me saying

2922
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:08,880
smoke some weed and sit back and think

2923
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:11,360
i wonder you know it's the joe rogan

2924
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:14,400
thing it's entirely possible

2925
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:17,839
that it's alien space junk

2926
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:19,359
anyway yeah i think so i i completely

2927
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:22,960
agree and i think that

2928
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:23,439
most scientists do speculate about these

2929
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,079
things

2930
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:27,198
it's just at what point do you act on

2931
01:40:26,079 --> 01:40:30,158
those things

2932
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:32,158
um so you're right that the scientific

2933
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:35,439
method has inherent skepticism and

2934
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:37,039
for the most part that's a good thing

2935
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:38,238
because it means that we're not just

2936
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:42,800
believing

2937
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:46,000
crazy things all the time but

2938
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:49,119
it's an interesting point that

2939
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:51,840
requiring that high level of of rigor

2940
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:53,039
occasionally means that you will miss

2941
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,440
something that is

2942
01:40:53,039 --> 01:40:56,479
truly interesting because you needed to

2943
01:40:55,439 --> 01:40:58,719
verify it

2944
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:00,319
three times and it wasn't verifiable i

2945
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,319
also think like when you communicate

2946
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:03,759
with the general public

2947
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:06,079
i think there's power in that one

2948
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:09,360
percent speculation

2949
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:12,399
of just demonstrating authenticity as a

2950
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:15,118
human being as a curious human being

2951
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:15,679
i think too often the i think this is

2952
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:18,238
changing

2953
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:20,000
but uh i saw i've been quite

2954
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:21,118
disappointed my colleagues throughout

2955
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,359
2020 with the

2956
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:25,920
with with the coronavirus there's too

2957
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:28,719
much speaking from authority

2958
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,920
as opposed to speaking from curiosity

2959
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:32,079
there's some of the most incredible

2960
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:34,560
science has been done in 2020 especially

2961
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:38,880
on the virology biology side

2962
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:40,159
and the kind of being talked down to by

2963
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,279
scientists is always really

2964
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:43,839
disappointing to me

2965
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:45,439
as opposed to inspiring like the things

2966
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,800
we there's a lot of uncertainty about

2967
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:49,359
the coronavirus

2968
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,400
but we know a lot of stuff and we speak

2969
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:52,079
from

2970
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:53,759
scientists from various disciplines

2971
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:56,559
speak from data

2972
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,760
in the face of that uncertainty and

2973
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,280
we're curious we don't know what the

2974
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,000
hell is going on we don't know if this

2975
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:03,039
virus is going

2976
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,279
to evolve evolve mutate we don't know if

2977
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:07,039
this virus or the next one

2978
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:08,479
might you know might destroy all human

2979
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:08,880
civilization you can't speak with

2980
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:11,839
certain

2981
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:14,639
in fact i you know i was on a on a

2982
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:16,000
survey paper about masks

2983
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:18,079
something i don't talk much about

2984
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,960
because i don't like politics

2985
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:22,479
but we don't know if masks work but

2986
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,000
there's a lot of evidence to show that

2987
01:42:22,479 --> 01:42:25,359
they work for this particular

2988
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,600
the transmission of the virus is

2989
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:30,000
fascinating actually the

2990
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,199
the biomechanics of the way viruses

2991
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,840
spread

2992
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:34,638
is fascinating it if it wasn't

2993
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,880
destructive

2994
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:39,279
it would be beautiful and we don't know

2995
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:40,480
but it's it's inspiring to to apply the

2996
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:42,960
scientific message

2997
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:44,238
to the best of our ability but also to

2998
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,960
show that you don't always know

2999
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:47,359
everything

3000
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:49,279
and to and perhaps not about the virus

3001
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:52,799
as much but

3002
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:55,118
other things speculate what if you know

3003
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:56,000
what what if it's uh the worst case and

3004
01:42:55,118 --> 01:42:58,399
the best case

3005
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,840
and um because that's ultimately what we

3006
01:42:58,399 --> 01:43:02,238
are descendants of apes that are just

3007
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:05,039
curious about the world around us

3008
01:43:02,238 --> 01:43:07,198
yeah i uh i'll just add to that not on

3009
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:09,198
the topic of masks but on the topic of

3010
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:13,519
curiosity that's

3011
01:43:09,198 --> 01:43:16,479
um i mean i think that's

3012
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,920
astronomy and planetary sciences a field

3013
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:20,079
are

3014
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,039
a little are are unique because for

3015
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:24,000
better and

3016
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:26,238
for worse they don't directly impact

3017
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,960
humanity

3018
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:29,359
so you know we're not studying virology

3019
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:33,039
to

3020
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:35,439
to prevent transmission of um

3021
01:43:33,039 --> 01:43:36,840
you know illness amongst humans we're

3022
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:38,719
not

3023
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:42,480
characterizing volcanoes on earth that

3024
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:46,079
could destroy cities we and it really is

3025
01:43:42,479 --> 01:43:49,198
a more curious and in my opinion playful

3026
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:51,039
scientific field than many um

3027
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:52,879
yeah so for better and worse we can kind

3028
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:54,880
of afford to pursue some of the

3029
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:57,279
speculation more because

3030
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,279
human lives are not in danger if we

3031
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:03,359
speculate a little bit too freely

3032
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:05,679
and get something wrong yeah definitely

3033
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:08,158
in the space of ai i am worried that

3034
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:11,440
we're sometimes too eager

3035
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:13,679
speaking for myself to uh like flip

3036
01:44:11,439 --> 01:44:15,839
the switch to on just to see like what

3037
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:17,520
happens uh maybe sometimes we want to be

3038
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:21,039
a little bit careful about that

3039
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:23,520
because uh bad things might happen

3040
01:44:21,039 --> 01:44:24,238
is there books or movies in your life

3041
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:27,679
long ago

3042
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:29,039
or recently that um that were inspiring

3043
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:30,239
had an impact on you that you would

3044
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:33,198
recommend

3045
01:44:30,238 --> 01:44:34,079
yeah absolutely uh so many that i just

3046
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:37,599
don't know where to start

3047
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:39,198
with it um so i i love reading i read

3048
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:41,520
obsessively i've been reading

3049
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:42,559
fiction and a little bit of non-fiction

3050
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:45,520
but mostly fiction

3051
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,560
obsessively since i was a child and just

3052
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:49,920
never stopped

3053
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:51,920
um so i have some favorite books

3054
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:54,158
none of them are easy reading so i

3055
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:55,920
definitely i mean i recommend them for

3056
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:56,559
somebody who likes an intellectual

3057
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:59,840
challenge

3058
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:02,960
in the books that they read um

3059
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,679
so maybe i should go chronologically i

3060
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,560
have at least

3061
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:06,880
three i'm not going to go through 50

3062
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:11,039
here

3063
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:13,679
but yeah i'd love to also like uh

3064
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:15,039
maybe ideas that you took away from sure

3065
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,359
as you mentioned

3066
01:45:15,039 --> 01:45:20,079
yeah yeah why they were so compelling to

3067
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:21,679
me um

3068
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:23,439
one of the first books that really

3069
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:27,039
captured my fascination

3070
01:45:23,439 --> 01:45:31,839
was nabakov's book pale fire oh wow

3071
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:31,840
um are you familiar with it so

3072
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,079
i read it actually for a class it's one

3073
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:39,359
of the few books i've ever read for a

3074
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:42,719
class that i actually really liked

3075
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:44,880
and the book is

3076
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:46,480
it's in some sense a puzzle he's a

3077
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,679
brilliant writer of course

3078
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:52,959
um but the book is like it's it's

3079
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:53,920
formatted like a poem so there's an

3080
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:56,960
introduction

3081
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:59,920
a very long poem and footnotes

3082
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:01,359
and you get part way through it before

3083
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,239
realizing that the whole thing is

3084
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:04,399
actually

3085
01:46:02,238 --> 01:46:05,279
a novel unless you sort of read up on it

3086
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:06,559
going in but

3087
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:08,399
but the whole thing is a novel and

3088
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:11,280
there's a story that

3089
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:13,839
slowly reveals itself over the course of

3090
01:46:11,279 --> 01:46:13,840
all of this

3091
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:21,439
and kind of reveals this

3092
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:23,920
just fascinating character basically and

3093
01:46:21,439 --> 01:46:26,238
how how his mind works in this story

3094
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,600
the idea of a novel also being a kind of

3095
01:46:26,238 --> 01:46:30,638
intellectual

3096
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:32,639
puzzle and something that slowly reveals

3097
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:34,400
itself over the course of reading

3098
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:36,079
was really fascinating to me and i have

3099
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:39,759
since found a lot more

3100
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:41,519
writers like that you know

3101
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:44,400
contemporary example that comes to mind

3102
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:46,560
is kazuo ishiguro who's pretty much

3103
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:47,759
all of his books are like slow reveals

3104
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,119
over the course of the book and like

3105
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:50,880
nothing much

3106
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:52,719
happens in the books but you keep

3107
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,960
reading them because you just want to

3108
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:57,439
know like what the reality is that he's

3109
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:59,679
slowly revealing to you

3110
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:02,000
the kind of discovery oriented reading

3111
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:05,199
maybe

3112
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,560
what's the second one perhaps my

3113
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:09,039
favorite writer is

3114
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,039
rainier

3115
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:16,239
you're hitting hidden ones i mean i know

3116
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,719
in the bulk of well but

3117
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:19,359
now i've never read pale fire but really

3118
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:22,000
i've never

3119
01:47:19,359 --> 01:47:22,559
i know it's a very difficult read i know

3120
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,880
that much

3121
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,960
yeah right all of these are difficult

3122
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:29,520
reads i think i just

3123
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,480
i read for in part for an intellectual

3124
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,840
challenge

3125
01:47:30,479 --> 01:47:36,158
but relka so he wrote

3126
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:38,560
one thing that might be characterizable

3127
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:40,479
as a novel but he wrote a lot of poetry

3128
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:43,119
i mean he wrote this series of poems

3129
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:45,599
called the duino elegies that were very

3130
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:46,799
impactful for me personally just

3131
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:50,000
emotionally

3132
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:53,039
um which actually it kind of ties in

3133
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:57,359
with astronomy um

3134
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:58,800
in that there's there's a sense

3135
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:01,920
you know in which we're all going

3136
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:04,079
through our lives alone and there's just

3137
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:07,600
this sense of kind of profound

3138
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:11,118
loneliness in the existence of every

3139
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:15,600
individual human and i think

3140
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:17,920
i was drawn to astronomy in part because

3141
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:20,239
the sort of vast spaces the kind of

3142
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:22,719
loneliness and desolateness of

3143
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:24,479
of space made the sort of internal

3144
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:26,560
loneliness feel okay

3145
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:27,599
in a sense it like gave companionship

3146
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:31,440
and

3147
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:35,440
um i that's how i feel about roelka's

3148
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:37,678
poetry he turns the kind of

3149
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:40,238
desolation and loneliness of human

3150
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:43,600
existence into something

3151
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:45,759
joyful and almost meaningful

3152
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:48,400
yeah there's something about melancholy

3153
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:52,800
i don't know about rookie in general but

3154
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:52,799
like contemplating the

3155
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,520
the melancholy nature of our of the

3156
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,639
human condition

3157
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:02,159
that makes it okay

3158
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:04,800
like i gentle from an engineering

3159
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:06,559
perspective think that there is

3160
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,800
so much loneliness we haven't explored

3161
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:11,520
within ourselves yet

3162
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:13,679
and that's my hope is to build ai

3163
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,440
systems that help us explore our own

3164
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:17,679
loneliness

3165
01:49:15,439 --> 01:49:18,479
i think that's kind of what love is and

3166
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:21,679
friendship is

3167
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:22,238
is somebody who in a very small way

3168
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:24,480
helps us

3169
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:25,359
explore our own loneliness like they

3170
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:28,479
listen

3171
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:29,839
we connect like two lonely creatures

3172
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:32,799
connect for a time

3173
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,440
that's like oh like acknowledge that we

3174
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:37,279
exist

3175
01:49:33,439 --> 01:49:40,000
together like for a brief time

3176
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:41,519
but in a somewhat shallow way i think

3177
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,599
relative to how much

3178
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:45,199
it's possible to truly connect those two

3179
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:47,679
consciousnesses so

3180
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:48,479
ai might be able to help on that on that

3181
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:50,880
front

3182
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:52,638
uh so what's the third one actually you

3183
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,319
know i hadn't realized until this moment

3184
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:55,679
but it's yet another one of these kind

3185
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:58,880
of slow reveal

3186
01:49:55,679 --> 01:50:00,960
books um it's a contemporary

3187
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,920
uh russian i think russian-american

3188
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,279
writer named

3189
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:07,840
olga grisham g-r-u-s-h-i-n

3190
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:10,158
and she wrote this just phenomenal book

3191
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:13,039
called the dream life of sukhinov

3192
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:14,638
that i read this year maybe it was last

3193
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:17,920
year for the first time

3194
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:19,679
and it's just a really beautiful

3195
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:21,679
this one you could call a character

3196
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:25,440
study i think

3197
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:29,118
of a russian father coming to terms with

3198
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:34,319
himself and his own past um

3199
01:50:29,118 --> 01:50:37,679
as he potentially slowly loses his mind

3200
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:39,679
slow reveal slow reveal

3201
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:43,279
well that's apparent from the beginning

3202
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:46,158
i hope i don't think it's a spoiler

3203
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:47,759
decline into madness spoiler alert so

3204
01:50:46,158 --> 01:50:48,479
all of these are really heavy i don't

3205
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,840
know i just

3206
01:50:48,479 --> 01:50:52,000
i don't have anything lighter to

3207
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:55,760
recommend ishiguro's the light version

3208
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:57,599
of this okay um well heavy is

3209
01:50:55,760 --> 01:51:00,000
has a certain kind of beauty to it in

3210
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:01,760
itself is there advice you would give to

3211
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,279
a young person today

3212
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:04,560
that looks up to the stars and wonders

3213
01:51:03,279 --> 01:51:04,960
what the heck they want to do with their

3214
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:09,520
life

3215
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:11,679
so career science life in general

3216
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:14,960
you've uh for now chosen a certain kind

3217
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:16,800
of path of curiosity

3218
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:20,239
what uh what insights do you draw from

3219
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:23,760
that you can give us advice to others

3220
01:51:20,238 --> 01:51:25,118
i think for somebody i i would not

3221
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:27,920
presume to speak

3222
01:51:25,118 --> 01:51:29,839
to giving people advice on on life and

3223
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:32,079
humanity overall but for somebody

3224
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,719
thinking of

3225
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:35,760
being a scientist so there are a couple

3226
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:39,039
of things

3227
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:41,199
one sort of practical thing which is

3228
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:43,039
career-wise i hadn't appreciated this

3229
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:46,079
going into science but

3230
01:51:43,039 --> 01:51:48,319
you need to so

3231
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:50,559
the the questions you're working on and

3232
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:54,479
the techniques you use

3233
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:56,159
are both of very high importance maybe

3234
01:51:54,479 --> 01:51:57,839
equal importance for being happy in your

3235
01:51:56,158 --> 01:51:59,359
career

3236
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,119
if there are questions you're interested

3237
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:02,960
in but the techniques that you need to

3238
01:52:01,118 --> 01:52:05,519
use to do them

3239
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:06,560
are tedious for you then your job is

3240
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,679
going to be miserable

3241
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:12,320
even if the questions are inspiring so

3242
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:13,039
you have to find but if the techniques

3243
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:15,198
that you use

3244
01:52:13,039 --> 01:52:16,560
are things that excite you then your job

3245
01:52:15,198 --> 01:52:18,559
is fun every day

3246
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:20,080
so for me i'm fascinated by the solar

3247
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:22,080
system and i love

3248
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:23,359
telescopes and i love doing data

3249
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:24,880
analysis playing with data from

3250
01:52:23,359 --> 01:52:26,399
telescopes coming up with new ways to

3251
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:27,599
use telescopes and so that's where i

3252
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:30,479
have found that

3253
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:32,239
mesh but if i was interested in you know

3254
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:33,839
the dynamical evolution of the solar

3255
01:52:32,238 --> 01:52:35,598
system how the orbits of things evolve

3256
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,599
then i would need to do a different

3257
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:39,119
type of work that i would just not find

3258
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:40,400
as appealing and so it just wouldn't be

3259
01:52:39,118 --> 01:52:42,960
a good fit and so

3260
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:44,479
it sort of is seems like an unromantic

3261
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:45,760
thing to have to think about the

3262
01:52:44,479 --> 01:52:47,759
techniques being the thing you want to

3263
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:50,000
work on also but it really makes

3264
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,119
a profound difference for i think your

3265
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,800
happiness and your

3266
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:54,479
scientific career i think that's really

3267
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:56,960
profound it's like the thing

3268
01:52:54,479 --> 01:52:58,718
the menial tasks if you enjoy those

3269
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:00,639
that's a really good sign that

3270
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:02,719
that's the right path for you i think

3271
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:06,239
david foster wallace said that uh the

3272
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:08,560
key to life is to be unborable

3273
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:09,678
so basically everything should be

3274
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:11,760
exciting

3275
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:13,118
i don't think that's feasible but you

3276
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,760
should find an area where

3277
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:16,399
everything is exciting i mean depending

3278
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,360
on the day

3279
01:53:16,399 --> 01:53:21,039
but you could find the joy in everything

3280
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:22,639
not just the big exciting

3281
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:24,960
chronicle things that everyone thinks is

3282
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:28,800
exciting but the

3283
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:30,800
the details the the repetitive stuff the

3284
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,279
medial stuff the stuff that takes years

3285
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,960
this

3286
01:53:31,279 --> 01:53:34,238
stuff that involves a lot of failure and

3287
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:35,679
all those kinds of things that you find

3288
01:53:34,238 --> 01:53:38,238
that enjoyable that's that's actually

3289
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:40,800
really profound to focus on that

3290
01:53:38,238 --> 01:53:42,559
uh because people talk about like dreams

3291
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,960
and passion and goals and so on the big

3292
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,159
thing

3293
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,920
but that's not actually what takes you

3294
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:46,319
there it takes you there's every single

3295
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,039
day

3296
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:50,399
putting in the hours and that's what

3297
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:52,399
actually makes up life

3298
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:54,399
is the boring bits and if the boring

3299
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:56,238
bits aren't boring and that's an

3300
01:53:54,399 --> 01:54:00,079
exciting life

3301
01:53:56,238 --> 01:54:02,319
let me uh because when you were talking

3302
01:54:00,079 --> 01:54:03,519
so romantically and passionately about

3303
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:06,319
io

3304
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:08,480
i remember the the poem by robert frost

3305
01:54:06,319 --> 01:54:10,079
so let me ask you uh let me read the

3306
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:12,079
poem and ask

3307
01:54:10,079 --> 01:54:13,359
what your opinion is that's called fire

3308
01:54:12,079 --> 01:54:15,198
and ice oh

3309
01:54:13,359 --> 01:54:17,679
yeah i could almost recite this from

3310
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:19,279
memory some say the world will end in

3311
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:21,279
fire some saying ice

3312
01:54:19,279 --> 01:54:23,279
from what i've tasted of desire hold

3313
01:54:21,279 --> 01:54:26,238
with those who favor fire

3314
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:27,439
but if i had to perish twice i think i

3315
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:30,479
know enough of hate

3316
01:54:27,439 --> 01:54:31,118
to say that for destruction ice is also

3317
01:54:30,479 --> 01:54:36,238
great

3318
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:38,960
and will suffice so uh let me ask

3319
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:41,198
if you had to only choose one would you

3320
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:44,800
choose the world to end in fire

3321
01:54:41,198 --> 01:54:48,319
in volcanic eruptions in heat

3322
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:51,760
and magma or in ice

3323
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:54,158
frozen over fire ice

3324
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:54,159
fire

3325
01:54:56,158 --> 01:55:02,839
excellent choice the sort of

3326
01:54:59,439 --> 01:55:06,000
i i've always been a fan of chaos and

3327
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:10,800
uh the idea of things

3328
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:14,000
just slowly getting cold and stopping

3329
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:16,159
and dying is just so depressing

3330
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,279
to me so much more depressing than

3331
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:19,759
things

3332
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:21,439
blowing up or you know burning or

3333
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:23,440
getting covered by a lava flow somehow

3334
01:55:21,439 --> 01:55:26,238
the like activity of it

3335
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:27,039
endows it with more like meaning to me

3336
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:28,959
maybe

3337
01:55:27,039 --> 01:55:30,399
some i've just now had this vision of

3338
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:32,319
you you know in action films where

3339
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:34,319
you're walking away without looking back

3340
01:55:32,319 --> 01:55:35,920

3342
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:40,800

3345
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:47,118
inspiring the

3346
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:49,920
the kind of things we'll discover about

3347
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:51,279
planets in the next few decades is super

3348
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:53,440

3349
01:55:51,279 --> 01:55:55,439

01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:58,319
life in one of them but there might be

3351
01:55:55,439 --> 01:55:59,118
and i i hope we discover just that and

um

3353
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:02,559

eruptions there's a

3355
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,080
