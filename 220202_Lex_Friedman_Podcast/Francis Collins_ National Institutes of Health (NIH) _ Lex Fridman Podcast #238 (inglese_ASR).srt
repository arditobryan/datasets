1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,879
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,679
francis collins director of the nih the

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,519
national institutes of health appointed

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,039
and reappointed to the role by three

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,839
presidents obama trump and biden

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:18,640
he oversees 27 separate institutes and

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,719
centers including nyad which makes him

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,920
anthony fauci's boss

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,479
at the nih francis helped launch and led

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
a huge number of projects that pushed

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,278
the frontiers of science health and

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,520
medicine including one of my favorites

13
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:36,159
the brain initiative that seeks to map

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,440
the human brain and understand how the

15
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,839
function arises from neural circuitry

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,159
before the nih francis led the human

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,399
genome project one of the largest and

18
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,759
most ambitious efforts in the history of

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
science

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,558
given all that francis is a humble

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,640
thoughtful kind man

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,039
and because of this to me he's one of

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,480
the best representatives of science in

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,239
the world he is a man of god and yet

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,198
also a friend of the late christopher

26
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:08,158
hitchens who called him quote one of the

27
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,319
greatest living americans

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,320
this is a lex friedman podcast to

29
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,559
support it please check out our sponsors

30
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:18,319
in the description and now here's my

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,280
conversation with francis collins

32
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,359
science at his best is a source of hope

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,079
so for me it's been difficult to watch

34
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,000
as it has during the pandemic become at

35
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,039
times a source of division

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,879
what i would love to do in this

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,360
conversation with you

38
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,078
is touch some difficult topics and do so

39
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,000
with empathy and humility so that we may

40
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,078
begin to regain a sense of trust in

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,759
science and then it may once again

42
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,599
become a source of hope

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,879
i hope that's okay with you i love the

44
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,519
goal

45
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,158
let's start with some hard questions

46
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,239
you called for quote thorough expert

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,439
driven and objective inquiry into the

48
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,359
origins of coven 19 so let me ask

49
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,078
is there a reasonable chance that covet

50
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:02,959
19 leaked from a lab

51
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:06,000
i can't exclude that i think it's fairly

52
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,239
unlikely i wish we had more ability to

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
be able to ask questions of the chinese

54
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,759
government and

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,520
learn more about what kind of records

56
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,439
might have been in the lab that we've

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,920
never been able to see

58
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,400
but most likely this was a natural

59
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,399
origin of a virus probably starting in a

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,039
bat perhaps traveling through some other

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,360
intermediate yet to be identified host

62
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,799
and finding its way into humans

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,879
is answering this question within the

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,280
realm of science do you think will we

65
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,759
ever know i think we might know if we

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,759
find that intermediate host

67
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,560
and there has not yet been a thorough

68
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,318
enough

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,680
investigation to say that that's not

70
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,560
going to happen

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,040
and remember it takes a while to do this

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,120
with sars it was 14 years before we

73
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,359
figured out it was the civet cat that

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,800
was the intermediate host with mers it

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,920
was a little quicker to discover it was

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
the camel

77
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,559
with sarsko v2 there's been some looking

78
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,439
but especially now with everything

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
really tense between the us and china if

80
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,878
there's looking going on we're not

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,480
getting told about it

82
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,399
do you think it's a scientific question

83
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,639
or a political question it's a

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
scientific question but it has political

85
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,479
implications

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,239
so the world is full of scientists that

87
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,679
are working together but in the

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,519
political space in the political

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
political science space

90
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,000
there's tensions

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,319
what is it like to do great science in a

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,840
time of a pandemic when there's

93
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:32,639
political tensions it's very unfortunate

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,920
pasteur said science knows no one

95
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,279
country

96
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:39,280
he was right about that my whole career

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
in genetics especially

98
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,519
is dependent upon international

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,400
collaboration between scientists as a

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,239
way

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,560
to make discoveries get things done

102
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,120
scientists by their nature

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,840
like to be involved in international

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,640
collaborations the human genome project

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,878
for heaven's sake 2 400 scientists in

106
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,318
six countries working together not

107
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,560
worrying who is going to get the credit

108
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,079
giving all the data away i was the

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,759
person who was supposed to keep all that

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,120
coordinated it was a wonderful

111
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,798
experience

112
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,438
and that included china that was sort of

113
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,719
their first real entry into a big

114
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,039
international

115
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,040
big science kind of project and they did

116
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,039
their part

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,799
it's very different now

118
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,199
continue on the line of difficult

119
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,198
questions

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,240
especially difficult ethical questions

121
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,159
in 2014

122
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,319
us put a hold on gain and function

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,000
research in response to a number of

124
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,879
laboratory biosecurity incidents

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,120
including anthrax smallpox and influenza

126
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,279
in december 2017

127
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,879
nih lifted this ban

128
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,638
because quote gain of functional

129
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,120
research is important in helping us

130
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,040
identify understand and develop

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
strategies and effective countermeasures

132
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,479
against rapidly evolving pathogens that

133
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,400
pose a threat to public health

134
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:59,120
all difficult questions have arguments

135
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,679
on both sides can you argue the pros and

136
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,280
cons of getting a function research with

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,879
viruses

138
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,599
i can

139
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,879
and first let me say this term gain of

140
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,520
function

141
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,519
is causing such confusion that i need to

142
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,159
take a minute and just sort of talk

143
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:19,279
about what the common scientific

144
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,120
use of that term is and where it is very

145
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,439
different when we're talking about the

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,959
current oversight of potentially

147
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,959
dangerous human pathogens

148
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,079
as you know in science we're doing gain

149
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,560
of function experiments all the time

150
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,159
we support a lot of cancer immunotherapy

151
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,000
at nih

152
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,080
right here in our clinical center there

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,800
are trials going on where people's

154
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,038
immune cells are taken out of their body

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
treated with a genetic therapy that revs

156
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,439
up their ability to discover the cancer

157
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,439
that that patient currently has maybe

158
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,560
even at stage four and then give them

159
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,120
back

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,600
as those little ninja warriors uh go

161
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,160
after the cancer and it sometimes works

162
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,000
dramatically that's a gain of function

163
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,520
you gave that patient a gain in their

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,478
immune function that may have saved

165
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,478
their life

166
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,159
so gotta be careful not to say oh gain

167
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,839
of function is bad

168
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,560
most of what we do

169
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,000
in science that's good involves quite a

170
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,519
bit of the hat

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,800
and we are all living with gains of

172
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,399
function every day i have a gain of

173
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,478
function because i'm wearing these

174
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,799
eyeglasses otherwise i would not be

175
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,719
seeing you as clearly i'm happy for that

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,439
gain of function

177
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,039
so

178
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,360
that's where a lot of confusion has

179
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:32,639
happened the kind of gain of function

180
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,360
which is now subject to very rigorous

181
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,960
and very carefully defined oversight

182
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,759
is when you are working with an

183
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,638
established human pathogen that is known

184
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,600
to be potentially causing a pandemic

185
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,478
and you are enhancing or potentially

186
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,840
enhancing its transmissibility or its

187
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,159
virulence

188
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:56,399
we call that epp

189
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,160
enhanced potential pandemic pathogen

190
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,519
that requires

191
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,439
this very stringent oversight worked out

192
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,120
over three years

193
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,240
by the national

194
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,199
science advisory board on biosecurity

195
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,840
that needs to be looked at by a panel

196
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,240
that goes well beyond nih to decide are

197
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,159
the benefits worth the risks in that

198
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,598
situation

199
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,560
most of the time

200
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:25,038
it's not worth the risk only three times

201
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,280
uh in the last three or four years uh

202
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,719
have experiments been given permission

203
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:33,119
to go forward they were all an influenza

204
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,520
so i will argue that if you're worried

205
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,759
about the next pandemic

206
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,918
the more you know about the coming enemy

207
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,840
the better chance you have to recognize

208
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,399
when trouble is starting

209
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,399
and so if you can do it safely

210
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,878
studying influenza

211
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,399
or coronaviruses like sars mers and

212
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,639
sarsko v2

213
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,719
would be a good thing to be able to know

214
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,120
about but you have to be able to do it

215
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,680
safely because we all know

216
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,598
lab accidents can happen and i mean look

217
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,840
at sars where there have been lab

218
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,038
accidents and people have gotten sick as

219
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,878
a result

220
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,800
we don't want to take that chance unless

221
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,759
there's a compelling scientific reason

222
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
that's why we have this very stringent

223
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,680
oversight

224
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,598
the experiments being done at the wuhan

225
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,639
institute of virology

226
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,759
as a sub-award to our grant to eco

227
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,879
health

228
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
in new york

229
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,680
did not meet that standard of requiring

230
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,198
that kind of stringent oversight i want

231
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,280
to be really clear about that because

232
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,158
there's been so much thrown around about

233
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,079
it

234
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,479
was it gain a function well in the

235
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,479
standard use of that term that you would

236
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,120
use in science in general you might say

237
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,120
it was but in the use of that term that

238
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,360
applies to this very

239
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,320
specific

240
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,000
example of a potential pandemic pathogen

241
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,959
absolutely not

242
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,679
so nothing went on there that should not

243
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,518
have happened based upon the oversight

244
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,319
there was an instance

245
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,320
where the grantee institution failed to

246
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,600
notify us about the result of an

247
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,040
experiment that they were supposed to

248
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,920
tell us where they

249
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:11,199
mixed and matched uh some viral genomes

250
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:15,120
and got a somewhat larger viral load as

251
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,120
a result but it was not epp it was not

252
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
getting into that zone that would have

253
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,440
required this higher level of scrutiny

254
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,680
it was all bat viruses these were not

255
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,080
human pathogens

256
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,039
so they didn't cross a threshold within

257
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,519
that gray area that makes for an eppp

258
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,958
they did not and anybody who's willing

259
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,200
to take the time

260
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,838
to look at what epp means and what those

261
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,519
experiments were would have to agree

262
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,360
with what i just said what is the

263
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,440
biggest reason it didn't cross that

264
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,440
threshold is it because it wasn't

265
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,760
jumping to humans

266
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,120
is it because it did not have a

267
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,360
sufficient increase in virulence and

268
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,679
transmissibility what's your sense

269
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,919
eppp only applies

270
00:09:53,679 --> 00:10:00,719
to agents that are known human pathogens

271
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,360
of potent of pandemic potential

272
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,639
these were all bat viruses derived in

273
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,200
the wild

274
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,799
not shown to be infectious to humans

275
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,959
just looking at what happened if you

276
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,599
took four different bat viruses and you

277
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,439
tried moving the spike protein gene from

278
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
one into one of the others to see

279
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,560
whether it would bind better to the ace2

280
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,799
receptor that doesn't get across that

281
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,838
threshold and let me also say for those

282
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,599
who are

283
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,760
trying to connect the dots here which is

284
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,040
the most troubling part of this and say

285
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:34,639
well this is how sarsko v2 got started

286
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,639
that is absolutely demonstrably false uh

287
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,439
these bat viruses that were being

288
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,240
studied had only about 80 percent

289
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,920
similarity in their genomes to sars cov2

290
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,680
they were like decades away in

291
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,679
evolutionary terms

292
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,799
and it is really irresponsible for

293
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,799
people to claim otherwise

294
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,559
speaking of people who claim otherwise

295
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
rand paul

296
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,119
what do you make of the battle of wars

297
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,720
between senator rand paul and dr anthony

298
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,159
fauci over this particular point

299
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,079
i don't want to talk about specific

300
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,958
members of congress but i will say it's

301
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,519
really unfortunate that tony fauci who

302
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,719
is the epitome of a dedicated public

303
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
servant

304
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,120
has now somehow been targeted for

305
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,200
political reasons

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,360
as somebody that

307
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
certain figures are trying to discredit

308
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,399
perhaps to try to distract from their

309
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,879
own failings

310
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,839
this never should have happened here's a

311
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:34,000
person who's dedicated his whole life uh

312
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,120
to trying to prevent illnesses from

313
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,679
infectious diseases including hiv

314
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,600
in the 1980s and 90s and now

315
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,439
probably the most

316
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,240
knowledgeable infectious disease

317
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,160
physician in the world and also a really

318
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,399
good communicator

319
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,639
is out there telling the truth about

320
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,320
where we are with sarsko v2

321
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,320
to certain political figures who don't

322
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,480
want to hear it and who are therefore

323
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,720
determined to discredit him

324
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,800
and that is disgraceful so with

325
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,560
politicians there they often play games

326
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:08,240
with black and white

327
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,399
they try to sort of uh use

328
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
the gray areas of science and then paint

329
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,839
their own picture

330
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,639
but i have a question about the gray

331
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,639
areas of science so like you mentioned

332
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,200
gain of function is a term there's very

333
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,159
specific scientific meaning but it also

334
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,240
has a more general term and it's very

335
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,480
possible to argue that the

336
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,079
not to argue not the way politicians

337
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,639
argue but just as human beings and

338
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,719
scientists that there was a gain of

339
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,839
function achieved

340
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,600
at the wuhan institute of

341
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,240
biology but it didn't cross a threshold

342
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,560
i mean there's a it's it's uh it but it

343
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,200
could have too so here's the thing when

344
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:50,319
you do these kinds of experiments

345
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,639
unexpected results may be achieved and

346
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,240
that's the gray area of science you're

347
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,399
you're taking risks with such

348
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,799
experiments

349
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,320
and i am very uncomfortable that we

350
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,319
can't

351
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,440
discuss the uncertainty in the gray area

352
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
of this

353
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,760
oh i'm comfortable discussing the gray

354
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,638
area what i'm uncomfortable with is

355
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,278
people deciding to define for themselves

356
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,519
what that threshold is based on sort of

357
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,639
some political argument the threshold

358
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,639
was very explicitly laid out

359
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,480
everybody agreed to that

360
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,799
in the basis of this three years of

361
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,120
deliberation so that's what it is if

362
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,000
that threshold needs to be reconsidered

363
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,600
let's reconsider it but let's not try to

364
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,078
take an experiment that's already been

365
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,399
done and decide that the threshold isn't

366
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,719
what it was because that that really is

367
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,639
doing a disservice to the whole process

368
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,000
i wish there was a discussion even in

369
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,759
response to

370
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,839
uh rand paul and i know we're not

371
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,679
talking about specific senators but just

372
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,360
that particular case i'm saying stuff

373
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,039
here i wish there's an opportunity to

374
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,440
talk about

375
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,799
given the current threshold this is not

376
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,240
gain of function

377
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,838
but maybe we need to reconsider the

378
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,839
threshold and have an action that's an

379
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,920
opportunity for discussion about the

380
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,600
ethics of gain or function you said that

381
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,519
there was three studies that passed that

382
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,680
threshold with influenza that's a

383
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,078
fascinating human question scientific

384
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,919
question about ethics because

385
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,759
you're playing like you said there's uh

386
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:18,240
there's pros and cons

387
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,240
you're taking risks here to prevent

388
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
horribly destructive viruses in the

389
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,959
future

390
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,839
but you also

391
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:28,399
are risking creating such viruses in the

392
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,000
future with nuclear weapons and nuclear

393
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,519
energy

394
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,879
you are

395
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,198
nuclear energy

396
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,120
promises a lot of positive effects and

397
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,759
yet you're taking risks here

398
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,720
with uh mutually sure destruction uh

399
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,480
nations possessing nuclear weapons oh my

400
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,879
you're a lot i hope we're not going

401
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,240
there well we're not but

402
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,838
a lot of people argue that that's the

403
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,320
reason we've nuclear weapons is the

404
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,120
reason we've prevented world wars

405
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,440
and yet they also have the risk of

406
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,120
starting world wars and this is what we

407
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,199
have to be honest about

408
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,959
with the with the benefits of risks of

409
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,879
science that you have to

410
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,638
make that calculation of what are the

411
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,198
pros and what are the cons i'm totally

412
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,959
with you but i want to reassure you lex

413
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:14,159
that this is not an issue that's been

414
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,599
ignored yes that this issue about the

415
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,480
kind of gain of function that might

416
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,720
result in a serious human pathogen has

417
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,959
been front and center in many

418
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,720
deliberations for a decade or more

419
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,359
involved a lot of my time along the way

420
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,079
by the way and has been discussed

421
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,079
publicly on multiple occasions including

422
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,078
two major meetings of the national

423
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,919
academy of sciences

424
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,838
getting input from everybody and

425
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,278
ultimately arriving at our current

426
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,519
framework now

427
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:46,559
we actually back in january of 2020 just

428
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,278
before covet 19 changed everything

429
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,278
had planned and even charged that same

430
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:54,078
national uh

431
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:56,320
science advisory by board on biosecurity

432
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,479
to reconvene and look at the current

433
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,320
framework and say do we have it right

434
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,120
let's look at the experience over those

435
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,120
three years and say is the threshold too

436
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,639
easy too hard

437
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,039
do we need to reconsider it let's look

438
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,879
at the experience kovit came along the

439
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,480
members of the board said please we're

440
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,639
all infectious disease experts we don't

441
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,199
have time for this right now but i think

442
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,560
the time is right to do this i'm totally

443
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,639
supportive of that and that should be

444
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,479
just as public a discussion as you can

445
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,720
imagine about what are the benefits and

446
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,800
the risk and if somebody decided

447
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,079
ultimately this came together and said

448
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,919
we just shouldn't be doing these

449
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,599
experiments under any circumstances if

450
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,599
that was the conclusion well that would

451
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,959
be the conclusion but it hasn't been so

452
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
far

453
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,638
if we can briefly look out into the next

454
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,559
hundred years on this

455
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,240
i apologize for the existential

456
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,039
questions

457
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
but

458
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:50,240
it seems obvious to me

459
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,039
that as gain of function type of

460
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,120
research and development becomes easier

461
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,919
and cheaper

462
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,078
it will become greater and greater risk

463
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,599
so if it doesn't no longer need to be

464
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:06,000
contained

465
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,599
within the laboratories of high security

466
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,119
it feels like this is one of the

467
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,678
greatest threats facing human

468
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,078
civilization do you worry that at some

469
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,919
point in the future a leaked man-made

470
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,480
virus may destroy

471
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,679
most of human civilization

472
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,838
i do worry about the risks and

473
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,919
at the moment where we have the greatest

474
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,599
control the greatest oversight

475
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,960
is when this is federally funded

476
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,879
research

477
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,200
but as you're alluding there's no reason

478
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,679
to imagine that's the only place that

479
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,880
this kind of activity would go on

480
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,360
if there was an evil source that wished

481
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,360
to create a virus that was highly

482
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:46,479
pathogenic in their garage

483
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:49,359
the technology does get easier

484
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,360
and there is no international oversight

485
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,359
about this either that you could say has

486
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,319
the same stringency as what we have in

487
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:58,000
the united states so yes that is a

488
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,279
concern

489
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,880
it would take

490
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:05,678
a seriously deranged group or person

491
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,000
to undertake this on purpose uh given

492
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,360
the likelihood that they too uh would go

493
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,079
down we

494
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,719
don't imagine there are going to be

495
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,480
bioweapons that only kill your enemies

496
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,360
and don't kill you sorry we're too much

497
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,480
alike for that to work

498
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,959
so

499
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,919
i don't see it as an imminent risk

500
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,160
there's lots of uh scary novels and

501
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,038
movies written about it but i do think

502
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,400
it's something we have to consider what

503
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,319
are all the things that ought to be

504
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,240
watched you may not know that if

505
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:40,159
somebody is ordering

506
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,079
a particular oligonucleotide

507
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,640
from one of the main suppliers and it

508
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:47,038
happens to match smallpox

509
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,160
they're going to get caught

510
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,400
so there is

511
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,558
effort underway to try to track any

512
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,080
nefarious actions that might be going on

513
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:55,759
in the united states or international is

514
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,000
there an international collaboration of

515
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,319
trying to track this stuff there is some

516
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,279
i wish it were stronger

517
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,359
this is a general issue like in terms of

518
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,440
do we have a mechanism particularly when

519
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,519
it comes to ethical issues

520
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,440
to be able to decide what's allowable

521
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,759
and what's not and enforce it i mean

522
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,840
look where we are with germline genome

523
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,000
editing for humans for instance there's

524
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,079
no enforcement mechanism there's just

525
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,240
bully pulpits and governments that get

526
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,480
to decide for themselves so you talked

527
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,400
about evil what about incompetence does

528
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,919
that worry you i was born in the soviet

529
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
union

530
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,679
my dad a physicist worked at chernobyl

531
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,880
that comes to mind that wasn't evil i

532
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,160
was

533
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,720
i don't know what word you want to put

534
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,160
it maybe incompetence is too harsh maybe

535
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,919
it's the inherent incompetence of

536
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,840
bureaucracy i don't know but for

537
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,720
whatever reason there was an accident

538
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,359
does that worry you of course it does

539
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,919
we know that sars for instance did

540
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,279
manage to leak out of a lab in china two

541
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,960
or three times

542
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,558
and at least in some instances people

543
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,558
died fortunately quickly contained

544
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,079
all one can do in that circumstance

545
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,480
because you need to

546
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,639
study the virus and understand it in

547
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,279
order to keep it from causing a broader

548
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,240
pandemic but you need to insist

549
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:14,798
upon the kind of biosecurity the bsl 2 3

550
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,960
and 4 framework under which those

551
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,279
experiments have to be done

552
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,600
and certainly at nih we're extremely

553
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,440
rigorous about that but you can't count

554
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,439
on every human being

555
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,120
to always do exactly what they're

556
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,200
supposed to so there's a risk there

557
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,079
which is another reason why if we're

558
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,600
contemplating supporting research on

559
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,879
pathogens that might be the next

560
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,719
pandemic

561
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,640
you have to factor that in not just

562
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,558
whether people are going to do something

563
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,080
on that we couldn't have predicted where

564
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,440
all of a sudden they created a virus

565
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,879
that's much worse without knowing they

566
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,440
were going to do that but also just

567
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,840
having an accident that's that's in the

568
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,440
mix when those uh estimates are done

569
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,678
about whether the risk is worth it or

570
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,679
not

571
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,558
continuing online of difficult questions

572
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:02,918
we're gonna get to fun stuff after a

573
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,918
while we will soon i promise

574
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,720
you are the director of the nih

575
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,240
you are dr anthony fauci's technically

576
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,640
his boss yep you have stood behind him

577
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,400
you have supported him just like you did

578
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,080
already in this conversation

579
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,919
it is painful for me to see division and

580
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,038
distrust

581
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,120
but

582
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,200
many people in politics and elsewhere

583
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,119
have called for anthony fauci to be

584
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,798
fired

585
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,119
when there's such calls of distrust in

586
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:36,158
public about a leader like anthony fauci

587
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:40,319
who should garner trust do you think

588
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:44,480
he should be fired absolutely not

589
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,359
to do so would be basically to give

590
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,200
the

591
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,798
opportunity

592
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,159
for those who want to make up stories

593
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,359
about anybody

594
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,679
to destroy them there is nothing

595
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:59,839
in the ways in which tony fauci has been

596
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,759
targeted that it's based upon truth

597
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,678
how could we then

598
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,879
accept those cries

599
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,798
for his firing as having legitimacy

600
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,120
it's a circular argument they've decided

601
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,960
they don't like tony so they make up

602
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,879
stuff and they twist

603
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,240
comments that he's made about things

604
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
like gain a function where he's

605
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,359
referring to the very specific gain of

606
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,279
function that's covered by this policy

607
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,319
and they're trying to say he lied to the

608
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,798
congress that's simply not true they

609
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,200
don't like the fact that tony changes

610
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:34,000
the medical recommendations about what

611
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,440
to do with covet 19 over the space of

612
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
more than a year

613
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
and they call that flip-flopping and you

614
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,159
can't trust the guy because he says one

615
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,558
thing last year and one thing this year

616
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,880
well the science has changed

617
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,720
delta variant has changed everything you

618
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
don't want him to be saying the same

619
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,919
thing he did a year ago that would be

620
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,000
wrong now it was the best we could do

621
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,640
then people don't understand that or

622
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,079
else they don't want to understand that

623
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,200
so when you basically whip up a largely

624
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:03,279
political argument against a scientist

625
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,919
and hammer at it over and over again to

626
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,918
the point where he now has to have 24 7

627
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,480
security to protect him against people

628
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,559
who really want to do violence to him

629
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,679
for that to be a reason to say that then

630
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:20,000
he should be fired is to hand the evil

631
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,000
forces the victory i will not do that

632
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,159
yet there's something difficult i'm

633
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,880
going to try to express to you

634
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,600
so

635
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,520
it may be your guitar playing

636
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,918
uh it may be something else

637
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:36,480
but there's a humility to you it may be

638
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,200
because you're a man of god there's a

639
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,038
humility to you

640
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,919
that

641
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:43,919
garners trust

642
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,839
and

643
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,919
when you're in a leadership position

644
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:53,678
representing science especially in

645
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:57,038
catastrophic events like the pandemic

646
00:23:53,679 --> 00:24:01,120
it feels like as a leader you have to go

647
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:03,278
far above and beyond your usual duties

648
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,678
and i think there's no question that

649
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,798
anthony falci has delivered on his

650
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,600
duties

651
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,440
but it feels like he needs to go above

652
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,199
as a science communicator and if there's

653
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,880
a large number of people

654
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,880
that are that are distrusting him

655
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:23,278
it's also his responsibility to garner

656
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:25,199
their trust to gain their trust

657
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:28,159
as a as a person who's the face of

658
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,600
science do you are you torn on this the

659
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,000
responsibility

660
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,599
of anthology of yourself to represent

661
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,159
science

662
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,839
not just the communication of advising

663
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,440
what should be done

664
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,759
but

665
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,960
giving people hope giving people trust

666
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,278
in science

667
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,240
and alleviating division

668
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:48,319
do you think that's also a

669
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,480
responsibility of a leader or is that

670
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,240
unfair to ask

671
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,159
i think the best way you give people

672
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,159
trust is to tell them the truth

673
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,240
and so they recognize that when you're

674
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,640
sharing information it's the best you've

675
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,798
got at that point and tony fauci does

676
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,880
that at every moment

677
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,240
i don't think him expressing more

678
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,919
humility

679
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,919
would change the fact that they're

680
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,120
looking for a target of somebody to

681
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,679
blame

682
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,798
to basically distract people from the

683
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,840
failings of their own political party

684
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,759
maybe i'm less targeted not because of a

685
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,720
difference in oh the way in which i

686
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,278
convey the information i'm less visible

687
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,079
if tony were out of the scene and i was

688
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,159
placed in that role i'd probably be

689
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,399
seeing a ratcheting up of that same

690
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,400
targeting

691
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,000
i would like to believe

692
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,080
that if

693
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,759
tony fauci said

694
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,399
that when i originally made

695
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,400
recommendations not to wear masks

696
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,880
that was given on the on our best

697
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,320
available data and now we know that is a

698
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,559
mistake

699
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,319
so admit with humility that there's an

700
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:56,720
error that's not

701
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,119
that's not actually correct

702
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,079
but that's a that's a statement of

703
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:04,239
humility and i would like to believe

704
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,918
despite the attacks

705
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,880
he would win a lot of people over with

706
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,960
that

707
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,760
so a lot of people as you're saying

708
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,480
would use that see that here we go

709
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:16,000
here's that dr anthony fauci making

710
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,440
mistakes how can we trust him at

711
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,720
anything i believe if he was

712
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:26,080
the sp that public display of humility

713
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,919
to say that i made an error

714
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:31,199
that would win a lot of people over

715
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,600
that's my that's kind of

716
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,840
my sense to face the fire of the attacks

717
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,079
from politics you have like politicians

718
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,158
will attack no matter what but the

719
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,759
question is the people

720
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,080
would you to win over the people that

721
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,480
the biggest concern i've had

722
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:49,439
is that there was this

723
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,798
distrust of science that's been brewing

724
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,480
and i'm

725
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,639
maybe you can correct me but i'm a

726
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,880
little bit unwilling to fully blame the

727
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,600
politicians because politicians play

728
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,120
their games no matter what

729
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,639
it just feels like this was an

730
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,558
opportunity

731
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,360
to inspire people with the power of

732
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,720
science the development of the vaccines

733
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,639
no matter what you think of those

734
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,000
vaccines is one of the greatest

735
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,679
accomplishments in the history of

736
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,720
science indeed

737
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,960
and

738
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,600
the fact that that's not inspiring

739
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,360
listen i host a podcast whenever i say

740
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,319
positive stuff about the vaccine i get

741
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,599
to hear

742
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:28,079
a lot of different opinions i bet you do

743
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,240
the fact that i do is a big problem to

744
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,199
me because it's an incredible

745
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,480
incredible accomplishment of science

746
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,519
and so i

747
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,798
yeah i i i'm sorry but i have to put

748
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,480
responsibility on the leaders

749
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,000
even if it's not their mistakes that's

750
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,919
what the leadership is that's what

751
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,240
leadership is you take responsibility

752
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,360
for the situation i wonder if there's

753
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,640
something that could have been done

754
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,240
better

755
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,320
to

756
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,640
give people hope

757
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,759
that science will save us as opposed to

758
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,759
science will divide us

759
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,440
i think you have more confidence

760
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,558
in the ability to get beyond our current

761
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,919
divisions uh than i do after seeing just

762
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:14,720
how deep and dark they have become

763
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,440
tony fauci has said multiple times the

764
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,200
recommendation about not wearing masks

765
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,200
was for two reasons

766
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,960
a shortage of masks which were needed in

767
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,440
hospitals and

768
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,038
a lack of realization early in the

769
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,558
course of the epidemic

770
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:33,759
that this was a virus that could heavily

771
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:36,798
infect asymptomatic people

772
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,798
as that changed he changed now did he

773
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,038
make an error no he was making a

774
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,720
judgment based on the data available at

775
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,119
the time but he certainly made that

776
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,200
clear over and over again

777
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,199
it has not stopped uh those who would

778
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,120
like to demonize him from saying well he

779
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,038
just flip-flopped

780
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,398
he you can't trust a guy he says one

781
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:59,200
thing today and one thing tomorrow

782
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:01,519
well masks is a tricky one so it is a

783
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,679
tricky one early on i'm a co-author and

784
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:06,558
a paper one of one of many but this was

785
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,919
a survey paper overlooking the

786
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,519
the evidence

787
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,559
uh it's a summary of the evidence we

788
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,798
have for the effectiveness of masks it

789
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,038
seems that

790
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,759
it's difficult to do rigorous scientific

791
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,200
study on masks it is difficult

792
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,278
there's a lot of philosophical and

793
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,759
ethical questions i want to ask you but

794
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,240
within this

795
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,480
it's back to your words and anthony

796
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,919
fauci's words

797
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,599
when you're dealing with so much

798
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,480
uncertainty

799
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,240
and so much potential uncertainty about

800
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,480
how catastrophic this virus is in the

801
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,359
early days

802
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,679
and

803
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,000
knowing that each word you say may

804
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,840
create panic

805
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,079
how do you communicate science with the

806
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,079
world

807
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,440
it's a philosophical it's an ethical

808
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,918
it's a practical question

809
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,200
there was a discussion about masks a

810
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,880
century ago

811
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,880
and that too led to panic

812
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,719
so

813
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,039
i mean i'm trying to put myself in the

814
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,720
mind in your mind in the mind of anthony

815
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,038
fauci in those early days knowing that

816
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,880
there's limited supply masks

817
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:17,359
like what do you say

818
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,760
do you fully convey the uncertainty of

819
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:22,639
the situation of the

820
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:26,480
of the challenges of the supply chain

821
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,600
or do you say that masks don't work

822
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,399
that's a complicated calculation

823
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:35,278
how do you make that calculation

824
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,359
it is a complicated calculation

825
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,960
as a scientist your

826
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,918
temptation would be

827
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,440
to give a full brain dump of all the

828
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,038
details

829
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,558
of the information about what's known

830
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,558
and what isn't known what experiments

831
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,000
need to be done

832
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,398
most of the time that's not going to

833
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,558
play well in a sound bite on the evening

834
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,319
news so you have to kind of distill it

835
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,839
down to a recommendation that is the

836
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,519
best you can do

837
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,119
at that time with the information you've

838
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,278
got

839
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,359
so you're a man of god

840
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,119
and we'll return to that to talk about

841
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:09,359
some

842
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,678
some also unanswerable philosophical

843
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,038
questions but first let's linger on the

844
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,679
vaccine

845
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,960
because in the in the religious in the

846
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,880
christian community there was some

847
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,519
hesitancy with the vaccine

848
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,360
still is still is

849
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,558
there's a lot of data showing high

850
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,678
efficacy and safety of vaccines of covid

851
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,398
vaccines

852
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,798
but still they are far from perfect as

853
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,319
all vaccines are can you empathize with

854
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,038
people who are hesitant to take the

855
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,759
covet vaccine or to have their children

856
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,440
take the covet vaccine i can totally

857
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,359
empathize

858
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,278
especially when people are barraged by

859
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:48,240
conflicting information coming at them

860
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,919
from all kinds of directions

861
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,640
i've spent a lot of my time in the last

862
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,278
year trying to figure out how to do a

863
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,759
better job of listening

864
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,558
because i think we have all

865
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:03,200
got the risk of assuming we know the

866
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:05,440
basis for somebody's hesitancy

867
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,519
and that often

868
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,640
doesn't turn out to be what you thought

869
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,480
and the variety of reasons is quite

870
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,080
broad

871
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,599
i think a big concern is just this sense

872
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,558
of uncertainty about whether this was

873
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,439
done too fast and that corners were cut

874
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,398
and

875
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,038
there are good answers to that

876
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:29,599
along with that a sense that maybe this

877
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:32,240
vaccine will have long-term effects that

878
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,639
we won't know about for years to come

879
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,319
and one can say that hasn't been seen

880
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,840
with other vaccines and there's no

881
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,678
particular reason to think this one's

882
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,439
going to be different than the dozens of

883
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,759
others that we have experience with but

884
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,919
you can't absolutely say no there's no

885
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,599
chance of that

886
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,480
so it does

887
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,918
come down to listening and then trying

888
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,038
in a

889
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,360
fashion that doesn't convey a message

890
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,798
that you're smarter than the person

891
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:00,798
you're talking to because that isn't

892
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,720
going to help

893
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,879
to really address what the substance is

894
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,600
of the concerns

895
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,240
but my heart goes out to so many people

896
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:12,879
who are fearful about this because of

897
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,798
all the information that has been dumped

898
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,720
on them

899
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,319
some of it by politicians a lot of it by

900
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,839
the internet

901
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,960
some of it by

902
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:26,000
parts of the media that seem to

903
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,440
take pleasure in stirring up uh this

904
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,359
kind of fear

905
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,200
for their own reasons

906
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,879
and that is shameful

907
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,278
i'm really sympathetic

908
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,480
with the people who are confused and

909
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,480
fearful

910
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,839
i am not sympathetic with people who are

911
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,519
distributing information that's

912
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:43,359
demonstrably false

913
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,278
and continue to do so

914
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,719
they're taking lives

915
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:51,759
i didn't realize how strong that

916
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,120
sector of disinformation

917
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,558
it would be

918
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,879
and it's been

919
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:59,359
in many ways more effective uh than the

920
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,679
means of spreading the truth

921
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,759
this is going to take us into another

922
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,120
place but alex if there's something i'm

923
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:08,639
really worried about in this country and

924
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,918
it's not just this country but it's the

925
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,399
one i live in

926
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,239
is that we have another epidemic besides

927
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,118
covet 19

928
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,838
and it's an epidemic of the loss

929
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,760
of the anchor of

930
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:22,878
truth that truth as a means of making

931
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,240
decisions

932
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:28,559
uh truth is a means of figuring out

933
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,559
how to wrestle with a question like

934
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,000
should i get this vaccine for myself or

935
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:35,279
my children

936
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,719
seems to have lost its primacy

937
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,320
and instead it's an opinion of somebody

938
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,480
who

939
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,280
expressed it very strongly

940
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,519
or

941
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,839
some facebook post that i read

942
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:51,119
two hours

943
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:53,759
ago and for those to become substitutes

944
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,879
for objective truth

945
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,200
not just

946
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,719
of course for vaccines but for many

947
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,399
other issues like

948
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:04,799
was the 2020 election actually fair

949
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,599
this worries me deeply

950
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,599
it's bad enough to have polarization

951
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,760
and divisions

952
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,720
but to have no way of resolving those by

953
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,720
actually saying okay what's true here

954
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,598
makes me very worried about the path

955
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,838
we're on and i'm usually an optimist

956
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,720
well to give you an optimistic angle on

957
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:24,400
this

958
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,919
i actually think

959
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,639
that

960
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,599
this sense that there's no one place for

961
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,879
truth

962
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,200
it's just a thing that will inspire

963
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,200
leaders and science communicators to

964
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,439
speak not from a place of authority but

965
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,679
from a place of humility i think it's

966
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,200
just challenging people to communicate

967
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,759
in a new way

968
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:47,838
to be listeners first

969
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
i think the problem isn't that there's a

970
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,239
lot of misinformation

971
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,520
i think that

972
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,358
um

973
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:59,199
people

974
00:35:55,358 --> 00:36:02,880
the the internet and and the world

975
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:04,719
are distrustful of people who

976
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,200
who speak as if they possess the truth

977
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:10,159
with an authoritarian kind of

978
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:12,399
tone yeah which was i think defining for

979
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,078
what science was in the 20th century

980
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,599
i just think it has to sound different

981
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,960
in the 21st

982
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:22,079
with uh it's a in the battle of ideas i

983
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,119
think humility and love wins

984
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,359
and

985
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,400
that's how science wins not through

986
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:31,358
having quote unquote truth because now

987
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,000
everybody can just say i have the truth

988
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,679
um i think you have to speak like i said

989
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,079
from humility not authority and so it

990
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:39,039
just challenges our leaders to uh go

991
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,160
back

992
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,239
and

993
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,239
learn to be part of my french less

994
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:48,159
and uh

995
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:50,239
more kind and like you said to listen to

996
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,078
listen to the experiences of people

997
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,519
that are good people not not the ones

998
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,760
who are trying to manipulate the system

999
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,400
and play a game and so on but real you

1000
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,599
know real people who are just afraid of

1001
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,200
uncertainty of hurting those they loved

1002
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,119
and so on so i think it's just an

1003
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,960
opportunity for leaders to go back and

1004
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:12,079
take a class on effective communication

1005
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,000
i'm with you on the shifting uh more

1006
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,519
from where we are to humility and love

1007
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,320
that's got to be the right answer that's

1008
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,239
very biblical by the way

1009
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,480
we'll get there

1010
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:24,479
i i have to bring up uh joe rogan i

1011
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,039
don't know if you know who he is i do

1012
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,800
he's a podcaster comedian fighting

1013
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:31,759
commentator and

1014
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,240
my now friend and iver mekton uh

1015
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,640
believer too yes that is the question i

1016
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,159
have to ask you about

1017
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,598
uh he has gotten some flack in the

1018
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:42,239
mainstream media for not getting

1019
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,039
vaccinated and when he got coveted

1020
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:46,719
recently taking ivermectin as part of a

1021
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,838
cocktail of treatments

1022
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:51,519
the nih actually has a nice page on

1023
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:53,599
ivermectin saying quote there's

1024
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,039
insufficient evidence to recommend

1025
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,280
either for

1026
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,279
or against the use of ivermectin for the

1027
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,599
treatment of covin19

1028
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,359
results from adequately powered

1029
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,280
well-designed and well-conducted

1030
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,679
clinical trials are needed to provide

1031
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,000
more specific evidence-based guidance on

1032
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,239
the role of ivermecton in the treatment

1033
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,400
of covenant 19.

1034
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,959
so let me ask why do you think there has

1035
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,200
been so much attack on joe rogan and

1036
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,199
anyone else that's talking about

1037
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:24,639
ivermectin when there's insufficient

1038
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,480
evidence for or against

1039
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,319
well let's unpack that

1040
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,838
first of all i think the concerns about

1041
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,838
joe are not limited to his taking

1042
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:35,920
ivermectin that much more seriously his

1043
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,199
being fairly publicly negative about

1044
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,838
vaccines

1045
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:43,118
at a time where people are dying

1046
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:44,239
700 000 people have died from covet 19

1047
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,320
estimates

1048
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:48,559
by kaiser or at least a hundred thousand

1049
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,320
of those were unnecessary deaths of

1050
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,039
unvaccinated people

1051
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,720
and for joe to promote that further even

1052
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:58,159
as this uh

1053
00:38:54,719 --> 00:39:00,559
pandemic rages through our population

1054
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:02,559
is simply irresponsible

1055
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,039
so yeah the ivermectin is just one other

1056
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:08,159
twist obviously ivermectin has been

1057
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,920
controversial for months and months

1058
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,920
the reason that it got particular

1059
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,760
attention is because of the way in which

1060
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,559
it seemed to have captured the

1061
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,400
imagination of a lot of people and to

1062
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,880
the point where they were taking doses

1063
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,559
that were intended for livestock

1064
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,119
and some of them got pretty sick as a

1065
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:28,400
result from overdosing on this stuff

1066
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:32,079
that was not good judgment

1067
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,160
the drug itself remains uncertain

1068
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,880
uh there's a recent review that looks at

1069
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,039
all of the studies of ivormectin and

1070
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,480
basically concludes that it probably

1071
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,480
doesn't work

1072
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,960
we are running a study right now i

1073
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,358
looked at that data this morning

1074
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,119
in a trial called active six which is

1075
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,239
one of the ones that my public-private

1076
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,400
partnership

1077
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,919
is running we're up to about 400

1078
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,760
patients who've been randomized to

1079
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,599
ivermectin or placebo

1080
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,760
and should know

1081
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,079
perhaps as soon as a month from now in a

1082
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,800
very carefully controlled trial did it

1083
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,079
help or did it not so there will be an

1084
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,240
answer

1085
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,079
coming back to joe

1086
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,759
again i don't think the fact that he

1087
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,560
took divermectin and hoping it might

1088
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,960
work

1089
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:18,159
uh is that big a knock against him it's

1090
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,079
more the conveying of we don't trust

1091
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,440
what science says which is vaccines are

1092
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,200
going to save your life we're going to

1093
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,280
trust what's on the internet that says

1094
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:26,799
ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine really

1095
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,640
do work even though the scientific

1096
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,119
community says probably not so let me

1097
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:33,679
push back in that a little bit

1098
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,358
so he doesn't he doesn't say let's not

1099
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,440
listen to science

1100
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:39,519
he doesn't say the vaccine don't get

1101
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,318
vaccinated

1102
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:45,199
he says it's okay

1103
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:47,199
to ask questions i'm okay with that how

1104
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,799
risky is the vaccine for certain

1105
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,000
populations

1106
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,760
what are the

1107
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,318
benefits and risks

1108
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,119
there's other friends of joe

1109
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,599
and

1110
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,760
friends of mine like sam harris who says

1111
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,680
if you look at the data

1112
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,040
it's obvious that the benefits outweigh

1113
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,719
the risks

1114
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,559
and what joe says

1115
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:09,679
is yes but let's

1116
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:12,078
still openly talk about risks and he

1117
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,679
often brings up anecdotal evidence of

1118
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,560
people who've had

1119
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,759
uh highly negative effects from

1120
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,440
vaccines

1121
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,200
science is not done with anecdotal

1122
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,358
evidence

1123
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,279
and so you could infer a lot of stuff

1124
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,639
from the way he expresses it but he also

1125
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,880
communicates a lot of interesting

1126
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,480
questions

1127
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,480
and that's something maybe you can

1128
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,079

1129
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,599
you know there's certain groups that are

1130
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,318
healthy

1131
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,880
they have uh they're younger they have

1132
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,639
they exercise a lot they get the all you

1133
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,519
know nutrition and all those kinds of

1134
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,118
things

1135
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,039
he shows

1136
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,760
skepticism on whether

1137
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,039
it's

1138
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,440
so obvious that they should get

1139
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,838
vaccinated and the same is

1140
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,000
he makes this he kind of presents the

1141
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,119
same kind of skepticism for

1142
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,838
kids

1143
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,720
for young kids so

1144
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:03,039
with

1145
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,919
empathy

1146
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:04,880
and

1147
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,358
uh

1148
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,920
you know listening my russian ineloquent

1149
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:12,318
description of what joe believes what

1150
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,680
what is your kind of response to that

1151
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:15,679
why should

1152
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,000
certain categories of healthy and young

1153
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,838
people still get vaccinated do you think

1154
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,159
well first just to say it's great for

1155
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:24,078
joe to be a skeptic to ask questions we

1156
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,078
should all be doing that but then the

1157
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,920
next step is to go and see what the data

1158
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,440
says and see if they're actually answers

1159
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,000
to those questions

1160
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,920
so coming to healthy people

1161
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,960
i've done a bunch of podcasts besides

1162
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,599
this one

1163
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:42,000
the one i think i remember most

1164
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:44,480
was a podcast with a worldwide wrestling

1165
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,358
superstar very nice he's about six foot

1166
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,000
six

1167
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:50,239
and just absolutely solid muscle

1168
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,159
and he got coveted

1169
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,639
and he almost died

1170
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,118
and recovering from that he said i've

1171
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,440
gotta let my

1172
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,519
supporters know because you can imagine

1173
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,119
worldwide wrestling fans are probably

1174
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:06,800
not big

1175
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:10,400
embracers of the need for vaccines

1176
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:13,200
and he want he just turned himself into

1177
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,079
a spokesperson for the fact that this

1178
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:18,318
virus doesn't care how healthy you are

1179
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,680
how much you exercise what a great

1180
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:23,759
specimen you are it wiped him out

1181
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,239
and we see that

1182
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,920
you know the average person in the icu

1183
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:31,199
right now with covet 19 is under age 50.

1184
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,639
i think there's a lot of people still

1185
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,000
thinking oh it's just those old people

1186
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:36,159
in the nursing homes it's not going to

1187
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,838
be about me they're wrong

1188
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,759
and they're plenty of instances of

1189
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:41,358
people who were totally healthy with no

1190
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,680
underlying diseases

1191
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:46,159
taking good care of themselves not obese

1192
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,239
exercising who have died from this

1193
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:52,559
disease

1194
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:54,959
700 children have died from this disease

1195
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,838
yes some of them had underlying factors

1196
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,519
like obesity but a lot of them did not

1197
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,559
so it's fair to say

1198
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:06,480
younger people are less susceptible to

1199
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:09,358
serious illness kids even less so than

1200
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,159
young adults but it ain't zero

1201
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,920
and if the vaccine is really safe and

1202
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,480
really effective

1203
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,880
then you probably want everybody to take

1204
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,719
advantage of that even though some are

1205
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,000
dropping their risks more than others

1206
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:26,159
everybody's dropping their risks some

1207
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,239
are you worried about variants so

1208
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,799
looking out into the future are you

1209
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,639
what's your vision for

1210
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,599
all the possible trajectories that this

1211
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,838
virus takes in human society i'm totally

1212
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,280
worried about the variance

1213
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,920
delta was

1214
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,000
such an impressive arrival on the scene

1215
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,440
in all the wrong ways i mean it took

1216
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,920
over

1217
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,960
the world yeah in the space of just a

1218
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,440
couple months because of its extremely

1219
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,960
contagious ability viruses would be

1220
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,280
beautiful if they weren't terrifying

1221
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,838
yeah exactly i mean this whole story of

1222
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,319
viral evolution scientifically is just

1223
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:04,318
amazingly elegant anybody who really

1224
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:05,679
wanted to understand how evolution works

1225
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:07,759
in real time

1226
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:09,440
study sars cov2

1227
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,000
because it's not just delta it's alpha

1228
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,318
and it's beta and it's gamma and it's

1229
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,400
the fact that these sweep through

1230
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:17,679
uh the world's population

1231
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,440
by

1232
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:22,879
fairly minor differences in fitness

1233
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,358
so the real question many people are

1234
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,920
wrestling is is delta it is it is it

1235
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:30,078
such a fit virus that nothing else will

1236
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,559
be able to displace it

1237
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,560
i don't know i mean there's now delta

1238
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,199
ay4

1239
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,719
which is a variant of delta that at

1240
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,639
least in the uk

1241
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,799
seems to be taking over

1242
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,358
the delta population as though it's

1243
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,440
maybe even a little more contagious that

1244
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:49,920
might be the first hint that we're

1245
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,159
seeing something new here it's not a

1246
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,280
completely different virus it's still

1247
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:57,039
delta but it's delta plus

1248
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,400
you know the big worry

1249
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,838
lex is

1250
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:06,240
what's out there that is so different

1251
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:06,239
that the vaccine protection doesn't work

1252
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,440
and we don't know how different it needs

1253
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,199
to be for the vaccine to stop working

1254
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,760
that's the that's the terrifying thing

1255
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,439
about each of these variants

1256
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,440
it's like uh it's always a pleasant

1257
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,880
surprise the vaccine seems to have still

1258
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,960
have efficacy

1259
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,838
and hooray for our immune system may i

1260
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,159
say

1261
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:30,639
because the vaccine immunized you

1262
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,639
against that original wuhan virus

1263
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,599
now we can see

1264
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,920
that especially after two doses and even

1265
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,400
more so after a booster your immune

1266
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,519
system is so clever that it's also

1267
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,358
making a diversity of antibodies to

1268
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:47,280
cover some other things that might

1269
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,318
happen to that virus to make it a little

1270
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,160
different

1271
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:51,759
and you're still getting really good

1272
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,078
coverage

1273
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,200
even for beta which was

1274
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,160
south africa b1351 which is the most

1275
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:59,759
different

1276
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,838
it looks pretty good

1277
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,240
but that doesn't mean it will always be

1278
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:06,239
as good as that if something gets really

1279
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,559
far away from the original virus now the

1280
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,838
good news is we would know what to do in

1281
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,719
that situation the mrna vaccines allow

1282
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:15,679
you

1283
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,598
to redesign the vaccine like that

1284
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,598
and to quickly get it through a few

1285
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,440
thousand participants in a clinical

1286
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,359
trial to be sure it's raising antibodies

1287
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,119
and then bang you could go

1288
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,440
but i don't want to have to do that

1289
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,358
there will be people's lives at risk in

1290
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,639
the meantime and what's the best way to

1291
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:32,318
keep that from happening well don't

1292
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,519
quite try to cut down the number of

1293
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:35,119
infections

1294
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:37,358
because you don't get variance unless

1295
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:39,280
the virus is replicating in a person so

1296
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,679
how do we

1297
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,880
uh solve this thing how do we get out of

1298
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:47,358
this pandemic what's like if you had a

1299
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,400
like a wand or something or

1300
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:52,078
uh you could really implement policies

1301
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,160
what's the full cocktail of solutions

1302
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,920
here oh it's a full cocktail it's not

1303
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,000
just one thing

1304
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,920
in our own country here in the u.s it

1305
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
would be getting those 64 million

1306
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,920
reluctant people to actually go ahead

1307
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,599
and get vaccinated there's 64 million

1308
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,480
people who didn't get vaccinated adults

1309
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:11,519
yes not even counting the kids wow 64

1310
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,760
million wow and that astounding

1311
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,679
get the kids vaccinated hopefully their

1312
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,640
parents will see that as a good thing

1313
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:18,399
too

1314
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,239
uh get those of us who are due for

1315
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,599
boosters boosted because that's going to

1316
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:22,879
reduce our likelihood of having

1317
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,240
breakthrough infections and keep

1318
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,318
spreading it

1319
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,639
uh convince people that until we're

1320
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,639
really done with this and we're not now

1321
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:33,358
that social distancing and mask wearing

1322
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:35,920
indoors are still critical uh to cut

1323
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:38,719
down the number of new infections

1324
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,960
but of course that's our country

1325
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:44,239
this is a worldwide pandemic

1326
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,679
i worry greatly about the fact that low

1327
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:48,078
and middle income countries have for the

1328
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:50,399
most part not even gotten started with

1329
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,960
access to vaccines and we have to figure

1330
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,200
out a way to speed that up

1331
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,079
because otherwise that's where the next

1332
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,838
variant will probably arrive

1333
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,760
and who knows how bad it will be and it

1334
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,480
will cross the world quickly as we've

1335
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,839
seen happen repeatedly in the last 22

1336
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,159
months

1337
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:09,679
i think i'm really surprised annoyed

1338
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,239
frustrated

1339
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:14,000
that testing

1340
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,239
rapid at home testing from the very

1341
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,960
beginning wasn't a big big part of the

1342
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:21,279
solution it seems first of all nobody's

1343
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,159
against it that's one huge plus for

1344
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,160
testing that it's everybody supports

1345
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:29,358
second of all like that's what america

1346
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,480
is good at is like mass manufacturer

1347
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:32,239
stuff like

1348
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,880
like stepping up engineers stepping up

1349
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,479
and really deploying it plus without the

1350
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,079
collection of data it's giving people

1351
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,000
freedom

1352
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,680
is giving them information and then

1353
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,440
freedom to decide what to do with that

1354
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,919
information it's such a powerful

1355
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,159
solution i don't understand well now i

1356
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,318
think the biden administration is

1357
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:52,558
i think emphasized like the scaling of

1358
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,400
testing manufacturers so but i just feel

1359
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,359
like it's an obvious solution get a test

1360
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,280
that

1361
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,199
costs less than a dollar manufacturer

1362
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,960
costs less than a dollar to buy

1363
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,399
and just everybody gets tested every

1364
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,920
single day

1365
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,599
don't share that data with anyone you

1366
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,000
just make the decisions and i believe in

1367
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,760
the intelligence of people to make the

1368
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,480
right decision to stay at home when the

1369
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,880
test is positive i am so completely with

1370
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,318
you on that and nih has been smack in

1371
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,680
the middle of trying to make that dream

1372
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,239
come true

1373
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:24,558
we're running a trial right now

1374
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:27,199
in georgia indiana hawaii

1375
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,800
uh and where's the other one

1376
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,039
oh kentucky

1377
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,000
basically blanketing a community with

1378
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,159
free

1379
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,639
i'm testing that's beautiful and look to

1380
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,960
see what happens as far as stemming the

1381
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:40,719
the spread of the epidemic and measuring

1382
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,720
it by waste water because you can really

1383
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,799
tell whether you've cut back the amount

1384
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,439
of infection in the community

1385
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,480
yeah you i'm so with you we got off to

1386
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,079
such a bad start with testing

1387
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,159
and of course all the testing was being

1388
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,760
done for the first several months in big

1389
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:57,920
box laboratories

1390
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,440
where you had to send the sample off and

1391
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,039
put it through the mail somehow and get

1392
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,559
the result back sometimes five days

1393
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,880
later after you've already infected a

1394
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,720
dozen people it was just a completely

1395
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,800
wrong model but it's what we had and

1396
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:11,039
everybody was like oh we got to stick

1397
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,720
with pcr because if you start using

1398
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:14,719
those home tests that are based on

1399
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:15,919
antigens lateral flow

1400
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,799
probably there's going to be false

1401
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,358
positives and false negatives okay sure

1402
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,519
no test is perfect but

1403
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,480
having a test that's not acceptable or

1404
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,480
accessible is the worst setting so we

1405
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,079
nih with some

1406
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,800
requests from congress got a billion

1407
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:36,559
dollars uh to create this program called

1408
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,240
rapid acceleration of diagnostics rad x

1409
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,240
and we turned into a venture capital

1410
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:42,159
organization and we invited every small

1411
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,318
business or academic lab that had a cool

1412
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,399
idea about how to do home testing to

1413
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:48,159
bring it forward and we threw them into

1414
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,639
what we called our shark tank

1415
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,679
of business experts engineers technology

1416
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:56,639
people people understood uh how to deal

1417
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:59,118
with supply chains and manufacturing

1418
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,838
and right now today uh there are about

1419
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,838
two million tests being done based on

1420
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:06,159
what came out of that program including

1421
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,558
most of the home tests that you can now

1422
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,480
buy on the pharmacy shelves we did that

1423
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,519
and i wish we had done it faster but it

1424
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,960
was an amazingly speedy effort

1425
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,119
and you're right companies are really

1426
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,720
good once they've gotten fda emergency

1427
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,079
use authorization and we helped a lot of

1428
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,719
them get that

1429
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,280
they can scale up their manufacturing

1430
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:27,519
i think in december we should have about

1431
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,079
410

1432
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,759
million tests for that month ready to go

1433
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,880
and if we can get one or two more

1434
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,599
platforms

1435
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,920
approved and by the way we are now

1436
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:38,880
helping fda by being their validation

1437
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,240
lab

1438
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,920
if we can get a couple more of these

1439
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,598
approved we could be in the half a

1440
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,920
billion tests

1441
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,640
a month which is really getting where we

1442
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,159
need to be wow yeah that's a dream

1443
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:52,639
that's a dream for me it seems like an

1444
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,799
obvious solution engineering solution

1445
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:57,118
everybody's behind it it leads to hope

1446
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,359
versus division i love it

1447
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,680
okay

1448
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:04,159
a happy story a happy story i was

1449
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:06,719
waiting for one yeah all right well one

1450
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:09,199
last dive into the not happy but you

1451
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:10,879
won't even have to comment on it uh well

1452
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:11,919
comment on the broader philosophical

1453
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:16,400
question so

1454
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:18,559
nih again i said uh joe rogan as the

1455
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,480
first one who pointed me to this

1456
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,720
nih was recently accused of funding

1457
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,559
research of a paper that had images of

1458
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,239
sedated puppies with their heads

1459
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,519
inserted into small enclosures

1460
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:30,318
containing disease carrying sand flies

1461
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,719
so

1462
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,838
i could just say that this this story is

1463
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:34,639
not

1464
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,039
true

1465
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:39,039
or at least the

1466
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:41,679
i think it is true that the paper that

1467
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:43,519
showed those images cited

1468
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:45,838
nih is a funding source but that

1469
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,880
citation is not correct

1470
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,199
yeah

1471
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,000
uh but that brings up a

1472
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:52,879
bigger philosophical question what that

1473
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,519
it

1474
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,680
could have been correct how difficult is

1475
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,519
it as a director of nih or just an

1476
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,318
ancient organization that's funding so

1477
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,880
many

1478
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:06,239
amazing deep research studies

1479
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:09,920
to ensure the ethical fortitude of those

1480
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:12,078
studies when the ethics of science is

1481
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,559
there's such a gray area between what is

1482
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,359
and what isn't ethical

1483
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,760
well tough issues um certainly animal

1484
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,838
research is a tough issue

1485
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,599
i was going to bring up it's a good

1486
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:27,440
example of that tough issue is in 2015

1487
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,599
you announced that nih would no longer

1488
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,760
support any biomedical research involved

1489
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,800
involving chimpanzees

1490
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,640
so that's like one example of

1491
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,039
looking in the mirror

1492
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:41,199
thinking deeply about what isn't isn't

1493
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:43,119
ethical and there was a conclusion that

1494
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:44,879
biomedical research on

1495
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,880
chimps is not ethical

1496
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,720
that was the conclusion that was based

1497
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,000
on a lot of deep thinking and a lot of

1498
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,919
input from

1499
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,079
people who have considered this issue

1500
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,880
and a panel of the national academy of

1501
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,960
sciences that was asked to review

1502
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,838
the issue i mean the question

1503
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,639
that i wanted them to look at was are we

1504
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:06,798
actually learning anything that's really

1505
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:08,879
essential from chimpanzee invasive

1506
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:11,920
research at this point

1507
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,838
or is it time to say that these closest

1508
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,599
relatives of ours

1509
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,519
should not be subjected to that any

1510
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,960
further and ought to be retired to a

1511
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,559
sanctuary

1512
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,000
and that was the conclusion that there

1513
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,798
was really no

1514
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,119
kind of medical experimentation that

1515
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:29,519
needed to be done on chimps in order to

1516
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,838
proceed so why are we still doing this

1517
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:33,679
many of these were chimpanzees that were

1518
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:34,639
purchased because we thought they would

1519
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:36,078
be

1520
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,400
good uh

1521
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,599
hosts for hiv aids and they sort of

1522
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,599
weren't

1523
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,920
and they were kept around in these

1524
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,000
primate laboratories with people coming

1525
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,400
up with other things to do but they

1526
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,559
weren't compelling scientifically so i

1527
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,400
think that was the right decision i took

1528
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,920
a lot of flack from some of the

1529
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,559
scientific community said well you're

1530
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,159
caving in to the animal rights people

1531
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,440
and now that you've said no more

1532
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:03,118
research on chimps what's next

1533
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,318
certainly when it comes to companion

1534
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,880
animals

1535
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:07,920
um everybody's heart

1536
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,720
starts

1537
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:14,000
to be hurting when you see anything done

1538
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:16,879
that seems harmful to a dog or a cat i

1539
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,880
have a cat i don't have a dog and i i

1540
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,160
understand that completely that's why we

1541
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,760
have these oversight groups that decide

1542
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:26,239
before you do any of that kind of

1543
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,160
research is it justified

1544
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:30,399
and what kind of

1545
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:32,239
provision is going to be made to avoid

1546
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,519
pain and suffering

1547
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:35,598
and those are

1548
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,838
those have input from the public as well

1549
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,079
as the scientific community

1550
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:42,880
is that completely saying that every

1551
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,839
step that's happening there is

1552
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,838
ethical by some

1553
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,839
standard that would be hard for anybody

1554
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:52,239
to agree to no but at least it's a

1555
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:54,318
consensus of what people think is

1556
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:56,639
acceptable

1557
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:59,920
dogs are the only host

1558
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:02,318
for some diseases like leishmaniasis

1559
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,079
which was that paper that we were not

1560
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:06,400
responsible for but i know why they were

1561
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,839
doing the experiment or like lymphatic

1562
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,680
filariasis

1563
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,599
which is an experiment that we are

1564
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:14,159
supporting in georgia

1565
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,000
that involves dogs getting infected with

1566
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:17,679
a parasite because that's the only model

1567
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,760
we have to know whether a treatment is

1568
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:21,838
going to work or not

1569
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,319
so i will defend that

1570
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:27,039
i am not in the place of those who think

1571
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:28,239
all animal research is evil

1572
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,519
because i think if there's something

1573
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:31,519
that's going to be done

1574
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,838
to save a child from a terrible disease

1575
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:36,079
or an adult and it involves animal

1576
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,159
research that's been carefully reviewed

1577
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,160
then i think ethically why it doesn't

1578
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:42,159
make me comfortable it still seems like

1579
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:45,039
it's the right choice

1580
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:47,199
i think to say all animal research

1581
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:49,039
should be taken off the table

1582
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:51,439
is also very unethical because that

1583
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,639
means you have basically doomed a lot of

1584
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,079
people

1585
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:57,838
for whom that research might have saved

1586
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:59,920
their lives to having no more hope

1587
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:02,159
and uh to me personally there's far

1588
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,000
greater concerns ethically in terms of

1589
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,078
uh factory farming for example the

1590
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,318
treatment of animals in other contexts

1591
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,960
oh there's so much that goes on outside

1592
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,318
of medical research that is much more

1593
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,280
troubling

1594
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:17,440
that said i think all cats have to go

1595
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,798
that's just my off the record opinion

1596
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,639
that's why i'm not involved with any

1597
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:22,480
ethical decisions i'm just joking

1598
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:24,798
internet i think i love cats you're a

1599
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,400
dog i'm a dog person i'm sorry

1600
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,239
have you seen the new yorker cartoon

1601
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,838
where there are two dogs in the bar

1602
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:31,439
having a martini

1603
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:33,199
and one is saying they're dressed up in

1604
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,000
their business suits and one says to the

1605
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:34,879
other

1606
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,679
you know

1607
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:40,240
it's not enough for the dogs to win the

1608
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:41,759
cats have to lose

1609
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:42,639
ah that's beautiful

1610
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,599
uh

1611
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:45,598
so

1612
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,920
uh a few weeks ago you've announced that

1613
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,039
you're resigning from the nih at the end

1614
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,880
of the year

1615
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,480
i'm stepping down

1616
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,079
i'm still going to be at nih in a

1617
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,039
different capacity different capacity

1618
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,318
right

1619
00:58:55,039 --> 00:59:00,239
and it's over a decade of an incredible

1620
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:02,079
career overseeing the nih as its

1621
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:03,919
director

1622
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,920
what are the things you're most proud of

1623
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,079
of the nih in your

1624
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,519
time here as this director may be

1625
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,000
memorable

1626
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:12,000
moments

1627
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,559
ah there's a lot

1628
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,798
in 12 years

1629
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:22,160
science has just progressed in amazing

1630
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:24,960
ways over those 12 years

1631
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:26,960
uh think about where we are right now

1632
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,720
something like gene editing being able

1633
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,880
to make changes

1634
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:33,919
in dna even for therapeutic purposes

1635
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:36,400
which is now curing sickle cell disease

1636
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,920
unthinkable when i became director in

1637
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,358
2009

1638
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,280
the ability to study single cells

1639
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:44,400
and ask them what they're doing and get

1640
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,119
an answer

1641
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:50,000
single cell biology just has emerged in

1642
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:52,880
this incredibly powerful way

1643
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,639
uh having the courage

1644
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,960
to be able to say we could actually

1645
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:59,199
understand the human brain

1646
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,440
seemed like so far out there and we're

1647
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:04,000
in the process of doing that with the

1648
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,599
brain initiative

1649
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,798
taking all that we've learned about the

1650
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:11,039
genome and applying it to cancer

1651
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:13,039
to make individual cancer treatment

1652
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,880
really precision

1653
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:17,199
and developing cancer immunotherapy

1654
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:20,480
which seemed like sort of a backwater

1655
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:22,000
into some of the hottest science around

1656
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,679
all those things sort of

1657
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,838
erupting and much more to come i'm sure

1658
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:28,480
we're on an exponential curve

1659
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:30,159
of medical research advances and that's

1660
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,039
glorious to watch

1661
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:33,838
and of course covet 19 as a beneficiary

1662
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,000
of

1663
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:39,119
decades of basic science understanding

1664
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,280
what mrna is understanding basics about

1665
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,599
coronaviruses and spike proteins and how

1666
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,440
to combine structural biology and

1667
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,359
immunology and genomics into this

1668
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,280
package that allows you to make a

1669
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:51,519
vaccine in 11 months

1670
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,559
just i would never have imagined that

1671
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:57,039
possible in 2009 so to have been able to

1672
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,960
kind of be the midwife helping all of

1673
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:02,079
those things get birthed

1674
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,318
that's been just an amazing 12 years

1675
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,559
and as nih director you have

1676
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:08,079
this convening power

1677
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,160
and this ability to look across the

1678
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,559
whole landscape of biomedical research

1679
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:13,679
and identify areas that are just like

1680
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,599
ready

1681
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,440
for something big to happen

1682
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,440
but isn't going to happen spontaneously

1683
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,039
without some encouragement without

1684
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,639
pulling people together from different

1685
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:24,239
disciplines who don't know each other

1686
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:25,759
and maybe don't know how to quite

1687
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:27,838
understand each other's scientific

1688
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,720
language and create an environment for

1689
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:32,719
that to happen that has been just

1690
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:35,118
an amazing experience i mean i mentioned

1691
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:36,639
the brain initiative is one of those

1692
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,880
the brain initiative right now i think

1693
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:40,078
there's about 600 investigators working

1694
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,640
on this

1695
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:45,039
uh last week the whole issue of nature

1696
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:47,039
magazine was about the output of the

1697
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:50,159
brain initiative basically now giving us

1698
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:52,239
a cell census of what those cells in the

1699
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:53,759
brain are doing which has just never

1700
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:57,679
been imaginable

1701
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,200
and interestingly most uh more than half

1702
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:01,679
of the investigators in the brain

1703
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:03,598
initiative are engineers

1704
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,838
they're not biologists in a traditional

1705
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,640
sense i love that maybe partly because

1706
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:10,960
my phd is in quantum mechanics so i

1707
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:13,038
think it's really a good idea to bring

1708
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,000
disciplines together and see what

1709
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,319
happens

1710
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,838
that's an exciting thing and i

1711
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:19,599
will not

1712
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:21,920
ever forget having the chance to

1713
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,920
announce that program

1714
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,880
in the east room of that white house

1715
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,358
with president obama who totally got it

1716
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,798
and totally loved science and working

1717
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:32,719
with him

1718
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:34,559
in some of those rare moments of sort of

1719
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:36,798
one-on-one conversation in the oval

1720
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,440
office just him and me about science

1721
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:41,838
that's a gift what's it like talking to

1722
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,679
uh barack obama about science he seems

1723
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,599
to be a sponge

1724
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,440
i've heard him i'm an artificial

1725
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,440
intelligence person and i've heard him

1726
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,280
talk about ai

1727
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,880
and it was like it made me think is

1728
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,319
somebody like whispering in his ear or

1729
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,559
something because he was saying stuff

1730
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,400
that totally passed the bs test like he

1731
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:00,319
really understands stuff

1732
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,798
he does that means he listened to a

1733
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:04,480
bunch of experts on ai he was like

1734
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,639
explaining the difference between narrow

1735
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,400
artificial intelligence and strong ai

1736
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,558
like he was he was saying all this both

1737
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,639
technical and philosophical stuff and it

1738
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,720
just made me i don't know it made me

1739
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,400
hopeful about

1740
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:18,639
the depth of understanding that a human

1741
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,559
being a political office can attain that

1742
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,078
gave me hope as well and having those

1743
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,400
experiences

1744
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:27,039
oftentimes in a group i mean another

1745
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,318
example was trying to figure out how do

1746
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,280
we take what we've learned about the

1747
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:33,358
genome and really apply it at scale

1748
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,359
to figure out how to prevent illness not

1749
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:37,358
just treat it but prevent it

1750
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:40,400
out of which came this program called

1751
01:03:37,358 --> 01:03:43,199
all of us this million strong

1752
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,639
american cohort of participants who make

1753
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:46,239
their electronic health records and

1754
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:47,838
their genome sequences and everything

1755
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,479
else available for researchers to look

1756
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:50,400
at

1757
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,760
that came out of a couple of

1758
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,079
conversations with obama and others

1759
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,480
in his office and

1760
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:00,798
he asked the best questions

1761
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,559
that was what struck me so much i mean a

1762
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:04,318
room full of scientists

1763
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,640
and we'd be talking about the possible

1764
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:08,960
approaches and he would come up with

1765
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:10,400
this incredibly insightful penetrating

1766
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,679
question not that he knew what the

1767
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,639
answer was going to be but he knew what

1768
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:18,159
the right question was i think the core

1769
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:19,759
to that is curiosity yeah it's i don't

1770
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:23,679
think he's even like he's trying to be a

1771
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,640
good leader he's legit curious yes

1772
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:26,399
legit

1773
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:28,239
that he almost like a kid in a candy

1774
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,318
store gets to talk to the world experts

1775
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:32,318
he got he somehow sneaked into this

1776
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,079
office and gets to get to talk to the

1777
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:36,159
world experts and it's

1778
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,839
that that's the kind of energy that uh i

1779
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:39,118
think leads to uh

1780
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:41,119
yeah to beautiful leadership in the

1781
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,960
space of science indeed

1782
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,880
another thing i've been able to do as

1783
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,559
director is to try to break down some of

1784
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,079
the boundaries that seem to be

1785
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,160
traditional between the public and the

1786
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,079
private sectors when it comes to areas

1787
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,558
of science that really could and should

1788
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,079
be open access anyway why don't we work

1789
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:58,960
together

1790
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:02,079
and that was obvious early on and after

1791
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:05,039
identifying a few possible

1792
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:07,280
collaborators who were chief scientists

1793
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,960
of pharmaceutical companies

1794
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,960
it looks like we might be able to do

1795
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,798
something in that space out of that was

1796
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,920
born something called the accelerating

1797
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:18,159
medicines partnership amp

1798
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,400
and it took a couple of years of

1799
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:22,159
convening people who usually didn't talk

1800
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,960
to each other and there was a lot of

1801
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:25,920
suspicion academic scientists saying oh

1802
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,599
those

1803
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,838
scientists and pharma they're not that

1804
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,318
smart they're just trying to make money

1805
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:34,480
and the academic scientists getting the

1806
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:35,838
wrap from the pharmaceutical scientists

1807
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,039
all they want to do is publish papers

1808
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:39,519
they don't really care about helping

1809
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,000
anybody and we found out both of those

1810
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:43,519
stereotypes were wrong

1811
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,559
and over the course of that couple of

1812
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:48,559
years built a momentum behind three

1813
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:51,039
starting projects one on alzheimer's one

1814
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:53,119
on diabetes one on rheumatoid arthritis

1815
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:55,920
and lupus very different each one of

1816
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:58,400
them trying to identify what is an area

1817
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,480
that we both really need to see advance

1818
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,680
and we could do better together and it's

1819
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,000
going to have to be open access

1820
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,838
otherwise nih is not going to play and

1821
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,440
guess what industry if you really want

1822
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:09,679
to do this you got to have skin in the

1823
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,599
game we'll cover half the cost you got

1824
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:14,318
to cover the other half i love it

1825
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,640
enforcing open access so

1826
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,798
resulting in open science millions of

1827
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:21,038
dollars gone into this and it has been a

1828
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,480
wild success after many people were

1829
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:25,039
skeptical

1830
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:27,199
um a couple years later we had another

1831
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:30,319
project called parkinson's uh more

1832
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:33,118
recently we added one on schizophrenia

1833
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:36,719
uh just this week we added one on gene

1834
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:38,640
therapy on bespoke gene therapy for

1835
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:40,078
ultra rare diseases which otherwise

1836
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,239
aren't going to have enough commercial

1837
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,079
appeal but if we did this together

1838
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:45,358
especially with fda at the table and

1839
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,200
they have been

1840
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:49,679
we could make something happen turn this

1841
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:51,118
into a sort of standardized approach

1842
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:52,318
where everything didn't have to be a

1843
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,640
one-off

1844
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:56,798
i'm really excited about that so what

1845
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,798
began as three projects is six and it's

1846
01:06:56,798 --> 01:07:00,480
about to be seven next year with a heart

1847
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:02,000
failure project

1848
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,440
and all of us have gotten to know each

1849
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,358
other

1850
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,358
and if it weren't for that background

1851
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:08,719
when covid came along it would have been

1852
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:10,880
a lot harder

1853
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:12,879
to build the partnership called active

1854
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,240
which has been my passion for

1855
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:18,000
the last 20 months accelerating covet 19

1856
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:19,919
therapeutic interventions and vaccines

1857
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
we just had our leadership team

1858
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,079
meeting this morning it was amazing

1859
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,159
what's been accomplished that's a

1860
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,079
pretty much a hundred people who dropped

1861
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:29,838
everything just to work on this about

1862
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,079
half from industry in half from

1863
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:34,480
government and academia

1864
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,400
and that's how we got vaccine master

1865
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,000
protocols designed

1866
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,838
so we all agreed about what the

1867
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,760
endpoints had to be and

1868
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:43,358
you wondered why are there 30 000

1869
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,520
participants in each of these trials

1870
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:47,759
that's because of actives

1871
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:50,960
group mapping out what the power needed

1872
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,039
to be for this to be convincing

1873
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,838
same with therapeutics

1874
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:58,400
we have run at least 20 therapeutic

1875
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:00,719
agents uh through trials that active

1876
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,480
supported in record time

1877
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:04,719
that's how we got monoclonal antibodies

1878
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,358
that we know work

1879
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:08,959
um that's been

1880
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:11,598
that would not have been possible if i

1881
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,760
didn't already have a sense of how to

1882
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,280
work with the private sector that came

1883
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,359
out of amp

1884
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,600
amp took two years to get started active

1885
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,759
took two weeks

1886
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,279
we just kept the lawyers 100 people over

1887
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,600
yeah kept the lawyers out of the room

1888
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,600
and uh

1889
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:30,238
um

1890
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:33,278
now you're gonna get yourself in trouble

1891
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:35,039
so that i i do hope one day the story of

1892
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,560
this incredible vaccine development of

1893
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:38,640
vaccine protocols and trials and all

1894
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,039
this kind of details the messy beautiful

1895
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,520
details of the science and engineering

1896
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:45,119
and and uh that led to the manufacturing

1897
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,839
the deployment and the scientific test

1898
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:48,880
it's such a nice dance between

1899
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:50,798
engineering and the space of

1900
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,960
manufacturing the vaccines you know you

1901
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:55,039
start before the studies are complete

1902
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,960
you start making the vaccines

1903
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:59,439
just in case the if the studies prove to

1904
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,520
be positive then you can start deploying

1905
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,278
them just like so many

1906
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,120
uh parties

1907
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,279
like you said private and public playing

1908
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:08,960
together that's just a beautiful dance

1909
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,040
that uh

1910
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,960
is one of the is one of for me the

1911
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,679
sources of hope in this very

1912
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,880
uh tricky time where there's a lot of

1913
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,440
uh

1914
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,560
things to be cynical about in terms of

1915
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,238
um

1916
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,920
the games politicians play and the

1917
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:26,559
hardship experience of the economy and

1918
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,079
all those kinds of things but to me this

1919
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,960
dance

1920
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:33,039
was of vaccine development was done just

1921
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,600
beautifully and it gives me hope

1922
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:38,319
it does me as well and it was in many

1923
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,079
ways the finest hour that science has

1924
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:43,120
had in a long time

1925
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:46,238
being called upon when every day counted

1926
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:47,759
and making sure that time was not wasted

1927
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:51,198
and things were done

1928
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:53,600
rigorously but quickly

1929
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:56,079
so you're incredibly good as the leader

1930
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,840
of the nih it seems like you're having a

1931
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:00,640
heck of a lot of fun

1932
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,560
why uh why step down from this role

1933
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,280
after so much fun

1934
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,560
well no other nih director

1935
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:08,800
has served

1936
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,880
more than one uh president after being

1937
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,800
appointed by one you're sort of done and

1938
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,640
the idea of being carried over

1939
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,480
for a second presidency with trump and

1940
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:20,400
now a third one with biden is unheard of

1941
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:23,599
i just think lex that scientific

1942
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:26,399
organizations benefit from new vision

1943
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,320
and 12 years is a really long time to

1944
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:30,079
have the same leader

1945
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:33,119
and if i wasn't going to stick it out

1946
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:35,679
for the entire biden four-year term

1947
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:36,640
it's good not to wait too late during

1948
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:38,640
that

1949
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,920
to signal an intent to step down because

1950
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,400
the president's got to find the right

1951
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:45,199
person got to nominate them got to get

1952
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:47,920
the senate to confirm them which is a

1953
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:49,919
unpredictable process right now and you

1954
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,158
don't want to try to do that in

1955
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,920
the second half of somebody's term as

1956
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:56,158
president this has got to happen now so

1957
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,960
i kind of decided back at the end of may

1958
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:02,479
that this should be my final year

1959
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:06,000
and i'm okay with that i do have some

1960
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:07,519
mixed emotions because i love the nih i

1961
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,439
love the job

1962
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,640
it's exhausting

1963
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:12,799
i'm

1964
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,640
traditionally for the last 20 months

1965
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:17,440
anyway working 100 hours a week it's

1966
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,719
just that's what it takes to juggle all

1967
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,799
of this

1968
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:23,039
and um that keeps me from having a lot

1969
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,560
of time for anything else

1970
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:26,238
and i wouldn't mind because i don't

1971
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,080
think i'm done yet i wouldn't mind

1972
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:29,919
having some time

1973
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:31,920
to really think about what the next

1974
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,600
chapter should be and i have none of

1975
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,359
that time right now

1976
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,039
do i have another calling is there

1977
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,719
something else i could contribute that's

1978
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:42,560
different than this

1979
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:42,560
i'd like to find that out

1980
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,800
i think the right answer is you're just

1981
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,329
uh stepping down to focus on your music

1982
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,880
career

1983
01:11:47,329 --> 01:11:51,439
[Laughter]

1984
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:54,319
but that that might not be a good plan

1985
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:56,000
for anything very sustainable uh but i i

1986
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:58,479
think that is a sign of a great leader

1987
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:02,079
as george washington did stepping down

1988
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:04,479
at the at the right time ted williams

1989
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:06,960
yes he quit when i think he hit a home

1990
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:09,359
run on his last at-bat and his average

1991
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,359
was 400 at the time

1992
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:13,599
no one to walk away i mean it's hard but

1993
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:16,719
it's beautiful to see in a leader

1994
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,400
uh you also oversaw the human genome

1995
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:21,039
project you mean you mentioned the brain

1996
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:24,319
initiative which has

1997
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:27,039
you know it's a it's a dream to map

1998
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:29,198
the human brain and there's the dream to

1999
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:31,279
map the the human code which is the

2000
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:33,119
human genome project and you have said

2001
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:35,599
that it is humbling for me and awe

2002
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:38,960
inspiring to realize that we have caught

2003
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,760
the first glimpse of our own instruction

2004
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,719
book

2005
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:45,039
previously known only to god

2006
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:47,760
how does that if you can just kind of

2007
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:49,679
wax poetic for a second

2008
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,039
how does it make you feel that we were

2009
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,520
able to

2010
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:54,800
map this instruction book look into our

2011
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,120
own code

2012
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,719
and be able to uh reverse engineer it

2013
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:03,439
it's breathtaking

2014
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:05,920
it's so fundamental

2015
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:08,479
and yet for all of human history we're

2016
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,079
ignorant of the details

2017
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:11,119
of what that instruction book looked

2018
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,359
like

2019
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:16,000
and then we crossed the bridge

2020
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:17,920
into the territory of the known

2021
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,238
and we had that in front of us still

2022
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,079
written in the language that we had to

2023
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:23,759
learn how to read and we're in the

2024
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,479
process of doing that and will be for

2025
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,520
decades to come but we owned it we had

2026
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,319
it

2027
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:32,640
and it has such profound consequences

2028
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:35,279
it's it's both a book about

2029
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:38,320
our history

2030
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:40,479
um it's a book of sort of the parts list

2031
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:42,799
of a human being the genes that are in

2032
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:45,359
there and how they're regulated

2033
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,360
and it's also a medical textbook

2034
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,198
that can teach us things

2035
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:50,799
that will provide answers to illnesses

2036
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:53,119
we don't understand

2037
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,320
and alleviate suffering and premature

2038
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:55,679
death so

2039
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:56,960
it's a pretty amazing thing to

2040
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,880
contemplate

2041
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,279
and it has utterly transformed the way

2042
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,119
we do science and it is in the process

2043
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:05,439
of transforming

2044
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:08,000
the way we do medicine although much of

2045
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,839
that still lies ahead

2046
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,960
you know while we were working on the

2047
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:15,440
genome project it was sort of hard

2048
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:18,719
to get this sense of

2049
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:20,479
a wellness because it was just hard work

2050
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,640
and you were getting you know another

2051
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:24,799
megabase okay this is good

2052
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,840
but when did you actually step back and

2053
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,760
say we did it

2054
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,679
it's the profoundness of that i mean

2055
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:34,000
there were two points i guess

2056
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:36,158
one was the announcement on that june 26

2057
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,520
2000 where the whole world heard

2058
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:39,198
well we don't quite have it but we got a

2059
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,520
pretty good draft

2060
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:45,119
and suddenly people are like realizing

2061
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:47,199
oh this is this is a big deal

2062
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,439
for me it was more when we got the full

2063
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:51,839
analysis of it published it in february

2064
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:54,079
2001 in that issue of nature

2065
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,079
paper that eric lander and bob waterston

2066
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,519
and i were the main authors and we

2067
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:59,679
toiled over

2068
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,840
and tried to get as much insight as we

2069
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:03,920
could in there about what the meaning of

2070
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,679
all this was

2071
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,800
but you also had this sense that we are

2072
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:11,520
such beginning readers here we are still

2073
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:14,560
in kindergarten trying to make sense out

2074
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:16,239
of this three billion letter book

2075
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,120
and we're going to be at this for

2076
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:21,119
generations to come

2077
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:22,319
you are a man of faith

2078
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:25,039
christian

2079
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:27,359
and you are a man of science

2080
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:30,399
what is the role of religion

2081
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:33,198
and of science and society and

2082
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:35,759
in the individual human mind and heart

2083
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:35,759
like yours

2084
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:40,960
well i was not a person of faith when i

2085
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:42,158
was growing up i became a believer in my

2086
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,600
20s

2087
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:45,920
influenced

2088
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,360
as a medical student by

2089
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,119
a recognition that i hadn't really

2090
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:50,238
thought through the issues

2091
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:52,479
of

2092
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:53,519
what's the meaning of life why are we

2093
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:55,198
all here

2094
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,719
what happens when you die

2095
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:58,879
is there a god

2096
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:00,158
science is not so helpful in answering

2097
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:02,560
those questions

2098
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:04,559
so i had to look around in other places

2099
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,880
and ultimately

2100
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,640
came to my own conclusion that atheism

2101
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:11,359
which is where i had been

2102
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,960
was the least supportable of the choices

2103
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:14,639
because it was the assertion of a

2104
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,600
universal negative

2105
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,440
which scientists aren't supposed to do

2106
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,320
and agnosticism

2107
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:23,839
came as an attractive option but felt a

2108
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,238
little bit like a cop-out so i had to

2109
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:29,279
keep going trying to figure out why do

2110
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:31,279
believers actually believe this stuff

2111
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:33,840
and came to realize it was all pretty

2112
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:35,519
compelling that there's no proof i can't

2113
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,360
prove to you or anybody else that god

2114
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,520
exists but i can say it's pretty darn

2115
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:41,198
plausible

2116
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,760
and ultimately

2117
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:46,158
what kind of god is it uh caused me to

2118
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,920
search through various religions and see

2119
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:49,599
well what a what do people think about

2120
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,600
that

2121
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,880
and to my surprise encountered the

2122
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:57,280
person of jesus christ as unique in

2123
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,960
every possible way and

2124
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,679
answering a lot of the questions i

2125
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,319
couldn't otherwise answer

2126
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:06,560
and somewhat kicking and screaming

2127
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,319
i became a christian

2128
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:09,520
even though at the time

2129
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:11,119
as a

2130
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,199
medical student already interested in

2131
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:15,119
genetics people predicted my head would

2132
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:16,399
then explode because these were

2133
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:17,920
incompatible

2134
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,479
world views

2135
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:22,880
they really have not been for me

2136
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:24,799
i am so fortunate i think that in a

2137
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,039
given day

2138
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:30,320
wrestling with an issue

2139
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:32,158
it can have both the rigorous scientific

2140
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:35,439
component and it can have the spiritual

2141
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:38,079
component covet 19 is a great example

2142
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:40,158
these vaccines are both an amazing

2143
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:42,479
scientific achievement and an answer to

2144
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:44,000
prayer

2145
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:46,158
when i'm wrestling with vaccine

2146
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,679
hesitancy and trying to figure out what

2147
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:50,000
answers to come up with i get so

2148
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:51,520
frustrated sometimes and i'm

2149
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,158
comforted

2150
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:56,000
by reassurances that god is aware of

2151
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:58,399
that this is i don't have to do this

2152
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,399
alone

2153
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:01,519
so

2154
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,279
i know there are people like your friend

2155
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,520
sam harris

2156
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:06,800
who feel differently sam wrote a rather

2157
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,120
famous

2158
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,679
op-ed in the new york times

2159
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:12,640
when i was nominated as the nih director

2160
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,640
saying

2161
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,920
this is a terrible mistake

2162
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,760
you can't no you can't ham

2163
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,840
you can't have somebody who believes in

2164
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,679
god running the nih he's just going to

2165
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,520
completely ruin the place

2166
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:28,399
well i have

2167
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:31,120
a testimonial christopher hitchens a

2168
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:32,879
devout atheist if i could say so oh yeah

2169
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:35,279
was a friend of yours and referred to

2170
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:37,679
you as quote one of the greatest living

2171
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:39,679
americans and stated that you were one

2172
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,560
of the most devout believers he has ever

2173
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,079
met

2174
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,000
he further stated that you were

2175
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:46,238
sequencing the genome of the cancer that

2176
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,920
would ultimately claim his life and that

2177
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:50,718
your friendship despite their differing

2178
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,239
opinions on religion was an example of

2179
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:55,279
the greatest

2180
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:56,879
armed truth in modern times

2181
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:58,800
what did you learn from christopher

2182
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,800
hitchens about life or perhaps what is

2183
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,199
the fond memory you have of this man

2184
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:06,079
with whom you've disagreed

2185
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:10,479
but who is also your friend

2186
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:12,238
yeah i loved hitch i'm sorry he's gone

2187
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,559
iron sharpens iron

2188
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:16,319
and there's nothing better uh for trying

2189
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,199
to figure out where you are with your

2190
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:19,279
own

2191
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:21,678
situation and your own opinions your own

2192
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:24,158
world views than encountering somebody

2193
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:26,560
who's completely in another space

2194
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:28,079
and who's got the gift as hitch did of

2195
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,320
challenging everything

2196
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:31,679
and uh doing so over a glass of scotch

2197
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:32,799
or two or three

2198
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,119
uh

2199
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,920
yeah we got off to a rough start uh

2200
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:40,079
where in an interaction we had at a

2201
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,440
rather uh highbrow dinner

2202
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,840
uh he was

2203
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:45,039
really deeply insulting of a question i

2204
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,039
was asking

2205
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:48,880
but you know i was like okay

2206
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:51,198
that's fine let's let's figure out how

2207
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,279
we could have a more civil conversation

2208
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:56,479
and then i really learned to greatly

2209
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:58,479
admire his intellect and to find the

2210
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:00,238
jousting with him

2211
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:01,599
and it wasn't all about faith although

2212
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:02,799
it often was

2213
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:06,239
was really

2214
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:08,800
inspiring and innovating energizing

2215
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,799
and then when he got cancer i became

2216
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,719
sort of his ally trying to help him find

2217
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:16,159
pathways through

2218
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:18,239
the various options and maybe helped him

2219
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:20,479
to stay around on this planet for an

2220
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:23,839
extra six months or so

2221
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:26,559
and i have the warmest feelings of being

2222
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,679
in his apartment uh downtown

2223
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,000
um

2224
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:32,560
over a glass of wine

2225
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,800
talking about whatever uh sometimes it

2226
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,400
was science he was fascinated by science

2227
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:39,679
sometimes it was

2228
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:40,638
thomas jefferson sometimes it was

2229
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,639
faith

2230
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:44,000
and i knew it would always be really

2231
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:47,199
interesting

2232
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,760
so he's now gone yeah

2233
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:51,439
do you think about your own mortality

2234
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,360
are you afraid of death

2235
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:55,279
i'm not afraid i'm not looking forward

2236
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:57,198
to it i don't want to rush it because i

2237
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:58,719
feel like i got some things i can still

2238
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:00,960
do here

2239
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:03,920
but as a person of faith

2240
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,520
i don't think i'm afraid i'm 71. i know

2241
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,800
i don't have an infinite amount of time

2242
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,440
left

2243
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:12,000
and i want to use the time i've got

2244
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:14,238
in some sort of way that matters

2245
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,840
i'm not ready to become a full-time

2246
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:17,519
golfer

2247
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,840
[Laughter]

2248
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,360
but i don't quite know what that is

2249
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,960
i do feel

2250
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:27,679
that i've had a chance to do amazingly

2251
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:31,439
powerful things as far as experiences

2252
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:34,399
and maybe god has something else in mind

2253
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:35,839
i wrote this book 16 years ago the

2254
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:37,439
language of god

2255
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:39,920
about science and faith trying to

2256
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:43,599
explain how from my perspective these

2257
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:46,079
are compatible these are in harmony

2258
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,520
they're complementary if you are careful

2259
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:49,279
about which kind of question you're

2260
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,360
asking

2261
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:53,039
and to my surprise a lot of people seem

2262
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:56,479
to be interested in that they were tired

2263
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:58,639
of hearing the extreme voices like

2264
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:59,678
dawkins at one end

2265
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:01,440
and

2266
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:03,279
people like ken ham and answers in

2267
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:05,519
genesis on the other end saying if you

2268
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:06,399
trust science you're going to hell

2269
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,840
and they

2270
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:09,679
thought there must be a way that these

2271
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,119
things could get along and that's what i

2272
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,840
tried to put forward and then i started

2273
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:15,279
a foundation biologos which then i had

2274
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,279
to step away from

2275
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:19,198
to become nih director which has just

2276
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:20,238
flourished maybe because i stepped away

2277
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:21,039
i don't know

2278
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:23,919
but

2279
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:25,600
it now has millions of people who come

2280
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,279
to that website and they run amazing

2281
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,520
meetings and i think a lot of people

2282
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:31,679
have really come to a sense that this is

2283
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,320
okay i can love science and i can love

2284
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:35,840
god and that's not a bad thing

2285
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:37,198
so maybe there's something more i can do

2286
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,119
in that space

2287
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:40,079
maybe that book is ready for a second

2288
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:41,279
edition

2289
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:43,600
i think so

2290
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,599
but when you look back

2291
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,920
life is finite

2292
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,440
what do you hope your legacy is

2293
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,679
hmm

2294
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:53,359
i don't know this whole legacy so it's a

2295
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:55,679
little bit hard to

2296
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:57,359
embrace it feels a little self-promoting

2297
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,520
doesn't it i sort of feel like in many

2298
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:01,039
ways i went to my own funeral

2299
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,480
on october 5th

2300
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:04,158
when i announced that i was stepping

2301
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:05,599
down and i got the most amazing

2302
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:07,599
responses

2303
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,920
from people some of whom i knew really

2304
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,920
well some of whom i didn't know at all

2305
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,239
who were just telling me stories

2306
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,119
about something that i had contributed

2307
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:17,039
to

2308
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:18,719
that made a difference to them and that

2309
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:20,560
was incredibly heartwarming and that's

2310
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:22,639
enough you know

2311
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,600
i don't want to build an edifice i don't

2312
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,440
have a plan for a monument or a statue

2313
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,600
god help us

2314
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:32,000
i do feel like i've been incredibly

2315
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,960
fortunate i've had the chance to play a

2316
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:38,158
role in things that were pretty profound

2317
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,359
from the genome project to nih to covet

2318
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:41,679
vaccines

2319
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:43,439
and i had to be plenty satisfied that

2320
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:46,000
i've had enough

2321
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:47,678
experiences here to feel pretty good

2322
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,479
about the way in which

2323
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:52,399
my life plan panned out

2324
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:54,158
we did a bunch of difficult questions in

2325
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:56,879
this conversation let me ask the most

2326
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:56,879
difficult one

2327
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,880
that perhaps

2328
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:02,279
is the reason you turn to god

2329
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,840
what is the meaning of life

2330
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:07,599
[Laughter]

2331
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,079
have you figured it out yet expect me to

2332
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,520
put that into three sentences

2333
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:12,079
we only have a couple of minutes at

2334
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,360
least hurry up

2335
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:16,960
[Laughter]

2336
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:18,799
well that's not a question i think

2337
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,800
science helps me with so you're going to

2338
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:23,360
push me into the face zone which is

2339
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,119
where i'd want to go with that

2340
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:28,479
i think welcome what is the meaning why

2341
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:30,639
are we here what are we put here to do

2342
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:34,079
i do believe we're here for just a blink

2343
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:35,840
of an eye and that our existence somehow

2344
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:38,079
goes on beyond that in a way that i

2345
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,600
don't entirely understand despite

2346
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:41,519
efforts to do so

2347
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,480
i think we are called upon

2348
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,719
in this

2349
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:47,439
blink of an eye to try to make the world

2350
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,880
a better place and to try to love people

2351
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:49,839
to try to

2352
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,440
do a

2353
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,719
better job

2354
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:55,759
of

2355
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:59,279
our more altruistic instincts

2356
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:01,199
and less of our selfish instincts

2357
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:03,039
to try to be

2358
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:05,039
what god calls us to be

2359
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:07,840
people who are

2360
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:09,039
holy not people who are

2361
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,159
driven by

2362
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:11,760
self

2363
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:13,359
indulgence

2364
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,199
and sometimes i'm better at that than

2365
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:16,559
others

2366
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:18,319
but i think that

2367
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,719
for me as a christian is it pretty clear

2368
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:23,519
i mean it's to live out

2369
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:27,439
the sermon on the mount

2370
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:31,120
once i read that i couldn't unread it

2371
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:33,039
all those beatitudes all the blesseds

2372
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:35,439
that's what we're supposed to do and the

2373
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:37,519
meaning of life is to strive for that

2374
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:38,559
standard recognizing you're going to

2375
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,560
fail

2376
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,239
over and over again and that god

2377
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,320
forgives you

2378
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:46,000
hopefully to put a little bit of love

2379
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:47,198
out there into the world that's what

2380
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,198
it's about

2381
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:53,519
francis um

2382
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:56,238

let me leave you with some words from

2397
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,520
isaac newton reflecting on his life and

2398
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:28,000
work

2399
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:30,239
i seem to have been only like a boy

2400
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,479
playing on the seashore and diverting

2401
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:34,959
myself and now and then finding a

2402
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:38,638
smoother pebble or a prettier shell than

2403
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:41,600
ordinary whilst the great ocean of truth

2404
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:43,440
lay all undiscovered before me

2405
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:47,239
thank you for listening and hope to see

2406
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:47,238
