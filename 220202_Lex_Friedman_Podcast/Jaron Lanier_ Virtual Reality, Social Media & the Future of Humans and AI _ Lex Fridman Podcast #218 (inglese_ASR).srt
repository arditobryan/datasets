00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:07,120
jaron lanier a computer scientist visual

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,160
artist philosopher writer futurist

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,719
musician and the founder of the field of

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,400
virtual reality to support this podcast

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:15,759
please check out our sponsors in the

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
description

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,600
as a side note you may know that jiren

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,480
is a staunch critic of social media

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,599
platforms him and i agree on many

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,000
aspects of this except perhaps i am more

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,480
optimistic about it being possible to

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,480
build better platforms and better

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,558
artificial intelligence systems that put

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,398
long-term interests and happiness of

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,640
human beings first

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
let me also say a general comment about

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,799
these conversations

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,960
i try to make sure i prepare well remove

20
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,599
my ego from the picture and focus on

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,280
making the other person shine as we try

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,679
to explore the most beautiful and

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,840
insightful ideas in their mind

24
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,519
this can be challenging when the ideas

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,039
that are close to my heart are being

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,039
criticized

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,840
in those cases i do offer a little

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,920
pushback but respectfully and then move

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,478
on trying to have the other person come

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,400
out looking wiser in the exchange

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,438
i think there's no such thing as winning

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
in conversations nor in life

33
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,839
my goal is to learn and to have fun

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,159
i ask that you don't see my approach to

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,040
these conversations as weakness it is

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,600
not

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,000
it is my attempt at showing respect and

38
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,280
love for the other person

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,920
that said i also often just do a bad job

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,320
of talking but you probably already knew

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,359
that so please give me a pass on that as

42
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,599
well

43
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,920
this is the lex friedman podcast and

44
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,438
here is my conversation with jaron

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
lanier

46
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:44,478
you're considered the founding father of

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,200
virtual reality

48
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:50,478
do you think we will one day spend most

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,320
or all of our lives in uh virtual

50
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:54,959
reality worlds

51
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,839
i have always found the very most

52
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,839
valuable moment in virtuality to be the

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,359
moment when you take off the headset and

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
your senses are refreshed and you

55
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,680
perceive physicality

56
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,599
uh afresh you know as if you were a

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,200
newborn baby but

58
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,560
with a little more experience so you can

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,359
really notice just how incredibly

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,080
strange and

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,840
delicate and peculiar and impossible the

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,640
real world is

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
um

64
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,199
so the magic is and perhaps forever will

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,680
be in the physical world

66
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,159
well that's my take on it that's just me

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,000
i mean i think i don't get to tell

68
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,400
everybody else how to think or how to

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,800
experience virtuality and at this point

70
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,239
there have been multiple generations of

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
younger people

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,680
who've

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840
come along and liberated me from having

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,879
to worry about these things

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,878
uh but i i should say also even in

76
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,239
what some well i called it mixed reality

77
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,959
back in the day and these days it's

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,159
called augmented reality uh but with

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,680
something like a hololens even then

80
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,840
like one of my favorite things is to

81
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,599
augment a forest not because i think the

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,878
forest needs augmentation but when you

83
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,119
look at

84
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,280
the augmentation next to a real tree the

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
real tree just pops out as being

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,560
astounding you know it's

87
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
it's

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,400
interactive it's changing slightly all

89
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,238
the time if you pay attention and it's

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,599
hard to pay attention to that but when

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,280
you compare it to virtual reality all of

92
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,839
a sudden you do

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,680
and even in practical applications uh my

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
my favorite

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,239
early application of virtuality which we

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,239
prototyped going back to the 80s when i

97
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,439
was working with dr joe rosen at

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,680
stanford med near near where we are now

99
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,639
we made the first surgical simulator

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,959
and

101
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,958
to go from

102
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,199
the fake anatomy of the simulation which

103
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,799
is incredibly valuable for many things

104
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,000
for designing procedures for training

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,599
for all kinds of things then to go to

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,318
the real person

107
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,560
boy it's really something like uh

108
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,318
surgeons really get woken up by that

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,080
transition it's very cool so i think the

110
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,399
transition is actually more valuable

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,400
than the simulation

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,200
that's fascinating i never

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,680
really thought about that it's almost

114
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,079
it's like traveling elsewhere in the

115
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,280
physical space can help you appreciate

116
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,680
how much you

117
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,479
value your home once you return

118
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,920
well that's how i take it i mean

119
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,439
once again people have different

120
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,358
attitudes towards it

121
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,839
all are welcome what do you think is the

122
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,478
difference between the virtual world and

123
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,159
the physical meat space world that

124
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,839
that you are still drawn for you

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
personally still drawn to the physical

126
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,439
world

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,280
like there clearly then is a distinction

128
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,759
is there some fundamental distinction or

129
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,519
is it the peculiarities of the current

130
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,080
set of technology

131
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,399
in terms of the kind of virtuality that

132
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,639
we have now

133
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,279
uh it's made of software and software is

134
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,240
terrible stuff yeah software

135
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,000
is always the slave of its own history

136
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,000
its own legacy

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,639
it's always um infinitely arbitrarily

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,478
messy and arbitrary working with it

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,360
brings out a certain kind of nerdy

140
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:06,560
personality in people or at least in me

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,759
which um i'm not that fond of and there

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,120
are all kinds of things about software i

143
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,240
don't like

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,519
and so that's different from the

145
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
physical world

146
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,000
it's not something we understand as you

147
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,758
just pointed out on the other hand you

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,918
know i'm a little mystified when people

149
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,360
ask me well do you think the universe is

150
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,399
a computer

151
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,240
and i have to say well i mean

152
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,560
what on earth could you possibly mean if

153
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
you say it isn't a computer if it isn't

154
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,959
a computer

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
it

156
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,239
wouldn't

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,918
follow principles consistently and it

158
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,478
wouldn't be intelligible because what

159
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,079
else is a computer ultimately you know i

160
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,680
mean and we have physics we have

161
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,758
technology you know so we can do

162
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,120
technology so we can program it so i

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,400
mean of course it's some kind of

164
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,918
computer but

165
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,478
i think trying to understand it as a

166
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,799
turing machine is probably

167
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,519
a foolish approach

168
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,240
right that's the question whether

169
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,519
it performs this computer we call the

170
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,160
universe performs the kind of

171
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,318
computation that can be modeled as a

172
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,280
universal touring machine or is it

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,280
something much more fancy

174
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,959
so fancy in fact that we it may be

175
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,559
beyond our cognitive capabilities to

176
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,799
understand

177
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,160
turing machines are kind of

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,560
um

179
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,680
i'd call them teases in a way

180
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,439
because like

181
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,360
if you have

182
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,038
an infinitely smart programmer with an

183
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,280
infinite amount of time an infinite

184
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,240
amount of memory and an infinite clock

185
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,559
speed

186
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,400
then they're universal but yeah that

187
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,120
cannot exist so they're not universal in

188
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,439
practice and they they actually are

189
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,199
in practice a very particular sort of

190
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,439
machine within

191
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,360
you know the constraints within

192
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,038
the conservation principles of any

193
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,080
reality that's

194
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,159
worth being in probably and so

195
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,279
so i i

196
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
uh

197
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,598
i think

198
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,479
the universality of a particular model

199
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,879
is probably a deceptive way to think

200
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,519
even though at some sort of limit of

201
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,120
course it's can it

202
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,399
something like that's got to be true at

203
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,918
some sort of

204
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,318
high enough limit but it's just not

205
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,318
accessible to us so what's the point

206
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,240
well to me the question of like whether

207
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,240
we're living inside a computer or a

208
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
simulation is interesting in the

209
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,960
following way

210
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:24,159
there's a technical question is here

211
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,839
how difficult is it to build

212
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,240
a machine

213
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:31,359
not that simulates the universe

214
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,439
but that makes it sufficiently realistic

215
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
that we wouldn't know the difference or

216
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,639
better yet

217
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,240
sufficiently realistic that we would

218
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
kind of know the difference but we would

219
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,879
prefer to stay in the virtual world

220
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,918
anyway

221
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,279
i want to give you a few different

222
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,279
answers i want to give you the one that

223
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,359
i think has the most practical

224
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,959
importance to human beings right now

225
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,840
which is that

226
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,680
there's a kind of an assertion sort of

227
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,918
built into the way the questions usually

228
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,038
ask that i think is false which which is

229
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:01,918
a suggestion that people have a fixed

230
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:04,560
level of ability to perceive reality in

231
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,959
in a given way and actually

232
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,199
people are always

233
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,439
learning evolving forming themselves

234
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,680
we're fluid too we're also

235
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,160
programmable self-programmable

236
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
changing adapting and so

237
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,879
uh

238
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,038
my favorite way to get at this is to

239
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,639
talk about the history of other media so

240
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,279
for instance there was a peer review

241
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,759
paper that showed that an early wire

242
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,439
recorder playing back an opera singer

243
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,680
behind a curtain was indistinguishable

244
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,278
from a real opera singer and so now of

245
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,879
course to us it would not only be

246
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,559
distinguishable but it would be very

247
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,479
blatant because the the recording would

248
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,918
be horrible but to the people at the

249
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,599
time without the experience of it it

250
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,480
seemed plausible

251
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,519
there was an early demonstration of

252
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,600
extremely crude video teleconferencing

253
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,039
between new york and dc

254
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,399
in the 30s i think so that people viewed

255
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,319
as being absolutely realistic and

256
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,360
indistinguishable which to us would be

257
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,879
horrible

258
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,240
uh and there are many other examples

259
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,000
another one one of my favorite ones is

260
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,159
in the civil war era

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,080
there were itinerant photographers who

262
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,559
collected photographs of people who just

263
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,480
looked kind of like a few archetypes

264
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,359
so you could buy a photo of somebody who

265
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,278
looked kind of like your loved one

266
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,278
to remind you of that person because

267
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,519
actually photographing them was

268
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,958
inconceivable and hiring a painter was

269
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,480
too expensive and you didn't have any

270
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,000
way for the painter to represent them

271
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,600
remotely anyway how would they even know

272
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,480
what they looked like

273
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,399
so these are all great examples of how

274
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,920
in the early days of different media we

275
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,159
perceived the media as being really

276
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:38,159
great but then we evolved through the

277
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,519
experience of the media this gets back

278
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,439
to what i was saying maybe the greatest

279
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,039
gift of photography is that we can see

280
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,399
the flaws in a photograph and appreciate

281
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,159
reality more

282
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,679
maybe the greatest gift of audio

283
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,000
recording is that we can distinguish

284
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,000
that opera thing on our singer now from

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,120
that recording of the opera singer on

286
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,399
the horrible wire recorder so so we're

287
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,200
we we shouldn't limit ourselves by some

288
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,039
assumption of stasis that's incorrect

289
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,480
so that's the first thing that's my

290
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,480
first answer which is i think the most

291
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,920
important one now of course somebody

292
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,839
might come back and say oh but you know

293
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,599
technology can go so far there must be

294
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,440
some point at which would surpass that's

295
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,879
a different question i i think that's

296
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
also an interesting question but i think

297
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,838
the answer i just gave you is actually

298
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,160
the more important answer to the more

299
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,760
important question that's profound yeah

300
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,838
but can you can you

301
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,639
the second question which you're now

302
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,040
making me realize is way different

303
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,439
is it possible to create worlds in which

304
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:33,759
people would want to stay

305
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,800
instead of the real world well

306
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:40,000
like um i unmask like large numbers of

307
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:42,399
numbers of people uh what i hope is you

308
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,559
know as i said before i hope that the

309
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,879
experience of virtual worlds helps

310
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,439
people appreciate

311
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,559
this this physical world we have and

312
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,120
feel

313
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,399
tender towards it and and uh

314
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
keep it from getting too [ __ ] up

315
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,559
that's my hope

316
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,399
um do you see all technology in that way

317
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,639
so basically technology

318
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,078
helps us appreciate

319
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,919
the more sort of

320
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,919
technology-free aspect of life

321
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,559
well

322
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,278
media technology

323
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,479
you know i mean i i you can stretch that

324
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,559
i mean you can

325
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,399
let me say i could definitely play

326
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,399
mcluhan and turn this into a general

327
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,639
theory it's totally doable the program

328
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,879
you just described is totally doable

329
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,159
um in fact i will psychically predict

330
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,799
that if you did the research you could

331
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,399
find 20 phd theses that do that already

332
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:31,838
yeah i don't i don't know but they might

333
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,720
exist but

334
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,000
i i don't know how much value there is

335
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,200
in pushing

336
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,639
a particular

337
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,800
idea that far

338
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,639
claiming that reality isn't a computer

339
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,799
in some sense seems incoherent to me

340
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,919
because we have we can program it we

341
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,759
have technology it has it seems to obey

342
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,039
physical laws what more do you want from

343
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,399
it to be a computer i mean it's a

344
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,919
computer of some kind we don't know

345
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,240
exactly what kind we might not know how

346
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,319
to think about it we're working on it

347
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,519
but uh sorry to interrupt but you're

348
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
absolutely right like that's my

349
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,039
fascination with the ai as well

350
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:07,200
is it uh helps in the case of ai

351
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,120
i see it as a set of techniques that

352
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,959
help us understand ourselves understand

353
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
us humans in the same way virtual

354
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,479
reality

355
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,039
and you're putting it brilliantly which

356
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,800
it's a it's a way to help us understand

357
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,519
reality

358
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,599
sure appreciate and open our eyes more

359
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,159
richly to reality

360
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,800
that's that's certainly how i see it and

361
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,199
i

362
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,199
i wish people who become incredibly

363
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,000
fascinated who go down the rabbit hole

364
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,399
of uh the different fascinations with

365
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,919
whether we're in a simulation or not or

366
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,320
you know that there's a whole world of

367
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,759
variations on that um

368
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,000
i wish they'd step back and think about

369
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,879
their own motivations and exactly what

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,278
they mean you know what and and i think

371
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,360
the danger with these things

372
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,799
is

373
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,720
um

374
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,120
so if you say is the universe some kind

375
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,040
of computer broadly it has to be because

376
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,360
it's not coherent to say that the uh

377
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,120
that it isn't on the other hand to say

378
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,039
that that means you know anything about

379
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,480
what kind of computer

380
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,919
that's something very different and the

381
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
same thing is true for the brain the

382
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,879
same thing is true for

383
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,399
anything where you might use

384
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,320
computational metaphors like we have to

385
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,600
have a bit of modesty about where we

386
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,600
stand and the problem i have with these

387
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,519
framings of computation as these

388
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,920
ultimate cosmic questions is that it has

389
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,879
a way of getting people to pretend they

390
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,799
know more than they do can you maybe um

391
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,320
this is a therapy session psychoanalyze

392
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,159
me for a second

393
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,639
i really like the elder scrolls series

394
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,879
it's a role-playing game

395
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:42,240
uh skyrim for example why do i enjoy

396
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,078
so deeply just walking around that world

397
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,959
and then there's people you could talk

398
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:46,159
to

399
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,799
and you can

400
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:51,519
just like it's an escape but you know my

401
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:54,240
my life is awesome i'm truly happy but i

402
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,320
also am happy with the with the music

403
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,198
that's playing and the and the mountains

404
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,920
and

405
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,799
uh carrying around a sword and just

406
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,039
that

407
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,039
i don't know what that is it's very

408
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,480
pleasant though to go there and i miss

409
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,078
it sometimes

410
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,680
i think it's

411
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,879
wonderful

412
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,359
to love

413
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,320
artistic creations it's wonderful to

414
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,959
love

415
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,760
contact with other people it's wonderful

416
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:24,319
to love play and ongoing evolving

417
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,519
meaning and patterns with other people i

418
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,680
think it's uh it's a good thing

419
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,919
you know

420
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:35,759
i'm not i'm not like anti-tech and i'm

421
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:38,078
certainly not anti digital tech i'm anti

422
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,198
as everybody knows by now i think the

423
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,120
you know

424
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,319
manipulative economy of social media is

425
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,278
making everybody nuts and all that so

426
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,519
i'm anti that stuff but the core of it

427
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,120
of course i worked for many many years

428
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,120
on trying to make that stuff happen

429
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,159
because i think it can be beautiful like

430
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,480
i

431
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,198
um i don't like why not

432
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,519
you know and and by the way

433
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,759
um there's a thing about humans which is

434
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,759
um

435
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,040
uh we're problematic any

436
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,078
any kind of social interaction with

437
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:14,559
other people is gonna have its problems

438
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:16,559
people are political and tricky and like

439
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,399
i love classical music but when you

440
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,919
actually go to a classical music thing

441
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,839
and it turns out oh actually this is

442
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,078
like a backroom power deal kind of place

443
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,680
and a big status ritual as well

444
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,759
and that's kind of

445
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,198
not as fun

446
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,879
that's part of the package and the thing

447
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,359
is it's always going to be there's

448
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,639
always going to be a mix of things

449
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,600
um

450
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,320
i i don't uh i don't think the search

451
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,560
for purity is going to get you anywhere

452
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,480
so i'm not worried about that i worry

453
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,319
about the the really bad cases where

454
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,320
we're becoming where we're making

455
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,000
ourselves crazy or cruel enough that we

456
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,000
might not survive and i think you know

457
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,480
the social media criticism

458
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,198
rises to that level but i'm glad you

459
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,120
enjoyed it i think it's great

460
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,198
and i like that you basically say that

461
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,839
every experience has both beauty and

462
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,758
darkness as in with classical music i

463
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,440
also play classical piano so i

464
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,600
appreciate it very much but it's

465
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,920
interesting i mean every and even the

466
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
darkness a man's search for meaning with

467
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,679
victor franco and uh

468
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,000
in concentration camps

469
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,078
even there there's opportunity to

470
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,799
discover beauty

471
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,958
now

472
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,319
and so it's

473
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,958
that's that's the interesting thing

474
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,959
about humans is the capacity to discover

475
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,239
uh beautiful in the darkest of moments

476
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,159
but there's always

477
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,879
the dark parts too well i mean it's

478
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,838
our situation is structurally difficult

479
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,919
we are

480
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,880
um

481
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:47,039
actually no it is it's true we perceive

482
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:48,078
socially we depend on each other for our

483
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,719
sense of

484
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,399
place and and perception of the world i

485
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,278
mean we're dependent on each other and

486
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,639
yet there's also a degree in which we're

487
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,078
inevitably

488
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,039
um

489
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:04,159
we never really let each other down uh

490
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:06,399
we are set up to be competitive as well

491
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,120
as supportive i mean it's a it's just

492
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,480
our fundamental situation is complicated

493
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,438
and challenging

494
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,279
and i wouldn't have it any other way

495
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,959
okay let's talk about one of the most

496
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,119
challenging things

497
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,798
one of the things i unfortunately am

498
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,000
very afraid of

499
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,359
being human

500
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,199
allegedly

501
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,399
you wrote an essay on death and

502
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,320
consciousness in which you write a note

503
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,000
certainly the fear of death has been one

504
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,119
of the greatest driving forces in the

505
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
history of thought and in the formation

506
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:40,399
of the character of civilization and yet

507
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,319
it is under acknowledged the great book

508
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,919
on the subject the denial of death by

509
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,918
ernest becker deserves a reconsideration

510
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,679
i'm russian so i have to ask you about

511
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,719
this what's the role of death and life

512
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,160
see

513
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,679
you would have enjoyed coming to our

514
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,640
house because uh

515
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,720
my wife is russian and we also have we

516
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,480
have a piano of such spectacular

517
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,480
qualities you wouldn't

518
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,120
you would have freaked out

519
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,839
but anyway we'll let all that go

520
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,639
so

521
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:13,439
the context in which i remember that

522
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,960
essay uh sort of this was from maybe the

523
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,038
90s or something and um

524
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,480
i used to publish in a journal called

525
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,200
the journal of consciousness studies

526
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,679
because i was i was interested in these

527
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,679
endless debates about consciousness and

528
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,559
science

529
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,600
which

530
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,480
certainly continued today

531
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,558
and

532
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,798
i was

533
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,480
interested in how

534
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,599
the fear of death

535
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,120
and the denial of death played into

536
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,719
different philosophical approaches to

537
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,038
consciousness

538
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,038
because

539
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:53,359
i uh i think on the one hand

540
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,359
uh

541
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,200
this sort of

542
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,440
sentimental

543
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,038
school of dualism meaning the feeling

544
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,200
that there's something apart from the

545
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,960
physical brain some kind of soul or

546
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,600
something else

547
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,360
is obviously motivated in a sense by a

548
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,599
hope that that whatever whatever that is

549
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,798
will survive death and continue and

550
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,798
that's a

551
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,279
very core aspect of a lot of the world

552
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,679
religions not all of them not not really

553
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,200
but you know uh most of them

554
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,360
um

555
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,240
the

556
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,000
thing i noticed is that the the opposite

557
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,079
of those which might be the sort of

558
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,279
hardcore no the brain's a computer and

559
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,599
that's it

560
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,798
in a sense

561
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,480
we're

562
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,079
motivated in the same way with a

563
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,519
remarkably similar chain of of uh of

564
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,159
arguments which is

565
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,440
no i the brain's a computer and i'm

566
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,279
going to figure it out in my lifetime

567
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
and upload it upload myself and i'll

568
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,519
live forever

569
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,319
that's interesting yeah that's that's

570
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,879
like the implied thought right yeah and

571
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,599
so it's kind of this in a funny way it's

572
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,280
it's the same thing

573
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,399
it's uh

574
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,158
um

575
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,400
it's peculiar

576
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,640
that you to notice that these people who

577
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,559
would appear to be opposites in

578
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,880
character and cultural references and uh

579
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,720
uh and in their ideas actually are

580
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,240
remarkably similar

581
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,440
and and to to to an incredible degree

582
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,079
this sort of hardcore uh

583
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,798
computationalist idea about uh the brain

584
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,639
has turned into medieval christianity

585
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,679
with together like there's a they're the

586
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
people who are afraid that if you have

587
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,960
the wrong thought you'll piss off the

588
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,400
super ais of the future who will come

589
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,798
back and zap you

590
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,640
and and all that stuff yeah it's like

591
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,960
it's really it's really turned into

592
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,759
medieval christianity all over again uh

593
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,640
this is so the ernest becker's idea that

594
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,240
death

595
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
the fear of death is the warm at the

596
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,960
core

597
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,840
which is like

598
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,960
that's the that's the core motivator of

599
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,480
everything we see humans have created

600
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,038
the question is if that fear of

601
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,200
mortality is somehow core it's like a

602
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,079
prerequisite

603
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,600
so

604
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,839
what you just you just moved across this

605
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,079
vast cultural chasm

606
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,079
uh that separates me from most of my

607
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,000
colleagues in a way and i can't answer

608
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,558
what you just said on the level without

609
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,200
this huge deconstruction yes should i do

610
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:23,519
it yes what's the chasm okay

611
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,279
let us travel across this vessel okay i

612
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,119
don't believe in ai i don't think

613
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,119
there's any ai there's just algorithms

614
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,038
we make them we control them now

615
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,719
they're tools they're not creatures now

616
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,640
this is something that rubs a lot of

617
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,600
people the wrong way

618
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,240
and don't i know it when i was young my

619
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,558
main mentor was marvin minsky who's the

620
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,720
principal author of

621
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,639
the computer as creature

622
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,159
rhetoric that we still use

623
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,240
uh he was the first person to have the

624
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,679
idea at all but he certainly

625
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,240
populated

626
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,280
the ai culture with most of its tropes i

627
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,798
would say

628
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,480
because a lot of stuff people will say

629
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,240
oh did you hear this new idea about ai

630
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,919
and i'm like yeah i heard it in 1978

631
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,480
sure yeah i remember that

632
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,038
so marvin was really the person and uh

633
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,798
marvin and i used to argue

634
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:12,960
all the time about the stuff because i

635
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:14,639
always rejected it and of all of his

636
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,200
um

637
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,120
of all of his uh i wasn't formally his

638
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,480
student but i worked for him as a

639
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,839
researcher but

640
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,599
of of all of his students and

641
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,599
student-like people

642
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,480
of his young adoptees

643
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,158
um

644
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,079
i think i was the one who argued with

645
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,840
him about this stuff in particular and

646
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,439
he loved it because yeah i would have

647
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,558
loved to hear that conversation it was

648
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,120
fun did you ever converse to a place

649
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,678
oh no no so the very last time i saw him

650
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,558
he was quite frail and and uh

651
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,320
i was in uh in boston and i was going to

652
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:47,279
the old house in brookline his amazing

653
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,200
house

654
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,000
and one of our mutual friends said hey

655
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,240
listen marvin's so frail

656
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,759
don't do the argument with him don't

657
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,159
argue about ai

658
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,960
you know and so i said but marvin loves

659
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,960
that and so i showed up and he's like he

660
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,679
was frail he looked up and he said

661
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,679
are you ready to argue

662
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,399
he's such an amazing person

663
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,319
so um

664
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,080
it's hard to summarize this because it's

665
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,000
decades of stuff

666
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,079
the first thing to say

667
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,480
is that nobody can claim absolute

668
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,240
knowledge about whether

669
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,919
somebody or something else is conscious

670
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,000
or not

671
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,880
this is all a matter of faith and in

672
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,679
fact

673
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,080
um

674
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,080
i think the whole idea of faith needs to

675
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,798
be updated so it's not about god but

676
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,319
it's just about stuff in the universe we

677
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,038
we have faith in each other being

678
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,558
conscious and then um

679
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,240
i used to frame this as a thing called

680
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,000
the circle of empathy

681
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,960
in my old papers and then

682
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,319
um

683
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,600
it turned into a thing for the animal

684
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,119
rights movement so i noticed peter

685
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,000
singer using it i don't know if it was

686
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,599
coincident or but anyway we there's this

687
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,599
idea that you draw a circle around

688
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,359
yourself and the stuff inside is more

689
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,798
like you might be conscious might be

690
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,038
deserving of your empathy of your

691
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,599
consideration and the stuff outside the

692
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:08,319
circle isn't and

693
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,319
um outside the circle might be a rock

694
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,359
or

695
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,439
i don't know uh so uh and that circle is

696
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,199
fundamentally based on faith

697
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,919
well your faith and what is and what

698
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,159
isn't the thing about this circle

699
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,919
is it can't be pure faith it also has

700
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,840
it's also a pragmatic decision and this

701
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,240
is where things get complicated

702
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,759
if you try to make it too big you suffer

703
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
from incompetence

704
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,440
if you say

705
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,880
i don't want to kill a bacteria i will

706
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,038
not brush my teeth i don't know like

707
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,960
what do you do yeah like you know like

708
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,879
there's a there's a competence question

709
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,880
where you do have to draw the line

710
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,240
people who make it too small become

711
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,240
cruel

712
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,400
people are so clanished and political

713
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,159
and so worried about themselves ending

714
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
up on the bottom

715
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,320
of society that they are always ready to

716
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,278
gang up on some designated group and so

717
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,038
there's always these people who are

718
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,720
being tried we're always trying to shove

719
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,038
somebody out of the circle

720
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,640
and so aren't you shoving ai outside the

721
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,278
circle well give me a second all right

722
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,080
so so there's a pragmatic consideration

723
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:10,400
here yeah and so uh and and uh the the

724
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,480
biggest questions are probably fetuses

725
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,278
and animals lately but ai is getting

726
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,159
there

727
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,119
now with ai

728
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,039
i think

729
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,038
uh

730
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,720
and i've had this discussion so many

731
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,720
times people say but aren't you afraid

732
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
if you exclude ai you'd be cruel to some

733
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,400
consciousness

734
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,440
and then i would say well if you include

735
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,120
ai

736
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,278
you make yourself

737
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,079
you you exclude yourself from being able

738
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,640
to be a good engineer or designer and so

739
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,000
you're facing incompetence immediately

740
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,080
so like i really think we need to

741
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,679
subordinate algorithms and be much more

742
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,278
skeptical of them

743
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,200
your intuition you speak about this

744
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,960
brilliantly with social media how things

745
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,919
can go wrong

746
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,360
isn't it

747
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,720
possible

748
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,678
uh

749
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,000
to design systems that that show

750
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,759
compassion not to manipulate you but

751
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,599
give you control

752
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,519
and make your life better if you so

753
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,759
choose to like grow together with

754
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,679
systems and the way we grow with dogs

755
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,158
and cats with pets with significant

756
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,360
others in that way they grow to become

757
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,200
better people

758
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,879
i i don't understand why that's

759
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,319
fundamentally not possible you're saying

760
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,080
oftentimes

761
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,918
you get into trouble

762
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,000
by thinking you know what's good for

763
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,679
people look

764
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,839
there's this question of what framework

765
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,519
we're speaking in um do you know who

766
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,599
alan watts was

767
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:33,200
so alan watts once said

768
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,959
morality is like gravity that in some

769
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,558
absolute cosmic sense there can't be

770
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,960
morality because at some point it all

771
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:40,960
becomes relative and who are we anyway

772
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,079
like morality is relative to us tiny

773
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,880
creatures

774
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,639
but

775
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,320
here on earth

776
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,919
we're with each other this is our frame

777
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,278
and morality is a very real thing same

778
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,400
thing with gravity at some point you

779
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:52,240
know you get

780
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,400
you get into interstellar space and you

781
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,319
might not feel much of it but here we

782
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,000
are on earth and and i think in the same

783
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,278
sense um

784
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,359
i think this

785
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,400
this identification

786
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:06,479
with a frame that's quite remote

787
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,720
cannot be separated

788
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,960
from a feeling of wanting to feel sort

789
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,558
of separate separate from and superior

790
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,000
to other people or something like that

791
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,000
there's there's an impulse behind it

792
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,798
that i really have to reject

793
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,720
and

794
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,879
we're just not competent yet to talk

795
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,679
about these kinds of absolutes

796
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,600
okay so i agree with you that a lot of

797
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,080
technologists sort of lack this basic

798
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,639
respect uh understanding and love for

799
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,480
humanity there's a separation there the

800
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,880
thing i'd like to push back against it's

801
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,640
not that you disagree but i believe you

802
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,919
can create technologies and you can

803
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,120
create a new kind of technologist

804
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,440
engineer that does build systems that

805
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:48,639
respect humanity not just respect but

806
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,840
admire humanity that have empathy for

807
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,960
common humans have compassion

808
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:57,199
i mean no no no i i think

809
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,038
yeah i mean i think musical instruments

810
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,480
are a great example of that musical

811
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,038
instruments are technologies that help

812
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,480
people connect in fantastic ways and

813
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,558
that's uh

814
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,720
a great example um

815
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,480
my uh

816
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,759
my invention or design during the

817
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,960
pandemic period was this thing called

818
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,119
together mode where people see

819
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,519
themselves seated sort of in a a

820
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,038
classroom or a theater instead of in

821
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,558
squares and

822
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,000
it allows them to

823
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:27,440
semi-consciously perform to each other

824
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,599
as if they're

825
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,798
as if they have proper eye contact as if

826
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,879
they're paying attention to each other

827
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:33,918
non-verbally and weirdly that turns out

828
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,480
to work

829
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,399
and so it promotes empathy so far as i

830
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,519
can tell i hope i hope it is of some use

831
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:40,479
to somebody

832
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,359
uh

833
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,599
the ai idea isn't really new um i would

834
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:48,000
say it was born with adam smith's

835
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,558
invisible hand with this idea that we

836
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,319
build this algorithmic thing and it gets

837
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,319
a bit beyond us and then we think it

838
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,038
must be smarter than us and the thing

839
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,960
about the invisible hand is absolutely

840
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,398
everybody has some line they draw where

841
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,159
they say no no no we're going to take

842
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:03,599
control of this thing they might have

843
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,799
different lines they might care about

844
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,959
different things but everybody

845
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,720
ultimately became a keynesian because it

846
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,000
just didn't work it really wasn't that

847
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,558
smart it was sometimes smart and

848
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,119
sometimes it failed you know and and and

849
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,879
so if you really you know people who

850
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,359
really really really

851
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,880
want to believe in the invisible hand is

852
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,798
infinitely smart

853
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,120
screw up their economies terribly you

854
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:27,359
have to you know you have to recognize

855
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,119
the economy as a subservient tool

856
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:30,959
everybody does when it's to their

857
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,158
advantage they might not when it's not

858
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,079
to their advantage that's kind of an

859
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,760
interesting game that happens

860
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,079
but the thing is it's just like that

861
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:41,679
with our algorithms you know like uh

862
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:44,319
you you can uh you can have a sort of a

863
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,159
chicago you cannot you know economic

864
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,759
philosophy about your computer say no no

865
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,039
no my things come alive it's smarter

866
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,599
than anything

867
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:54,000
i think that there is a deep loneliness

868
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,240
within all of us this is what we seek we

869
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,440
seek love from each other

870
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,038
i think ai can help us connect deeper

871
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,278
like this this is what you criticize

872
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:04,960
social media for i think there's much

873
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,038
better ways of doing social media that

874
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,798
doesn't lead to manipulation but instead

875
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,879
released a deeper connection between

876
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,119
humans leads to you becoming a better

877
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,760
human being and what that requires is

878
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,359
some agency on the part of ai to to be

879
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,558
almost like a therapist i mean a

880
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,038
companion

881
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:23,200
it's not telling you

882
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,278
what's right it's not guiding you as if

883
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,278
it's an all-knowing thing

884
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,960
it's just another companion that you can

885
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,640
leave at any time

886
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,120
you you have complete transparency

887
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,759
control over there's a lot of mechanisms

888
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,798
that you can have that that are counter

889
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,839
to how current social media uh operates

890
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,480
that i think

891
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,558
is subservient to humans or no

892
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,919
deeply respects

893
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:47,678
human beings

894
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,038
and it's empathetic to their experience

895
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,798
and all those kinds of things i think

896
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,440
it's possible to create ai systems like

897
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,119
that and i think they i mean that's a

898
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,679
technical discussion of whether they

899
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,678
need to have

900
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,640
something that looks like more like ai

901
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,480
versus algorithms something that has a

902
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,360
identity something that has a

903
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,440
personality all those kinds of things ai

904
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,398
systems and you've spoken extensively

905
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,120
how ai systems

906
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,119
manipulate you within social networks

907
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:22,079
and that's the biggest the biggest

908
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,678
problem isn't necessarily that

909
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,720
um

910
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,240
there's advertisement that uh

911
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,000
you know social networks present you

912
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,159
with advertisements that then get you to

913
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,599
buy stuff that's not the biggest problem

914
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,679
the biggest problem is they then

915
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,558
manipulate you

916
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,679
your they alter like your

917
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:43,678
human nature to get you to buy stuff or

918
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,640
or to get you to um

919
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,720
do whatever the advertiser wants or

920
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,720
maybe you can correct yeah i i don't see

921
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,120
it quite that way but we can work with

922
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,880
that as an approximation sure so my i

923
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,558
think the actual thing is even sort of

924
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,039
more ridiculous and stupider than that

925
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:02,079
but that's that's okay let's let's so my

926
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,038
question is let's not use the word ai

927
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,158
uh but

928
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,839
how do we

929
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,000
fix it oh fixing social media um

930
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,398
that diverts us into this whole other

931
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
field in my view which is economics

932
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:15,678
which i always thought was really boring

933
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,119
but we have no choice but to turn into

934
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,720
economists if we want to fix this

935
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,879
problem because it's all about

936
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,519
incentives but um

937
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,559
i've been around this thing since it

938
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,079
started and and uh i've been in the

939
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,319
meetings where the social media

940
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,158
companies

941
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,079
sell themselves to the people who put

942
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,679
the most money into them which are

943
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,158
usually the big advertising holding

944
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,919
companies and whatnot and there's this

945
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,278
there's this idea that i think is kind

946
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,038
of a fiction

947
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,038
and maybe it's even

948
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:45,759
been recognized as that by everybody

949
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,158
that

950
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,519
the the algorithm will get really good

951
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,278
at getting people to buy something

952
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,038
because i think people have looked at

953
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,880
their returns and looked at what happens

954
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:58,720
and everybody recognizes that's not

955
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,960
exactly right it's more

956
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,360
like a cognitive access

957
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,200
blackmail payment at this point

958
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,639
like you just to be connected you're

959
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,798
paying the money it's not so much that

960
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,559
the persuasion algorithms that so

961
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,798
stanford renamed its program but it used

962
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:15,839
to be called engage persuade the engaged

963
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,440
part works the persuade part is iffy but

964
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,359
the thing is that

965
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,038
once people are engaged in order for you

966
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,798
to exist as a business in order for you

967
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:24,879
to be known at all you have to put money

968
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:24,879
in

969
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,880
it's a giant it's a giant cognitive

970
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,320
access blackmail scheme at this point so

971
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,120
um because the science behind the

972
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,918
persuade part it's not entirely

973
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:43,759
it's not entirely uh a failure but it's

974
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,759
it's not what the there's we play make

975
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:49,759
believe that it it works more than it

976
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:52,119
does um the damage doesn't come honestly

977
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:55,200
as i've i've said in my books i'm not

978
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:57,359
anti-advertising i actually think

979
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,519
advertising can be demeaning and

980
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,278
annoying and banal

981
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,278
and ridiculous

982
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,038
and take up a lot of our time with

983
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:08,320
stupid stuff like there's a lot of ways

984
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:10,480
to criticize that um advertising that's

985
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,559
accurate and it can also lie and all

986
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,159
kinds of things however

987
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,440
if i look at the biggest picture i think

988
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,280
advertising

989
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,559
at least as it was understood before

990
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,320
social media

991
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,838
helped bring people into modernity in a

992
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,559
way that overall

993
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,519
actually did benefit people overall

994
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,440
and

995
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:28,159
you might say am i contradicting myself

996
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,079
because i was saying you should

997
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,599
manipulate people yeah i am probably

998
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,679
here i mean i'm not i'm not pretending

999
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,440
to have this perfect airtight

1000
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,720
world view without some contradictions i

1001
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,398
think there's a bit of a contradiction

1002
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,118
there so you know well looking at the

1003
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,759
long arc of history advertisement has as

1004
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,000
in some parts benefited society yeah

1005
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,720
because it funded some efforts that

1006
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,719
perhaps yeah i mean i think like there's

1007
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,559
a there's a thing where

1008
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,838
uh sometimes i think it's actually been

1009
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:54,719
of some use

1010
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:56,480
now

1011
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,078
let's

1012
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,838
where the damage comes is a different

1013
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,440
thing though social media

1014
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:05,358
um algorithms on social media have to

1015
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,039
work on feedback loops where they

1016
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:08,960
present you with stimulus they have to

1017
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,358
see if you respond to the stimulus

1018
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,119
now the the problem is that the the

1019
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,519
measurement mechanism for telling if you

1020
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,680
respond in the engagement

1021
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:19,599
feedback loop is very very crude it's

1022
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,960
things like whether you click more or

1023
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,800
occasionally if you're staring at the

1024
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,320
screen more if there's a forward-facing

1025
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,359
camera that's activated but typically

1026
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,200
there isn't

1027
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,880
so you have this incredibly crude back

1028
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,279
channel of information

1029
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,480
and so it's crude enough that it only

1030
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,440
catches

1031
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,719
sort of the more dramatic responses from

1032
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,400
you and those are the fight-or-flight

1033
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,679
responses those are the things where you

1034
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,079
get scared or pissed off or aggressive

1035
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,838
or horny you know these are these

1036
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,440
ancient the sort of what are sometimes

1037
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:50,078
called the lizard brain circuits or

1038
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,960
whatever you know these these fast

1039
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,079
response old old old evolutionary

1040
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,960
business

1041
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,640
circuits that we have that

1042
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,800
are helpful in survival once in a while

1043
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,159
but are not us at our best they're not

1044
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,000
who we want to be they're not how we

1045
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,078
relate to each other they're this old

1046
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,159
business but it's so then just when

1047
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,880
you're engaged using those intrinsically

1048
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:13,118
totally aside from whatever the topic is

1049
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,519
you start to get incrementally just a

1050
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,880
little bit more paranoid xenophobic

1051
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,559
aggressive

1052
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,880
you know you get a little stupid and

1053
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,039
like a you become a jerk

1054
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,640
and it happens slowly it happens it's

1055
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,719
not it's not like everybody's like

1056
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,480
instantly transformed but it does kind

1057
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,399
of happen progressively where people who

1058
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,719
get hooked kind of get drawn more and

1059
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,039
more into this pattern of being at their

1060
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:37,598
worst would you say that people are able

1061
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:40,480
to when they get hooked in this way look

1062
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,359
back at themselves from 30 days ago and

1063
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,440
say

1064
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:46,480
i am less happy

1065
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,240
with who i am now or i'm not happy with

1066
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,559
who i am now versus who i was 30 days

1067
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,159
ago are they able to self-reflect when

1068
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,039
you take yourself outside of the lizard

1069
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,838
brain sometimes um i wrote a book about

1070
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:57,119
people

1071
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,719
suggesting people take a break from

1072
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,160
their social media to see what happens

1073
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,598
and maybe even

1074
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,440
it was actually the title of the book

1075
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,800
was just the arguments to delete your

1076
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,720
account yeah

1077
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,320
and 10 arguments 10 arguments although i

1078
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,919
always said i don't know that you should

1079
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,760
i can give you the arguments it's up to

1080
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,079
you i'm always very clear about that but

1081
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,400
you know i get like i don't have a

1082
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,560
social media account obviously and

1083
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,680
it's not that easy for people to reach

1084
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,000
me they have to search out an

1085
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:24,000
old-fashioned email address on a super

1086
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,159
crappy antiquated website like it's it's

1087
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,320
actually a bit i don't make it easy and

1088
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,920
even with that i get this huge flood of

1089
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,280
mail from people who say oh i quit my

1090
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,119
social media i'm doing so much better i

1091
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,200
can't believe how bad it was

1092
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,280
but the thing is what's for me a huge

1093
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,199
flood of mail would be an imperceptible

1094
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,040
trickle from the perspective of facebook

1095
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:44,719
right and so uh i think it's rare for

1096
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,279
somebody to look at themselves and say

1097
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,199
oh boy i sure screwed myself over

1098
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,200
well it's a really hard thing to ask of

1099
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:53,039
somebody none of us find that easy right

1100
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,358
well the reason that's hard the reason i

1101
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,279
ask this is is it possible to design

1102
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,159
social media

1103
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,320
systems that optimize for some longer

1104
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,719
term metrics of

1105
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,559
you huge being happy with yourself

1106
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,319
personal i don't think you should try to

1107
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,759
engineer personal growth or happiness i

1108
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,160
think what you should do is design a

1109
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,920
system that's just respectful of the

1110
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,838
people and subordinates itself to the

1111
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,760
people and doesn't have perverse

1112
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,838
incentives and then at least there's a

1113
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,880
chance of something decent happening you

1114
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,559
have to recommend stuff right so but so

1115
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,240
you're saying like be respect what does

1116
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,400
that actually mean engineering-wise like

1117
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,559
people yeah curation people have to

1118
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,000
people have to be responsible algorithms

1119
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,358
shouldn't be recommending algorithms

1120
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,440
don't understand enough to recommend

1121
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:37,358
algorithms are crap in this era i mean

1122
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,800
i'm sorry they are like i and i'm not

1123
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,239
saying this as somebody as a critic from

1124
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,920
the outside i'm in the middle of it i

1125
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:43,679
know what they can do i know the math i

1126
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,639
know what the corpora are

1127
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,879
i'm

1128
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,440
you know i know the best ones

1129
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,519
our office is funding gpt3 and all these

1130
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,440
things that are that are you know

1131
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,000
at the at the edge of what's possible

1132
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,358
and they do not have

1133
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,039
yet

1134
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:02,078
i mean it still is

1135
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,199
statistical emergent pseudosemantics it

1136
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,200
doesn't actually have deep

1137
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,039
representation emerging of anything it's

1138
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:09,519
just not like i mean that i'm speaking

1139
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:12,000
the truth here and you know it well

1140
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,838
let me push back on this this uh there's

1141
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,679
several truths here so one you're

1142
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:16,960
speaking to the way certain companies

1143
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:18,879
operate currently

1144
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,599
i don't think it's outside the realm of

1145
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,800
what's technically uh feasible to do

1146
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,000
they're just not incentive like

1147
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,000
companies are not why fix this thing

1148
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,838
i am aware

1149
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,280
that for example the youtube search and

1150
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:36,400
discovery has been very helpful to me

1151
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,640
and there's a huge number of there's so

1152
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,720
many videos that it's nice to have a

1153
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,759
little bit of help have you done but i'm

1154
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,519
still in control let me ask you

1155
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,000
something have you done the experiment

1156
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,239
of letting youtube recommend videos to

1157
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,239
you either starting from

1158
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,598
a absolutely anonymous random place

1159
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,358
where it doesn't know who you are or

1160
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,440
from knowing who you or somebody else is

1161
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,440
and then going 15 or 20 hops have you

1162
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,679
ever done that and just let it go

1163
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,079
top video recommend and then just go 20

1164
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,039
hops no i know i've done that many times

1165
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,920
now

1166
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:09,199
i have because of how large youtube is

1167
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,200
and how widely it's used it's very hard

1168
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,879
to get to enough scale to get a

1169
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,879
statistically

1170
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,880
solid result on this i've done it with

1171
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,318
high school kids with dozens of kids

1172
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,240
doing it at a time

1173
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:23,039
every time i've done an experiment the

1174
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:25,519
majority of times after about 17 or 18

1175
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,639
hops you end up in really weird paranoid

1176
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:30,400
bizarre territory because ultimately

1177
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,838
that is the stuff the algorithm rewards

1178
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,920
the most because of the feedback

1179
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,719
crudeness i was just talking about

1180
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,400
so uh i'm not saying that the video

1181
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:40,799
never recommends something cool i'm

1182
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,838
saying that it's fundamental core is one

1183
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,480
that promotes a paranoid style that

1184
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:50,000
promotes increasing irritability that

1185
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,559
promotes xenophobia promotes fear anger

1186
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,838
promotes selfishness promotes separation

1187
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:55,838
between people

1188
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:58,400
uh and i would encoura the thing is it's

1189
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,880
very hard to do this work solidly many

1190
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,480
have repeated this experiment and yet it

1191
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,720
still is kind of anecdotal i'd like to

1192
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,159
do like a large you know citizen science

1193
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:07,519
thing sometime and do it but then i

1194
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:09,920
think the problem with that is youtube

1195
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,519
would detect it and then change it yes i

1196
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,000
definitely say i love that kind of stuff

1197
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,039
on twit so jack dorsey has spoken about

1198
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,639
uh

1199
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,880
doing healthy conversations on twitter

1200
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,639
or optimizing for healthy conversations

1201
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,838
what that requires within twitter are

1202
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:25,199
most likely

1203
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,440
citizen experiments of what does how the

1204
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,879
conversation actually look like and what

1205
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,358
how do you incentivize those healthy

1206
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,760
conversations you're describing what

1207
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:36,000
often happens and what is currently

1208
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,560
happening what i'd like to argue is it's

1209
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,199
possible to strive for healthy

1210
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,159
conversations not in a dogmatic way of

1211
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,480
saying

1212
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,078
uh i know what healthy conversations are

1213
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,800
and i will tell you i think one way to

1214
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,839
do this is to try to look around at

1215
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,039
social

1216
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,960
maybe not things that are officially

1217
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,119
social media but things where people are

1218
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,358
together online and see which ones have

1219
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,358
more healthy conversations even if it's

1220
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,639
hard to

1221
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:02,480
be completely objective in that

1222
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,239
measurement you can kind of at least

1223
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,800
cruelly you could do subjective

1224
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:09,039
annotation of this like having so here

1225
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,440
crowdsourced yeah one that i've been

1226
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,599
really interested in is github

1227
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,440
because um

1228
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,240
uh it could change i'm not saying it'll

1229
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,119
always be but for the most part github

1230
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,159
has had a relatively quite low poison

1231
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,039
quotient

1232
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,639
and

1233
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,559
i think there's a few things about

1234
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,719
github that are interesting

1235
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,279
one thing about it is that people have a

1236
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:33,118
stake in it it's not just empty status

1237
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,599
games there's actual code or there's

1238
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,519
actual stuff being done and i think as

1239
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,039
soon as you have a real world stake in

1240
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,920
something

1241
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:44,800
you have a motivation to not screw up

1242
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,800
that thing and i think that that's often

1243
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,480
missing that there's a there's no

1244
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,560
incentive for the person to really

1245
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,880
preserve something if they if they get a

1246
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,279
little bit of attention from um dumping

1247
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,559
on somebody's tick tock or something

1248
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,359
that there's they don't pay any price

1249
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:01,119
for it but on you have to kind of

1250
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,199
get decent with people when you have a

1251
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,880
shared stake you know a little secret so

1252
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:09,759
get so github does a bit of that um

1253
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,039
github was wonderful yes but i yeah i'm

1254
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,000
tempted to play

1255
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:16,559
uh the gerund back at you which is that

1256
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,960
so github is currently is amazing but

1257
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,719
the thing is if you have a stake then if

1258
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,480
it's a social media platform they can

1259
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:23,838
use the fact that you have a steak to

1260
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,079
manipulate you because you want to

1261
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,920
preserve the steak so like

1262
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,200
right well this is why this all right

1263
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,800
this gets us into the economics so

1264
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:32,879
there's this thing called data dignity

1265
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,560
that i've been studying for a long time

1266
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,480
i wrote a book about an earlier version

1267
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:41,599
of it called who owns the future

1268
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:42,800
um and the the basic idea of it is that

1269
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,318
once again this is the third year

1270
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,079
conversation the fascinating topic let

1271
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,719
me do the fastest version of this i can

1272
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,640
do the fastest way i know how to do this

1273
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,838
is to compare two features

1274
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:52,639
all right

1275
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,599
so

1276
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,358
future one is then the normative one the

1277
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,680
one we're building right now and future

1278
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:02,400
two is going to be data dignity okay and

1279
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,318
um and i'm gonna use a particular

1280
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,480
population i live on the hill and

1281
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,000
berkeley and one of the features about

1282
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,318
the hill is that as the climate changes

1283
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,760
we might burn down and i'll lose our

1284
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,119
houses or die or something like it's

1285
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,160
it's dangerous you know and it didn't

1286
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,519
used to be

1287
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:19,519
and so um who keeps us alive well the

1288
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,599
city does the city does some things the

1289
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,358
electric company kind of sort of maybe

1290
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,079
hopefully better

1291
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:27,440
individual people who own property take

1292
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,119
care of their property that's all nice

1293
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,800
but there's this other middle layer

1294
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,440
which is fascinating to me

1295
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,680
which is that the groundskeepers

1296
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,599
who work up and down that hill many of

1297
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,519
whom are not

1298
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,480
legally here many of whom don't speak

1299
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:42,480
english

1300
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,318
cooperate with each other

1301
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,639
to make sure trees don't touch to

1302
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,239
transfer fire easily from la to lot they

1303
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,000
have this whole little web that's

1304
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,318
keeping us safe i didn't know about this

1305
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,519
at first i just started talking to them

1306
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,000
because they were out there during the

1307
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,440
pandemic and so i try to just see who

1308
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,280
are these people who are these people

1309
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,800
who are keeping us alive

1310
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,160
now i want to talk about the two

1311
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,800
different faiths for those people under

1312
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,719
future one and future two

1313
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,920
future one um

1314
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:11,439
some weird like kindergarten paint job

1315
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,119
van with all these like cameras and

1316
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,440
where things drives up observes what the

1317
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,079
gardeners and groundskeepers are doing

1318
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,000
a few years later some amazing robots

1319
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,440
that can shimmy up trees and all this

1320
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,719
show up all those people are out of work

1321
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,240
and there are these robots doing the

1322
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,039
thing and the robots are good and they

1323
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,959
can scale to more land and they're

1324
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,480
actually good but then they're all these

1325
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,679
people out of work and these people have

1326
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,880
lost dignity they don't know what

1327
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,639
they're going to do

1328
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,039
and and then somebody say well they go

1329
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,960
on basic income whatever they become

1330
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,119
wards of the state

1331
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,519
my problem with that solution is every

1332
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,039
time in history that you've had some

1333
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,880
centralized thing that's stoling out the

1334
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,719
benefits that things get seized by

1335
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,240
people because it's too centralized and

1336
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,639
it gets seized that's happened to every

1337
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,519
communist experiment i can find

1338
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:57,759
um so i think that turns into a poor

1339
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,199
future that will be unstable i don't

1340
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,520
think people will feel good in it i

1341
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:03,439
think it'll be a political disaster with

1342
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:06,639
the sequence of people seizing this

1343
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,159
central source of the the basic income

1344
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,519
and you'll say oh no an algorithm can do

1345
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,519
it then people will seize the algorithm

1346
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,838
they'll see they'll seize control unless

1347
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,559
the algorithm is decentralized and it's

1348
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:18,078
impossible to cease to control yeah but

1349
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,199
but uh

1350
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,119
60 something people own a quarter of all

1351
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,239
the bitcoin like like the things that we

1352
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,838
think are decentralized are not

1353
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:29,358
decentralized

1354
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:31,679
so let's go to future two future two

1355
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,279
the gardeners see that that van with all

1356
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,279
the cameras and the kindergarten paint

1357
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,440
job and they say with the groundskeepers

1358
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,040
and they say hey the robots are coming

1359
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,679
we're gonna form a data union and

1360
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:45,599
amazingly california has a little baby

1361
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:47,919
data union law emerging in the books yes

1362
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,400
and so there's and so they'll um and and

1363
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,880
what they say they say we're gonna form

1364
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,838
we're gonna form a data union and we're

1365
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,838
gonna

1366
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:56,880
not only are we gonna sell our data to

1367
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:58,000
this place but we're going to make it

1368
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,039
better than it would have been if they

1369
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,519
were just grabbing it without our

1370
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,800
cooperation and we're going to improve

1371
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,838
it we're going to make the robots more

1372
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,200
effective we're going to make them

1373
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,838
better and we're going to be proud of it

1374
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:10,318
we're going to become a new class of

1375
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,679
experts that are respected and then

1376
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:12,880
here's the interesting

1377
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:14,480
there's two things that are different

1378
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,559
about that world

1379
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,240
from future one one thing of course the

1380
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,119
people have more pride they have more

1381
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:23,759
sense

1382
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,200
of of ownership of uh of of of agency

1383
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,920
but

1384
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,239
what the robots do changes uh instead of

1385
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,519
just like this functional like we'll

1386
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,439
figure out how to keep the neighborhood

1387
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,280
from burning down uh

1388
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,559
you have this whole creative community

1389
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,079
that wasn't there before thinking well

1390
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,079
how can we make these robots better so

1391
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,599
we can keep on earning money there'll be

1392
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,039
waves of

1393
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,359
creative

1394
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:47,519
uh groundskeeping with spiral pumping

1395
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:50,078
pumpkin patches and waves of cultural

1396
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,838
things there'll be new ideas like wow i

1397
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,160
wonder if we could do something about

1398
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:56,400
climate change mitigation with how we do

1399
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,480
this what about what about fresh water

1400
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,160
can we what about can we make the food

1401
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,358
healthier what about what about all of a

1402
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:03,199
sudden there'll be this whole creative

1403
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,759
community on the case

1404
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:07,679
and isn't it nicer to have a high-tech

1405
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,359
future with more creative classes than

1406
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,399
one with more dependent classes isn't

1407
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:14,558
that a better future but but but

1408
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,880
future one and future two

1409
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,800
have the same robots and the same

1410
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,160
algorithms there's no technological

1411
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,519
difference there's only a human

1412
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,199
difference yeah

1413
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:25,599
and that second future too that's state

1414
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:27,598
of dignity

1415
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,519
the economy that you're i mean the game

1416
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,760
theory here is on the humans and then

1417
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,719
the technology is just the tools that

1418
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,599
enable yeah you know i mean i think you

1419
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,879
can believe in ai and be in future too i

1420
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,359
just think it's a little harder you have

1421
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,838
to do you have to do more

1422
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:46,078
um contortions it's possible so in the

1423
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:49,679
case of social media

1424
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,079
what is uh idea dignity look like is it

1425
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,399
people getting paid for their data yeah

1426
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,359
i think um what should happen is in the

1427
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,280
future there should be uh massive data

1428
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,598
unions uh

1429
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,720
for people putting

1430
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,640
content into the system and the state

1431
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,799
unions smooth out the results a little

1432
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:10,400
bit so it's not winner take all but at

1433
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,760
the same time

1434
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,119
and people have to pay for it too they

1435
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,960
have to pay for

1436
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,358
facebook the way they pay for netflix

1437
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,199
with with an allowance for the poor

1438
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:21,519
there has to be a there has to be a way

1439
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:24,318
out too but the thing is people do pay

1440
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:26,400
for netflix it's a going concern

1441
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:28,318
people pay for xbox and playstation like

1442
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,680
people there's enough people to pay for

1443
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:31,199
stuff they want this could happen too

1444
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:33,199
it's just that this precedence started

1445
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:36,318
that moved in the wrong direction and

1446
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,078
then what has to happen

1447
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:38,880
the economy is a measuring device if

1448
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,880
it's an

1449
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,358
honest measuring device

1450
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,838
the outcomes for people form a normal

1451
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:47,119
distribution a bell curve and then so

1452
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:49,279
there should be a few people who do

1453
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,640
really well a lot of people who do okay

1454
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,119
and then we should have an expanding

1455
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,279
economy reflecting more and more

1456
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,760
creativity and expertise flowing through

1457
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,440
the network and that expanding economy

1458
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,520
moves the result just a bit forward so

1459
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,039
more people are getting money out of it

1460
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:04,880
than are putting money into it so it

1461
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:06,880
gradually expands the economy and lifts

1462
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,920
all boats and the in the society has to

1463
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,079
support

1464
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,079
the the the lower wing of the bell curve

1465
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,280
too but not universal basic income it

1466
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,200
has to be

1467
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,800
for the you know because if it's an

1468
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,759
honest if it's an honest economy there

1469
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,839
will be

1470
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,359
uh that lower wing and we we have to

1471
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,880
support those people there has to be a

1472
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:26,318
safety net um but um see what i believe

1473
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,000
i'm not going to talk about ai but i

1474
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,279
will say

1475
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,079
that i think there'll be more and more

1476
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,000
algorithms that are useful and so i

1477
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,000
don't think everybody's going to be

1478
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,440
supplying data to grounds keeping robots

1479
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,800
nor do i think everybody's going to make

1480
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,880
their living with tick-tock videos i

1481
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,720
think in both cases there'll be a rather

1482
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,559
small contingent

1483
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,118
that do well enough at either of those

1484
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,119
things but i think there might be many

1485
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,480
many many many of those niches that

1486
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,480
start to evolve as they're more and more

1487
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,480
algorithms more and more robots and it's

1488
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,559
that large number

1489
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,559
that will create the economic potential

1490
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,519
for a very large part of society to

1491
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,519
become members of new creative classes

1492
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:04,480
do you think it's possible to

1493
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:06,800
um

1494
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,480
to create a social network that competes

1495
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,079
with twitter and facebook that's large

1496
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,719
and centralized in this way not

1497
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:15,440
centralized or large large how do we get

1498
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:17,039
all right so i gotta tell you how to get

1499
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,039
from what i'm talking how to get from

1500
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:21,440
where we are to anything kind of in the

1501
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:22,639
zone of what i'm talking about is

1502
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,599
challenging

1503
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:26,078
um

1504
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:29,200
i know some of the people who run like i

1505
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,720
know jack dorsey and i view jack

1506
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:33,838
as somebody

1507
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,838
who's actually

1508
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:37,838
i think he's really striving and

1509
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,358
searching and finding and trying to find

1510
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,239
a way to make it better

1511
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:44,078
uh but is kind of like

1512
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:45,358
it's very hard to do it while in flight

1513
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,359
and he's under enormous business

1514
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:49,199
pressure too um

1515
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:51,598
so jack dorsey to me is a fascinating

1516
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,439
study because i think his mind is in a

1517
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,079
lot of good places because he's a good

1518
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,440
human being but there's a big titanic

1519
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,640
ship that's already moving in one

1520
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,240
direction it's hard to know what to do

1521
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:01,759
with that i think that's the story of

1522
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:03,598
twitter i think that's the story of

1523
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,200
twitter um one of the things that i

1524
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,519
observe is that if you just want to look

1525
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:09,439
at the human side meaning like how are

1526
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,440
people being changed how do they feel

1527
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,960
what does the culture like

1528
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,519
almost all

1529
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,519
of the social media platforms that get

1530
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:18,639
big have an initial sort of honeymoon

1531
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:20,800
period where they're actually kind of

1532
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,719
sweet and cute yeah like if you look at

1533
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,240
the early years of twitter it was really

1534
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:27,439
sweet and cute but also look at snap

1535
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,318
tik tok

1536
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,000
and then what happens is as they scale

1537
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:33,599
and the algorithms become more

1538
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,039
influential instead of just the early

1539
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,400
people when it gets when it gets big

1540
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,480
enough that it's the algorithm running

1541
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,160
it then you start to see the rise of the

1542
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,400
paranoid style and then they start to

1543
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,838
get dark and we've seen that shift in

1544
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,920
tik-tok rather recently but i feel like

1545
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:51,519
that scaling reveals

1546
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,039
the flaws within the incentives

1547
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:56,079
i feel like i'm torturing you i'm still

1548
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:57,838
no no it's not torture no because

1549
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,318
i i have hope

1550
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:01,759
uh for the world with with humans and

1551
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:04,558
have hope for a lot of things that

1552
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,359
humans create including technology and i

1553
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,519
just

1554
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:11,759
uh i feel it is possible to create uh

1555
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:13,440
social media platforms that incentivize

1556
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,760
different things than the current i

1557
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,920
think the current incentivization is

1558
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,480
around like the dumbest possible thing

1559
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,800
that was invented like 20 years ago or

1560
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,639
however long and it just works and so

1561
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,839
nobody's changing it i just think that

1562
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:29,358
there could be a lot of innovation for

1563
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:31,838
more see you kind of push back this idea

1564
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:34,558
that we can't know what long-term growth

1565
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:37,599
or happiness is i i if you give control

1566
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:41,119
to people to define what their long-term

1567
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,800
happiness and goals are then you that

1568
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,400
optimization can happen for each of

1569
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,839
those individual people

1570
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,680
you know

1571
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:50,239
well i mean

1572
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:52,558
imagine a future

1573
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:52,558
where

1574
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:59,279
probably a lot of people would love to

1575
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,000
make their living doing tick-tock dance

1576
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,760
videos but people recognize generally

1577
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,119
that's kind of hard to get into

1578
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,559
nonetheless

1579
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,480
dance crews

1580
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,400
have an experience that's very similar

1581
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,159
to programmers working together on

1582
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,240
github so the future is like a cross

1583
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:17,358
between tick tock and github and they

1584
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:19,679
get together and they have their negotia

1585
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,440
they have rights they're negotiating

1586
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:23,759
they're negotiating for returns they

1587
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,159
join different artists societies in

1588
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,400
order to soften the blow of the

1589
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,239
randomness of who gets the network

1590
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,039
effect benefit because nobody can know

1591
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:32,558
that

1592
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:35,519
and

1593
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:37,280
they uh and i think an individual person

1594
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,960
might join a thousand different data

1595
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,798
unions in the course of their lives or

1596
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,960
maybe even ten thousand i don't know but

1597
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:45,679
the point is that we'll have like these

1598
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,838
very hedge distributed portfolios of

1599
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:49,519
different data unions we're part of

1600
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:51,119
and some of them might just trickle in a

1601
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,798
little money for

1602
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,519
nonsense stuff where we're contributing

1603
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:57,119
to health studies or something and but i

1604
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:59,679
think people will find their way they'll

1605
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,640
find their way to the right github-like

1606
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:05,199
community in which they find their value

1607
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:08,078
in the context of supplying

1608
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:10,639
inputs and data and taste and

1609
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:14,318
correctives and all of this into the

1610
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:14,318
algorithms and the robots of the future

1611
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:21,199
and that is a way to resist the uh

1612
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:23,199
the lizard brain based

1613
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:26,239
funding assist mechanisms it's an

1614
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:29,358
alternate economic system that rewards

1615
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,959
productivity creativity uh value as

1616
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:32,960
perceived by others it's a genuine

1617
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,039
market it's not doled out from a center

1618
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,798
there's not some communist person

1619
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,558
deciding who's valuable it's actual

1620
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:41,838
market

1621
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:44,720
and the the money is made

1622
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:46,480
by supporting that instead of

1623
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:47,838
just grabbing people's attention in the

1624
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,760
cheapest possible way which is

1625
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:50,719
definitely how you get the lizard brain

1626
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,890
yeah

1627
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:55,598
okay so we're finally at the agreement

1628
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:56,480
[Laughter]

1629
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,119
but i

1630
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,960
i just think that

1631
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,160
so yeah i'll tell you what how i think

1632
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,079
uh

1633
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:06,239
fake social media there's a few things

1634
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,079
there's a few things so one i think

1635
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,639
people should have complete control over

1636
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,880
their data and transparency of uh what

1637
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:15,039
that data is and how it's being used if

1638
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,720
they do hand over the control another

1639
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,599
thing they should be able to delete walk

1640
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:21,039
away with their data at any moment easy

1641
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,119
like with a single click of a button

1642
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:25,440
maybe two buttons i don't know just

1643
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,240
easily walk away with their data

1644
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,079
uh

1645
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:30,078
the other is control of the algorithm

1646
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,119
individualized control of the algorithm

1647
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,599
for them

1648
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,039
so each one has their own algorithm each

1649
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,079
person has their own algorithm they get

1650
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:41,119
to be the decider of uh what they see in

1651
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:43,760
this world and to me that i mean that's

1652
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,000
i guess fundamentally decentralized

1653
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,680
terms of the key decisions being made

1654
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,400
but if that's made transparent i feel

1655
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:53,440
like people will choose that system over

1656
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,200
twitter of today over facebook of today

1657
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,440
when they have the ability to walk away

1658
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,838
to control their data and to control the

1659
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,079
kinds of things they see now

1660
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:02,960
let's walk away from the term ai you're

1661
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,798
right

1662
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,960
in this case you

1663
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:09,199
you have full control of the algorithms

1664
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,199
that help you if you want

1665
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:14,558
to use their help but you can also say

1666
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:18,159
fu to those algorithms and just uh

1667
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:21,280
consume the raw beautiful waterfall

1668
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:23,440
of the internet i think that

1669
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,640
to me that's not only fixes social media

1670
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,480
but i think it will make a lot more

1671
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,318
money so i would like to challenge the

1672
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,039
idea i know you're not presenting that

1673
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:31,759
but

1674
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:34,079
that the only way to make a ton of money

1675
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,480
is to operate like facebook is i think

1676
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,839
you can make more money by giving people

1677
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,760
control

1678
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,239
yeah i mean i certainly believe that

1679
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,440
we're definitely in the territory of

1680
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:45,838
uh

1681
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,240
wholehearted agreement here

1682
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:50,239
um i i do want to caution against one

1683
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:51,838
thing which is

1684
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:53,759
making a future that benefits

1685
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:55,838
programmers versus p like this idea that

1686
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,880
people are in control of their data so

1687
00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,159
um years ago i co-founded an advisory

1688
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,000
board for the eu with a guy named

1689
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:02,960
giovanni but torelli who passed away

1690
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,880
it's one of the reasons i wanted to

1691
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,000
mention it a remarkable guy

1692
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,000
who'd been

1693
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,960
he was originally a prosecutor who was

1694
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,679
throwing mafioso in jail

1695
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,920
in in sicily so he was like this intense

1696
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:17,759
guy who was like i've been i've dealt

1697
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,000
with death stress mark zuckerberg

1698
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,920
doesn't scare me or whatever so

1699
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,798
we worked we worked on this path of

1700
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,720
saying let's make it all about

1701
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:27,599
transparency and consent and it was one

1702
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:29,358
of the feeders that led to this huge uh

1703
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,680
data

1704
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:33,920
data privacy and and uh protection

1705
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,719
framework in europe called the gdpr

1706
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,880
and

1707
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,959
uh so therefore we've been able to have

1708
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,039
uh empirical feedback on how that goes

1709
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,159
and the problem is that

1710
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:46,719
most people actually get stymied by the

1711
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:48,159
complexity of that kind of management

1712
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:50,798
they have trouble

1713
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:52,639
and reasonably so i don't i'm like a

1714
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:55,519
techie you know i can i can go in and i

1715
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:57,598
can figure out what's going on but uh i

1716
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:59,199
most people really do and why and so

1717
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,160
there's the problem that it

1718
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,239
it it

1719
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:04,480
it differentially it differentially

1720
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,318
benefits those who kind of have a

1721
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,599
technical mindset and can go in and sort

1722
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:08,880
of have a feeling for how this stuff

1723
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,880
works

1724
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,000
i kind of still want to come back to

1725
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,680
incentives and so if the incentive

1726
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,440
for whoever is if the commercial

1727
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:18,639
incentive is to help the creative people

1728
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,400
of the future make more money because

1729
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:22,480
you get a cut of it

1730
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,079
that's how you grow an economy not the

1731
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,519
programmers

1732
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,119
well some of them will be programmers

1733
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:30,159
it's not anti-programmer i'm just saying

1734
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:33,519
that um it's not only programmers

1735
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:35,279
you know so uh i mean so yeah yeah you

1736
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:37,679
have to make sure the incentives are

1737
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,640
right i mean i like

1738
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,159
control is an interface problem to where

1739
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,440
you have to create something that's

1740
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:46,960
that's uh

1741
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:50,480
compelling to everybody to the creatives

1742
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,400
to the public i mean there's uh

1743
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,760
i don't know creative commons like the

1744
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,720
licensing

1745
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,720
uh

1746
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:59,358
this you know there's a bunch of legal

1747
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,199
speak just in general the whole legal

1748
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:02,719
profession it's nice when it could be

1749
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:04,399
simplified in the way that you can truly

1750
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:06,558
you know simply understand everybody can

1751
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,119
simply understand um

1752
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:12,559
the the basics in the same way

1753
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:14,798
it should be very simple to understand

1754
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:17,440
how the data is being used

1755
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:19,759
and what data is being used for people

1756
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,960
but then you're arguing that in order

1757
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,400
for that to happen you have to have the

1758
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,199
incentives the like

1759
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,559
i mean a lot of the reason that money

1760
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:28,879
works

1761
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:31,359
is actually information hiding and

1762
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:34,000
information loss like one of the things

1763
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:35,519
about money is a particular dollar you

1764
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,838
get might have passed through your

1765
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:39,838
enemy's hands and you don't know it but

1766
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:41,599
also this is i mean this is what adam

1767
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:44,159
smith if you want to give the most

1768
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,920
charitable interpretation possible to

1769
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,279
the invisible hand is what he was saying

1770
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,519
is that like there's this whole

1771
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,040
complicated thing and not only do you

1772
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:52,318
not need to know about it the truth is

1773
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,838
you'd never be able to follow it if you

1774
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:57,599
tried and just like let the economic

1775
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:59,599
incentives solve for this whole thing

1776
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,280
and and and that um

1777
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,519
in a sense every transaction is like a

1778
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,599
neuron and a neural net if if he'd had

1779
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:07,358
that metaphor he would have used it

1780
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:10,318
and uh let the whole thing settle to a

1781
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:12,719
solution and don't worry about it um i i

1782
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:14,719
think this idea of

1783
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:17,679
having incentives that reduce complexity

1784
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:19,199
for people can be made to work and and

1785
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:20,798
that's an example of an algorithm that

1786
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:22,239
could be manipulative or not going back

1787
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,559
to your question before about can you do

1788
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:25,838
it in a way that's not manipulative and

1789
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,880
i would say

1790
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:28,719
um

1791
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,200
a github like if you just have this

1792
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,399
vision github plus tick tock

1793
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:35,039
combine

1794
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:38,559
is it possible i think it is i'm not

1795
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:40,318
gonna be able to unsee that idea

1796
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,920
of creatives on tick tock collaborating

1797
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,480
in the same way that people on github

1798
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,280
collaborate i like that kind of version

1799
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,119
why not i like it i love it i just like

1800
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,760
right now when people use by the way

1801
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:53,440
father of teenage daughters

1802
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,440
all about tic-tac right

1803
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,318
so you know when people use tick-tock

1804
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,440
there's a lot of uh

1805
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:01,519
it's kind of funny i was gonna say

1806
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,480
cattiness but i was just using the cat

1807
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:06,318
as this exemplar of overcoming

1808
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,838
i contradict myself but anyway there's

1809
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:09,599
all this cattiness where people are like

1810
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:11,519
hey this person

1811
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:13,519
and and i i just um

1812
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:15,759
uh what about people getting together in

1813
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:17,119
conjunction saying okay we're gonna work

1814
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,720
on this move we're gonna get a bit of

1815
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,920
can we get a better musician like and

1816
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:23,759
they they do that but that's the part

1817
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,280
that's kind of

1818
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,480
off the books right now you know that

1819
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,319
should be like right there that should

1820
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,000
be the center that's where the that's

1821
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:32,000
the really best part well that's that's

1822
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,480
where the invention of get period the

1823
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,920
versioning is brilliant and so some of

1824
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,798
the some of the things you're talking

1825
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,240
about

1826
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:42,159
technology algorithms tools can empower

1827
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:44,879
and that's that's the thing for humans

1828
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:46,159
to to connect to collaborate and so on

1829
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,838
can we uh

1830
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:50,159
can we upset more people a little bit

1831
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:53,119
you already i thought maybe we'd have to

1832
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,519
try no no can we uh can i ask you

1833
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,880
to elaborate because i my intuition was

1834
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:58,719
that you would be a supporter of

1835
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,559
something like cryptocurrency and

1836
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:03,679
bitcoin because it is fundamentally

1837
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,680
emphasizes decentralization what do you

1838
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,919
so can you elaborate

1839
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:09,519
yeah okay look your thoughts on bitcoin

1840
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,920
i um

1841
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:15,599
it's kind of funny um i i wrote

1842
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,000
i've been advocating some kind of

1843
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:20,798
digital currency for a long time and

1844
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,119
when the the uh

1845
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:26,239
when th when bitcoin came out and the

1846
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:28,880
original paper on on blockchain

1847
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:31,598
um my heart kind of sank because i

1848
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,599
thought oh my god we're applying all of

1849
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:36,400
this fancy thought and all these very

1850
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,400
careful distributed security measures to

1851
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,798
recreate the gold standard

1852
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,079
like it's just so retro it's so

1853
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:43,759
dysfunctional

1854
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,920
it's so useless from an economic point

1855
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,920
of view so it's always and then the

1856
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,318
other thing is using computational

1857
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,798
inefficiency at a boundless scale as

1858
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:54,880
your form of security is a crime against

1859
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:56,960
the atmosphere obviously a lot of people

1860
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,559
know that now but we knew that at the

1861
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,240
start like the thing is when the first

1862
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,519
paper came out i remember a lot of

1863
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:03,759
people saying oh my god i think this

1864
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:06,239
thing scales it's a carbon disaster you

1865
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:09,280
know and and um

1866
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:10,558
i i just like i'm just mystified but

1867
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,039
that that's a different question than

1868
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,839
when you asked can you have

1869
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,680
um a cryptographic currency or at least

1870
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:20,639
some kind of digital currency that's of

1871
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:21,598
a benefit and absolutely like i'm and

1872
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:23,358
there are people who are trying to be

1873
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,880
thoughtful about this you should uh if

1874
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:26,880
you haven't you should interview vitalik

1875
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,280
buter in some time yeah interviewed him

1876
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,559
twice okay so like there are people in

1877
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,760
the community who are trying to be

1878
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,920
thoughtful and trying to figure out how

1879
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,200
to do this better it has nice properties

1880
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,639
though right so the one of the nice

1881
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:38,879
problems is that like government

1882
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,879
centralized it's hard to control

1883
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,240
uh and then the other one to fix some of

1884
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,160
the issues that you're referring to i'm

1885
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,439
sort of playing devil's advocate here is

1886
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:48,719
you know there's lightning network

1887
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:50,400
there's ideas how to how you uh build

1888
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:52,798
stuff on top of bitcoin similar with

1889
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,599
gold that allow you to have this kind of

1890
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:57,280
vibrant economy that operates not on the

1891
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:00,880
blockchain but outside the blockchain

1892
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,400
and uses uh bitcoin for uh

1893
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,480
for like checking the security of those

1894
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,480
transactions so bitcoin's not new it's

1895
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,599
been around for a while i've been

1896
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:12,880
watching it closely i've not seen one

1897
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:14,318
example of it creating economic growth

1898
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,318
there was this obsession with the idea

1899
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:18,639
that government was the problem that

1900
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:21,279
idea that government's the problem let's

1901
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:22,719
say government earned that wrath

1902
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,798
honestly

1903
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,159
because if you look at some of the

1904
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:28,960
things that governments have done in

1905
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:29,920
recent decades it's not a pretty story

1906
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,679
like

1907
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,358
after

1908
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:36,000
after a very small number of people in

1909
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:37,358
the u.s government decided to bomb and

1910
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,199
land mine

1911
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:40,480
southeast asia

1912
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,719
it's hard to come back and say oh

1913
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,798
government's this great thing but

1914
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:47,279
uh then

1915
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:48,798
the problem is that this resistance to

1916
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,119
government

1917
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:52,318
is basically resistance to politics it's

1918
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,000
a way of saying

1919
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:55,920
if i can get rich nobody should bother

1920
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,760
me it's a way of not of not having

1921
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,639
obligations to others and that

1922
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,559
ultimately is a very suspect motivation

1923
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:06,558
but does that mean

1924
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:09,280
that the impulse that the government um

1925
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:12,079
should not overreach its power is flawed

1926
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,000
well i mean what i want to ask you to do

1927
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,519
is to replace the word government with

1928
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,480
politics

1929
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:20,000
like our politics is people having to

1930
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,920
deal with each other

1931
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,920
my theory about freedom

1932
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,400
is that the only authentic form of

1933
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,240
freedom is perpetual annoyance that

1934
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,079
all right so

1935
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:31,759
annoyance means you're actually dealing

1936
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,760
with people because people are annoying

1937
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,079
perpetual means that that annoyance is

1938
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,760
survivable so it doesn't destroy us all

1939
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,680
so if you have perpetual annoyance then

1940
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,119
you have freedom and that's politics

1941
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:42,798
that's politics if you don't have

1942
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,640
perpetual annoyance

1943
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,920
something's gone very wrong and you

1944
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:47,279
suppress those people it's only

1945
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,400
temporary it's going to come back and be

1946
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,119
horrible

1947
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,559
you should seek perpetual annoyance i'll

1948
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,760
invite you to a berkeley city council

1949
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:57,280
meeting so you can know what that feels

1950
01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:00,000
like what perfection feels like

1951
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,359
but anyway so freedom is being the the

1952
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,119
test of freedom is that you're annoyed

1953
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:05,038
by other people if you're not you're not

1954
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,480
free if you're not you're trapped in

1955
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,760
some temporary illusion that's going to

1956
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,000
fall apart

1957
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,760
now um the this quest to avoid

1958
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,679
government is really a quest to avoid

1959
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,000
that political feeling but you have to

1960
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,798
have it you have to deal with it

1961
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,719
um and it sucks but that's the human

1962
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:22,159
situation that's the human condition and

1963
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:24,000
this idea that we're going to have this

1964
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:25,920
abstract thing that protects us from

1965
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,199
having to deal with each other is always

1966
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,280
an illusion the idea and i apologize i

1967
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:32,318
uh overstretched the use of the word

1968
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,200
government

1969
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:37,279
the idea is there should be some

1970
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:39,519
punishment from the people

1971
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,200
when a group when a bureaucracy when a

1972
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:42,719
set of one instead of people or a

1973
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:45,279
particular leader like in an

1974
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,279
authoritarian regime which more than

1975
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,130
half the world currently lives under if

1976
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,359
you

1977
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:51,760
[Music]

1978
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:53,679
like if they become

1979
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,079
they start stop representing the people

1980
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:59,038
it stops being like a berkeley uh

1981
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:01,519
meeting and starts being more like uh

1982
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:04,480
like a dictatorial kind of uh situation

1983
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:05,679
and so the point is it it's nice to give

1984
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,880
people

1985
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:10,558
uh the populist in decentralized way

1986
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,680
power to

1987
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,319
um

1988
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:16,719
resist that kind of uh government

1989
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:18,719
becoming over yeah but people see this

1990
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:21,439
idea that the problem is always the

1991
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:23,439
government being powerful is false

1992
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,678
the problem can also be criminal gangs

1993
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:27,198
the problem can also be weird cults the

1994
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,199
problem can be

1995
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:33,439
abusive um

1996
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:35,198
abusive clergy the problem can be uh

1997
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:37,599
fault infrastructure that fails the

1998
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:40,079
problem can be poisoned water the

1999
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:43,120
problem can be failed electric grids the

2000
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:43,119
problem can be

2001
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:48,960
a crappy education system that makes

2002
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,520
this the whole society uh less and less

2003
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,279
able to to create value there are all

2004
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,880
these other problems that are different

2005
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,880
from an overbearing government like you

2006
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,640
have to keep some sense of perspective

2007
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,319
and not be obsessed with only one kind

2008
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:03,199
of problem because then the others will

2009
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:05,199
pop up but empirically speaking some

2010
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:06,879
problems are bigger than others

2011
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:08,000
so like some

2012
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,600
uh like

2013
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,158
groups of people like governments or

2014
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,880
gangs or companies leaders are you are

2015
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,719
you a u.s citizen yes has the government

2016
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,159
ever really been a problem for you well

2017
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,239
okay so first of all i grew up in the

2018
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:22,000
soviet union used to east well and

2019
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:25,439
actually yeah my wife did too

2020
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,880
yeah so i i have i have seen you know um

2021
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,879
sure uh

2022
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,239
and has the government bothered me i

2023
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,920
would say that

2024
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:34,000
uh that's that's a really complicated

2025
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,359
question especially because the united

2026
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,238
states is such

2027
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:40,400
it's a special place in like like like a

2028
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:42,718
lot of other countries my wife's family

2029
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:44,719
were refused next and so we have like a

2030
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:48,158
very and uh her dad was sent to the

2031
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:50,239
gulag uh for what it's worth uh on my

2032
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:53,039
father's side all but a few were killed

2033
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:57,039
by a pogrom in in uh

2034
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:59,119
a post-soviet program in ukraine

2035
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:01,359
so i i i would think because because you

2036
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:03,198
did a little trick of uh

2037
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:05,039
eloquent trick of language that you

2038
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:06,960
switch to the united states to talk

2039
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,079
about government so

2040
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,158
i am

2041
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:14,000
i'm i believe unlike my friend michael

2042
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:15,439
malus who's an anarchist i believe

2043
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,039
government can do a lot of good in the

2044
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:20,079
world that's exactly what you're saying

2045
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,760
which is it's it's politics the thing

2046
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:24,960
that bitcoin folks and cryptocurrency

2047
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,239
folks argue is that one of the big ways

2048
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,079
that governments can control the

2049
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:30,639
populace is centralized bank like

2050
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:33,039
control the the the money that was the

2051
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:36,000
case in the soviet union too there's

2052
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:37,679
you know uh inflation is can really make

2053
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,560
poor people

2054
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,440
suffer

2055
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,320
and

2056
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:46,559
so what they argue is this is one way to

2057
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:48,559
go around that power that government has

2058
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,640
of controlling the monetary system so

2059
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,679
that's a way to resist that's not

2060
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,719
actually

2061
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:57,279
saying government bad that's saying

2062
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,000
some of the ways that

2063
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:01,840
central banks get into trouble can be

2064
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,039
resisted through defense so let me ask

2065
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:07,600
you on balance today in the real world

2066
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:09,760
in terms of actual facts

2067
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,320
do you think cryptocurrencies are doing

2068
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:15,119
more to prop up corrupt murderous

2069
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:16,639
horrible regimes or to resist those

2070
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:19,760
regimes where do you think the balance

2071
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,440
is right now i i know exactly uh having

2072
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:24,000
talked to a lot of cryptocurrency folks

2073
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:25,678
what they would tell me right i

2074
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,238
it's hard it's

2075
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,920
i don't know no no no no i'm asking it

2076
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:31,678
as a real question there's no way to

2077
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,399
know the answer there's no way it can

2078
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,880
enhance it perfectly however i gotta say

2079
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:38,639
uh if you look at people who've been

2080
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,480
able to decode

2081
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,159
uh blockchains and they they do leak a

2082
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:43,519
lot of data they're not as secure as

2083
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:46,719
this widely thought

2084
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,800
there are a lot of unknown uh bitcoin

2085
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,679
whales from pretty early and they're

2086
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,880
huge and

2087
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:57,039
if you ask who are these people um

2088
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:59,039
there's evidence that a lot of them are

2089
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:02,158
quite on not the people you'd want to

2090
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:05,279
support let's say and i i just don't

2091
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:07,839
like i think empirically this idea

2092
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,759
that there's some intrinsic way that bad

2093
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,880
governments will

2094
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,640
be

2095
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,640
will will be

2096
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,679
disempowered and people will be able to

2097
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:19,119
resist them more then new villains or

2098
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:21,199
even villainous governments will be

2099
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:22,960
empowered there's no basis for that

2100
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:24,559
assertion it just is kind of

2101
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,760
circumstantial

2102
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,400
and

2103
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,560
i think in general

2104
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:32,799
bitcoin ownership

2105
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,280
is one thing but bitcoin transactions

2106
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,400
have tended to support criminality more

2107
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:38,158
than

2108
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:40,238
productivity of course they would argue

2109
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:42,559
that was that was the story of its early

2110
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:45,198
days that now more and more

2111
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,400
bitcoin is being used for uh legitimate

2112
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:48,079
transactions

2113
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:49,679
but that's the difference i didn't say

2114
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:52,479
for legitimate transactions i said for

2115
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,279
economic growth for for creativity like

2116
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,158
um

2117
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:58,399
i uh i think what's happening is people

2118
01:12:56,158 --> 01:13:01,119
are using it a little bit for

2119
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:03,119
for buying i don't know maybe somebody's

2120
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:04,640
companies make it available for this and

2121
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:07,359
that you buy a tesla with it or

2122
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:10,159
something yeah um

2123
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:11,599
investing in a startup hard

2124
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:13,839
it might have happened a little bit but

2125
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:16,079
it's it's not an engine of productivity

2126
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,400
creativity and economic growth

2127
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,158
whereas old-fashioned currency still is

2128
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:23,759
and

2129
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:26,079
uh anyway i'm look i think something

2130
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,000
i'm i'm pro the idea of digital

2131
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:30,079
currencies yeah

2132
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,520
i am anti

2133
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:32,960
the idea

2134
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,640
of

2135
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,600
economics

2136
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:39,360
wiping out politics as a result

2137
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,280
i think they have to exist in some

2138
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:42,319
balance to avoid the worst dysfunctions

2139
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,000
of each

2140
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:47,198
in some ways there's parallels to our

2141
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,800
discussion of algorithms and

2142
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:52,799
cryptocurrency is you're pro the idea

2143
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,920
but it can be used

2144
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,440
uh to manipulate you can use be used

2145
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,199
poorly by

2146
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:01,599
aforementioned humans

2147
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:04,479
well i think that you can make better

2148
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,440
designs and worse designs and i think

2149
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:07,759
and you know the thing about

2150
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,599
cryptocurrency that's so interesting

2151
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,880
is how many of us

2152
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,880
are

2153
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,960
responsible for the poor designs because

2154
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,359
we're all so hooked

2155
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:19,119
on that horatio alger story on like i'm

2156
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:20,719
gonna be the one who gets the viral

2157
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:22,079
benefit you know

2158
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,158
way back when all this stuff was

2159
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,679
starting i remember it would have been

2160
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:28,399
in the 80s somebody had the idea of

2161
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,600
using viral as a metaphor for network

2162
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:32,158
effect

2163
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,840
and the whole point was to talk about

2164
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:36,719
how bad network effect was that it

2165
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,400
always created distortions that ruined

2166
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,000
the the usefulness of economic

2167
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:43,359
incentives that

2168
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,439
that created dangerous distortions like

2169
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,960
but then somehow even after the pandemic

2170
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:48,479
we think of viral as this good thing

2171
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,239
because we imagine ourselves as the

2172
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:52,718
virus right we want to be on the on the

2173
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:54,479
beneficiary side of it but of course

2174
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:56,319
you're not likely to be

2175
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:59,198
there is a sense because money is

2176
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:02,319
involved people are not reasoning

2177
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:03,359
uh clearly always because they want to

2178
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:06,158
be

2179
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:08,079
they want to be part of that first viral

2180
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:11,279
wave that makes them rich and that

2181
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:13,439
blinds people from their basic morality

2182
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:15,039
i had an interesting conversation i

2183
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:17,039
don't i sort of feel like i should

2184
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:19,600
respect some people's privacy but some

2185
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:22,560
of the initial people who started uh

2186
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:26,159
bitcoin i i remember having an argument

2187
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,679
about like it's intrinsically a ponzi

2188
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:30,158
scheme like you know the early people

2189
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:32,560
have more than the later people and the

2190
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:34,799
further down the chain you get the more

2191
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,239
you're subject to gambling like dynamics

2192
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,440
where it's more and more random and more

2193
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:39,519
and more subject to weird network

2194
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:42,000
effects and whatnot unless you're a very

2195
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,679
small player uh perhaps and you're just

2196
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,359
buying something but even then you'll be

2197
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:48,079
subject to fluctuations because the

2198
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:50,238
whole thing is just kind of it like that

2199
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:52,800
as it fluctuates it's gonna wave around

2200
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:54,639
the little people more and

2201
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,320
they i remember the conversation turned

2202
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,719
to gambling because gambling's a pretty

2203
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:00,399
large economic sector and it's always

2204
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,399
struck me as being

2205
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:04,479
non-productive like somebody goes to las

2206
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:06,238
vegas and loses money and

2207
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,439
so one argument is well they got

2208
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:09,119
entertainment they paid for

2209
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:12,559
entertainment as they lost money so

2210
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:14,000
that's fine and the in las vegas does up

2211
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,920
the losing of money in an entertaining

2212
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,520
way so why not it's like going to a show

2213
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,119
so that's one argument

2214
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,719
the argument that was made to me was

2215
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:21,840
different from that it's that no what

2216
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,158
they're doing is they're getting a

2217
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,679
chance to experience hope and a lot of

2218
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:26,960
people don't get that chance and so

2219
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:28,399
that's really worth it even if they're

2220
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,840
going to lose they have that moment of

2221
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:31,119
hope and they need to be able to

2222
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,400
experience that

2223
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:36,800
and this is a very interesting argument

2224
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:37,519
um that's so heartbreaking because uh

2225
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,679
well

2226
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,600
i've seen it but i've seen that like

2227
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,279
that i have that a little bit of a sense

2228
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,840
i've talked to some young people who

2229
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:46,880
invest in cryptocurrency

2230
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,800
and it

2231
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,400
what i see is this hope this is the

2232
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,880
first thing that gave him hope and

2233
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:55,839
that's so heartbreaking to me

2234
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:58,400
that you've gotten hope from the so much

2235
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:00,400
is invested it's like hope from

2236
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:03,359
somehow becoming rich as opposed to

2237
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:06,000
something to me i apologize but money

2238
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:08,238
is in the long term not going to be a

2239
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,399
source of that deep meaning it's good to

2240
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:12,000
have enough money but it should not be

2241
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:13,439
the source of hope

2242
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,158
and it's heartbreaking to me how many

2243
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:18,238
people is the source of hope

2244
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:20,238
yeah um

2245
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:23,359
you've just described the psychology of

2246
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:25,919
virality or the psychology of

2247
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:27,920
of trying to base a civilization on

2248
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,199
semi-random occurrences of network

2249
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,640
effect peaks

2250
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:32,799
yeah and

2251
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,560
it doesn't really work i mean i think we

2252
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,400
need to get away from that we need to

2253
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,000
soften those peaks

2254
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:39,839
um

2255
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,760
and accept microsoft which deserves

2256
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,840
every penny but in every other case

2257
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,960
well you mentioned

2258
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:47,600
github i think what microsoft did with

2259
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:50,319
github was brilliant i i was very

2260
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,560
okay uh if i can give a uh

2261
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,158
not a critical but sure

2262
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,960
on microsoft

2263
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:59,759
because they recently purchased bethesda

2264
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,760
so elder scrolls is in their hands

2265
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,719
i'm watching you microsoft did not screw

2266
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,960
up my favorite game so um yeah

2267
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,719
look i'm i'm not speaking for microsoft

2268
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,480
i haven't i have an explicit arrangement

2269
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,079
with them where i don't speak for them

2270
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,678
obviously like that should be very clear

2271
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:17,439
i do not speak for them

2272
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:20,560
um i i am not saying um i like them i

2273
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:22,399
think such is amazing um

2274
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,600
the term data dignity was coined by

2275
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:25,439
sacha

2276
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,199
like so you know we have

2277
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:29,279
uh it's it's kind of extraordinary but

2278
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:30,639
you know microsoft's this giant thing

2279
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:32,559
it's going to screw up this or that you

2280
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,880
know it's not it's not

2281
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,880
i don't know it's kind of interesting

2282
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,319
i've had a few occasions in my life to

2283
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,760
see how things

2284
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:41,359
work from the inside of some big thing

2285
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,480
and you know it's always just people

2286
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:44,000
kind of

2287
01:18:42,479 --> 01:18:46,158
it it's

2288
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,719
i don't know there's always like

2289
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:50,719
coordination problems and there's also

2290
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,000
there's always there's human problems oh

2291
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:54,000
there's some good people there's some

2292
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,158
bad people it's always i hope microsoft

2293
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,920
doesn't screw up

2294
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:59,920
and i hope they bring cliffy back you

2295
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:02,399
should never kill clippy bring clippy

2296
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,840
back oh clippy but clippy pronounced the

2297
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:05,439
myth of a.i

2298
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,840
well that's why this how about i think

2299
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:09,519
you're wrong how about if we all right

2300
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,159
could we bring back bob instead of

2301
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:14,080
clippy which one was bob oh bob was

2302
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:15,839
another thing like bob was this other

2303
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:18,158
screen character who was supposed to be

2304
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,239
the voice of ai cortana cortana with

2305
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:22,799
cortana dude for you cortana is too

2306
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:24,158
corporate

2307
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,079
i like it

2308
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:27,599
there's a there's a woman in seattle

2309
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:29,439
who's like the model for cortana did

2310
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,440
cortana's voice and was it there was

2311
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:33,839
like no the way this is great we had a

2312
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:35,839
vis we had her as a she used to walk

2313
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,039
around and if you were wearing hololens

2314
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,039
for a bit i don't think that's happening

2315
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:40,960
anymore i think i don't think you should

2316
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:42,880
turn a software software into a creature

2317
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,039
i think well you you and i yeah just get

2318
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,960
a camera tonight you and i well get go

2319
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:47,840
get a dog get a dog

2320
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,640
yeah

2321
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:54,319
yeah you're a hedgehog yeah hedgehog

2322
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,920
yeah i you co-authored a paper you

2323
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:57,479
mentioned lee smolin

2324
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,079
uh titled the

2325
01:19:57,479 --> 01:20:02,000
autodidactic universe

2326
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:05,840
which describes our universe as one that

2327
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,840
learns its own physical laws

2328
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:09,519
that's a trippy and beautiful and

2329
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,439
powerful idea

2330
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,080
what are what would you say are the key

2331
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,759
ideas in this paper ah okay well i

2332
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:18,639
should say uh

2333
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,880
that paper reflected work from last year

2334
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:22,800
and the project the program has moved

2335
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,239
quite a lot so it's a little there's a

2336
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,840
lot of stuff that's not published that

2337
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:29,439
i'm quite excited about so i have to

2338
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:31,039
kind of keep my frame in that in that uh

2339
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:33,759
last year's thing so i have to try to be

2340
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:35,279
a little careful about that

2341
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,199
we can think about it in a few different

2342
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:39,679
ways um

2343
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:43,759
the core of the paper the the technical

2344
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:45,920
core of it is a triple correspondence

2345
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,679
one part of it was

2346
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,319
already established and then another

2347
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:52,319
part is in the process the part that was

2348
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:54,238
established was

2349
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:57,279
of course understanding different

2350
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:58,479
theories of physics as matrix models the

2351
01:20:57,279 --> 01:20:59,759
part that

2352
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:01,759
was uh

2353
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,600
fresher is understanding those as a

2354
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,520
machining machine learning system so

2355
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:08,239
that we could move fluidly between these

2356
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:10,800
different ways of describing systems and

2357
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:15,119
the reason to want to do that is to just

2358
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:15,119
have more tools and more options because

2359
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:19,919
uh well theoretical physics is really

2360
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:21,599
hard and a lot of programs have kind of

2361
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,000
um

2362
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,079
run into a state where they feel a

2363
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,279
little stalled i guess i can i i want to

2364
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:28,880
be delicate about this because i'm not a

2365
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:30,319
physicist i'm the computer scientist

2366
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,400
collaborating so

2367
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:34,559
um i don't mean to diss anybody's so

2368
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:36,960
this is almost like gives a framework

2369
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,960
for generating new ideas in physics as

2370
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,800
you as we start to publish more about

2371
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:43,439
where it's gone i think you'll start to

2372
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,679
see there's there's tools

2373
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:47,759
and ways of thinking about

2374
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:51,039
theories that

2375
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:53,440
i think open up some new paths uh that

2376
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:55,119
that will be of interest um

2377
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:56,479
there's the technical core of it which

2378
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:58,719
is this idea this idea of a

2379
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:00,879
correspondence to give you more facility

2380
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:03,198
but then there's also the storytelling

2381
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,480
part of it and this is something

2382
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:07,839
um

2383
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:10,879
lee loves stories and i do and the idea

2384
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:13,600
here is that

2385
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:16,480
a typical

2386
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:18,239
way of thinking about physics is that

2387
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:19,759
there's some kind of starting condition

2388
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:20,879
and then there's some principle by which

2389
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,280
the starting

2390
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,520
condition evolves

2391
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:28,399
uh and the question is like why the

2392
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:30,159
starting condition like how how

2393
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:32,479
oh the starting condition has to get

2394
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:33,839
kind of per this has to be fine-tuned

2395
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:34,879
and all these things about it have to be

2396
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,960
kind of

2397
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,800
perfect and so we were thinking well

2398
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,960
look what if

2399
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,320
we could push the storytelling about

2400
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,560
where the universe comes from much

2401
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:46,479
further back by starting with really

2402
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,760
simple things that evolve and then

2403
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:49,119
through that evolution explain how

2404
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,239
things got to be how they are through

2405
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:54,800
very simple principles right and so

2406
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:57,039
we've been um exploring a variety of

2407
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,440
ways to push the the start of the

2408
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:02,399
storytelling further and further back

2409
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:03,839
which um and it's an interesting

2410
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:04,879
it's really kind of interesting because

2411
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:08,319
like uh

2412
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:10,560
um for all of his lee is uh sometimes

2413
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:11,359
considered to be

2414
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,120
uh

2415
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:15,039
to have a radical quality in the physics

2416
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:17,519
world but um

2417
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:19,600
uh he still is like no this is gonna be

2418
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,440
like the kind of time we're talking

2419
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,960
about in which evolution happens is the

2420
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:24,960
same time we're now and we're talking

2421
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,560
about something that starts

2422
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,639
and continues and i'm like well what if

2423
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,320
there's some other kind of time that's

2424
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,840
time-like and well that sounds like

2425
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:34,559
metaphysics but

2426
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,639
there's an ambiguity you know like

2427
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,320
it has to start from something and uh

2428
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:40,560
it's kind of an interesting so there's

2429
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:42,079
this uh

2430
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,000
a lot of the math can be thought of

2431
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:46,000
either way which is kind of interesting

2432
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,520
so it pushes so far back that basically

2433
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,039
all the things we take for granted and

2434
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,320
physics start becoming and emerge

2435
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:54,158
i really want to emphasize it's all

2436
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:56,559
super baby steps i don't want to over

2437
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:58,158
claim it's like it's i i think a lot of

2438
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,159
the things we're doing we're approaching

2439
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:03,198
some old problems in a in a pretty fresh

2440
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:04,879
way informed there's been a zillion

2441
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:06,559
papers about how you can think of the

2442
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,199
universe as a big neural net or how you

2443
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:11,120
can think of different ideas in physics

2444
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:13,039
as being quite similar to or even

2445
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:15,359
equivalent to some of the ideas in

2446
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:17,039
machine learning

2447
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:18,880
and uh

2448
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:21,039
that actually works out crazy well like

2449
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,960
i mean it that is actually kind of eerie

2450
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:24,800
when you look at it like uh

2451
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,399
there's probably

2452
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,239
two or three dozen papers that have this

2453
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:30,479
quality and some of them are just crazy

2454
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:32,479
good and it's very it's very interesting

2455
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:34,079
what we're trying to do is is

2456
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:35,759
take those kinds of observations and

2457
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:38,319
turn them into an actionable framework

2458
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,679
where you can then start to

2459
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:40,719
do things with landscapes or theories

2460
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,480
that you couldn't do before and that

2461
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:44,399
sort of thing

2462
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:46,959
so in that context

2463
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:49,519
or maybe beyond uh how do you explain us

2464
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:52,480
humans how unlikely are we this

2465
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:54,400
intelligent civilization or is there a

2466
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:56,879
lot of others or are we alone in this

2467
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:56,879
universe

2468
01:24:57,279 --> 01:24:59,840
yeah

2469
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:06,560
you seem to appreciate humans very much

2470
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:06,559
i've grown fond of us

2471
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:12,960
um whatever there are nice qualities

2472
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,279
um

2473
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,359
and like i like that i mean we're kind

2474
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:19,039
of weird we sprout this hair on our

2475
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,119
heads and then i don't know we're sort

2476
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:22,399
of weird animals that's the feature not

2477
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:23,760
a bug i think

2478
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:26,399
the weirdness

2479
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:28,079
i hope so i hope so

2480
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:30,319
um

2481
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:30,319
i

2482
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:36,639
i think if i'm just going to answer you

2483
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,560
in terms of um truth the first thing i'd

2484
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:40,719
say is we're not we're not

2485
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:43,280
in a privileged enough position

2486
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:44,960
at least as yet to really know much

2487
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:47,439
about

2488
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,960
who we are how we are

2489
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:51,119
what we're really like in the context of

2490
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,560
something larger what that context is

2491
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:54,000
like all that stuff

2492
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,360
we might learn more in the future our

2493
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,679
descendants might learn more but we

2494
01:25:55,359 --> 01:26:00,000
don't really know very much yeah which

2495
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:01,520
you can either view as frustrating or

2496
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,880
charming like that first year of tick

2497
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,000
tock or something

2498
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,079
um

2499
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:09,119
but all roads lead back to tig talk i

2500
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:11,039
like it well lately uh but but in terms

2501
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:14,479
of there's another level at which i can

2502
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:14,479
think about it where

2503
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,520
i sometimes think that

2504
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,840
if you

2505
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,360
are just

2506
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,679
quiet and you do something that gets you

2507
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:28,079
in touch with the way reality happens

2508
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:29,199
and for me it's playing music

2509
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:31,679
sometimes

2510
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:34,399
it seems like you can feel a bit of how

2511
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:36,079
the universe is and it feels like

2512
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:38,000
there's a lot more going on in it and

2513
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:39,519
there is a lot more life and a lot more

2514
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,039
stuff happening

2515
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,159
and a lot more stuff flowing through i

2516
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:44,719
don't know i'm not speaking as a

2517
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:47,519
scientist now this is kind of a more

2518
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:49,520
my artist's side talking and it's uh

2519
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,679
uh so i feel like i'm suddenly in

2520
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:54,719
multiple personalities with you but well

2521
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:57,440
uh kerouac jack kerouac said that uh

2522
01:26:54,719 --> 01:27:00,000
music is the only truth

2523
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:02,399
what do you uh it sounds like you might

2524
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,600
be at least in part there's a there's a

2525
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:07,359
passage in kerouac's book dr sachs where

2526
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,960
somebody tries to just explain the whole

2527
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:10,719
situation with reality and people in

2528
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,880
like a paragraph and i i couldn't

2529
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,800
reproduce it for you here but it's like

2530
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,000
yeah like there are these bulbous things

2531
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,520
that walk around and they make these

2532
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,719
sounds you can sort of understand them

2533
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,639
but only kind of and then there's like

2534
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:23,840
this it's just like this amazing like

2535
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:25,520
just really quick like if if some

2536
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,719
spirit being or something was gonna show

2537
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,320
up in our reality and hadn't knew

2538
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:29,920
nothing about it it's like a little

2539
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:31,119
basic intro like okay here's what's

2540
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:33,920
going on here

2541
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:36,639
an incredible passage yeah yeah it's

2542
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,880
like a one or two sentence summary uh

2543
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:42,000
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy right

2544
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,920
of what this uh mostly harmless mostly

2545
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,238
harmless yeah do you think there's truth

2546
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:48,880
to that that uh music somehow connects

2547
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:51,039
something that words cannot

2548
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:54,719
yeah music is something that

2549
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:57,359
just towers above me i don't i don't

2550
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:59,279
i don't feel like i have an overview of

2551
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:01,599
it it's just the reverse i don't i don't

2552
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:03,519
fully understand it because on one level

2553
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,480
it's simple like you can say oh it's

2554
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,880
it's

2555
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:08,959
a thing people evolved to coordinate our

2556
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:11,039
brains on a

2557
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,319
pattern level or

2558
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:14,399
or something like that there's all these

2559
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:16,799
things you can say about music which you

2560
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:18,799
know some of that's probably true

2561
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,960
it's

2562
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:24,239
also

2563
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,239
there's kind of like this

2564
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,199
this is the mystery of meaning like

2565
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:31,199
there's a way that just

2566
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:33,158
instead of just being pure abstraction

2567
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:35,198
music can have like this kind of

2568
01:28:33,158 --> 01:28:39,599
substantiality to it

2569
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:39,599
that is philosophically impossible

2570
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,920
i don't know what to do with it yeah the

2571
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,119
amount of understanding i feel i have

2572
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,719
when i

2573
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:48,158
hear the right song

2574
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:50,639
at the right time

2575
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:53,519
is not comparable to

2576
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:55,440
anything i can read on wikipedia

2577
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,520
anything i can understand

2578
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:59,599
read through in language there's the

2579
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,239
music does connect us to something

2580
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,639
there's this thing there yeah there's

2581
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:06,879
there's there's some kind of a thing in

2582
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:09,760
it and i've never ever

2583
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:12,159
i i've run across a lot of explanations

2584
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:15,360
from all kinds of interesting people uh

2585
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:17,279
like that it's some kind of uh

2586
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:19,039
a flow language between people or

2587
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:20,880
between people and how they perceive and

2588
01:29:19,039 --> 01:29:22,238
and that kind of thing there's

2589
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,960
and and that

2590
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:28,000
sort of explanation is fine but it's not

2591
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:30,000
it's not quite it either yeah there's a

2592
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,399
there's something about music that makes

2593
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
me uh believe that pan psychism could

2594
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:35,679
possibly be true

2595
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,520
which is uh that everything in the

2596
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:42,880
universe is conscious it makes me think

2597
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:45,679
makes me be humble in how

2598
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:48,159
much or how little i understand about

2599
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:50,480
the functions of our universe

2600
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:53,439
that everything might be conscious

2601
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:56,959
most people um interested in theoretical

2602
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,919
physics eventually land in pan psychism

2603
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:01,279
um

2604
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:03,760
but i i'm not one of them i uh

2605
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:06,719
i still think there's this um

2606
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,760
pragmatic imperative to

2607
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:09,760
uh

2608
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,840
treat people is special so i will

2609
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:14,480
proudly be a dualist

2610
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,480
sure uh without people on cats people

2611
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,718
and cats yeah i'm not i'm not

2612
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:20,479
i'm not quite sure where to draw the

2613
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,158
line or why the line's there or anything

2614
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:24,158
like that but i don't think i should be

2615
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:26,399
required to all the same questions are

2616
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:28,158
equally mysterious for no line so i

2617
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:31,039
don't i'm not i don't feel disadvantaged

2618
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:33,039
by that so i shall remain a duelist but

2619
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:36,079
if you

2620
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:38,238
listen to anyone trying to explain

2621
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:40,399
where consciousness is in a dualistic

2622
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:42,238
sense either believing in souls or some

2623
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,599
special thing in the brain or something

2624
01:30:42,238 --> 01:30:47,479
you pretty much say

2625
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:47,480
screw this i'm going to be advanced

2626
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:54,960
fair enough

2627
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:55,840
is there moments in your life that

2628
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,800
happen

2629
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,400
that we're defining in the way that

2630
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,480
you hope others your daughter well

2631
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:05,198
listen i gotta say

2632
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:07,599
the moments that defined me were not the

2633
01:31:05,198 --> 01:31:10,000
good ones the moments that defined me

2634
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:11,199
were often horrible

2635
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,600
um

2636
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:15,919
i um i've had

2637
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,760
successes you know but if you ask what

2638
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,440
defined me

2639
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,760
my mother's death

2640
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:21,759
um

2641
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:27,198
being under the world trade center in

2642
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:27,198
the attack

2643
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:32,079
the things that the things that have had

2644
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:34,399
an effect on me were the most were sort

2645
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:36,479
of real world

2646
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:38,000
terrible things which i don't wish on

2647
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:40,799
young people at all

2648
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,639
um and this is this is the thing that's

2649
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,719
hard about giving advice to young people

2650
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:48,319
that

2651
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:49,520
they have to learn their own lessons

2652
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:52,880
and

2653
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:54,719
lessons don't come easily

2654
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:57,199
and a world

2655
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,279
which avoids hard lessons is will be a

2656
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:01,039
stupid world you know and i i don't know

2657
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:03,679
what to do with it that's a that's a

2658
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:05,840
little bundle of truth that has a bit of

2659
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,719
a fatalistic quality to it but i don't i

2660
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,079
don't

2661
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:09,840
this is like what i'm saying that you

2662
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:11,439
know freedom equals eternal annoyance

2663
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,039
like you can't

2664
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:15,359
like

2665
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:16,639
um there's a degree to which honest

2666
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:18,319
advice

2667
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,319
is

2668
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:21,198
not that pleasant to give

2669
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:23,519
and

2670
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:26,479
i i don't want young people to have to

2671
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:28,159
know about everything i think you don't

2672
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:31,759
want to wish hardship on them yeah i

2673
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:34,158
think they they deserve to have

2674
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,639
a little grace period of naivete that's

2675
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:39,439
pleasant i i mean i i do you know if

2676
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:41,600
it's possible if it's

2677
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:44,000
ah these things are this is like this is

2678
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:46,960
tricky stuff i mean um

2679
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,960
if you if you

2680
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:54,000
okay so let me let me try a little bit

2681
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:55,920
on this advice thing i think one thing

2682
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,600
any serious broad advice will have been

2683
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,239
given a thousand times before for a

2684
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:03,840
thousand years so this i'm not gonna

2685
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:06,839
i'm not going to claim originality but

2686
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:10,480
i think trying to find a

2687
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:13,119
way to really pay attention

2688
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:14,718
to what you're feeling fundamentally

2689
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:16,719
what your sense of the world is what

2690
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:20,239
your intuition is if you feel like an

2691
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:20,239
intuitive person what you're

2692
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,800
um

2693
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,120
like like to try to

2694
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,600
escape the constant sway of social

2695
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:31,439
perception or manipulation whatever you

2696
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:34,079
wish not to escape it entirely that

2697
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:37,359
would be horrible but to to find

2698
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:39,920
to find cover from it once in a while

2699
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:41,039
to find a sense of being anchored in

2700
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,359
that

2701
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:45,760
to believe and experience as a real

2702
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:47,759
thing believing in experience as a real

2703
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:50,639
thing is very dualistic that goes in

2704
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,719
that goes with my philosophy of dualism

2705
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:54,800
i believe there's something magical and

2706
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,800
i instead of squirting the magic dust on

2707
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,239
the programs i think

2708
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,320
experience is something real and

2709
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:02,238
something apart something mystical and

2710
01:34:00,319 --> 01:34:04,559
your own personal

2711
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:06,559
internal experience that you just have

2712
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,159
and then you're saying yeah silence the

2713
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,520
rest of the world enough to hear that

2714
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:11,519
like whatever that

2715
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,440
magic just yeah and that experience find

2716
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,520
with with what is there

2717
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:18,079
and um

2718
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:19,520
i think uh that's one that's one thing

2719
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:22,158
another thing

2720
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:23,760
is to recognize

2721
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:25,359
that kindness

2722
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,039
requires genius that it's actually

2723
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:30,000
really hard

2724
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:32,158
that facile kindness is not kindness and

2725
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,279
that it'll take you a while to have the

2726
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:35,519
skills

2727
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:37,359
to have kind impulses to want to be kind

2728
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,920
you can have right away

2729
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:42,319
to be effectively kind is hard

2730
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:44,560
to be effectively kind it takes it takes

2731
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:47,519
skill it takes

2732
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:49,600
it takes hard lessons

2733
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:52,320
um

2734
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,760
it's it's uh you'll never be perfect at

2735
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,439
it

2736
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,840
to the degree you get anywhere with it

2737
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:00,559
it's the most rewarding thing ever

2738
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:04,560
um

2739
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:04,560
uh let's see what else would i say

2740
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:11,880
i would say um when you're young

2741
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:11,880
you can be very overwhelmed

2742
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:18,719
by social and interpersonal emotions

2743
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:21,440
you'll have

2744
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:23,279
broken hearts and jealousies you'll feel

2745
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:25,759
socially

2746
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:28,079
down the ladder instead of up the ladder

2747
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,360
it feels horrible when that happens all

2748
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:32,559
of these things

2749
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:35,439
and you have to remember

2750
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:37,039
what a fragile crust all that stuff is

2751
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:41,158
and it's hard because right when it's

2752
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:41,158
happening it's just so intense

2753
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:45,359
and

2754
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,359
if i was actually giving this advice to

2755
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:51,440
my daughter she'd already be out of the

2756
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:53,359
room

2757
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:56,000
so i'm just this is for some like

2758
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:57,759
hypothetical yeah teenager that doesn't

2759
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,520
really exist that really wants to sit

2760
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,760
and and listen to my wife or your

2761
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:04,080
daughter ten years from now

2762
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:04,079
maybe

2763
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:11,519
a difficult question yeah sure you uh

2764
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:12,880
you talked about losing your mom yeah

2765
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,960
uh do you

2766
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,560
do you miss her

2767
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:19,118
yeah i mean i still connected her

2768
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,480
through music she was a

2769
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:22,158
she was a

2770
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:23,359
young prodigy

2771
01:36:22,158 --> 01:36:26,559
piano

2772
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:29,039
player in vienna and uh she survived the

2773
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,960
concentration camp and then died in a

2774
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:33,600
car accident

2775
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:35,679
here in the us

2776
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,639
what music makes you think of her is

2777
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:38,158
there

2778
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:40,800
is there a song

2779
01:36:38,158 --> 01:36:42,960
well she you know she was in vienna so

2780
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:45,440
she's she

2781
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:48,239
had the whole viennese

2782
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:51,279
music thing going um

2783
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:53,359
which is this you know incredible school

2784
01:36:51,279 --> 01:36:55,599
of uh

2785
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:58,079
absolute skill and romance bundled

2786
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:00,400
together and uh wonderful on the piano

2787
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:01,920
especially i learned to play the some of

2788
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:04,158
the beethoven sonatas for her and i

2789
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:06,800
played them in this exaggerated drippy

2790
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:08,799
way i remember when i was a kid and uh

2791
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,960
exaggerating meaning uh too full of

2792
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,560
emotion yeah like just like

2793
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:14,000
it's just it's not the only way to play

2794
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,760
beethoven i mean i would i didn't know

2795
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,679
there's anything that's a reasonable

2796
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,079
question i mean the fashion these days

2797
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:21,840
is to be slightly apollonian with even

2798
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:23,439
with beethoven but

2799
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,440
one imagines that

2800
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:28,399
actual beethoven playing might have been

2801
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:30,399
different i don't know i um

2802
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:31,920
i've gotten to play a few instruments he

2803
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:33,118
played and tried to see if i could feel

2804
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,960
anything about how it might have been

2805
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:36,960
for him i don't know really

2806
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:39,279
i was always against the clinical

2807
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,399
precision of classical music

2808
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:43,599
i thought

2809
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:46,158
a great piano player should be um

2810
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,400
like um

2811
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:53,039
in in pain like

2812
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:55,599
you know like emote emotion emotionally

2813
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:58,800
like truly feel the music and and make

2814
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:00,880
it messy sort of sure um maybe play

2815
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:03,840
classical music the way i don't know

2816
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:05,359
blues pianist plays blues

2817
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,840
like

2818
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:09,359
it seems like they actually got happier

2819
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,199
and i'm not sure if beethoven got

2820
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:12,719
happier i think it's a different i think

2821
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:16,638
it's a different

2822
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:16,639
kind of concept of the place of music

2823
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:21,039
i think the uh

2824
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:24,479
the blues the whole african-american

2825
01:38:21,039 --> 01:38:26,079
tradition was initially surviving awful

2826
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:27,359
awful circumstances so you could say you

2827
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:30,479
know there was some of that in the

2828
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:31,519
concentration camps and all that too um

2829
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:32,959
and

2830
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,040
it's it's not that beethoven's

2831
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:37,679
circumstances were brilliant but he kind

2832
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:37,679
of also

2833
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,039
i don't know this is hard like i mean it

2834
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:45,119
would seem to be his misery was somewhat

2835
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:46,639
self-imposed maybe through i don't i

2836
01:38:45,118 --> 01:38:48,479
don't know it's kind of interesting like

2837
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:51,039
um i've known some people who loathed

2838
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:53,118
beethoven like uh the composer uh late

2839
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:54,880
composer pauline oliveros this wonderful

2840
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:57,279
modernist composer i played in a in her

2841
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,800
band for a while and she was like oh

2842
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:01,759
beethoven like that's the worst music

2843
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:04,880
ever it's like all ego it completely it

2844
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:08,159
turns um it turns information and i mean

2845
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:10,800
it turns emotion into your enemy and

2846
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:12,319
it's uh it's ultimately um all about

2847
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,000
your own self-importance which is all

2848
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:16,158
which has to be at the expense of others

2849
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,479
could what else what else could it be

2850
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:19,519
and uh blah blah blah so she had i

2851
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:20,879
shouldn't say i don't mean to be

2852
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,639
dismissed but i'm just saying like her

2853
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,440
position on beethoven

2854
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:27,039
was very negative and very unimpressed

2855
01:39:25,439 --> 01:39:28,559
which is really interesting for the man

2856
01:39:27,039 --> 01:39:30,560
or the music

2857
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,760
i think uh i don't know i mean he's not

2858
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,119
here to speak for herself so it's a

2859
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:35,199
little hard for me to answer that

2860
01:39:33,118 --> 01:39:36,238
question i'm um but it was interesting

2861
01:39:35,198 --> 01:39:37,919
because i'd always thought it paid homes

2862
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:40,479
like oh you know this is like you know

2863
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:43,118
it is like really the the the dude you

2864
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:44,559
know and she's like yeah you know

2865
01:39:43,118 --> 01:39:46,158
beethoven schmidt oven you know it's

2866
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,159
like not really happening yeah i still

2867
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:49,920
even though it's cliche i like playing

2868
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:52,000
uh personally just for myself mulan

2869
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:55,840
sonata i mean i just

2870
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:58,079
um moonlight's amazing you know um

2871
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,079
i

2872
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,320
you know you're talking about comparing

2873
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:04,159
the blues and that sensibility from

2874
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:06,479
europe it's so diff so different in so

2875
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:08,158
many ways i one of the musicians i play

2876
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:10,879
with is uh john bautiste who has the

2877
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:12,238
band on on colbert show and uh he'll

2878
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,679
he'll sit there playing jazz and

2879
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:16,319
suddenly go into moonlight he loves

2880
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:18,480
moonlight and what's kind of interesting

2881
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:18,479
is

2882
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:23,359
he's found a way to do beethoven and he

2883
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,920
by the way he can really do beethoven

2884
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:27,599
like he uh he went through juilliard and

2885
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,118
one time you know what what time he's at

2886
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,560
my house he's saying hey do you have the

2887
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:31,759
book of beethoven's house to say yeah i

2888
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,440
want to find one i haven't played any

2889
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:35,360
sight read through the whole damn thing

2890
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:36,960
perfectly and i'm like oh god i just

2891
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:40,399
yeah get out of here i don't i can't

2892
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,399
even deal with this but anyway

2893
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,639
yeah but anyway the thing is he he has

2894
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:46,238
this way

2895
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:48,639
of with the same persona and the same

2896
01:40:46,238 --> 01:40:50,479
philosophy moving from the blues and to

2897
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:53,679
beethoven that's really really

2898
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:55,839
fascinating to me it's like um

2899
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:58,480
i don't want to say he plays it as if it

2900
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:00,560
were jazz but he kind of does yeah it's

2901
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:01,919
kind of really and he talks he'll well

2902
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,600
he was sight reasoning he talks like

2903
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,279
beethoven's talking to him like he's

2904
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,360
like oh yeah i hear he's doing this he's

2905
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:09,118
i can't do john but you know it's like

2906
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:11,039
it's really it's really interesting like

2907
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:12,719
it's very different like for me

2908
01:41:11,039 --> 01:41:14,560
i was introduced to beethoven as like

2909
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:16,880
almost like this god-like figure figure

2910
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,159
and i presume pauline was too that was

2911
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,920
really kind of oppressed and hard to

2912
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:21,279
deal with and for him it's just like

2913
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,359
it's a conversation

2914
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:24,639
he's playing uh james p johnson or

2915
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:26,158
something it's like another musician who

2916
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:27,920
did something and they're talking and

2917
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:29,039
it's it's very cool to be around it's

2918
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,239
very uh

2919
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:32,639
kind of uh

2920
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:34,959
freeing to see someone have that that

2921
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,639
abil that that relationship i would love

2922
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:39,520
to hear him play bad horn that sounds

2923
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:42,079
that sounds amazing he's great

2924
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:44,080
we talked about ernest becker

2925
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:46,639
and uh the the

2926
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:47,760
how much value he puts on our mortality

2927
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:50,400
and

2928
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:52,480
our denial of our mortality do you think

2929
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:54,879
about your mortality do you think about

2930
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:56,799
your own death you know what's funny is

2931
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,400
i used to not be able to but as you get

2932
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,159
older you just know people who die and

2933
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:04,079
there's all these things it just becomes

2934
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:06,638
familiar and and more of a

2935
01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:07,920
more ordinary which is what it is

2936
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:09,440
but

2937
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,880
are you afraid

2938
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:13,759
um sure

2939
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:14,560
although less so

2940
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,560
um

2941
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:18,159
and it's not like i didn't have some

2942
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,080
kind of

2943
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:22,479
insight or revelation to become less

2944
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:25,519
afraid i think i just

2945
01:42:22,479 --> 01:42:27,439
like i say it's kind of familiarity

2946
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,119
it's just knowing people who who have

2947
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:30,960
died and

2948
01:42:29,118 --> 01:42:35,118
i really believe

2949
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:37,359
in the future i have this optimism that

2950
01:42:35,118 --> 01:42:38,639
people or this whole thing of life on

2951
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:40,479
earth this whole thing we're part of i

2952
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:43,118
don't know where to draw that circle but

2953
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:47,039
this thing is

2954
01:42:43,118 --> 01:42:47,039
going somewhere and has some kind of

2955
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:51,439
value and

2956
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:52,879
you can't both believe in the future and

2957
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:55,279
want to live forever you have to make

2958
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:57,600
room for it you know like you have to

2959
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:59,279
that optimism has to also come with its

2960
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,840
own like humility you have to make

2961
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:04,399
yourself small to believe in the future

2962
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:06,960
and so it actually in a funny way

2963
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:10,638
comforts me

2964
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:12,480
wow that's powerful

2965
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:14,960
and optimism

2966
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:16,638
requires you to kind of step down after

2967
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:19,039
time

2968
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:21,679
yeah i mean and that said life seems

2969
01:43:19,039 --> 01:43:23,198
kind of short but you know whatever

2970
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:24,719
do you think there i've tried to find i

2971
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:26,479
can't find the complaint department you

2972
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,239
know i really want to i want to bring

2973
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:30,319
this up but the customer service number

2974
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:31,519
never answers and like the email bounces

2975
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:33,759
one way

2976
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:35,119
uh do you think there's meaning to it

2977
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:36,960
to life

2978
01:43:35,118 --> 01:43:38,880
ah well see um

2979
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,079
meaning's a funny word like we say all

2980
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,359
these things as if we know what they

2981
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:42,719
mean but meaning

2982
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:45,359
we don't know what we mean when we say

2983
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:48,158
meaning like we obviously do not and uh

2984
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:49,920
it's a it's it's a funny little mystical

2985
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:52,559
thing i think it ultimately connects to

2986
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:55,039
that sense of experience that dualists

2987
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,159
uh tend to believe in

2988
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:58,079
um

2989
01:43:56,158 --> 01:44:00,399
because there are why like if you look

2990
01:43:58,079 --> 01:44:02,800
up to the stars and you experience that

2991
01:44:00,399 --> 01:44:04,960
awe inspiring like joy

2992
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,719
whatever

2993
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:08,800
when you look up to the stars i i don't

2994
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:09,679
know like for me this kind of makes me

2995
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,920
feel

2996
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:14,960
uh joyful maybe a little bit melancholy

2997
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:17,039
just some weird soup of feelings

2998
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:21,840
and ultimately the question is like why

2999
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:21,840
are we here in this vast universe

3000
01:44:22,079 --> 01:44:25,118
that question why

3001
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:30,239
have you been able in some way

3002
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:33,238
maybe through music answer it for

3003
01:44:30,238 --> 01:44:33,238
yourself

3004
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:42,079
my impulse

3005
01:44:40,158 --> 01:44:44,960
is to feel like it's not quite the right

3006
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:46,719
question to ask but i feel like going

3007
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,880
then that down that path is just too

3008
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:51,840
tedious for the moment and i don't want

3009
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,840
to do it but

3010
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,840
the wrong question well just because you

3011
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:58,560
know

3012
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:01,520
um i don't know what meaning is and i i

3013
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:04,320
think um i do know that sense of awe

3014
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:08,239
i grew up in southern new mexico and the

3015
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:08,238
stars were so vivid um

3016
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,480
i had i've had some

3017
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,480
weird misfortunes

3018
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:18,319
but i've had some weird

3019
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:20,638
luck also one of our near neighbors uh

3020
01:45:18,319 --> 01:45:22,000
was the head of optics research at white

3021
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:23,760
sands and when he was young he

3022
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,039
discovered pluto his name was clyde

3023
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,639
tombaugh

3024
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:28,800
and uh he taught me how to make

3025
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:30,400
telescopes grinding mirrors and stuff

3026
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:33,920
and my dad had also made telescopes when

3027
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:35,439
he was a kid but uh clyde had like

3028
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,560
backyard telescopes that would put to

3029
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:40,638
shame a lot of like i mean he really he

3030
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,760
did his telescopes you know and so i

3031
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:42,960
remember

3032
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,119
he'd let me go and play with him and

3033
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,560
just like looking at a

3034
01:45:45,118 --> 01:45:48,559
globular cluster and you're seeing the

3035
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:50,239
actual photons and with a good telescope

3036
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,760
it's really like this object like you

3037
01:45:50,238 --> 01:45:53,678
can really tell

3038
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:55,440
this isn't coming through some

3039
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,199
intervening information structure this

3040
01:45:55,439 --> 01:45:59,519
is like the actual photons and it's

3041
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:01,279
really a three-dimensional object

3042
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:04,159
and you have even a feeling for the

3043
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:05,679
vastness of it and um

3044
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:08,000
it's it's

3045
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:10,158
it's i don't know so i definitely i was

3046
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,479
very very fortunate

3047
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:13,439
to have a connection to this guy that

3048
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:16,079
way

3049
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:18,399
when i was a kid um to have had that

3050
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:21,920
experience again the emphasis yeah

3051
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:21,920
experience i um

3052
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:27,840
it's kind of funny like i

3053
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:29,118
i feel like sometimes like i've taken um

3054
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,760
when she was younger i took my daughter

3055
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:33,439
and her friends to to like a telescope

3056
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,039
there are a few around here that are

3057
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:37,198
kids can go and use and they would like

3058
01:46:35,039 --> 01:46:40,158
look at jupiter's moons or something i

3059
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:41,439
think like galilean moons and i i don't

3060
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:44,879
know if they quite

3061
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:44,879
had that because it's like too

3062
01:46:45,118 --> 01:46:49,759
it's been just too normalized and i

3063
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:51,198
think maybe

3064
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,440
when i was growing up screens weren't

3065
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:56,158
that common yet and maybe it's like too

3066
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:57,919
confusable with the screen i don't know

3067
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:00,719
you know somebody uh uh

3068
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,639
brought up in conversation to me

3069
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:05,198
somewhere i don't remember who but they

3070
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:07,840
they kind of posited this idea that

3071
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:09,839
if humans early humans weren't able to

3072
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:12,079
see the stars like if earth atmosphere

3073
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,920
was such there was cloudy

3074
01:47:12,079 --> 01:47:15,600
that we would not develop human

3075
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:17,359
civilization there's something about

3076
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:19,119
being able to look up

3077
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:21,439
and see a vast

3078
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:23,679
universe is like that's fundamental to

3079
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:25,439
the development of human civilization

3080
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:26,639
i thought that was a curious kind of

3081
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:28,719
thought

3082
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:31,039
that reminds me of that uh

3083
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:32,719
old isaac asimov story where the cl you

3084
01:47:31,039 --> 01:47:34,238
know there's this planet where they

3085
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:35,520
finally get to see what's in the sky

3086
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:36,879
once in a while and it turns out they're

3087
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,320
in the middle of a globular cluster and

3088
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,159
they're always starting

3089
01:47:38,319 --> 01:47:41,679
i forget what happens exactly god that's

3090
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:44,000
that's from when i was the same age as a

3091
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:47,279
kid i don't really remember yeah

3092
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,639
uh but um yeah i don't know it's uh

3093
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:50,800
it might be right i'm just thinking of

3094
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:52,960
all the civilizations that grew up under

3095
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:56,719
clouds i mean like the

3096
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:58,560
the vikings needed a special uh

3097
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:59,840
diffracting piece of mica to navigate

3098
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,199
because they could never see the sun

3099
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,800
they had this thing called a sunstone

3100
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:04,638
that they found from this this one cave

3101
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,679
do you know about that so they were in

3102
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:08,480
this like

3103
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:10,480
uh they were trying to navigate boats

3104
01:48:08,479 --> 01:48:11,599
you know in the north atlantic with

3105
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:13,678
without being able to see the sun

3106
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:16,960
because it was cloudy and so they they

3107
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:17,760
used uh a

3108
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,639
uh uh

3109
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:22,159
chunk of mica to diffract it in order to

3110
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:23,600
be able to align where the sun really

3111
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:25,839
was because they couldn't tell my eye

3112
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,039
and navigate so i'm just saying there

3113
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,719
are a lot of civilizations that are

3114
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:30,479
pretty impressive that have to deal with

3115
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:31,520
a lot of clouds

3116
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:34,238
uh

3117
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:35,840
the amazonians invented our agriculture

3118
01:48:34,238 --> 01:48:37,839
and they they were probably under clouds

3119
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,760
a lot i don't know i don't know to me

3120
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:41,440
personally the the question of the

3121
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:44,079
meaning of life

3122
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:46,719
becomes most um

3123
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:48,639
vibrant most apparent when you look up

3124
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:52,079
at the stars because

3125
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:54,560
it makes me feel very small

3126
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:56,238
that we're not small

3127
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:59,360
but then you ask

3128
01:48:56,238 --> 01:49:01,599
it it still feels that we're special

3129
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:05,198
and then the natural question is like

3130
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:06,960
well if we are special as i think we are

3131
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:09,919
why the heck are we here

3132
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:12,560
in this vast universe

3133
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:14,319
that ultimately is the question of um

3134
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:15,920
right well the meaning of life i mean

3135
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:19,840
look

3136
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:21,279
there's a confusion sometimes in trying

3137
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,800
to use

3138
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:24,800
uh

3139
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,719
to set up a question

3140
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:29,840
or a thought experiment or something

3141
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:31,679
that's defined in terms of a context to

3142
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,599
explain something where there is no

3143
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:35,199
larger context and that's a category

3144
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:38,079
error

3145
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:41,359
if we want to do it in physics

3146
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:43,039
or well right in computer science

3147
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:44,559
it's hard to talk about the universe as

3148
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:46,639
a turing machine because a turing

3149
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,960
machine has an external clock and an

3150
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:51,039
observer and uh input and output there's

3151
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:52,639
a larger context implied in order for it

3152
01:49:51,039 --> 01:49:53,599
to be defined at all

3153
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:55,279
and so if you're talking about the

3154
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:57,199
universe you can't talk about it

3155
01:49:55,279 --> 01:49:58,639
coherently as a turing machine

3156
01:49:57,198 --> 01:50:01,039
quantum mechanics like that quantum

3157
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:03,039
mechanics has an external clock and has

3158
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:04,800
some kind of external context depending

3159
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:05,599
on your interpretation

3160
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,679
um

3161
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:09,119
that's either you know the observer or

3162
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:10,880
whatever

3163
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:13,118
and there's a they're they're similar

3164
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:16,000
that way so maybe maybe turing machines

3165
01:50:13,118 --> 01:50:17,439
and quantum mechanics can be

3166
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,039
better friends or something because they

3167
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:21,359
have a similar setup but the thing is if

3168
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:23,599
you have something that's defined

3169
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:26,079
in terms of an outer context

3170
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:27,920
you can't talk about ultimates with it

3171
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:30,639
because obviously it doesn't it's not

3172
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:32,319
suited for that so there's some ideas

3173
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:34,639
that are their own context general

3174
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:36,639
relativity is its own context it's

3175
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:38,639
different that's why it's hard to unify

3176
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:40,400
and

3177
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:42,319
i think the same thing is true when we

3178
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:44,319
talk about

3179
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:45,279
these types of questions like

3180
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:46,479
uh

3181
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:49,920
meaning

3182
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:51,598
is in a context and

3183
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:53,679
to talk about ultimate meaning is

3184
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:55,440
therefore a category or it's not it's

3185
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:56,800
not a

3186
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:59,279
um

3187
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:02,320
it's not a resolvable way of thinking it

3188
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:05,639
might be a way of thinking that

3189
01:51:02,319 --> 01:51:05,639
is experientially

3190
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:11,679
um or aesthetically valuable because

3191
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:13,760
it is

3192
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:16,000
awesome in the sense of you know

3193
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:18,239
awe-inspiring um

3194
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,960
but to try to treat it analytically is

3195
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:21,439
not

3196
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:23,760
sensible maybe that's what music and

3197
01:51:21,439 --> 01:51:26,319
poetry are for yeah maybe i think so i

3198
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:27,840
think music actually does escape any

3199
01:51:26,319 --> 01:51:29,198
particular context that's how it feels

3200
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:31,279
to me but i'm not sure about that that's

3201
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:33,279
once again crazy artists talking not

3202
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:36,639
scientists

3203
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:38,960
well you did uh you do both masterfully

3204
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:40,400
uh jaren and like i said i'm a big fan

3205
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:44,560
of everything you've done of you as a

3206
01:51:40,399 --> 01:51:47,359
human being um i appreciate the the fun

3207
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:49,520
argument we had today that will i'm sure

3208
01:51:47,359 --> 01:51:50,960
continue for 30 years as it did with

3209
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:53,679
mark minsky

3210
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:55,118
um honestly i i deeply appreciate that

3211
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:56,158
you spend your really valuable time with

3212
01:51:55,118 --> 01:51:58,319
me today it was a really great

3213
01:51:56,158 --> 01:51:59,439
conversation thank you so much

3214
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:01,599
thanks for listening to this

3215
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:03,678
conversation with jaren lanier

3216
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:06,000
to support this podcast please check out

our sponsors in the description

3218
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,719
and now let me leave you with some words

3219
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:12,799
from jaron lanier himself

3220
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:16,000
a real friendship ought to introduce

3221
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:17,440
each person to unexpected weirdness in

3222
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,118
the other

3223
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:23,000
thank you for listening and hope to see

3224
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:23,000
you next time
