17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,120
conversation with jimmy

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,920
pedro

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,519
what is the most beautiful throw in judo

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,120
to you

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,640
i think uchimara

22
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,878
you know it's the it's the one that

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,120
seems to have the most amplitude the

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,718
person goes the highest you see a leg

25
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,479
swing through the middle

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,600
uh the person doing the throw there's a

27
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,000
leg swinging through the middle the

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,558
other person definitely goes you know

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,560
head over heels flat on their back um

30
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:07,920
it's probably the most dynamic pretty

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,079
judo throw there is

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,000
okay so it's a single you're standing on

33
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,760
a single foot and you're raising your

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
other foot in the air and it's a forward

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,520
throw which means the uh

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,359
your your back is facing the opponent

37
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,519
but uh they kind of

38
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,359
both fly through the air and twist

39
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,679
through the air correct

40
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,680
yeah so how does that throw

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,040
work what are the principles behind that

42
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,040
throw is one of those throws that um

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
you know people can kind of understand

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
how to pick up another human being in

45
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,919
sort of trivial ways but the h mata to

46
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,078
me never quite made sense

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,680
like why it works

48
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,199
there's there's a cork there's a

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,000
twisting motion

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,799
there's some involvement of the hip but

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,438
not it's not really a hip throw

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,759
because the hip is not all the way over

53
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,839
so it's not it it's a very confusing

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,359
throat

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,118
can you say something probably one of

56
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,118
the most difficult throws to learn as

57
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,359
well because it is so complex you do

58
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,199
have to stand on one leg balance on one

59
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,878
leg you know swing your other leg

60
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,560
through the middle hold your opponent up

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,159
in the air and it's and it's hard to

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,560
it's hard to make that contact with

63
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,000
upper body to your to your back you know

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,878
you have to turn your back on the throw

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,520
as well so how does it work um it's

66
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,840
definitely sort of a throw where you

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
need to start pulling your opponent's

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
upper body towards you

69
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,280
right so their upper body starts coming

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,280
towards you your legs go towards them as

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,039
your body starts to go

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,919
to into the throw so your head is going

73
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,239
to go left let's say your body your legs

74
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,159
are going to go to the right your body's

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,560
your partner is going to start to lean

76
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,400
towards you and just as you start to get

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,719
their momentum coming forward

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,120
your leg is going to sweep up underneath

79
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,719
theirs pick them up onto your hip right

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
and then the finish of the throw is a

81
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,800
twist and a lot of times the good jadoka

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
will leave their feet when they do the

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,519
throw so both bodies are in the air

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,000
together and then the thrower comes down

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,840
on top of the person being thrown so all

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,919
four feet are in the air correct so

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
there's just this unstoppable forces

88
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,280
twist so you're all in the air you're

89
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,519
basically doing a roll together correct

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:25,039
okay so who to you is the best uchimada

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,120
who has the besides yourself

92
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,719
i'm not gonna lie there's there's plenty

93
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
of guys that do shimada a lot better

94
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,359
than i do uh you do have a nice video

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,199
about the chamada online but uh

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,920
who who's a great practitioner of the

97
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,839
ichimodo team right now shohei ono who's

98
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,158
two-time olympic gold medalist that's

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,120
his favorite throw and he there's a

100
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:47,039
tons of highlight videos on the igf and

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,719
judo fanatic showing how he does his

102
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,519
uchimara and it is quite different than

103
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,280
everybody else's um but it's unstoppable

104
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,959
when when he comes in nobody stops it

105
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,039
he's won two goals in a row at the

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,039
olympics i think maybe in the last eight

107
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,359
years the guy's lost two matches you

108
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,959
know he's just incredible so at a very

109
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,879
competitive division i guess 73 kilos

110
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,039
okay and then three

111
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,399
three-time world champ too is he the

112
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,000
greatest of all time

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,599
do you

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,238
the only reason why he's not is because

115
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,319
nomura is a 60 kilo player he was

116
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,879
three-time olympic champion

117
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,719
so no more i mean unless ono's gonna

118
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,800
stick around for another three years and

119
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
win again and uh

120
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,400
win again here in paris that's you know

121
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,560
then he'd match what nomura did but

122
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,159
three-time gold medalist in judo in a

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,079
lightweight division

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,080
that's pretty spectacular

125
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,639
so to you the

126
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:41,758
the being able to win a championship

127
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,639
world championship or olympic medal

128
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,000
is a measure of greatness it's not like

129
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,439
um

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,199
you have some people who are not as

131
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,959
accomplished like koga or something like

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,879
that but just

133
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,359
the the beauty

134
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,759
uh the the moments of magic the number

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,080
of moments of magic is the highest even

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,000
if it's not championships i think you

137
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,319
have to go by that because there's so

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,478
many phenomenal judo players that have

139
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,159
come through the system of spectacular

140
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,800
judo um

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,120
you have one you know countless major

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,560
events but you know the ability to pull

143
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,399
it together right at those magical

144
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,918
moments the the pinnacle of the sport

145
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,000
the world championships the olympic

146
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,599
games and proving that you can do it

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,120
time and time again

148
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,439
makes you unstoppable it makes you the

149
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,240
best um you know there was a guy back in

150
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,560
the

151
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,918
70s and 80s by the name of fuji and he

152
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,319
won four

153
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,959
world championships back to back and

154
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,038
back then the worlds was every two years

155
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,959
so he was here he was a four-time world

156
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,918
champion that's eight years the top of

157
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,519
the sport

158
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,359
he never

159
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,198
uh won an olympic medal

160
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,280
you know he never went to the olympics

161
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,680
you know so there's a guy who missed out

162
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,439
on on olympic greatness but was

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,918
arguably the best competitor back in

164
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,038
that that period by the way same

165
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,240
fuji as

166
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,719
as fuji

167
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,360
right really okay wow i didn't know that

168
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,440
was an actual guy fuji our brand is is

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,720
named after the mountain mount fuji okay

170
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,680
but you know this is a different guy his

171
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,560
name was future all right well

172
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,079
um history rhymes

173
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
what about

174
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,959
teddy renair ten-time world champ i

175
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,439
think two-time gold medalist at the

176
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:22,159
olympics two times bronze medalist at

177
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,160
the olympics

178
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,600
probably the most dominant judoka ever

179
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,880
is he in the running what do you think

180
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,759
about that guy

181
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,759
i think he's a a freak of nature teddy

182
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,479
you know if you look at the size just

183
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,720
how big he how tall he is how big he is

184
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,560
how physical he is of a specimen like i

185
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,440
sat next to him on a bus

186
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,560
and

187
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,639
like his legs are literally the size of

188
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,639
my waist yeah like when you sit next to

189
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,439
him and just look at the side he's a big

190
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,560
man

191
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,199
you know so

192
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,000
obviously to win 10 world titles in the

193
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,720
sport of judo i mean it that's uh that's

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,879
almost an incomprehensible feat uh

195
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,880
two-time olympic champion again

196
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,719
um but

197
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,639
you know that puts him in one of the

198
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,880
maybe 10 or 12 people that ever do that

199
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,560
in the history of the sport so

200
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,560
he's definitely got to be in the running

201
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,800
for for the best but

202
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,000
you know technically i don't think he's

203
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,000
as technical as some of the other um

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,160
in terms of pure judo

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,959
finesse technique you know it's he's

206
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,800
powerful he's explosive he's dominant

207
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,959
he's strong um

208
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,879
teddy also grips really really well

209
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,959
which makes him

210
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,399
that much tougher to beat because a lot

211
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,519
of times heavyweights especially the

212
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,758
heavyweight division a lot of them just

213
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,560
grab the ghee and they go you know man

214
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,319
to man and judo to judo and take shots

215
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,319
at each other and that's why a lot of

216
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,400
them end up getting beat but teddy's in

217
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,800
control like positionally he stays in

218
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,399
really good position and he controls his

219
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,319
opponent the whole fight so they really

220
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,000
don't have a chance against them he

221
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,680
doesn't give them a chance to beat him

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,279
which is why he's been so dominant but

223
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,959
he's not really stalling

224
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:03,038
so i mean he does have a really nice uh

225
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,399
sort of gary this uh

226
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,038
backward trip

227
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,560
outside trip in case people don't know i

228
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,878
mean he has

229
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,598
just like technically pretty good throws

230
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,280
and for heavyweight yes heavyweights can

231
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,000
be sometimes messy

232
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,279
with their uh judo he's pretty

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,519
technical

234
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,878
and uh clean

235
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,318
in the execution of his big throws but

236
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,319
a lot of that probably has to do with

237
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,160
the dominant gripping that he does it's

238
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,120
not defensive gripping it's offensive

239
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,360
gripping but the dominant gripping 100

240
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,519
he he controls the grips he controls the

241
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,038
movement of the match as a result of

242
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,719
that and then he creates his own

243
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,199
openings so i mean as a for a

244
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,120
heavyweight phenomenal technique yes

245
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,278
um and what you said messy i'd like to

246
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,360
call it sloppy right a lot a lot of the

247
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,360
uh heavyweights tend to be sloppy

248
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,039
they've fallen on the ground a lot

249
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,879
it's hard to move somebody that weighs

250
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,639
350 pounds you know it's hard to get

251
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,120
that body moving and just with the

252
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,799
simple uh pull motion so

253
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,080
um he's definitely found a way to do it

254
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,519
but he's also i don't know six foot

255
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,160
eight yeah you know he's probably weighs

256
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,320
140 kilos he's a big boy and but he had

257
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,838
this winning streak of just uh i don't

258
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,560
know how long but like over 100 matches

259
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,399
and he lost at this uh olympics that we

260
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,239
just went through the 20 i don't even

261
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,120
know what to call it 2021 olympics i

262
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,159
don't know the proper terminology tokyo

263
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:31,039
2020 okay 2020. all right

264
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:33,759
so he lost to uh tamerlan bashev

265
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:36,079
i mean it's always sad to see a sort of

266
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,958
greatness come to an end it's like uh

267
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,120
corellon and wrestling and greco-roman

268
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,518
did you shed a bit of a tear to see

269
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,480
greatness go or um

270
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,120
like

271
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,200
or is it just the way of life

272
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,240
um i mean what did you think about sort

273
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,680
of this dominance this run of dominance

274
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,000
being stopped

275
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,399
i think i mean it's obviously sad to see

276
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
i love seeing champions succeed um

277
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,000
especially people that that are good

278
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
people and i think teddy's a good person

279
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,120
you know i mean i think there's some

280
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,640
arrogant champions that everybody would

281
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,799
like to see lose just because they don't

282
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,559
want to deal with their um you know

283
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,159
their personality or

284
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,319
but and i think but i think teddy's a

285
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,480
very humble champion you know he's a

286
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,920
people's champion you know he's

287
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,680
i think he's been privileged and he

288
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,120
makes good money from the sport of judo

289
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,439
and the french federation has taken care

290
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,799
of him well so he's a he's a lifelong

291
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,800
judo icon

292
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,639
um so it's sad to see somebody like that

293
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,240
get beat especially when this could have

294
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,439
been you know his his third olympic

295
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,959
title and

296
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,640
um

297
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,278
you know just

298
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,679
beco put him in infamy you know so it

299
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,120
was sad to see but i think you know

300
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,359
every athlete

301
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,959
goes through it right i mean you

302
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,360
it's just that's what the olympics is

303
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:50,078
all about the great ones fall sometimes

304
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,519
and um especially in judo right it's

305
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,159
like so

306
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,240
like the margin of error i mean i guess

307
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:59,360
the other question i want to ask here is

308
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,399
in your sense how difficult it is to not

309
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
lose for

310
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,078
so long

311
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,278
it seems like in judo like a little

312
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,879
mistake

313
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,799
and it's over

314
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,679
there's no there's no coming back any

315
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,879
pawn means it's over so how difficult is

316
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,719
that is

317
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,799
it's hard to stay that dominant without

318
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,639
question first of all when you are when

319
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,399
you are the entire world is is training

320
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,159
against you just to be right they're

321
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,679
studying every single

322
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,199
movement they're they're studying

323
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,519
patterns they're they're trying to break

324
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,360
it down and find a flaw in your game

325
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,560
so everybody's hunting for you when

326
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,079
you're the best in the world especially

327
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,679
at the olympics that's that's the that's

328
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,199
the one to beat you at so

329
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,199
everybody's focused on you and then

330
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,120
there's an incredible amount of pressure

331
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,879
on that athlete to perform you know you

332
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,240
carry the flag for your country you know

333
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,000
when you're in opening ceremonies

334
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,959
sometimes you know there's

335
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,559
all spotlight is on you um and it's

336
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,838
particularly hard when things don't go

337
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,078
well early

338
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,839
you know in other words when you're

339
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,919
expected to win and then all of a sudden

340
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,240
now you're in a hard fight and it's not

341
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,439
going the way you want that pressure the

342
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,959
one who's the favorite feels the

343
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,320
pressure the most at the olympics and

344
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,679
that's why i think the other ones are

345
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,000
able to win it

346
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,439
i've actually never gotten a chance to

347
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,320
listen to teddy renair sort of explain

348
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,920
uh ideas behind his judo like i wonder

349
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,920
what his mental game is like because i

350
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,719
think his english is pretty not very

351
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,679
good

352
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,200
and so

353
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,879
um and i just haven't seen good

354
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,480
interviews but it's always fascinating

355
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,679
to

356
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,560
there's certain great athletes that are

357
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:32,159
also great thinkers and speakers

358
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,759
like um the satia brothers in wrestling

359
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,600
again not meaning that that's on my

360
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,838
to-do list 100

361
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,519
i'm going to afghanistan and talking to

362
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,680
them because they're brilliant

363
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,078
but to be able to sort of

364
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,559
um maybe after retirement to to think

365
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,879
back what were the systems involved

366
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,799
both on the technical

367
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,759
the training side

368
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,838
and then the uh mental side because like

369
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,360
to stay that dominant just like you're

370
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,320
saying everybody's studying to beat you

371
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,000
and

372
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,000
and the heavyweights are just these

373
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,679
powerful dudes so

374
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,919
to be able to control them with your

375
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,519
game and like the game that everybody

376
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,039
knows is coming is

377
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,759
i don't know i don't know what's behind

378
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,599
that but there's got to be um

379
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,759
it feels like the mental game is

380
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,440
exceptionally important

381
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,759
i think a lot of people underestimate

382
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,519
just how important that that side is

383
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,838
meant being mentally prepared for

384
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,879
victory mentally prepared to be the best

385
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,880
to stay the best um

386
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,200
there's nobody that's weak minded that

387
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,720
they can accomplish that you know it's

388
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,399
it's a hundred percent confidence and

389
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,800
belief in yourself

390
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,720
if we take a big picture of you then not

391
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,000
necessarily tater in there but

392
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,440
if you want to go from the very

393
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,679
beginning from day one of judo class to

394
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,160
olympic champion

395
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,919
or olympic medalist

396
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,000
what does it take

397
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,078
to become an olympic medalist in judo

398
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,839
from start to finish

399
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,919
like how many different trajectories do

400
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,600
you see or is there some

401
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,679
unifying principles

402
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,920
i think a lot of it has to your journey

403
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,879
is going to depend a lot by where you're

404
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,039
from

405
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,039
so a path that an american might take

406
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,439
versus somebody who's from japan or

407
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,599
somebody who's from europe there's two

408
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,560
very just three very distinct paths

409
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
right

410
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,359
because

411
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,440
you know in japan it's it's part of the

412
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,360
culture it's there's a there's a system

413
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,199
of excellence there's you know there's

414
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,879
elementary school judo there's junior

415
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,599
high school there's high school there's

416
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,958
collegiate there's olympic and

417
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,800
you know

418
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,879
much like our wrestling is here in our

419
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,039
in the united states right it's very

420
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,278
similar there's youth wrestling there's

421
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,439
high school this ncaa and then there's

422
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,559
olympic wrestling and you know when you

423
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,120
when you your country is a factory of

424
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:49,919
producing athletes at the highest level

425
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,600
then all of those top athletes typically

426
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,879
go back into the sport and there's

427
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,240
professions for them they have an

428
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,480
opportunity to coach at all those

429
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,720
different levels and just the level of

430
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,879
their game and the expertise that all of

431
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,959
them have even down at the elementary

432
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,360
level make their skill

433
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,439
so solid and as a coach in that

434
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,519
situation you can just sit back

435
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,079
and watch who stands out

436
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,000
as opposed to i think in america i guess

437
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,120
you need to

438
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,799
craft

439
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,879
you don't get to choose from a thousand

440
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,120
people a few people that naturally stand

441
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,120
out at the age of nine

442
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,159
you get you have to actually

443
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,919
uh

444
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,000
whatever the natural resources you're

445
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,000
given

446
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,879
craft them into a champion

447
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
um

448
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,600
so if we look at that the american way

449
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,399
where you just have a person with a

450
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,120
smile show up show up to your dojo says

451
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,799
i wanted to be an olympic medalist

452
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,639
what process do you take them through

453
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,719
well the odds are really insurmountable

454
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,959
like it's it's a very very high hill to

455
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,040
climb uh and there's only a few i think

456
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,719
only a few people and there's only a few

457
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,958
coaches in this entire country that

458
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
really understand that process

459
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,919
and they can that can help people reach

460
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,559
that level as as it's been proven right

461
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:06,000
yeah um number one you you certainly

462
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,479
have to have a solid base a fundamental

463
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,919
base of of an expectation of what the

464
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,360
training is going to be

465
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,759
and it has to be a level of

466
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,680
professionalism very very early where

467
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,759
you're teaching all the basic judo moves

468
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,879
all the basic fundamental movements

469
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,320
posture

470
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,000
gripping

471
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,720
well maybe gripping doesn't come in so

472
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,240
early in the game but um throwing

473
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,440
methodology movements nawaza position

474
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,799
um standing fundamental throws and i

475
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,199
think most importantly is really the

476
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,719
work ethic just the way you're going to

477
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,639
train the intensity you're going to

478
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,160
train with the ability to

479
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,240
the you know mindset of going to

480
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,439
tournaments constantly you need you know

481
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,240
in order to compete with the rest of the

482
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,560
world

483
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,240
our young kids need to

484
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,838
be tested

485
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,600
a lot when they're young they have to be

486
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,040
put through adversity because they don't

487
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,079
get put through adversity and training

488
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,679
because you don't have that many good

489
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,159
training partners so you get put through

490
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,519
adversity in competition and then do we

491
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,078
see what your weaknesses are and we

492
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,199
continue to make improvements on those

493
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:07,438
um but the journey is is it's long and

494
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,720
and until they're kind of at the teenage

495
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,240
years they're going to have to pretty

496
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,318
much stay domestic right because they

497
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,679
got to go through life as a normal kid

498
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,639
but they've got to be training in the

499
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,079
dojo at least you know five days a week

500
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,000
you know sometimes they might want to

501
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,918
get you know an extra technical workout

502
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,838
in or doing some base conditioning in

503
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,079
addition to that and then really at the

504
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:29,359
teenage years that's where we really

505
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:32,000
um we've struggled in america of of

506
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,558
keeping teens in the sport of judo as

507
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,240
well as developing them properly because

508
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:38,399
up until around the teenage years i

509
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,558
think the americans are on par with the

510
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,559
rest of the world in terms of technique

511
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,480
and in terms of skill and

512
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,839
you know we've we've proven we can

513
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,519
compete with the rest of the world up

514
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,918
until that age but

515
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,000
that's where japan and that's where the

516
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,679
europeans and the countries that are

517
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,679
strong in judo that's where they put a

518
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,038
lot of time energy and effort is into

519
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,960
the teens

520
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,279
where they have a great coaching staff

521
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,440
they have good training camps with with

522
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,879
800 a thousand people going to them

523
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,120
every single weekend

524
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,000
um when you say teens what do you mean

525
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:13,279
do you mean literally like 13 yeah

526
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,960
13 to 17 13 to 19. and that's where sort

527
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,480
of that's when you really accelerate

528
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,600
your development so you're saying like

529
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,038
in america

530
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,719
when you're young

531
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,480
like before you know

532
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,480
9 10 11 12 you stick in judo you can

533
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,798
progress quite a bit right but then i

534
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,919
guess the other competition there

535
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,359
if you're into uh

536
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,799
two people

537
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,959
uh

538
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,558
you know doing stuff to each other in a

539
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,480
combative way

540
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:41,599
uh the other competitor in america is

541
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,000
wrestling

542
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,159
so judo almost primes you like it

543
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,440
teaches you uh how to be a great

544
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,600
wrestler as well and so then you have to

545
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,440
have a hard decision

546
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,639
because you can probably be a collegiate

547
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,600
wrestler

548
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,640
you can you can you have like a a clear

549
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,240
plan

550
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,320
of where you're going to go if you want

551
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,440
to be a wrestler with judo

552
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,200
that plan is more um

553
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,200
is less clear

554
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,038
so yeah you have to be on your own a bit

555
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,000
with your coach that kind of thing

556
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:13,759
exactly

557
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,960
okay so when you're on your own with

558
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,640
your coach to me that's just a

559
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,440
fascinating journey because then it's

560
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,400
just like the purity of it it's the

561
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,798
coach and the athlete and the dream

562
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,440
it's all about the dedication the the

563
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:31,279
five six seven days a week

564
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,200
competing what once a month

565
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,759
twice a month

566
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,960
okay and just but also you probably

567
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,640
don't have that conversation i don't

568
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
know if you do maybe you do

569
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,440
saying like we're gonna do this for the

570
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,440
next eight years

571
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,839
right do you ever sit down would you

572
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,679
just do it take it to david goggins way

573
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,558
which is like let's just take it one

574
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,000
step at a time

575
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,599
let's hope we're there in eight years

576
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,359
yeah let's hope we're there do you

577
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,399
actually like right now you have to

578
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,479
think about

579
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,720
the olympics is gonna be in in los

580
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,880
angeles in 2028 so it's really

581
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,558
interesting now now would be the time

582
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,640
and now is the time

583
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,440
to identify talent

584
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,240
and get commitment out of students

585
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,440
that in seven years you can make a u.s

586
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,200
olympic team because we're going to have

587
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,038
a full team

588
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,558
america is going to have 14 athletes

589
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,640
compete in those games one in every

590
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:23,839
weight class so now is the time if

591
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,840
you're going to go on a journey to the

592
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,759
olympics and stay with the sport of judo

593
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,399
now would be the time to do it

594
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:34,960
you know and so what uh

595
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,600

596
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,159

00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,558
or something like that traveling

603
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,440
abroad is there something to be said

604
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,918

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,038
just said we needed all of it and we do

607
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,279
do all of that right now we have a young

608
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:09,200

613
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,400
they're just young boys but they've been

614
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,639
training hard through kovid yeah um

615
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,679
we've been travis and myself have been

616
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,600
training them we share responsibilities

617
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,200
um they're doing randori like five

618
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,359
nights a week you know we have them

619
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,960
doing randori tuesdays

620
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,599
wednesdays

621
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,880
thursdays fridays and sundays is when

622
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,240
they're doing randori they're coming to

623
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,240
the dojo friday night and sunday night

624
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,240
to do training

625
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,759
we also have technical sessions for them

626
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,120
and they're in school now so it's a

627
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,558
little bit challenging but they come

628
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,639
five o'clock in the afternoon and they

629
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,480
do a technical session through covid

630
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,320
they were coming every morning doing

631
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,960
technical sessions what's the technical

632
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,879
session you're it's an hour of um

633
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,279
repetitive throwing or repetitive

634
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,400
drilling to to reinforce movements that

635
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:05,359
we deem important to our successful uh

636
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,360
system so nawaza positions groundwork

637
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,479
positions where we want them to be put

638
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,479
in this position and they're going to

639
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,120
drill it 50 times you know with

640
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,839
resistance in big groups you know doing

641
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:17,439
drills over and over again picking apart

642
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,959
the details of the technique and what

643
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,200
they're doing wrong showing them how to

644
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,200
fix it but now we've done it so much

645
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,319
that now we can do a whole drill session

646
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,400
with them where they know all the

647
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,319
different techniques inside and out and

648
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,880
they can move from position to position

649
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,119
really quickly do they do it for uh a

650
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,840
period of time like two minutes five

651
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:38,558
minutes or is it like one do they're

652
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,480
actually counting no sometimes it's both

653
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,839
so sometimes we do it for reps sometimes

654
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,000
we do it for time

655
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,240
yeah so sometimes it might be as many as

656
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,079
they can do in in 60 seconds or as many

657
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,519
as they can do in two minutes and

658
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,839
sometimes it might just be i want you to

659
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,440
do every position five times

660
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,279
in terms of throws

661
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,120
we're not talking about on a crash pad

662
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,839
right it's it's just we're talking about

663
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,918
free moving around the mat and just

664
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,439
dynamically and just throwing correct

665
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,280
how many uh

666
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,480
because uh as i was mentioning to you

667
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,119
offline

668
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,880
uh travis threw me a few times

669
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,158
a lot of times when he was visiting in

670
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,840
austin and i just remembered uh so

671
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,320
there's two things i

672
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,639
fortunately or unfortunately in my life

673
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,038
haven't gotten a chance to train with

674
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,520
folks of that level without just

675
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,839
cleanness of throw and the power and it

676
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:31,119
was very nice i can i immediately

677
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,038
actually enjoyed being thrown like that

678
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,239
to throw a little at craig jones

679
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,720
with his current matt situation um is

680
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,359
they're very they were quite thin

681
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,960
uh and as travis commented on and not

682
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,759
just the thinness of the mats but they

683
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,720
were laid on like concrete right so i

684
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,720
felt i felt it's like soft until it's

685
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
not um

686
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,319
but uh

687
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,919
being thrown very cleanly i just felt

688
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,079
like there's this is not gonna lead to

689
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,799
injury it was great it wasn't injury

690
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,480
prone but then as i mentioned to you

691
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:06,879
when i a day or two after my entire leg

692
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,919
one of them i guess it's the left leg

693
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,200
um

694
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,799
was just in just black bruise

695
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,038
it didn't it didn't hurt too bad it was

696
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,879
just the body's gotten soft so i guess

697
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,599
the question is um

698
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,159
does the body get used to

699
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,959
just that number of throws just over

700
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,159
time being thrown thousands of times a

701
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,720
month

702
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,960
unquestionably your body gets used to it

703
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,759
so it hardens it gets really hard which

704
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,440
is why judo is is hard to come back to

705
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,038
after you've taken a long period of time

706
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,720
off because your body is not used to

707
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:40,558
that impact anymore

708
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,440
um i always found out that you know when

709
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:45,759
i was training judo a lot it's hard to

710
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,400
it's hard to shed weight and keep weight

711
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,000
off because your body like you know it

712
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,600
it develops like this layer of

713
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,960
protection on itself that it doesn't

714
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,079
want to give up yeah you know when

715
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,919
you're sucking a lot of weight that

716
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,278
means you're frail and you know so i

717
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,278
always seem to

718
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,919
retain weight more you know when you're

719
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,200
doing hard judo training as opposed to

720
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,600
you know losing weight it's easy when

721
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,038
you go for runs and things like that to

722
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,278
shed the water weight but to actually

723
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,119
keep the pounds off was yeah pretty hard

724
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,038
yeah the body kind of develops like you

725
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:15,678
said a level of protection what about

726
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:18,400
the randori just out of curiosity again

727
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,880
i i haven't ever had the opportunity to

728
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,080
train with folks at a high level

729
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,760
um it's you know in jiu jitsu

730
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,599
the there's different gyms have

731
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,640
different styles but i've noticed that

732
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,798
at the highest levels people

733
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,840
can go pretty hard in a certain kind of

734
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:39,519
way where it's more technical and you're

735
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:42,319
not you're moving at a hundred percent

736
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,440
but the power is not at a hundred

737
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,918
percent

738
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,080
it's it's a weird little dance it's it's

739
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,600
techn like you're not really

740
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,558
um

741
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,719
forcing stuff you're more focused on on

742
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:57,599
the right timing the right

743
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,960
uh positioning of hands and feet and

744
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,359
body and all those kinds of things

745
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,360
you're not like forcing stuff in the way

746
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,599
you would in competition like really the

747
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,199
power does that sound similar to you for

748
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,119
the way you tried to durandori so

749
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,798
there's different styles of judo and

750
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,798
they say the japanese style the

751
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,158
technical style of judo is exactly what

752
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,240
you just talked about it's like it's

753
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,000
almost like two guys in pajamas right

754
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,558
we're not going we're not using it we're

755
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,079
using minimal effort maximum efficiency

756
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:23,519
we're moving around and we're trying to

757
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,278
feel that movement

758
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,000
and it's timing and finesse and

759
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,359
technique and fun and clean throws and

760
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,720
when you you know when you train in

761
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:34,000
japan

762
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,558
you can train 15 rounds of randori five

763
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,038
minute rounds that's 75 minutes of of

764
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:41,359
straight you know sparring you can do

765
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:42,798
that straight in japan without a problem

766
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,158
i mean you'll get tired of course you're

767
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,599
going to fall a lot you're going to

768
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,320
throw a lot

769
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,319
but it's very like free feeling

770
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,240
and it's technical as you explained but

771
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,158
then when you go to europe and you try

772
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,120
to do rounds with the europeans they are

773
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,360
very physical they don't have that same

774
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,519
finesse in their training that they do

775
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,119
in japan and in europe you'd be

776
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,679
hard-pressed to do eight rounds of

777
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,079
randori in a night it's so physically

778
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,159
exhausting because so much effort is

779
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:12,480
going into just fighting and fending off

780
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,960
the gripping system and the power of

781
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,558
your opponent you're physically drained

782
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,519
after eight rounds of randori so it's a

783
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:22,319
much different feel when you say europe

784
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,398
do you mean germany france britain

785
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,240
russia is there a lot so

786
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,079
there's a kind of

787
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,599
similarity to all of those kinds of

788
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,240
approaches the only difference would be

789
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,879
russia that they do a lot more active

790
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,038
drilling a lot more sequential movement

791
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,919
training they don't focus as much on

792
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,960
randori you'll do much fewer rounds in

793
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,120
russia

794
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,480
during training camps than you would in

795
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,439
in those other countries we just talked

796
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,120
about france germany etc what about in

797
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,000
this kind of american system where you

798
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,639
have much less talent

799
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,278
uh to work with is

800
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,038
did you uh

801
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,960
just select whatever works for the

802
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,440
particular athletes or do you have a

803
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,519
something you prefer in your system

804
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,558
so you need a combination of all of it

805
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,398
if you're going to win at the olympic

806
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,319
level you have to be able to deal with

807
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,879
the finesse of the japanese the

808
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:15,439
physicality of the europeans you have to

809
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,120
focus on on the ground nawaza aspect

810
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,798
because a lot of people are weak there

811
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,239
in the world of the sport of judo that's

812
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:21,759
a chance to win

813
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,720
we've sort of developed our american

814
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,480
system of judo at least for the last i

815
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,038
say probably the last 20 years would be

816
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,519
the american system of judo which relies

817
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:34,000
heavily on taking the individual and

818
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:36,639
whatever techniques they they do

819
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,558
perfecting those techniques and

820
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,480
the combinations and other throws that

821
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,639
go with those throws but then

822
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,480
implementing and overlaying an american

823
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:49,278
system of gripping nawaza conditioning

824
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,599
mentality training methodology

825
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,278
like in in game planning you know to

826
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,519
beat your opponents and i think that's

827
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,880
the that's the secret sauce to success

828
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,759
for the fair americans because there's

829
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,200
no way if we don't have eight partners

830
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,960
to train within the night that are going

831
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
to give us good rounds right we might

832
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,440
have two

833
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,278
you know so we know the same guy four

834
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,960
times those two people four you know two

835
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,640
times each now i have four good rounds

836
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,079
the rest of the rounds i'm not being

837
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,360
pushed to the limit so we train

838
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,359
differently

839
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,759
um and a lot of times we do a lot of

840
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,359
stuff like shark bait when our athletes

841
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,359
are preparing for competition for

842
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,519
example when kayla or travis were

843
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,038
preparing for competition

844
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,200
we might only have 20 people in the

845
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:27,919
whole gym work to work out with those

846
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,399
two

847
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,559
olympic medalists right and of those 20

848
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:34,879
people maybe four of them are travis's

849
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,558
size you know maybe there's only one

850
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
girl in the room for kayla she's got to

851
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,079
train with guys and then the other ones

852
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,918
are teenagers that are too weak to train

853
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,678
with either one of them so what we would

854
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,600
do is just put together four or five

855
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,519
people that could you know give them a

856
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,199
challenge and we'd line them up and they

857
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,038
would do a minute a minute a minute a

858
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,399
minute and then do five minutes in a row

859
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,240
as hard as they can

860
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,158
that person can go hard for a minute

861
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,679
with travis or kayla they can't go five

862
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,399
minutes hard but they can go one minute

863
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,559
hard so it made their training much

864
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,439
much more intense much more physically

865
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,839
demanding and then rinse and repeat that

866
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,278
six times or eight times in a night

867
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,278
you know they just got 40 minutes of

868
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,119
intense randori the person that was

869
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,558
training with them that wasn't as good

870
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,158
only had to do six or eight minutes of

871
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:17,678
training the whole night yeah you know

872
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,799
so

873
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,320
it's so

874
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,398
it's so difficult

875
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,038
because you then you look at like

876
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:29,038
the russian national team

877
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,839
and you have just world champions and

878
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,158
so

879
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,158
um

880
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,480
or you even have like um what is the tom

881
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,640
brands and terry brands in the in the

882
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,640
wrestling system you have like

883
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,799
these people it's a small group of

884
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,320
people but they're all some of the best

885
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,319
people in the world and they're going

886
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,798
head to head and yeah you don't

887
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:52,639
necessarily get a good look kind of a

888
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,519
variety of styles

889
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,000
but just the qualities there and even

890
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,079
that is missing for people your size in

891
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,398
america because

892
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,639
and that is so difficult to work with we

893
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,199
should make scales and makes travis's

894
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,519
story that much more amazing

895
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,440
is um you mentioned kind of

896
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,440
picking whatever the set of techniques

897
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,200
the athlete

898
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,720
is naturally good at or prefers or

899
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,600
whatever

900
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,679
how much specialization is there

901
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,959
maybe if i give you like two choices is

902
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,559
it good to have like one throw

903
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,319
and try to become the best person in the

904
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,398
world at that throw or do you want to

905
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,119
have a bunch of stuff

906
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,639
uh like a a variety of throws well for

907
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,038
travis it was he pulling saying aggie

908
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,200
that was his main throw right but from

909
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,960
that ipo and saying he had a variety of

910
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,960
other attacks he could do

911
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,558
you know that mixed it up so that you

912
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,079
kept people guessing that maybe it

913
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:47,599
wasn't the paul and say we was coming

914
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,079
maybe it was the koshi grumma that he

915
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,158
did or maybe it was the ipone to osoto

916
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:54,000
that he did in combination so you

917
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,760
typically have one main

918
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,880
throw that you do for me it was tai

919
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:01,359
otoshi for kayla it was her ogoshi for

920
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,960
travis it was ipo and sanagi but then

921
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,678
you come up with a variety of other

922
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,600
throws that you do from the very same

923
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,679
grip so whatever grip you take for your

924
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,240
main throw you want to develop you know

925
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,159
an arsenal of attacks that go in all

926
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,880
different directions holding that same

927
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,880
grip so you keep your opponent guessing

928
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,720
as to what's coming you know because if

929
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,480
they're just sitting on one technique

930
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,159
at the highest level of sport with the

931
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,919
exception of a few right we talked about

932
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,840
ono's uchimada

933
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,679
with the exception of a few most of the

934
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:30,720
world catches on pretty quick on how to

935
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,960
beat you

936
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,440
there is something to just sticking

937
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,079
making sure you really dedicate to the

938
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,278
main thing so for travis that would be

939
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:43,839
like the main version of his inagi

940
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,079
like really making sure you don't forget

941
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,798
to really put in the time on that

942
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,798
because um

943
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,880
i mean one one way to say it is

944
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,038
that threat being dangerous opens up a

945
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,240
lot of things right

946
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,640
but also

947
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,519
i don't know

948
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,640
i think i'm just as a fan i think it

949
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,200
it's sad when like elite level athletes

950
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,640
in in all like combat sports

951
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,399
kind of start taking their main thing

952
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,120
for granted

953
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,479
like um they think okay i've i figured

954
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,239
that part out

955
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,720
now i'll be working on all this whole

956
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,440
system on variations on different setups

957
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,919
on

958
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,558
uh lefty versus some like weird

959
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,840
variation as opposed to

960
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:30,558
you know what if you look at some of the

961
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,720
best people ever they seem to have not

962
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,798
cared about variations at all

963
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,679
they're just like literally

964
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:39,759
they are more like jiro dreams of sushi

965
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,960
and like

966
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:45,919
like fine-tuning their ear their ability

967
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,399
to detect the mine movements that give

968
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,120
you an opening on that main thing and so

969
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:53,278
the whole time you're just

970
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,798
waiting for that throw you're like

971
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,759
dancing with the like little bit of

972
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,440
pressure

973
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:59,278
and like releasing the pressure and

974
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,679
putting the pressure maybe a little bit

975
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,640
off off balance and finding like the

976
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,480
right

977
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,559
moment to strike and

978
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,599
focusing on that again maybe that's just

979
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,759
like a romanticization of like

980
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,519
the simplicity of that maybe it is kind

981
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,429
of impossible to do that on a large

982
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,358
scale but i just um

983
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,358
[Music]

984
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:21,358
yeah i i don't know if you can comment

985
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,279
on that whether there is some value and

986
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,679
still putting in like tens of thousands

987
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,079
of reps on the main main thing well

988
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,079
unquestionably that has to happen you

989
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,000
still have to drill your main throw and

990
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,159
you have to fine tune it and continue to

991
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,079
do you know repetition after repetition

992
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,919
and throws on the crash pad you know or

993
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,519
throws on the mat moving around just

994
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,878
explosive movements doing your main

995
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,079
technique you're never going to forget

996
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,159
that and you're not going to put it to

997
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,000
the side and not practice it anymore it

998
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,159
still has to be part of your repertoire

999
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,559
and part of your daily training but you

1000
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,639
do have to evolve and i think that's and

1001
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,960
i think that's the sport of judo makes

1002
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,960
you evolve you know when i look at we

1003
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,639
talk about koga from before right and we

1004
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,800
talked about he had a dynamic he pulling

1005
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,480
say in agi that nobody could stop for

1006
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,079
years and years and years but

1007
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,400
when people started to you know be

1008
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,480
unorthodox and come down his back and

1009
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,160
cross-grip him and he couldn't get to

1010
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,519
the lapel he had to come up with

1011
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,159
something else and all of a sudden you

1012
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,400
saw koga doing now he did a soda where

1013
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:18,639
now he did a tomo nagi which so he can

1014
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,480
he added to his arsenal you know to keep

1015
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,078
people thinking keep purple gas in so

1016
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,159
it's not you're not just that one trick

1017
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,039
pony they still couldn't stop his ipo

1018
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,358
and say

1019
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:29,039
once he got that grip but if they stop

1020
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,960
them from getting that grip or putting

1021
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,800
two hands on the ghee he had to go to

1022
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,440
something else and that's what he did

1023
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,640
does travis's or koga's say nagi make

1024
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,200
sense to you

1025
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,400
that weird uh so when i because split

1026
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,319
hip that's

1027
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,079
split hip so

1028
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,599
i don't know if you know this but like i

1029
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,680
got into judo because of travis i

1030
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,760
watched him with 2008 olympics and i was

1031
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,239
uh there's something about like

1032
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,280
uh just the not the cockiness but the

1033
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:57,519
confidence and just the refusal to quit

1034
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,280
the refusal to just some that energy

1035
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,960
whatever you connect to me is like oh

1036
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,040
that guy's badass

1037
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,800
i want to be badass like that

1038
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,838
and then i also there happened to be in

1039
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,280
my university judo and i um

1040
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:10,639
and i got into and just fell in love

1041
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,519
with the elegance and the beauty and the

1042
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:16,078
power of the sport um

1043
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,880
but also i started to mimic travis's

1044
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,800
game

1045
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,280
uh his and koga's

1046
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,640
and i and then uh the instructors i

1047
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,240
worked with they said that's the wrong

1048
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:26,559
way to do it

1049
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,319
and i always i never found somebody that

1050
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,920
told me that like

1051
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,838
no that's not the wrong way to there's a

1052
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,960
lot of ways to do it and there's like

1053
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:34,480
the classic way and you have to

1054
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,320
understand and you have to learn it but

1055
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,240
this is not the wrong way because i was

1056
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,838
trying to find somebody who understands

1057
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,118
this throw

1058
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:42,320
because it's so

1059
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,320
beautiful at the highest level

1060
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,240
especially with koga the way

1061
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,000
you're able the quickness with which you

1062
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,239
can strike the fact that you could stand

1063
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,039
on the feet and the elevation you can

1064
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,719
get and the power you can get it has

1065
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,000
certain throws

1066
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,879
just

1067
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,119
like uchamata doesn't look powerful

1068
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,480
it it's just like it's it looks

1069
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,838
effortless

1070
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,880
but like

1071
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,039
the standing sanagi with a split hip it

1072
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,640
just looks powerful because

1073
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,480
there's a

1074
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:13,920
you're like you're stepping into them

1075
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,760
you're lifting the opponent and they

1076
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,838
still have they're not surprised they're

1077
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,079
now like helpless right their feet are

1078
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:22,239
fluttering and flattering so and then

1079
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,880
there's just this this pause and then

1080
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,439
just big slam with the ucha mata it's

1081
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,039
almost like you don't know what hit you

1082
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,880
that's like tayatoshi is the same it's

1083
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,279
almost like a surprise like oh i'm

1084
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,400
not on my back and

1085
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,400
um

1086
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,079
so i i just i just

1087
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,320
love that throw but like

1088
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,119
i it didn't make sense to me

1089
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,039
like

1090
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,559
when trying to explain it to others when

1091
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,960
trying to learn it didn't make sense to

1092
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:49,679
me uh how it works does it make sense to

1093
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,240
you it does yeah i'm i was born a judoka

1094
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,279
right so i i've lived this stuff since i

1095
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,159
was

1096
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,000
an infant and i've seen every style and

1097
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,838
every technique um

1098
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,920
the split hip saying aggie is is

1099
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,320
difficult to learn it's harder to learn

1100
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,320
than the the basic form but it is

1101
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,079
powerful and it does

1102
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,599
upon entry

1103
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,359
both your opponent's feet leave them out

1104
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,960
at the same time so you've got them once

1105
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,400
you enter you've got them you just got

1106
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,079
to finish right you just got to lock

1107
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,559
them and turn and go so

1108
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,160
it makes sense to me my dad did teach me

1109
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,078
how to do that when i was younger yeah

1110
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,838
he wanted me to do a split hip we have

1111
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,400
kids at the school today that we teach

1112
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,559
the split up say in aggie same way

1113
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,480
um because it is that dynamic right you

1114
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,960
don't drop to the ground and roll and

1115
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,400
turn it's not the classic form where

1116
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,000
you're giving way to your opponent it's

1117
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,039
actually you go pick the guy up in the

1118
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,280
air and then you slam them so

1119
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,400
okay uh

1120
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,240
beautiful so maybe on a small tangent so

1121
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,639
we're talking about elite level athletes

1122
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,239
in terms of randori in terms of rep like

1123
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,960
uh drilling

1124
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,759
for more recreational athletes

1125
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,199
like

1126
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,040
you know i have personally that

1127
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,399
situation going on but there's other

1128
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,838
people there just recreationally

1129
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,320
training judo how do you recommend they

1130
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,320
improve judo like

1131
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,559
if i wanted to compete a bunch

1132
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,200
and do reason reasonable with a

1133
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,880
particular set of throws say the split

1134
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,159
uh

1135
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,320
senagi

1136
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,960
how do you do you do the randori do you

1137
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,559
use a crash brad to get him reps do you

1138
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,880
like what do you recommend so i guess

1139
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,639
there's two recreational people that

1140
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,559
we're talking about one is somebody who

1141
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:28,799
wants to learn judo and become good at

1142
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,559
judo but don't doesn't necessarily want

1143
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,240
to compete but just wants to get better

1144
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:33,440
and i think that there's not enough

1145
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,279
emphasis

1146
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,119
in this country on

1147
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,960
just that on paying attention to that

1148
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,599
type of student everybody pushes them to

1149
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,440
competition but in reality there's a

1150
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,280
huge audience of people out there that

1151
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,599
would love to learn judo and be very

1152
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,000
proficient at judo and have the skills

1153
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,000
to go execute if they ever needed it

1154
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and there's a class and there should be

1155
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,480
a program for that athlete and that

1156
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,639
athlete does not need to do randori

1157
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,320
like the sport of judo is physical

1158
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:01,838
enough when you're picking somebody up

1159
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,680
all the time and moving their body

1160
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:06,078
weight around the mat all the time where

1161
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,239
you can get very physically strong very

1162
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,800
physically fit technically you'll be

1163
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,118
better than somebody that does randori

1164
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,880
more than you because you're move if you

1165
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,480
learn good technique and you learn the

1166
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,559
movement and you learn the feel and you

1167
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,240
move the learn the timing

1168
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,159
you'll actually be a better athlete than

1169
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,838
the person that just focuses on randori

1170
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:27,039
who does ugly technique and wins with

1171
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:28,559
force so you know we have a recreational

1172
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,239
class at our school

1173
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,838
where they don't do any randori they

1174
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,759
have an option afterwards if they want

1175
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,119
to stay for 15 minutes or stay for 30

1176
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,839
minutes where they can participate in

1177
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,240
randori but most of the adult students

1178
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,318
choose not to because they're already so

1179
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,000
tired from the other you know good

1180
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,639
workout right they're already dripping

1181
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,559
sweat they're already like if you if you

1182
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,039
you know work hard and drill hard it's

1183
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:54,000
an intense workout you're exhausted

1184
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:56,480
you know so that that's a specific

1185
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,480
set of of a program i should say at

1186
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,599
every academy and then if you want to

1187
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,400
get good and you want to compete

1188
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,480
then to me once you have your techniques

1189
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,599
it's learning how to

1190
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,760
implement a good gripping system to put

1191
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:16,240
yourself in a position where you can

1192
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,240
always you know dominate the grips

1193
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,240
control the movement initiate the

1194
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,480
reactions from your opponent and then

1195
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,719
have the opportunity to attack and score

1196
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,199
and and i think that when people train

1197
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:29,199
with or when they jump into a higher

1198
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:31,118
level of the sport of judo all of a

1199
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:32,399
sudden the first thing they say is i

1200
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,760
can't attack

1201
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,519
i don't know how to attack because

1202
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,880
positionally they don't know where to

1203
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,960
put their hands they don't know how to

1204
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,800
hold the ghee properly they don't

1205
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,960
understand that they're

1206
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,720
you know they have an inferior grip

1207
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,318
and and they don't know how to get into

1208
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,239
better position so they can attack and

1209
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,159
that's a big part of the game that not a

1210
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,639
lot of people really understand so you

1211
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,000
really even for recreational competitors

1212
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,679
you really need to have a gripping

1213
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,119
system you need to understand the

1214
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,279
gripping system

1215
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,720
if you want to win yeah i mean if the

1216
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,319
goal is to go and compete that's a

1217
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,000
different story you're going i don't

1218
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:05,358
have fun getting beat up or losing in

1219
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,960
competitions i

1220
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,239
enjoy the

1221
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,079
i don't even know if it's the winning or

1222
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,279
the losing i don't

1223
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,119
i i think

1224
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,800
this is what because i competed a lot in

1225
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,800
both judo and jiu jitsu and in judo

1226
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,880
it feels like because i didn't have a

1227
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,200
gripping system it feels like you're not

1228
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,838
even playing judo against the the good

1229
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,759
black belts you're they're just they're

1230
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,838
not they're not even trying because they

1231
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,920
have they get a certain kind of grip and

1232
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,279
you just can't do anything and i don't

1233
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,440
have a good answer for that i don't even

1234
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,680
know what i'm looking for and so it's

1235
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,920
not even fun it's not like even losing

1236
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,759
it's it's like um

1237
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,200
i don't know it's like you didn't even

1238
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,800
show up to play

1239
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,838
is what it feels like and it's

1240
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,920
unfortunate i i think that is a big gap

1241
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:51,440
in knowledge actually

1242
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,800
in um

1243
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,599
judo schools

1244
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,720
is is the gripping part

1245
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,160
when you first go out to to do judo

1246
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:01,759
right you the first thing you have to do

1247
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:03,199
is you have to grab your opponent right

1248
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,119
and a lot of times i hear coaches say

1249
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:07,118
get a grip just take a grip well

1250
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,200
sometimes if you take a grip

1251
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,800
you're in a worse position than not

1252
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,399
having a grip at all that's what a lot

1253
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,400
of people don't understand like if you

1254
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,838
hold the ghee in the wrong way your

1255
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,639
opponent can attack you but you can't

1256
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,239
attack him so why would you ever do that

1257
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,480
grip

1258
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,399
if it's only to your detriment

1259
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,800
right so that's and

1260
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,720
the way you grip does set up

1261
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,318
what attacks you can do as well so that

1262
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:33,039
is a huge part and i'm not saying that

1263
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,719
you have to be 100 disciplined and only

1264
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,400
always out grip your opponent and only

1265
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,639
be able to do throws when you have a

1266
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,240
superior grip i'm just saying that

1267
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,598
to be able to put the grips together

1268
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,519
with the throws and understand the

1269
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,800
movements is going to make you that much

1270
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:47,679
ahead of the game

1271
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,839
so if we take a step to uh our previous

1272
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,679
discussion of going from

1273
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:54,719
zero to hero

1274
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,879
so going from the the early days through

1275
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:58,399
the teenage years to winning

1276
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,920
an olympic medal

1277
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,680
so we mentioned

1278
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,639
a lot of training the dedication of the

1279
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:04,719
training

1280
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,838
the competing what other elements are

1281
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:10,318
there the mental side is uh

1282
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:12,239
visualization believing that you could

1283
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,679
perform at that level

1284
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,118
uh so what else can you say about it i

1285
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,279
think that comes at the highest level

1286
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,039
the the visualization the success that

1287
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,680
comes at the highest level i think in

1288
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:24,239
the teen years um

1289
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:26,799
there's the experience just plays a huge

1290
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,559
role in getting to

1291
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,800
train with other people like as

1292
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,799
americans we have to go train in europe

1293
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,160
we have to feel the european style of

1294
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,240
judo we have to

1295
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,719
understand that physicality they they

1296
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:41,519
grip very differently they put you in

1297
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,039
very unorthodox positions and if you

1298
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,039
when if you don't know how to deal with

1299
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,039
that you get thrown before you even have

1300
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,800
a chance to try your own throws you know

1301
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,559
so it takes a lot of

1302
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,960
it takes a lot of that experience and

1303
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,318
understanding what's going on

1304
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,400
and then you also need to get that

1305
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:59,759
physicality you need to be physically

1306
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,680
strong and hard i would say by doing all

1307
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,440
those rounds with the europeans and at

1308
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,358
the same time you need to go to asia and

1309
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,079
you need to train in in japan because

1310
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:10,318
you need to feel that free-flowing

1311
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,839
judo for your technical the technical

1312
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:13,039
side i think that's

1313
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:15,039
one of the things that i was able to

1314
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:17,039
benefit from my dad was a coach who said

1315
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:19,679
listen i've taken as far as i can take

1316
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,920
you i want you to go to the next level i

1317
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,598
want you know he sent me to to england

1318
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,680
with neil adams who was an olympic

1319
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,519
silver medalist and was a world champion

1320
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,519
had a great ground game and was good at

1321
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,440
gripping and actually did taotoshi which

1322
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,039
is the throw i did so my dad said i want

1323
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,079
you to go learn from neil and i ended up

1324
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:35,838
going to

1325
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,440
to england probably eight to ten times

1326
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,119
in my career and spending a good amount

1327
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,159
of time there training at the neil adams

1328
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,880
academy

1329
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:44,159
um he's now the voice of judo neil adams

1330
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,200
what do you make of that guy just a

1331
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:49,358
brief pause he's like the like uh morgan

1332
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:50,960
freeman is the voice of like march of

1333
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:53,920
the penguins and any other nature

1334
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,920
documentary and neil adams is uh there's

1335
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,358
very few sports that have a neil adams i

1336
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,800
would say because

1337
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:02,799
he's legitimately maybe like joe rogan

1338
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,039
is that from mixed martial arts it's

1339
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,119
just like an exceptionally

1340
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,960
recognizable voice he's really

1341
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,519
knowledgeable also the passion is

1342
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,599
conveyed so well like many times i'll

1343
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,920
watch just because he's talking right so

1344
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,760

place at like seven in the morning and

1368
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,240
the first thing we would do is we'd go

00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:10,719
for a run and we'd either be running

1370
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,639
mountains or we'd be doing a five mile

1371
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,239

1372
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,159
park we were doing sprints and buddy

1373
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:18,078
carries and all this stuff and then at

1374
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,000
nine a.m we'd have a technical session

1375
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,440
with neil adams where he would you know

1376
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,599

1377
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,079
techniques and learn positions and it

1378
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,680
was no randori it was that sequential

1379
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,880
drilling that we talked about before

1380
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,279
right where you're

1381
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,358
reinforcing your your two or three

1382
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,400
attacks to set up your main attack or if

1383
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,199
you're on the ground you're going

1384
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,000
through repetitions of certain movements

1385
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:42,960

1388
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,078
that place and then in the evening we

1389
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,239
would either do randori training at the

1390
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,240
nail adams club or we would all get in a

1391
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,358
car and we'd drive to another another

1392
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:54,799
location

1393
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,159
you know and we'd go train in another

1394
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,680
club that might be an hour away and

1395
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,199
there'd be you know 50 bodies there to

1396
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:01,440
train with and each night we'd go to a

1397
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:03,118
different dojo and so it would be all

1398
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,880
day at the club and i'd do that for like

1399
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,960
three weeks straight you know all we did

1400
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,960
was try do you know how he became the

1401
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,639
voice of judo do you have an

1402
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,440
understanding

1403
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,598
of what he's thinking is around like how

1404
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,920
much he dedicates to himself

1405
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,039
to just uh commentating on jude i

1406
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,119
imagine the amount of research required

1407
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,279
but also just like psychologically just

1408
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,160
the excitement he has in his voice

1409
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,079
it it takes work to do that do you have

1410
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,920
an understanding of like what his vision

1411
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,039
is with that he's always been a very

1412
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,599
charismatic animated personnel you know

1413
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,519
very passionate and loud and you know

1414
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,079
funny and the brits are very funny to

1415
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,400
begin with so he's he's you know very

1416
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,480
charismatic but um

1417
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,400
i think after coaching he tried coaching

1418
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,400
he coached the country of wales for a

1419
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,160
while he tried coaching stints in other

1420
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,240
countries he didn't he didn't have a lot

1421
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,399
of success on the coaching side

1422
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:59,039
um developing an olympic champion i know

1423
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,400
that some that was a goal of his that he

1424
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,800
he was a world champion i think it was

1425
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,519
1981 he won two silver medals in the

1426
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,318
olympic games um himself

1427
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:10,239
he went on to coach for a while and had

1428
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:12,639
some political issues with the the

1429
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:14,558
country of of england for a while and

1430
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,400
then left england and went to wales and

1431
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,359
i think he had a coaching somewhere else

1432
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,039
as well

1433
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:21,358
didn't have a lot of success coaching in

1434
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,440
the sport um with athletes not at the

1435
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,960
highest level had a great national team

1436
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,679
and things like that he was really good

1437
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,280
at

1438
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:29,279
at teaching his technique to others

1439
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,480
because he helped me a lot

1440
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,000
um

1441
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,760
but running a program i think was

1442
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,599
difficult for him you know the boy's not

1443
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,839
listening and not having that same kind

1444
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,680
of passion and intensity that he and

1445
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,440
that's why i bonded well with him

1446
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:43,519
because i was all in right i went there

1447
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,760
and whatever he said i did i didn't care

1448
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,358
how hard i didn't care how long i just

1449
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,319
wanted to get as good as i could and so

1450
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:50,078
that's why

1451
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:52,000
he was a good mentor for me

1452
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,200
but now in terms of a

1453
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,519
commentator

1454
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:58,318
he he's very cerebral he just

1455
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,599
he loves judo he he look researches it

1456
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:02,239

1458
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:05,919

1459
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:07,598

1460
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,838
he's done and now this is who he is

1461
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,880
right he he does judo full-time this is

1462
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:14,639
his job can ask you uh a small before we

1463
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,119
return to the actual

1464
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,960
sport the coaching of the sport

1465
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,838
it's a bit of a political question i did

1466
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,838
a whole rant before travis episode

1467
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:26,480
uh

1468
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:28,639
i love neil adams's voice i love

1469
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,039
watching judo and it's really

1470
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:33,118
disappointing to me that

1471
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,279
the ioc

1472
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,640
and whoever is responsible i don't

1473
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,280
understand this

1474
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:41,039
that they don't make it easy for people

1475
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,920
to watch the olympics

1476
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:46,318
uh in replay for years after

1477
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,480
like i can't watch travis's matches i

1478
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:51,279
can't walk like it they make it very

1479
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,280
difficult to watch stuff online

1480
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,760
so what happened is

1481
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,240
i uploaded the travis stevens episode

1482
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,119
and we talked about his ole bishop 2012

1483
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:02,719
match

1484
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:04,640
and it was like one minute of uh

1485
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,318
like a small overlay of the video as

1486
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:09,118
we're talking through it

1487
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:11,679
with like stepping through it and it got

1488
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,240
taken down immediately from youtube that

1489
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:17,598
the whole four-hour conversation

1490
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:20,639
because of that one minute little clip

1491
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:23,680
and the way got taken down automatically

1492
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,799
is because the ioc has that video

1493
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,199
uploaded

1494
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,359
it's set to private but it's uploaded

1495
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,439
so like they have the video

1496
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:32,799
and they choose not to show it it's not

1497
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,400
that they're asking for money or

1498
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,440
whatever they're just not showing it

1499
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,119
anywhere

1500
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,599
they're not showing it through their own

1501
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:42,000
service like an nbc olympics or so on

1502
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,559
there's just so many great human stories

1503
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,039
that the olympics reveals they're just

1504
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,640
not made easily accessible that's the

1505
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,920
olympics charter

1506
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:54,239
is you want to i think uh

1507
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,079
the actual line is to ensure the fullest

1508
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,000
coverage and the widest possible

1509
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,720
audience in the world for the olympic

1510
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,318
games and it seems like to me as a fan

1511
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:04,159
of the olympic games

1512
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,400
we're not getting any of that do you

1513
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:09,358
have an understanding

1514
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,838
of why that is like why we can't watch

1515
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,598
kayla's matches travis's matches super

1516
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:14,799
easily even if we're willing to pay

1517
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,880
money for it

1518
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,720
so you you can't go on the international

1519
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,599
judo federation website right now and

1520
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,598
watch any of the olympic footage no

1521
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,559
no no

1522
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,480
uh so the only thing they have is for

1523
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,920
certain for example teddy renair match

1524
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,079
he lost

1525
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,480
not available anywhere really and that's

1526
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,880
like a dramatic thing so the one thing

1527
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,280
they have is for certain sports at the

1528
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,440
highest level like gymnastics they'll

1529
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,599
have a highlight which is the most

1530
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,559
frustrating thing to me

1531
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,318
because this is what i can't i'm going

1532
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,280
to go like i'm going to try to prevent

1533
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,558
myself from going on the rant but

1534
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,960
you know

1535
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,440
people don't just want to see a

1536
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,480
two-minute highlight of a historic

1537
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,240
moment

1538
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,559
they want to see the build up where the

1539
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:05,279
athlete is standing the nerves the fear

1540
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,599
the confidence you see the build-up to

1541
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,839
the event say it's a gymnastic

1542
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,680
whatever floor routine like

1543
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:13,920
their name is announced they're walking

1544
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:16,000
the coat then they cut to the coach and

1545
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,760
the coach with anticipation and then go

1546
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
to the athlete you want the full 10

1547
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,839
minute thing you don't want a two minute

1548
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,719
highlight of what happened like last

1549
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:26,960
second or whatever it it it's just like

1550
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:30,159
the magic of that full

1551
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,599
story like a lifetime building up to

1552
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:33,519
those 10 minutes

1553
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,599
right that that's the magic of the

1554
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,358
olympics the both the drama and the

1555
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,640
triumph that happens in those moments

1556
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:41,039
and the fact that you can't really

1557
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,279
relive that

1558
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,358
like travis had a bunch of those right

1559
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,440
like he he had a bunch of times he faced

1560
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,000
like world champions right he won and

1561
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,920
lost and and just it's always close it's

1562
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,440
always dramatic right right right and

1563
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,200
none of those are available except like

1564
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,480
maybe uh

1565
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:01,919
the one would be uh armbard or what

1566
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,519
whatever the submission was i forgot the

1567
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,920
choke

1568
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:10,239
yeah the the georgia but most things are

1569
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:12,400
not uh usain bolt the full races not all

1570
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:15,279
of us races are available online

1571
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,280
um the the race with the italian winning

1572
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,079
the 100 meter uh

1573
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,280
the

1574
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,280
track race

1575
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,119
uh this this olympics is not only

1576
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,440
highlight is available from what i saw i

1577
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,440
didn't look too hard so like but

1578
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,960
that the fact that it's not super easily

1579
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,960
accessible if you're willing to pay

1580
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,519
money even but probably should be for

1581
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,159
free is it's heartbreaking to me because

1582
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:40,000
to me the olympics is

1583
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:42,480
like some of the best of humanity

1584
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,159
just like again the hardship they have

1585
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,000
to overcome so like the losses are

1586
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,239
really powerful sure because it's such

1587
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,400
heartbreak but it's also like

1588
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:52,159
the triumph we're losing history yeah

1589
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,880
you're losing history is what you are of

1590
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:58,399
of all the magical moments of your sport

1591
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,000
right it that's that's a it's a sin um

1592
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,280
i gotta

1593
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,639
blame it on television rights and in in

1594
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,319
money that's what it comes down to you

1595
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:09,358
talk on billions and billions of dollars

1596
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:11,759
of television rights paid by nbc here in

1597
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,920
the united states and globally whatever

1598
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,920
the main carriers are and all the other

1599
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,240
nations that are dictating

1600
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,240
what can be replayed and what can't and

1601
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:22,318
it's what it comes down to you know i i

1602
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:25,118
made it i made a uh

1603
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,480
dvd or you know video when i first

1604
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,318
retired from the sport it was called

1605
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,400
fury on the mat it was kind of my story

1606
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:33,119
right and i did it with a friend

1607
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,119
um who was a videographer and we grabbed

1608
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,880
a bunch of my old footage and olympic

1609
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,318
footage and

1610
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,240
somebody said to me you know you can't

1611
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,079
use that olympic footage and you know i

1612
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,759
was young and i had just retired i mean

1613
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,599
i can't use the olympic footage it's not

1614
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,359
it's not the television footage it's my

1615
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,039
buddy who filmed it with his own camera

1616
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:50,960
it's my footage yeah exactly you know

1617
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,000
and they said no if it has olympics in

1618
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,960
it or it's anything to do with the

1619
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,719
olympics the usoc owns it yeah i said

1620
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,119
okay well they said well you should get

1621
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:01,519
to send it to them and let them you know

1622
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:03,440
review it so i sent it to them and i got

1623
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:04,559
i got a bill back i got a thing back

1624
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,679
that said if you want to use this

1625
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,599
footage it's going to be like thirty

1626
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,199
thousand dollars and i said

1627
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,200
but it's only like three minutes i

1628
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,039
spliced it up as much as i could and i

1629
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:15,199
only have highlights in there and yeah

1630
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:17,440
and then i said come on i i i went back

1631
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:18,798
and i negotiated with them but at the

1632
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,039
end of the day i still have to pay like

1633
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:23,599
fifteen thousand dollars just to have a

1634
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:25,119
few minutes of footage in my own film

1635
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,400
this is

1636
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,160
and i'm thinking you wouldn't even have

1637
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,119
that film if i didn't compete in it you

1638
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,960
know like

1639
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,720
you can't you know so that was a it was

1640
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,639
a struggle this is the different like

1641
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:37,199
you have the same in uh jiu jitsu

1642
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:39,519
there's certain organizations ibbh ibj

1643
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,199
jf or like flow grappling and flow

1644
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:43,280
wrestling i understand

1645
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:44,480
i think when it's a business it might

1646
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,079
make sense

1647
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,000
first of all you should actually be good

1648
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,640
at being a business and making money

1649
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,039
which is why for me the ioc doesn't make

1650
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,639
sense like it should be accessible but

1651
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:56,239
it would cost money

1652
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,318
uh if if

1653
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:59,759
i can't buy it like i would would i

1654
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:01,519
would i have to email them for this

1655
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,160
footage and pay thirty thousand dollars

1656
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:06,159
yeah no but the the the the question is

1657
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:08,078
that like the way you run a business is

1658
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:09,679
you make that frictionalness you

1659
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,680
whatever the money is thirty thousand

1660
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:13,679
dollars or thirty dollars you make it

1661
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:16,318
frictionless and easy to pay that money

1662
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:18,639
but anyway i i understand why that might

1663
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:21,039
be the case will flow grappling but to

1664
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:22,639
me the olympics is a special thing for

1665
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:25,679
sure it's like like you said it is

1666
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:27,279
history like there's not even like the

1667
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,358
even the world championships don't

1668
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,798
compare i i understand they're they're

1669
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:33,838
really important but

1670
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:36,400
olympics is history and the

1671
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,239
the stories should certainly belong to

1672
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,519
the athletes if they want to do like

1673
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:44,558
fury on the mat to do their own story or

1674
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:47,599
like on a podcast to talk about the most

1675
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:49,280
uh tragic moment of their career

1676
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,960
it

1677
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,319
uh do you have a sense of how that could

1678
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,559
be fixed

1679
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,000
or no

1680
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,200
the only thing i could think of is you

1681
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,960
know you'd have you'd have to go to the

1682
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:00,639
olympic committee the us olympic

1683
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,400
committee is the place i would start

1684
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:04,639
because the us controls the worldwide

1685
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,160
market when it comes to television we

1686
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,358
pay the most for our television rights

1687
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:09,039
our sponsors

1688
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,199
pay the most for their

1689
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:12,558
uh rights to be associated with the best

1690
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:14,639
team in the world which is the united

1691
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,000
states right so so all the money starts

1692
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:17,920
here um

1693
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,760
i gotta believe there has to be a way to

1694
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,480
get that footage that should be

1695
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,359
accessible to the sports themselves i'm

1696
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,960
surprised it's not but if it's not then

1697
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:28,719
it's because of dollars

1698
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,720
you know it's because people aren't the

1699
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,719
sport itself is not willing to pay

1700
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:35,598
enough money to have it on its

1701
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:37,358
you know accessible to its audience yeah

1702
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,559
it's too cost prohibitive for them to do

1703
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:40,639
it

1704
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,960
no but i think it's also unfortunately

1705
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,039
might be some mixture of incompetence

1706
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,880
and just an old way of doing things

1707
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:48,400
because um

1708
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,400
there's a lot of money to be made on

1709
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,200
television rights where you like live

1710
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,798
show

1711
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:55,598
the event right

1712
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:57,199
but what's not being leveraged is the

1713
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,640
huge amount of money that could be made

1714
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:59,759
on the replay this is what people don't

1715
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,639
understand

1716
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,359
is

1717
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:06,239
do you know how many times

1718
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:08,078
just the tens of millions the the uh of

1719
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:09,039
times that people watch individual

1720
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,480
events

1721
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:12,480
years from now

1722
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,559
you watch like all the videos on youtube

1723
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,559
they're still getting plays hundreds of

1724
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,559
millions of views on stuff that happened

1725
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,079
10 years ago 15 years ago

1726
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,519
that that's really powerful there's a

1727
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,119
lot of opportunity to make a ton of

1728
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:24,480
money sure so it's not that they're

1729
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,720
necessarily

1730
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,719
greedy they're also just not good at

1731
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,078
being greedy no i get what you're saying

1732
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:31,279
yeah it's not the tradition you know

1733
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,599
think about it though it's not

1734
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,160
traditional right for for television

1735
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,160
studios it's non-traditional to go to

1736
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,159
online streaming to

1737
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:41,759
you know online access to information

1738
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,279
it's not hard right because everybody's

1739
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,520
doing it now but

1740
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:50,319
it's it's not typical yeah so it's it

1741
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:52,239
requires for the ioc to operate outside

1742
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:54,400
their comfort zone well i definitely

1743
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:56,639
hope that's the case and i

1744
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,200
since travis's

1745
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,719
video got taken down

1746
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:02,399
it's obvious they have it they have it

1747
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:04,239
on their youtube channel

1748
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,720
so it's like um

1749
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:09,439
i'm i hope i hope that they will just

1750
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:13,358
release it and for money for whatever

1751
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:15,920
but release it and have um

1752
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:17,440
that's that uh history not be erased

1753
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,119
right it'd be wonderful if athletes

1754
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,318
would be could buy there you know even

1755
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,160
if you could buy your own footage you

1756
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:24,159
can't use it commercially you can't but

1757
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:25,838
you can you can buy your own matches and

1758
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:28,159
have them available for yourself or

1759
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:31,199
package the you know the the footage it

1760
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:31,199
would be to be awesome

1761
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:35,119
thank you for that that is uh quite

1762
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:37,920
heartbreaking for me so and i wanted to

1763
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:39,280
talk about it a little bit

1764
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,358
let's go to

1765
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,400
you as an athlete real quick

1766
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:47,039
sure you represented the united states

1767
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,200
at four olympics winning a bronze medal

1768
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:50,239
at two of them

1769
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:53,439
who

1770
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:55,118
or what was the toughest match or moment

1771
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,400
you had in those years

1772
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:01,838
maybe a moment that defined you

1773
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:05,119
that you remember as being particularly

1774
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,119
defining in your career

1775
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:12,480
i would say the the bronze medal match

1776
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:14,798
in atlanta in 96 because up to that

1777
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,039
moment the united states team had not

1778
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:18,400
won a medal had not fought for a medal

1779
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,639
in the games

1780
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,400
we were on our home turf it was my

1781
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,879
second olympic games right so i had

1782
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,798
competed in 92 and i had won two matches

1783
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,599
and and lost in the third round in

1784
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:32,000
barcelona um i didn't make the podium i

1785
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,599
lost to a japanese guy from japan

1786
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,440
um

1787
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,680
but the the gold silver and bronze

1788
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,838
medalist at that olympics in barcelona

1789
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:41,598
were all guys that i had beat in fact

1790
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,119
two of them i was undefeated against in

1791
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,960
my entire career the brazilian and the

1792
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,880
cuban i had never lost to

1793
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,838
so that's when i knew i was capable of

1794
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,200
being

1795
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:52,400
you know on the on the podium at the

1796
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:55,118
olympic games when 96 came around i was

1797
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,960
25 years old i was fairly in my prime i

1798
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,798
had lived in japan for six months my

1799
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,798
technique was at a high level

1800
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:02,480
you know i was i was you know amongst

1801
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:04,159
the best in the world

1802
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,480
um

1803
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:09,199
i lost at that olympics to a guy from

1804
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,960
mongolia it was right before the match i

1805
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:12,798
was supposed to fight against japan so i

1806
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,519
was like anticipating the match against

1807
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:17,519
japan and i got beat by the mongolian

1808
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:19,519
so that was kind of a letdown but

1809
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:21,920
the match for the bronze

1810
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:24,239
you know in front of the hometown crowd

1811
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,480
all of my family all of my friends

1812
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:29,199
everybody who would ever help me in my

1813
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,960
in the sport were in the stands that day

1814
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,480
including all my teammates at brown

1815
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,358
university that were on the wrestling

1816
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,119
team and little my uncles my aunts

1817
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:39,838
everybody everybody was in the stands

1818
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,680
right so it was like the jimmy pedro day

1819
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:43,038
and uh i'm getting goosebumps right now

1820
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:44,159
talking about it

1821
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,079
um

1822
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,598
but it was a match against the brazilian

1823
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,519
for the bronze medal i had beaten the

1824

1848
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,680
it ended up being the only olympic medal

1849
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:44,318
we won one at that games but it was like

1850
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:46,239
a magical moment that defined my career

1851
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:48,079
and solidified myself in like history

1852
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,838

1855
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,960
my defining moment and after that i was

1856
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,480
sold like man i had to go back to the

1857
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,318

1859
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:04,960
all over again i don't care if i have to

1860
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,480
wait four years let's let's do it

1861
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,720
in your career

1862
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,679
the like moments like that

1863
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,959
do you think you love

1864
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:15,199
[Music]

1865
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:17,760
winning or hate losing more

1866
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:20,960
so do you live for those moments

1867
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:24,240
or are you more driven by

1868
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,880
just how much you hate losing

1869
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:28,639
so in order to be a champion my belief

1870
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,200
is that you have to

1871
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:33,519
hate losing more than you like winning

1872
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:36,000
hate losing more than you like winning

1873
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:36,719
but i live for those moments when you do

1874
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,639
win

1875
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:40,558
and what excited me the most in my

1876
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:42,639
career and my when i was

1877
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,880
competing was

1878
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:47,440
i loved being in the finals i love the

1879
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,119
spotlight being on me i can't think of

1880
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,119
too many times in my career of course

1881
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:54,000
there were a few but there weren't too

1882
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:56,720
many times where the chips were down

1883
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,400
like the lights were on and i didn't win

1884
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:00,000
like it was

1885
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,440
i might have lost early in the day and

1886
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,679
didn't make it to the finals or didn't

1887
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,639
make it to the metal rounds but like in

1888
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:08,960
my career i have a ton of golds i have a

1889
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:10,400
ton of bronzes which means

1890
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,880
the lights are on

1891
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,798
and i won and i have very few silvers

1892
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,559
and very few fifths

1893
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:17,838
so i either lost in the early rounds and

1894
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,599
didn't make to the metal rounds in my

1895
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:21,440
younger days or

1896
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:22,720
the spotlight came and i really shined

1897
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,400
because if you look i i don't know how

1898
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,399
many silvers but there wasn't very many

1899
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,760
silver medals in my career that i want

1900
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,440
you know what i mean so

1901
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,319
i just loved that moment i didn't feel

1902
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,480
pressure i loved the crowd i loved being

1903
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:36,558
in the spotlight i didn't have i wasn't

1904
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,000
nervous when it came to the finals or i

1905
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,760
knew i was getting a medal it didn't

1906
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,119
matter you know so it was just me

1907
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,960
against the other guy and that's how i

1908
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,079
always saw it and i just loved that

1909
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,440

probably the most brilliant

1943
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:06,399
human when it comes to

1944
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,798
preparing an athlete physically

1945
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,000

01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,760
when all the chips are down that athlete

1948
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:16,318
will be ready that day and he has a

1949
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,079
system of of training and preparing and

1950
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:19,679

1960
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,519
at the same time you go back and ask

01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,400
ronda rousey about her career right my

1962
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:44,719

brought a russian girl in she did throws

1969
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:57,280
on his cement outside with the little

1970
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,519
crash bag through the russian girl you

1971
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,640
know 100 times that morning and then

1972
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:02,400
every night

1973
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,000
came to boston you know to the training

1974
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,519
center in wakefield trains at night and

1975
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,480
went back and slept at my dad's house

1976
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:08,400
and

1977
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,639
three weeks straight before she went off

1978
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,599
to beijing and he did the same with

1979
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:16,079
kayla he did the same with me like

1980
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,759
he's just his passion is is producing

1981
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,679
athletes the highest level and he knows

1982
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:23,759
how to do it and then

1983
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:25,679
the one side of my dad's

1984
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,520
coaching where i think there's a flora

1985
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,279
weakness is on the mental preparation

1986
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,159
side of the game he wasn't somebody that

1987
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,400
was

1988
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:33,920
um i don't know if he he

1989
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,599
maybe because he wasn't an olympic

1990
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,000
champion himself and wasn't a world

1991
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,000
champion he lacked the confidence in

1992
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,600
helping others be more confident so he's

1993
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,279
more of a

1994
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,120
this is what you need to work on type of

1995
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:48,080
thing he doesn't know how to build the

1996
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:49,519
athletes up to make them feel invincible

1997
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:51,679
and i feel like that's something that i

1998
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,520
was able to give all of the athletes to

1999
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,600
to help them with that visualization

2000
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,880
belief in yourself knowing that you're

2001
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,560
going to win before you step out of the

2002
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,039
mat knowing that we've earned the right

2003
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,239
to victory you know seeing success in

2004
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:05,359
your mind

2005
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,798
having a positive uh mantra that you i'm

2006
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,199
the best in the world nobody's beating

2007
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:10,960
me today type of type of feeling so you

2008
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,879
go out there feeling like king kong when

2009
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,119
you step on the mat that nobody's going

2010
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,759
to stop you you know and so i think the

2011
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:18,960
combination of both of us as coaches

2012
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,439
i'm a

2013
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,759
a lot more technical my dad is good at

2014
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:25,838
letting identifying what they need to do

2015
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,759
for their techniques and what you know

2016
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:29,359
how in strategy how to beat how to beat

2017
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:30,319
opponents and putting game plans

2018
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,640
together

2019
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:34,719
um so combined the two of us made a an

2020
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,480
unbelievable team so he uh he's not

2021
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:38,560
going to let the athlete be soft when

2022
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:41,198
they uh when they enter

2023
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,440
the highest the most difficult uh uh

2024
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:45,358
competitions of their career

2025
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:48,238
so on the mental side

2026
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,719
what's mental preparation look like like

2027
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:53,919
how many years before the olympics

2028
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,600
do you start helping an athlete believe

2029
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,199
that they can win

2030
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,960
an olympic medal

2031
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:00,639
well i think it's got to be a seed in

2032
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,359
that athlete's brain something they want

2033
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,760
to do right nobody

2034
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,839
nobody can quickly get there right it's

2035
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,440
a long process but if your goal if

2036
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,600
you're a national champion or you've

2037
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,119
proven yourself to win it in some

2038
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,320
international tournaments

2039
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:16,640
and you think the olympics is a

2040
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:18,960
possibility for you then defining it as

2041
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,760
hey i want to be on the olympic team

2042
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,198
that would be the first step into

2043
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:27,119
you know into um getting ready and

2044
01:10:25,198 --> 01:10:29,039
you know but you i always make them put

2045
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:30,399
it on paper you know if it really is

2046
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:32,158
your goal then you show me that it's

2047
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:34,000
your goal and put it on paper and commit

2048
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,359
to it i want to be olympic medalist i

2049
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,840
want to be olympic champion i want to go

2050
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:39,439
to the olympics world team member maybe

2051
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,279
junior world team member whatever it is

2052
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:42,879
we we walk before we go to the highest

2053
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:44,238
level but

2054
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,679
if the goal is to go to the olympics

2055
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:47,839
let's let's accomplish these other

2056
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,239
things first right because if we if we

2057
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,920
can accomplish these other things

2058
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:54,079
then we're on our way to getting to the

2059
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,480
ultimate goal which is the olympics

2060
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:58,399
for somebody like kayla for example you

2061
01:10:56,479 --> 01:10:59,599
know she didn't

2062
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:00,960
she didn't

2063
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,880
say that she wanted to be olympic

2064
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,198
champion you know when she first came

2065
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,400
here in 2005. right

2066
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:08,158
we wanted to

2067
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,599
become national champion then we wanted

2068
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:11,679
to be on the world team then we wanted

2069
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,440
to be a world medalist then we our sites

2070
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:15,520
were set on the olympics or the olympic

2071
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:17,359
gold you know so it's having those

2072
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,360
clearly defined goals that are

2073
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:20,880
attainable like they should be a reach

2074
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:22,799
they should be a stretch

2075
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:26,239
but they have to be attainable they

2076
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,560
can't be just a pipe dream you know but

2077
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:30,639
once you put it to paper and if you

2078
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,960
think it's achievable then it's it's

2079
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:36,320
mapping the plan to get there

2080
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:38,640
is there a daily process of visualizing

2081
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:41,119
yourself as an olympic champion or

2082
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,079
national champion yes

2083
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:43,439
it is

2084
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,039
you should do it every either every

2085
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:46,479
night before you go to bed

2086
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:48,800
or every

2087
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:50,319
um before every training session or

2088
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,239
after every training session one of

2089
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:54,158
those three times it should or first

2090
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:55,599
thing you wake up in the morning because

2091
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:57,599
it may be to help some people it

2092
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,360
motivates them to go do what it is they

2093
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,640
they're supposed to do in the day

2094
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:03,119
um

2095
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,480
but the process of visualization is is

2096
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:06,559
to me

2097
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:08,479
is closing your eyes for

2098
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,280
a few moments your brain works really

2099
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:13,439
really fast right and it's actually

2100
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,840
picturing the day

2101
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:17,359
in its entirety from start to finish you

2102
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,039
know from the moment you wake up and you

2103
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:20,399
step on the scale

2104
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:22,158
so the moment you have your breakfast

2105
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,079
and you go through your morning routine

2106
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:25,519
like live the day that you're going to

2107
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:26,559
have at the olympics so whatever it is

2108
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,199
you're trying to do let's say the

2109
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,280
olympic day for example

2110
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:32,879
picture yourself making weight picture

2111
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:34,559
yourself who you're around eating your

2112
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,199
breakfast you know having maybe saying a

2113
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,920
few jokes laughing this is a real day

2114
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:41,759
make it real yeah um going back and

2115
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:44,239
getting packing your judo bag for the

2116
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,000
day you know getting on the bus

2117
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:48,000
driving to the venue

2118
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,039
feel what it's like walking into the

2119
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,560
stadium

2120
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:52,158
you know for the first time going to the

2121
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,080

watching yourself warm up go through

2126
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:02,799
your warm-up routine

walking out of the chute you know into

2128
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,960
the venue going to do that first fight

2129
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:09,519

2130
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,640
opponent coming off the mat high-fiving

2131
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,800

as possible

2136
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,520
you know where all the way to the moment

2137
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,320
where you've just won and you're raising

2138
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,239
your arms in celebration you're bowing

2139
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:28,719
you're hugging your opponent you come

01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,359
you're running around the stadium with

2142
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,039
the flag

2143
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:35,279
you know you you stepped up on the

2144
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:37,760
podium you heard your name olympic

2145
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:38,800
champion jimmy pedro like you heard the

2146
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,960
moment

2147
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,920
the the the metal being put around your

2148
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,439
neck

2149
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,960
picture the people coming up on the

2150
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:47,279
podium with you

2151
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,319
arms around them taking the pictures

2152
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,960
like

2153
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:53,198
the more real you can make it

2154
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,640
even before it ever happens

2155
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:57,678
right

2156
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:59,280
when you do that enough times

2157
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:01,279
i feel that like

2158
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:03,439
pathways get created

2159
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:04,800
for you so that when your your body gets

2160
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,719
to that moment

2161
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,079
and i've been here before this is it

2162
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,239
this is my moment this is what i've

2163
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:11,600
pictured my whole life i'm not nervous

2164
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:14,000
because i've seen this this is gonna

2165
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,079
happen i believe it's possible right and

2166
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,600
i believe the athletes that do that and

2167
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:19,600
make it real enough

2168
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,199
that when they get to that moment

2169
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,640
they go right through there's no

2170
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,238
hesitation

2171
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,159
yeah this is what this is meant to be

2172
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:27,519
this is my destiny this is why i did

2173
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:29,599
everything i did

2174
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,719
versus the ones that don't think about

2175
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,640
it ever but just kind of like hope yeah

2176
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,319
it's not real to them it doesn't feel

2177
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,320
attainable they don't believe it's

2178
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:40,399
possible they haven't committed to

2179
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:42,799
believing it was possible without that

2180
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:45,519
commitment in yourself and that belief

2181
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,079
it can't happen and one thing that uh i

2182
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,320
talked to travis a bit about this

2183
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:52,000
uh you probably worked with him

2184
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,799
on the details of what you're talking

2185
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,399
about

2186
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,560
but he said that you should really

2187
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:00,639
like focus on visualizing like the

2188
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:03,120
sensations

2189
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,800
you feel so like say if you're drinking

2190
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:06,079
coffee or something like that

2191
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,679
you're not

2192
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:09,439
thinking about like

2193
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,920
like observing yourself from a third

2194
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:14,639
person perspective drinking coffee like

2195
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,480
you're you're thinking of how your

2196
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,199
hand will feel when it touches something

2197
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:22,839
warm like you tried to replay the actual

2198
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:25,519
sensations you would feel right so it

2199
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,279
sounds uh kind of strange but meaning

2200
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,679
like you really want to put yourself in

2201
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:32,079
the body as you would experience those

2202
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,920
moments as opposed to like watching

2203
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:37,039
yourself on tv experience in those

2204
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,719
moments like really be inside and yeah

2205
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:41,198
so that means sensations like how does

2206
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,079
it feel when you grip a ghee how does it

2207
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:45,519
you know

2208
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:47,198
um the yeah the the sweating just the

2209
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,440
sensation of sweat

2210
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:51,359
like rolling down your forehead or

2211
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:52,479
whatever like all of those actual

2212
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:54,559
feelings

2213
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:56,319
when i explain it to you yeah like i

2214
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:58,800
guess my body has been through through

2215
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:01,039
it so many times both in my mind and in

2216
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,039
reality that it brings back all of those

2217
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:05,840
same emotions it

2218
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:07,920
i start to get goosebumps my my armpits

2219
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:10,960
start to sweat like i'm living it if

2220
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,158
it's real yeah i'm reliving it now but i

2221
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,239
in your when you're going through the

2222
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:16,719
visualization process

2223
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:19,279
it has to be that real the the smells

2224
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:21,600
the the the taping of the fingers like

2225
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:23,119
the more colorful and the more real you

2226
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,520
can make it

2227
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:27,760
the more believable it is

2228
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,480
so i've been doing this kind of thing

2229
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,640
just

2230
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:33,519
having listened to you enough

2231
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,719
for uh other stuff in life so let's see

2232
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,480
if it works

2233
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:38,158
uh but do you see this kind of

2234
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,119
visualization being useful for other

2235
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:40,879
things

2236
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:42,640
in career and all those kind of things

2237
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,800
all 100

2238
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,119
100 because

2239
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,279
i just know with my own life my own my

2240
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:51,039
own experiences like i

2241
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,639
like my wife sometimes says to me she

2242
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:53,920
says well where do you see yourself in

2243
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,280
like you know

2244
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:59,359
five years from now and five years ago

2245
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,920
i had said to her you know i want to

2246
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:02,559
have my own business i want to have you

2247
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,000
know

2248
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,600
this is the amount of money that i'm

2249
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,119
hoping i can make in a given year like

2250
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,360
you have to have goals for yourself like

2251
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:11,760
is this if you put out there like okay i

2252
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:14,238
want to make a million dollars in a year

2253
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,840
that's a big number like like for me or

2254
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:17,439
for the normal person that like that's a

2255
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,360
really big number you know what i mean

2256
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,960
like it's not especially when you're not

2257
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:23,599
making that much at the time it's a

2258
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:25,198
super big number right so having those

2259
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,679
goals for yourself like

2260
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:28,960
it it won't happen and it's not possible

2261
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,279
unless you dream

2262
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,679
it's possible and think it that it's

2263
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,439
possible and then it doesn't magically

2264
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:37,520
happen and maybe it doesn't happen in

2265
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:39,759
five years maybe happens in 10 at least

2266
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,880
you're on the path to getting there

2267
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,199
you know what i mean and i said i want

2268
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:46,000
to own my own business i want to control

2269
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:48,000
my own destiny i want to be my own boss

2270
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,279
i want to make my own decisions like

2271
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,439
these are the things that i told her i

2272
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:52,880
wanted to do and and now

2273
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:54,639
i'm at that point

2274
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,480
you know where you know i work for

2275
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,480
myself i have my own company i have

2276
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:00,000
partners obviously but like

2277
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:01,359
if i want to pick up and go somewhere

2278
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,439
for a week i just do i have to ask

2279
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:05,679
permission to do it right that that's

2280
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:07,919
what life freedom right that's what i

2281
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:09,039
like yeah it's so and all of it starts

2282
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,679
with a dream

2283
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:12,719
in in the same with my dojo when i first

2284
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,960
opened

2285
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:17,198
so i ran a dojo for a long time and i

2286
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,760
only had 60 students always like 40 to

2287
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:21,359
60 students had fluctuated

2288
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,840
and i sit there and say why can't i get

2289
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:25,679
more people in my door right so i hired

2290
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:28,719
consultants to come in and look at my

2291
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,239
business and say why right and

2292
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,239
they came in and said well this place is

2293
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:33,839
really intimidating like if i was coming

2294
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:35,839
in off the street the first thing i see

2295
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,600
is this big olympic champion on the wall

2296
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,880
and i see this training that's going on

2297
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,120
and these guys are flying through the

2298
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,480
air and landing hard and as a white belt

2299
01:18:41,119 --> 01:18:44,399
you're telling me that's the class for

2300
01:18:42,479 --> 01:18:45,759
me like no way i'm not going to do that

2301
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:47,359
so like i listened to these people i

2302
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,360
said you're right

2303
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:51,759
and you know the training was hour and a

2304
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:53,119
half two hours long people can't handle

2305
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,400
an hour and a half or two hours training

2306
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:56,800
when i first walked in the door so i had

2307
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:58,559
to restructure all my programming

2308
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,320
i had to look at the way i was offering

2309
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,199
my my curriculum at my school and i had

2310
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:03,599
to make

2311
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:05,439
levels for everybody right like

2312
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,600
here's my four to six year old class

2313
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:09,839
here's my six to 13 year old class

2314
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,520
there's my all my beginner classes they

2315
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,719
don't mix in with the advanced people

2316
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,199
and like

2317
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:17,198
you know and i had to learn how to

2318
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:18,960
make it accessible for everybody instead

2319
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:20,319
of just the the people that wanted to

2320
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:22,399
train hard and

2321
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:23,759
then the challenge was okay if you can

2322
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:24,879
have a lot of people in your dojo

2323
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,400
training

2324
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,159
it's a recreational school you can't

2325
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:29,679
produce champions at that same school

2326
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:31,198
that's what i was told

2327
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:33,199
so then i got all my black belts

2328
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:34,960
together and i said listen this is my

2329
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:37,678
vision this is what i want i want to

2330
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,399
have a club that has over 200 judo only

2331
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:43,600
athletes no jiu jitsu no karate nothing

2332
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:45,759
judo only i want over 200 people

2333
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,920
and in the inside of that dojo i want to

2334
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,000
have olympic champions and i want to

2335
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,000
have recreational like little kids five

2336
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,238
and six years old older guys in their

2337
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,840
70s training i don't care but i want the

2338
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:57,919
spectrum of recreational and i want

2339
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,199
olympic champions the only way to do

2340
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,119
that is

2341
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:03,439
to take your instructors and say you're

2342
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:04,880
going to do this define the roles who's

2343
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:06,559
going to be the recreational coach who's

2344
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,480
going to be the competitive coach how do

2345
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,080
we separate these programs

2346
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:11,599
and lo and behold that was my vision

2347
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:13,119
that i shared with all of them and that

2348
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,760
was back in

2349
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:16,840
2006

2350
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,199
and by

2351
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,119
2012 we've got olympic champion kayla

2352
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,279
harrison we have over 200 people at the

2353
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,439
school we have a successful thriving

2354
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:26,639
business but it doesn't happen without

2355
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:27,919
that vision

2356
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:29,760
a plan

2357
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,119
and believing that

2358
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,400
it's possible believing that it's

2359
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:35,279
possible

2360
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:37,759
i don't know but i personally have uh

2361
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:40,880
on top of that

2362
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:43,600
almost like very specific visions of of

2363
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,880
a future like uh um

2364
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,840
i don't know what an because i don't

2365
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,840
want to give actual examples

2366
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,960
because uh for several reasons

2367
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:55,520
one of which is just people will

2368
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,840
as they often have they often will in

2369
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:00,159
your life they'll just uh

2370
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,159
laugh at it a little bit like that seems

2371
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:04,719
silly

2372
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,079
and i don't i'm very hesitant to share

2373
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,399
certain things like that with people

2374
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:11,198
because they'll

2375
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:13,920
i mean um i'm with johnny ive

2376
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:16,559
who's the lead designer in apple like

2377
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:19,199
you want that dream that little flame to

2378
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,440
not people will put that flame out too

2379
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:25,678
easily even people that love you

2380
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:25,678
so i have very specific kind of

2381
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:29,519
visions like well maybe for travis it

2382
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:31,198
would be like

2383
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:34,239
a specific opponent or something like

2384
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:36,238
holy bishop like very specific

2385
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:37,759
very specific situation of what's going

2386
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:40,718
to happen not just like i want to be

2387
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:43,039
olympic champion but very specific like

2388
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:45,198
almost silly situations

2389
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:46,800
yeah like the dynamic between travis and

2390
01:21:45,198 --> 01:21:49,439
ollie bishop or something like maybe

2391
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:52,480
visualize that for me that helps because

2392
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:54,879
it makes it all real even more real it's

2393
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:56,718
not like some big goal like a million

2394
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,239
dollars or something like that

2395
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,639
which is also really important to have

2396
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:01,759
because you can measure it and so on but

2397
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:03,840
the

2398
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,600
it's it's just like you belong in those

2399
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,440
situations

2400
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,760
just believing you belong right right

2401
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:12,079
right in there it's not that they could

2402
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,000
be you yeah it could be you and that for

2403
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:16,960
some reason that really helps me the the

2404
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,679
little details sure the like visualizing

2405
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,119
is

2406
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,239
most of them are almost a little bit

2407
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:23,198
funny

2408
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:26,638
like the the focusing on the funniness

2409
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:28,960
it's the the mundaneness of it

2410
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:30,560
uh helps me a lot and all the people

2411
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,760
that have done great things they're just

2412
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,639
human too

2413
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:38,719
correct and i think a lot of people

2414
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:39,679
overestimate who others are right and

2415
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,158
don't

2416
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:44,319
and and sell themselves too short yeah

2417
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:45,839
because at the end of the day everybody

2418
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:48,559
started

2419
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,400
like everybody else really i mean we did

2420
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,000
you know we were all infants we couldn't

2421
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:54,158
walk we couldn't talk we couldn't do

2422
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,600
anything we learned along the way but

2423
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:57,519
and i think that's the one thing that i

2424
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,320
realized is that

2425
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:03,440
and i tell this to to my athletes but i

2426
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:06,880
also tell it to my recreational students

2427
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:08,879
nobody is better than you are nobody

2428
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,119
unless you allow them to be

2429
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:15,039
right if you really want something to

2430
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:18,238
happen then like map the plan

2431
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:20,560
believe in yourself decide and no

2432
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:22,399
full out you're going to fail a lot

2433
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,840
you're going to get beat down you're

2434
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:25,839
going to have losses you're going to

2435
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,279
have struggles like and i think that's

2436
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,560
the one thing with social media today is

2437
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:30,800
that

2438
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,920
everybody sees everybody succeed nobody

2439
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,079
posts the picture when they're on the

2440
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:36,079
ground in failure losing like nobody

2441
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:37,679
nobody sees when you broke your arm and

2442
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,439
you had to go through rehab you know

2443
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,440
whatever it is like had your injuries

2444
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:43,678
and you're on your couch watching tv and

2445
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:45,678
you were suffering and you were like

2446
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:47,840
everybody has really really dark bad

2447
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:50,158
moments in their life and defeats and

2448
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,880
losses and suffrage

2449
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,638
and

2450
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,079
it's only at the end after they've

2451
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,600
recovered from all of that they've

2452
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:57,039
reclined up the mountain and they've

2453
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,039
gone to the pinnacle that you see them

2454
01:23:57,039 --> 01:24:01,359
on social media with the metal

2455
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,920
right but everybody else

2456
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:06,319
like struggles and was human and

2457
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,920
failed many many times and

2458
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:10,238
you know

2459
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,920
convincing yourself that you're capable

2460
01:24:10,238 --> 01:24:13,519
i think is the first start with

2461
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,800
everything do you need people in your

2462
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,480
life that

2463
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,880
believe in you or should

2464
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:20,638
most of it come from within yourself

2465
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,440
i think most of it has to come in from

2466
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:24,719
from it it certainly helps but it has to

2467
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:27,198
come from you

2468
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,880
first you have to be driven like other

2469
01:24:27,198 --> 01:24:30,960
people can help you

2470
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,039
define where you want to go and help you

2471
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:35,198
get there and encourage you and can

2472
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:37,920
support you and you know whether it's

2473
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:39,839
resource wise or with connections and

2474
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:42,319
like they can help with that path but

2475
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,880
that that first part has to come from

2476
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:46,399
you it has to be your passion your

2477
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,400
desire your

2478
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:49,839
it's your commitment to yourself you're

2479
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:52,319
the one that's going to ultimately make

2480
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:54,319
all the sacrifices to do it so you ha it

2481
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:56,479
has to be your decision not your parents

2482
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:59,198
not your spouse's something that you're

2483
01:24:56,479 --> 01:25:01,678
really motivated to do

2484
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:03,198
let me ask you about travis kayla and

2485
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:06,480
maybe a few of the other athletes you've

2486
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:08,559
been involved with so first travis

2487
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:11,839
travis stevens

2488
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,760
olympic silver medalist

2489
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:17,039
three-time olympian

2490
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:20,719
2008 2012 2016.

2491
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:23,600
what makes travis stevens great what

2492
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:26,560
makes him so successful what makes him

2493
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,920
unique in your mind as an athlete

2494
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,560
through all the hardship he had to

2495
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,679
overcome

2496
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:32,400
[Music]

2497
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:36,079
through his uh weird looking say inagi

2498
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:37,839
that uh eventually worked out nicely

2499
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:40,158
to the the full richness of his

2500
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,760
personality in the context of all the

2501
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:44,879
other great athletes you've coached what

2502
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,880
makes him special

2503
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:48,880
his fight

2504
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:51,279
travis has fight and you know the first

2505
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:53,679
time i ever saw travis stevens was in

2506
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,359
like recognized him maybe i had seen him

2507
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:57,760
before as a younger boy or something but

2508
01:25:55,359 --> 01:26:00,880
like actually recognized him as

2509
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,119
i brought a group of young kids to italy

2510
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:06,239
for a competition in a training camp and

2511
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:09,039
it was this program called u23 elite and

2512
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:11,678
i picked hand-picked 20 kids

2513
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:14,960
to go to this event and it was the first

2514
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:16,960
time i coached uh an international team

2515
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:19,920
and i had never seen travis fight before

2516
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:21,119
compete train anything and during this

2517
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,960
competition

2518
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:26,559
you know he's an 81 kilo player i think

2519
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:29,198
he was maybe like 18 years old um

2520
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,199
17 18 years old and

2521
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:33,279
it was a really hard european event and

2522
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:34,638
i think travis won three matches and he

2523
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:36,319
lost two

2524
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:37,199
but what stood out the most to me was

2525
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:39,198
like

2526
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:41,678
the fight he had in him

2527
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:43,839
he was scrapping every fight like he

2528
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:46,239
scrapped hard like he wanted to win more

2529
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:48,000
than any of them right he didn't win but

2530
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:50,319
he wanted to win more and i and i

2531
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,158
noticed that right away and then i also

2532
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:53,359
noticed that after he lost his second

2533
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:55,759
match and he was eliminated from the

2534
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:56,880
tournament i saw how disappointed he was

2535
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,560
in himself

2536
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,239
like he actually thought he was supposed

2537
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,520
to beat those people even though he was

2538
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:03,119
like 17

2539
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,960
right he's fighting against grown men

2540
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:07,039
that are you know a high level judo much

2541
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,800
higher than he was and i said to him i

2542
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:10,639
said hey son like

2543
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,480
don't worry man you got a long career

2544
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,560
ahead of you like i'm glad you're

2545
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:16,559
disappointed but there's so many things

2546
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,639
you don't know and so many skills you

2547
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,639
don't have the fact that you were able

2548
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:22,000
to hold your own and scrap like that

2549
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:24,880
like you've got a good future and i

2550
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,039
remember calling my friend jason morris

2551
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,600
after that tournament and i said hey man

2552
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:31,679
do you ever hear this kid travis stevens

2553
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:34,000
he says no why i said man that kid's got

2554
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:35,760
some fighting him right and i said that

2555
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,119
i said that to jason at the time i said

2556
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,119
that kid's got some fight in him man

2557
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:40,639
he's pretty talented you know and that's

2558
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:41,519
how it started

2559
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:43,039
um

2560
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,040
but so i saw that i meant when he was

2561
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:47,760
young but the other thing was

2562
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:50,238
travis like there's not there's no such

2563
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,760
thing as hard work to that guy

2564
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:53,759
if you tell him to put his head through

2565
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,199
the wall and help and that's how he wins

2566
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,000
he'll go put his head through the wall

2567
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:59,279
he'll do whatever it takes

2568
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,880
for him to do

2569
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:03,679
to achieve success

2570
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:05,039
and he hates

2571
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:08,000
failure

2572
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:09,840
more than he likes winning 100

2573
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,158
he always has he punishes himself when

2574
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:14,960
he doesn't do well he makes himself work

2575
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:15,839
harder he goes and you know

2576
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,239
just

2577
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:20,239
abuses himself when he doesn't when he

2578
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:22,158
doesn't succeed because he's so

2579
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:22,879
heartbroken and disappointed in himself

2580
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:24,399
so

2581
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,239
that's a trait that i think all of the

2582
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:28,158
athletes that i work with

2583
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:30,158
like closely though they all had that

2584
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:31,279
same trait they hated losing more than

2585
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:33,279
anything they would they would break

2586
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:35,039
their arm they'd fall on their head you

2587
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:36,800
know they'd rather get hit by a car than

2588
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:38,800
lose a judo tournament yeah you know and

2589
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,639
then and as a result then they all had

2590
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,159
fight and they all were willing to train

2591
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:44,560
they were willing to listen and they

2592
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:46,158
would do anything for victory you know

2593
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,520
within you know within the rules i'm not

2594
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:49,119
talking about taking drugs or anything

2595
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,320
like that but they would

2596
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:51,760
they'd give a hundred percent of

2597
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:53,359
themselves

2598
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,039
for victory and

2599
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:57,439
you know travis was somebody that when

2600
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:58,880
he was down he found a way to do to get

2601
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:00,638
better doing something else if he

2602
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,400
couldn't do standing that's when he

2603
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,000
started jiu jitsu he couldn't go on his

2604
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:06,319
feet anymore he couldn't stand up and

2605
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,079
train i might as well go learn jiu jitsu

2606
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:10,399
and get good on the ground right because

2607
01:29:08,079 --> 01:29:12,559
i can you know so he always found a way

2608
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:14,238
no matter what obstacle was in his way

2609
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:16,159
he just went around it

2610
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:18,000
so what about the

2611
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:20,158
interesting to get your perspective

2612
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,119
because i know travis's perspective is

2613
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:24,079
the

2614
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:25,198
just the number of injuries

2615
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:27,600
like what do you make of the

2616
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:29,919
perseverance through all the injuries he

2617
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,239
had to overcome specifically like you

2618
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:33,279
just observing this creature that you've

2619
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:35,678
coached

2620
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:38,319
i mean he seems to not see the injuries

2621
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:41,279
as a problem he's just like just like

2622
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:43,198
you said head through the wall it's like

2623
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:44,719
what like when i when we were talking

2624
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:47,359
about injuries

2625
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:49,439
he kind of he doesn't even see the

2626
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:51,920
injuries themselves as the problem

2627
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:54,879
because he thinks that the injuries you

2628
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:56,480
know you heal back stronger

2629
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,199
i forget the exact quote but he said

2630
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:00,479
like

2631
01:29:57,198 --> 01:30:01,519
my body is is now less injury prone than

2632
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,678
most of

2633
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,440
anyone else because i've already broken

2634
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:07,119
i've broken everything and it's just

2635
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:08,479
growing back stronger

2636
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:10,880
like because i asked them something like

2637
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:11,919
do you regret sort of pushing your body

2638
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,760
to

2639
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,039
all of those places that resulted in

2640
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:17,840
those injuries

2641
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:19,439
he was his response was like no i'm

2642
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:21,760
stronger now

2643
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:24,000
so i don't know if that's justification

2644
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:26,320
but that certainly describes a mindset

2645
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:29,920
that yeah head through the wall

2646
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:32,399
that doesn't uh it's almost not

2647
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:35,119
dramatic like look i got this injury

2648
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:37,519
it's so i'm so like brave and special

2649
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:39,920
for overcoming this injury he's just

2650
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:41,600
he's just that's part of the job and he

2651
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,440
gets the job done

2652
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,079
but like that job evolves a lot of

2653
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:48,079
injuries one of the talks i gave travis

2654
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:49,920
and that team at that at that particular

2655
01:30:48,079 --> 01:30:51,600
tournament was at the very beginning of

2656
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,800
the camp after the tournament i said to

2657
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,560
them listen

2658
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,480
my vision i shared my vision with them i

2659
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,239
said my vision is

2660
01:30:56,479 --> 01:31:00,959
you know in seven years because that was

2661
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:02,479
2005. i said in seven years i want to

2662
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,800
have a u.s team

2663
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:06,158
that steps on the mat that is ready to

2664
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,239
kick ass

2665
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:10,000
and in order to get there all of you

2666
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:11,519
guys can be a part of this team and part

2667
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,600
of this process but in order to get

2668
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,360
there you guys have to be the first ones

2669
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,600
to practice you have to be the last ones

2670
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:19,198
to leave because we have to work harder

2671
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:22,000
than the rest of the world because we're

2672
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:24,158
up against all odds i said i am sick of

2673
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,719
america being a laughing stock of judo

2674
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:28,638
and being the first round easy match

2675
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:30,960
warm-up for everybody else

2676
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:33,199
i said if you get injured you're not

2677
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:36,000
going to be on the side with with you

2678
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:37,599
know with a ice bag on taking off rounds

2679
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,359
and then get back on the mat the next

2680
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,199
day and tell me you're okay if you can

2681
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:42,559
train the next day you can train today

2682
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:44,399
so there's no injury the only time

2683
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,400
you're leaving this dojo is if the

2684
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:48,879
ambulance has to take you out of here

2685
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:51,359
you know i and i do think subliminally

2686
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:53,440
travis bought into that message and

2687
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:54,719
heard that message then he said if i'm

2688
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:57,279
going to be a champion that's the way

2689
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,920
i'm going to do it and he did and he

2690
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:02,800
embodied it he lived it man there were

2691
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:05,119
many times in europe where i said dude

2692
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,960
just tape it up go go off to the side

2693
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,399
just take the day off like take the rest

2694
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,760
of the day off you're beat up you can't

2695
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:11,279
do it he says no i'm going to tape it up

2696
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,639
i'm going to tell you no

2697
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:15,519
you don't need to right now and he said

2698
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:17,039
no sensei i'm doing it i'm you know

2699
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,520
the ambulance isn't taking me out it's

2700
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:22,079
just just my wrist it's just my ankle

2701
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:23,199
it's just my it's just my ankle you know

2702
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:26,399
i love it

2703
01:32:23,198 --> 01:32:28,960
yeah what about the so the other really

2704
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,399
big thing is you comment on a little bit

2705
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:33,760
is the weight cut

2706
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:37,039
so early in his career he was 81 kg

2707
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:38,800
and that was presumably not so difficult

2708
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:41,679
but later in his career

2709
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:43,840
his 81 kg and it's becoming more and

2710
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:46,480
more difficult so

2711
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:48,639
that's that's the other thing with him

2712
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:50,479
is uh so i've known a lot of

2713
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:52,880
really really tough people at the

2714
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:55,359
highest levels broken by the weight cut

2715
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,840
like that can break the toughest minds

2716
01:32:55,359 --> 01:33:00,399
and it doesn't seem to have broken him

2717
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:03,199
and he's delivered on it often

2718
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:04,799
on like insane way cuts

2719
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:06,479
so um

2720
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,560
just as a coach what do you think about

2721
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:10,559
his particular his mind and the

2722
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,800
challenge of the way cut

2723
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:15,039
it was part of his process it was part

2724
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:18,639
of his way of getting ready for battle

2725
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:20,639
suffering yeah it really was and if i'm

2726
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:22,560
going to suffer this much then i'm going

2727
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:24,079
to make my opponents pay yeah for all

2728
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,320
the suffering that i went through to get

2729
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:27,359
here yeah that was his mindset

2730
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:29,599
um

2731
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:31,679
later on in his career you're right like

2732
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,039
a lot of times travis he would never

2733
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:34,719
step on a scale

2734
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:36,319
you know until he got to the tournament

2735
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:37,439
you know and even when he'd get to the

2736
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:39,759
tournament

2737
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:42,399
like he'd weigh like 90 kilos he'd show

2738
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:45,119
up at the tournament nine kilos over

2739
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:47,519
i'm like you have to but i never it was

2740
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:49,198
just an expectation of making weight

2741
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,679
not making weight was never an option

2742
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:53,599
for any of our athletes and travis knew

2743
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:56,000
it and he said

2744
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:58,079
as a professional my job is to make

2745
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
weight if i don't make weight he you

2746
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:01,198
know he he was never going to allow that

2747
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,679
to happen and he was never going to

2748
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:06,079
allow us to come to him and say hey

2749
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:08,319
i told you you know because he

2750
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:10,079
losing wasn't an option making a weight

2751
01:34:08,319 --> 01:34:12,238
wasn't not making weight was not an

2752
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:14,158
option for him ever either but you know

2753
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,238
a lot of times he wouldn't even

2754
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:18,158
he'd be nine kilos over on the plane

2755
01:34:16,238 --> 01:34:20,000
going over to the tournament and have to

2756
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:22,960
make weight three days later you know

2757
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,800
and he didn't break 86 kilos

2758
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,719
until the day before the tournament like

2759
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:29,039
he had five kilos over the day before

2760
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:30,880
that was his way but he would do

2761
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:32,639
three workouts you know wake up in the

2762
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,000
morning work out then he'd eat then he'd

2763
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:36,400
work out in the afternoon then he'd eat

2764
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,840
again then he'd work out again at night

2765
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:39,119
and then he'd reward himself hey i

2766
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:42,239
worked out three times today he'd go

2767
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:44,238
have a you know a mountain dew yeah you

2768
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:46,238
know or chocolate bar you know and then

2769
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:49,759
he's next morning he's uh you know back

2770
01:34:46,238 --> 01:34:53,198
up to 87 and he would never touch weight

2771
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:55,760
until the morning of lance that that's a

2772
01:34:53,198 --> 01:34:58,638
when he that he wasn't on weight for

2773
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:00,639
more than like five minutes

2774
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:03,440
his process would break a lot of people

2775
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:05,760
so the fact that he got the job done is

2776
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:08,079
not just the job done but every single

2777
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,000
time he got the job done and i made

2778
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:12,000
those athletes fight

2779
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,399
we would fight in paris we would do a

2780
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,359
camp for a week double session camp for

2781
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:18,079
a week

2782
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:19,759
he'd be seven kilos over have to fight

2783
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:21,519
the next weekend

2784
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,199
we're talking two or three days later

2785
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,719
you know so not only did he make the

2786
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:28,158
weight but he did a grueling training

2787
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:30,079
camp twice a day and and then cut weight

2788
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:31,839
and then fought again then did another

2789
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:33,439
camp for a week in double session

2790
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,920
training camp and then fought on the

2791
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:37,678
third weekend in a row and our athletes

2792
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,359
went through hell you know all of our

2793
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:40,719
athletes went through hell because on

2794
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:43,198
the tour

2795
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:45,359
around the world they fought in every

2796
01:35:43,198 --> 01:35:46,479
event they did every camp they fought in

2797
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:48,319
every event

2798
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:50,158
whereas most of the other teams like

2799
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:51,920
japan comes in and fights in paris then

2800
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:53,679
they go home you know they maybe do a

2801
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,359
camp for three days then they go home

2802
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:57,279
they don't stay in europe for four or

2803
01:35:55,359 --> 01:35:59,279
five weeks straight and fighting every

2804
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:01,359
tournament and when you get to germany

2805
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:02,719
the germans skip the french open they

2806
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:04,719
skip the camp in france they're just

2807
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:06,239
getting ready for germany our athletes

2808
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:07,439
already had two competitions two

2809
01:36:06,238 --> 01:36:09,678
training camps

2810
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:10,960
two three weight cuts now and then so

2811
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:12,960
they're not a hundred percent when they

2812
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,198
fight in germany but that's all part of

2813
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,719
the experience they need the training

2814
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:18,799
that they need that they don't get here

2815
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:20,960
in the in in this country and all of

2816
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,360
those were just preparation for our

2817
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:25,039
world championships or our olympic games

2818
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:26,399
so by the time our athletes got to those

2819
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:29,519
tournaments

2820
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:30,879
they felt so strong so rested so like

2821
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,880
man this guy

2822
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,480
that felt like a monster in germany

2823
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:37,118
feels like nothing today

2824
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:39,039
because you're fully rested now you know

2825
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:41,039
but part of the challenge is because the

2826
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:44,000
american team is smaller

2827
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:45,359
and more i mean just smaller

2828
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,600
is um

2829
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:51,118
you know all the different places you go

2830
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:54,400
for to do the weight cut to do the diet

2831
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:57,198
to do the preparation or the recovery

2832
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:58,879
there's like that process changes

2833
01:36:57,198 --> 01:37:00,479
every time

2834
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,480
so it's you're basically have to

2835
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:03,678
improvise a lot oh yeah you show up to a

2836
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:05,279
hotel

2837
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,639
and how you do the weight cut you don't

2838
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:08,238
know and this is the different weather

2839
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:10,400
conditions it's not

2840
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:12,399
it's like um

2841
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:14,079
so what is it rocky versus drago right

2842
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:16,000
right right so you don't have you have

2843
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:17,600
to just improvise and that that's also a

2844
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,880
fascinating part of the american judo

2845
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,400
story which is like you have to

2846
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,639
improvise more well

2847
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:24,559
i was funny because when i it was 1990

2848
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:27,199
and it was at the goodwill games

2849
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:29,280
right and we were it was a u.s olympic

2850
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:31,359
committee type event and so we're on the

2851
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:33,198

american team and we're going to the

2854
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,800
judo competition but we're on the bus

2855
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,639
with the swim team i'm sorry we're going

2856
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:42,480
to the venue where we're staying you

2857
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:45,039
know i remember being like by ourselves

2858
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:46,399
with no staff no no no manager no coach

2859
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:50,319
we'll just buy ourselves going to fight

2860
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:51,920
in russia right and uh

2861
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:53,920
and the swim team's on there with their

2862
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:55,840
full sweats and their staff and like

2863
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,199
their managers and i i heard the lady

st petersburg russia so

2867
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:04,799
i heard the little girl on the team she

2868
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,239
goes up the coast she goes coach um

2869
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,079

therapist to my room at 10 a.m you know

2871
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:12,158

01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:14,880
i looked it i mean jason

2873
01:38:12,158 --> 01:38:17,118

she

2875
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:20,559
yeah wouldn't even have a staff like

2876
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:23,520
what the hell is going on here you know

2877
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:25,199
what a difference in yeah sporting you

2878
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,239
know different sports within the same

2879
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:28,799
country

2880
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:30,718
you know and but that i mean not to

2881
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,480
romanticize things but that you do

2882
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,158
represent the spirit of the olympics

2883
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:35,439
when you're kind of

2884
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:37,839
the the

2885
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:40,719
improvisational nature of it because it

2886
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:42,560
it is just you you and sometimes you and

2887
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:45,039
the coach and just

2888
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,520
pure guts and

2889
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:51,279
you against the world with no money the

2890
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:54,639
warrior spirit the warrior spirit

2892
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:59,039
being in two olympics beating some of

2893
01:38:57,118 --> 01:39:00,880
the best people in the world

2894
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:02,158
facing some of the best people in the

2895
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,159
world and

2896
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:06,000
just barely losing

2897
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:08,000
what did it feel like to you as a coach

2898
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,920
to see travis stevens win the silver

2899
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,279
medal

2900
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,880
electric

2901
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:14,479
uh like

2902
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:16,719

2903
01:39:14,479 --> 01:39:19,279
2012 in london

2904
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:21,198

01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:24,399
died i'm not gonna be i'm not gonna lie

2906
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:26,079
to you like the ole bishop match not no

2907
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:27,759
just seeing travis not finish on the

2908
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:28,719
podium period

2909
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,960
you know

2910
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:33,520
in the only bishop match i thought he

2911
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:35,279
won regardless of who won and who lost

2912
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:37,119
he just left everything he had on that

2913
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:38,800
mat right 10 minutes of

2914
01:39:37,118 --> 01:39:41,679
probably a 20-something minute match but

2915
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:43,360
10 minutes of fighting actually right

2916
01:39:41,679 --> 01:39:44,719
he left everything he had he wanted to

2917
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:46,639
be in the olympic finals he wanted to be

2918
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:49,198
olympic champion and when he didn't get

2919
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:51,359
that opportunity he lost everything he

2920
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:52,559
he drained himself he cried for 45

2921
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:54,238
minutes straight

2922
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,239
i couldn't regroup them i couldn't get

2923
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:57,599
them up i said travis you've got to stop

2924
01:39:56,238 --> 01:40:00,158
you're crying you've got to get off the

2925
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,960
floor we've got a bronze medal fight

2926
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:02,879
like

2927
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,880
if you don't recover you're not going to

2928
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,440
perform well and he just didn't care

2929
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:09,520
like it was gold or nothing and so when

2930
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:11,198
he walked out against the canadian boy

2931
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,880
he had beaten the canadian i think at

2932
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:15,039
that time he had beaten that canadian

2933
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:17,039
every single time except for that bronze

2934
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:19,279
medal match but he just didn't have the

2935
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:21,359
fight in him anymore he left it all in

2936
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:23,359
the match in the bishop match so to see

2937
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:24,960
him come back with zero right we just

2938
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:26,880
had a team where

2939
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,319
his best friend marty malloy won a

2940
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,118
bronze medal

2941
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:31,759
right

2942
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:33,519
then the day after travis fights kayla

2943
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:35,039
harrison goes and wins her first gold

2944
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,119
medal right our first ever goal so we

2945
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:38,719
have a gold and a bronze he's his

2946
01:40:37,118 --> 01:40:41,279
training partner wins a gold his best

2947
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:42,480
friend from growing up wins a bronze he

2948
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:45,679
has nothing

2949
01:40:42,479 --> 01:40:48,559
right to see him for four years

2950
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:50,960
go through hell like literally like all

2951
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,800
of his injuries every training camp and

2952
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,520
then forget the humiliation because

2953
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,679
every time any reporter ever came to my

2954
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:59,360

01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,800
she is

3061
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,480
one of if not the greatest american

3062
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:39,440
judoka ever

3063
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:43,279
uh two-time gold medalist

3064
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:45,519
2010 world champion 2010 first senior

worlds senior worlds

3066
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:51,280
what makes

3067
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:54,000
kayla special what makes her so great

3068
01:44:51,279 --> 01:44:55,920
what made this champion

3069
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,439
it's a combination of of

3070
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:00,079
a lot of things

3071
01:44:57,439 --> 01:45:02,399
one was obviously kayla's mental

3072
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:03,760
toughness right to overcome what she

3073
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:06,799
overcame

3074
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,920
you know this is a girl who

3075
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,440
you know let

3076
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,760
let's i don't say forget about the

3077
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:13,519
sexual abuse but the the fact that she

3078
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:15,840
had to go through that in life and and

3079
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:17,679
learned how to compartmentalize that and

3080
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:19,840
keep that off as a separate part of her

3081
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:20,960
brain you know and forget about it and

3082
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:23,199
move on

3083
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:26,079
that took an incredible team to help her

3084
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:28,879
do that and my dad was a huge part of

3085
01:45:26,079 --> 01:45:31,198
her accomplishing that so for people who

3086
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:34,079
don't know we should comment and say

3087
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:36,158
that kayla had to go through trauma

3088
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:38,238
in her earlier life

3089
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:40,559
through sexual abuse and had to overcome

3090
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:43,118
that through the whole process of

3091
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:45,199
of becoming a champion as well right

3092
01:45:43,118 --> 01:45:47,359
because she had zero self-esteem zero

3093
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:48,559
self-worth she was the lowest of lows

3094
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:49,519
and and

3095
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,719
um

3096
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:53,679
you know didn't even want to be on this

3097
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:56,079
earth right so she she was

3098
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:57,600
traumatized obviously for

3099
01:45:56,079 --> 01:45:58,960
and getting her the right help and

3100
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,400
surrounding her with the right people

3101
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:03,118
who could help her

3102
01:46:00,399 --> 01:46:05,198
get through that and and be by her side

3103
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:06,960
as she's getting through that and

3104
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:08,879
letting her know and reaffirming that

3105
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,800
she's doing the right thing and she made

3106
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:12,480
the right decision and she should have

3107
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,079
zero guilt and

3108
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:15,519
you know this doesn't define her it

3109
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:17,359
happened to her but it doesn't define

3110
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:19,520
her what defines her is what she does

3111
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:21,679
from now on and then rebuilding that

3112
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,600
person to become who she became i think

3113
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:26,560
the mental toughness is is a big part of

3114
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:27,920
it her her mind um

3115
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,679
but then

3116
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:32,079
as an athlete

3117
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:34,319
you know she's a lot like travis

3118
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:35,920
you know she's she's a warrior she's a

3119
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:37,118
fighter you know my dad always jokes

3120
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,520
with her you know

3121
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:40,639
he says you're a workhorse you're not a

3122
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,639
thoroughbred we're not going to treat

3123
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:45,199
you like a thoroughbred right you're a

3124
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:46,400
workhorse so you're going to work and

3125
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:47,599
the way you're going to get bigger and

3126
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:49,039
stronger is you're going to work harder

3127
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,679
and you're going to keep you know and

3128
01:46:49,039 --> 01:46:53,519
she came to us when she was only 15. so

3129
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:55,279
at that time we got her with a really

3130
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:57,600
good strength and conditioning coach we

3131
01:46:55,279 --> 01:47:00,319
did all the core olympic style lifting

3132
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:01,920
like as her body was developing

3133
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:04,158
she was getting stronger every single

3134
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:06,158
day and then you know she had the luxury

3135
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:07,759
of being on the mat with

3136
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:09,519
at the time i was still young enough to

3137
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:11,440
train and be on the mat and i was around

3138
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:12,960
her weight class and travis was able to

3139
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:15,439
train with her and all we had all the

3140
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,439
top u.s athletes at the time

3141
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:19,118
training here at my school so she got

3142
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:20,638
the benefit of all the best guys to

3143
01:47:19,118 --> 01:47:22,880
train within the country

3144
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:24,159
you know and and her doing all of those

3145
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,920
rounds

3146
01:47:24,158 --> 01:47:28,638
you know night in week

3147
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:30,560
night every night every week every year

3148
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:32,560
compiled with the best you know highest

3149
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,840
level she could as a girl

3150
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:35,440
she got the strength she got the

3151
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:37,119
technique she got the and then she had

3152
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:39,039
the coaching on top of it with my dad

3153
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:41,118
being on her as you know working her out

3154
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:43,279
and you know having the

3155
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:44,639
the wherewithal to develop a strategy

3156
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:46,158
and a plan for her because when she

3157
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:49,600
first came here

3158
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:51,279
she competed at 63 kilos which is 138

3159
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:52,400
pounds

3160
01:47:51,279 --> 01:47:54,639
at the time

3161
01:47:52,399 --> 01:47:56,879
ronda was ronda rousey was also training

3162
01:47:54,639 --> 01:48:00,319
here and she was 70 kilos

3163
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:02,159
so if kayla was struggling making 63 so

3164
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:04,399
the only way to obviously the only way

3165
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:05,920
to still compete is to move up but my

3166
01:48:04,399 --> 01:48:07,679
dad said well if you move up then you're

3167
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:09,039
in rhonda's weight so let's skip that

3168
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,480
weight and you're going to go to 78

3169
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:12,399
kilos and he told her listen you're

3170
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:13,599
gonna go up two eight classes

3171
01:48:12,399 --> 01:48:17,039
she looked at him and was like that's

3172
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:18,639
172 pounds and he goes well i don't care

3173
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:20,880
like you're already struggling making

3174
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:23,600
138 you weigh 150 what's the difference

3175
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:25,199
we put 20 pounds on go to 170. so that's

3176
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:26,480
why she jumped two weights because she

3177
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:27,759
passed rhonda

3178
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:29,439
she went to the weight above so she

3179
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,440
could make the national team and she had

3180
01:48:29,439 --> 01:48:32,960
a chance to go to the olympics and and

3181
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:35,198
all that because we envisioned ronda

3182
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:37,600
staying around until 2012. and that's

3183
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:39,599
also like a long-term vision because you

3184
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:41,760
kind of grow into that body then over

3185
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:43,440
time correct so you can dominate you can

3186
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,880
learn what it's like in that weight

3187
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:47,599
class you can learn to dominate that

3188
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:49,840
weight classic excel and then dominate

3189
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:51,280
people that cut weight too hard too long

3190
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,800
they forget about technique because

3191
01:48:51,279 --> 01:48:54,559
they're only worried about losing weight

3192
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:56,159
they're always tired in training they

3193
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,400
don't give 100 effort they're not

3194
01:48:56,158 --> 01:49:00,399
getting better she now is just focused

3195
01:48:58,399 --> 01:49:01,920
on getting better at judo you know and

3196
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:04,158
getting bigger getting stronger getting

3197
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:07,920
more powerful so i think giving her that

3198
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:10,079
purpose and that that was a great call

3199
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:12,639
what are some memorable or maybe the

3200
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:16,238
most memorable moment kayla harrison

3201
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:16,239
moment to you as her coach

3202
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:22,079
not the most perhaps let's say

3203
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:23,678
what are some memorable moments

3204
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:25,198
everybody hears the good ones right so

3205
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:27,599
everybody knows she won the war she won

3206
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:30,000
the world championships in tokyo in 2012

3207
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:32,639
in 2010 she was our two-time olympic

3208
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,639
champion in 2012 2016. i'll never forget

3209
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:36,719
those moments right because they're

3210
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:37,760
historic

3211
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:40,079
one of the

3212
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:43,039
biggest moments that i like sharing this

3213
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:45,679
story with everybody is that

3214
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:48,000
in 2010 in january

3215
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:50,319
kayla was still a developing athlete and

3216
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,840
we had a local tournament in new york

3217
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:53,439
it was in brooklyn new york was called

3218
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,679
the starrett cup

3219
01:49:53,439 --> 01:49:57,519
and i knew that at that tournament that

3220
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:59,760
two of the canadian girls they were like

3221
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:01,440
ranked 15th or 20th in the world they

3222
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,400
weren't superstars but they were tough

3223
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:03,678
players

3224
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:05,679
both of them i knew were going to be at

3225
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:07,039
that tournament so i said kayla we're

3226
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:08,239
going to go to this tournament you're

3227
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:10,000
going to compete against the canadian

3228
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:11,198
girls get some good experience you know

3229
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,238
figure out what you need to work on and

3230
01:50:11,198 --> 01:50:13,598
then we'll go home and work on some

3231
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:14,799
stuff

3232
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:16,639
well she went to the tournament there

3233
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,320
was only three girls in the weight her

3234
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:20,079
and the two canadians

3235
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:22,319
at that tournament

3236
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:24,559
she lost both fights

3237
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:26,479
right so this is january 2010.

3238
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:28,320
she lost both matches you know she was

3239
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:30,238
competitive but certainly things she

3240
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:32,479
needed to work on it was good you know

3241
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:34,559
development thing for her and for us it

3242
01:50:32,479 --> 01:50:36,479
also opened her mind to say oh man you

3243
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:38,560
know because she was already a

3244
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:40,479
a junior world champion

3245
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,080
at the time but so now there's another

3246
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:43,519
level this is a senior level right you

3247
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:45,279
got to go up another level and here's

3248
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,719
two girls that aren't even medalists

3249
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:47,920
that are beating you so now there's more

3250
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:51,039
work to be done

3251
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:52,639
and so i like telling that story because

3252
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:54,319
everybody sees the champions and the

3253
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:55,920
greatest moments they don't see them

3254
01:50:54,319 --> 01:50:58,559
when they have bad days and could you

3255
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:00,399
imagine being you know oh and two

3256
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,520
you feel like you feel like a failure

3257
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:03,279
right

3258
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:05,040
but

3259
01:51:03,279 --> 01:51:08,158
ten months later

3260
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:10,880
it was tokyo 2010. she went from owen to

3261
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:15,198
at starrett new york

3262
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:16,719
to world champion 2010 in the motherland

3263
01:51:15,198 --> 01:51:19,279
in japan yeah

3264
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:21,198
i mean that's an amazing turnaround

3265
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:24,158
and that's only possible if you

3266
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:26,399
put the losses in their proper context

3267
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:29,279
you don't let it destroy you mentally

3268
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:32,158
you just keep moving forward correct

3269
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:35,920
this is so funny uh so you were there

3270
01:51:32,158 --> 01:51:38,479
2010 at the stair cup was travis there

3271
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:41,440
yeah i made all those we fought at every

3272
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:43,678
loc like the mentality of our team was

3273
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:45,839
no tournament is beneath us

3274
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,760
if our goal is to go to the olympics in

3275
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:49,440
the worlds and win

3276
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,880
there's no tournament that's beneath us

3277
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:52,719
we're going to get experience we're

3278
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:54,079
going to fight we're going to learn

3279
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:55,359
we're going to compete we're going to

3280
01:51:54,079 --> 01:51:56,238
get better

3281
01:51:55,359 --> 01:51:59,198
you know

3282
01:51:56,238 --> 01:52:02,158
i actually just as a funny little con

3283
01:51:59,198 --> 01:52:04,238
side i was there i competed really this

3284
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:06,000
is one of the earlier tournaments like

3285
01:52:04,238 --> 01:52:08,879
the beginner division oh no i actually

3286
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,639
did black belt division too

3287
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,760
that was one of the actual yeah i

3288
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:14,319
remember that

3289
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:16,480
that's when it was so early that i

3290
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:18,479
thought

3291
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:19,839
like i was also really strong at that

3292
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:22,158
time just like physically like

3293
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:23,840
powerlifting stuff so i thought like it

3294
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:26,638
would be good experience

3295
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:27,679
uh to also do uh black belt division and

3296
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:29,118
remember

3297
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:31,760
it must have been actually travis's

3298
01:52:29,118 --> 01:52:34,479
division which is funny uh

3299
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:36,880
uh there's legere brothers

3300
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:38,559
harry and gary they are super they're

3301
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,279
super good and they're super dominant

3302
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:42,800
but i think travis faced one of them

3303
01:52:41,279 --> 01:52:46,319
and beat them

3304
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:47,840
um i i don't know i just remembered uh

3305
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:49,840
it's funny how there's just like these

3306
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:52,319
little roads that later

3307
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:54,319
reconnect right uh but yeah there's some

3308
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:56,960
incredible people there

3309
01:52:54,319 --> 01:52:59,519
and it i saw obviously the positive

3310
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:01,439
things and it's interesting that kayla's

3311
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:04,400
story was also intersecting there and

3312
01:53:01,439 --> 01:53:08,000
that was one of the lower points for her

3313
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:09,920
another story i like to to share is that

3314
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,599
you have to know your athletes right and

3315
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:13,599
you have to you know really get to know

3316
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:15,520
their psychological what they're

3317
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:17,520
thinking psychologically mentally what's

3318
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:20,960
going through their head another

3319
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:23,440
story was in in tokyo it was

3320
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:25,359
2015

3321
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:26,879
the tokyo grand slam

3322
01:53:25,359 --> 01:53:28,880
so we had

3323
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,960
had kayla face off against almost all

3324
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:33,039
the top girls in her in her division she

3325
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:36,158
had beaten everybody going into the 2016

3326
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:38,800
olympics but at the 2015

3327
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:40,479
tokyo grand slam

3328
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:42,079
there was a girl from japan

3329
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:43,678
that she hadn't fought in a long time

3330
01:53:42,079 --> 01:53:45,279
and she lost to the girl last time she

3331
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:47,840
she fought her so it was something we

3332
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:49,519
wanted her to beat this girl going into

3333
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:52,159
the olympics so that she knew she could

3334
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:54,560
beat everybody

3335
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:55,839
and it was a first-round match

3336
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,840
and

3337
01:53:55,840 --> 01:54:00,480
it was gonna be tough for kayla right it

3338
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:02,079
was gonna be a really hard fight and

3339
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:03,359
um she had won a bunch of tournaments in

3340
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:04,800
a row leading up to that so her

3341
01:54:03,359 --> 01:54:06,559
confidence was really high but at the

3342
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:10,320
same time

3343
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:12,320
she didn't think she needed this fight

3344
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:13,759
and she showed up to the tournament and

3345
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:15,679
she said

3346
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:17,440
i don't think i can fight today i've got

3347
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:18,960
a stinger in my neck you know i've got a

3348
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:20,319
stinger coming down my neck and i'm kind

3349
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:22,319
of sore and

3350
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:25,039
she didn't tell us she went and told the

3351
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:26,719
trainer she walked around she's holding

3352
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:28,960
her neck and me and my dad were like

3353
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:30,960
what's up with her i don't know

3354
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:32,158
and then so

3355
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:34,158
like maybe she doesn't want to fight

3356
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:35,598
today i don't know right so

3357
01:54:34,158 --> 01:54:37,198
all of a sudden the trainer comes up to

3358
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:38,960
us and she didn't come to us the trainer

3359
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:41,359
came to us you know i really don't think

3360
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,599
it's a good idea that kayla fight today

3361
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:45,039
i mean we looked at him and like

3362
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:47,119
well your opinion doesn't really matter

3363
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:49,039
does it okay

3364
01:54:47,118 --> 01:54:50,399
what's up with her yeah oh she has this

3365
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:53,359
thing in her neck it's like a pinched

3366
01:54:50,399 --> 01:54:55,439
nerve and there's this and then

3367
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:56,880
we talked i said

3368
01:54:55,439 --> 01:54:58,719
is there a risk of her getting injured

3369
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,840
like is this pain or is this risk that

3370
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:01,439
she's going to get injured and she's

3371
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,560
going to set her back like long time in

3372
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:03,678
her career

3373
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:05,280
she says no she's not going to get

3374
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:06,239
injured it's just a pinched nerve a

3375
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:09,519
little pain she's going to have to deal

3376
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:11,519
with like okay well can you fix the pain

3377
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:13,199
he says yeah i can do this and that and

3378
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,080
i can give her a shot and the pain will

3379
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:15,439
go away

3380
01:55:14,079 --> 01:55:17,118
okay then do that

3381
01:55:15,439 --> 01:55:18,960
and so kayla kayla comes up she goes

3382
01:55:17,118 --> 01:55:20,719

3386
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:27,598
trainer and

3387
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:29,280
i love it he said you're good to go yeah

3388
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:30,639
she looked at us like

3389
01:55:29,279 --> 01:55:31,599
and then we had to talk to her and say

3390
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:34,000
listen

3391
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:35,679
you're not injured you're in pain

3392
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
because we just came from a camp i said

3393
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:39,440

3396
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,079
period i don't care i want to know that

3397
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:46,400
you can beat this girl this is why we

3398
01:55:44,079 --> 01:55:48,158
came this is our last hard tournament

3399
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:50,238
before the olympic games

3400
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:53,198
this is what you what we want from you

3401
01:55:50,238 --> 01:55:55,118
and lo and behold she understood she

3402
01:55:53,198 --> 01:55:56,960
they gave her a quick shot the rest of

3403
01:55:55,118 --> 01:55:59,759
the world thought we were crazy making

3404
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:00,399
her compete yeah and then she went out

3405
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:01,679
there

3406
01:56:00,399 --> 01:56:03,519
she fought

3407
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:04,719
didn't even know she was injured no you

3408
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:06,480
know what i mean she just went out there

3409
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:08,560
she fought the tournament she beat the

3410
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:10,319
japanese girl she ended up going through

3411
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:11,280
the whole tournament she took a gold

3412
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:13,840
medal

3413
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:15,198
she won the event

3414
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:16,560
it turned out to be a great confidence

3415
01:56:15,198 --> 01:56:18,158
builder and

3416
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:20,719
it it yeah

3417
01:56:18,158 --> 01:56:22,319
uh and that kind of sets you up for all

3418
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:25,118
the chaos that can happen at the olympic

3419
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:27,439
games and it tells you if you can beat

3420
01:56:25,118 --> 01:56:28,559
these girls when you're not 100 yeah and

3421
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:31,598
you're not at your best you're

3422
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:32,560
physically beat mentally beat

3423
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:34,159
imagine what you're going to do when

3424
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,080
you're fresh well when she was going to

3425
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:37,679
the olympic games there's a lot she had

3426
01:56:36,079 --> 01:56:40,238
the mental game

3427
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:41,520
down down down there wasn't a girl in

3428
01:56:40,238 --> 01:56:44,238
that division that thought that could be

3429
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:45,920
kayla going into those games not a one

3430
01:56:44,238 --> 01:56:47,359
they just looked at her and went no not

3431
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:49,118
happening yeah

3432
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:50,799
that's great i mean she's a great

3433
01:56:49,118 --> 01:56:53,598
olympic champion two-time olympic

3434
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:55,360
champion but there is uh

3435
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:56,560
there is something that she's commented

3436
01:56:55,359 --> 01:56:58,880
on which is

3437
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:00,480
she's suffered or

3438
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:02,319
went through depression after winning

3439
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:04,319
her second olympic gold

3440
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:06,479
why do you think this happens

3441
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:08,158
you often hear stories of great

3442
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:10,879
champions

3443
01:57:08,158 --> 01:57:13,920
becoming depressed after the olympics

3444
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:16,319
there's a lack of purpose afterwards

3445
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,560
right because you've done

3446
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:20,639
in life what you set out to do you've

3447
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:22,840
had a goal every day you woke up you

3448
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:25,760
knew what your purpose was you knew what

3449
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:28,239
your you know what your day looked like

3450
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:31,039
you knew why you were doing that and all

3451
01:57:28,238 --> 01:57:33,598
of a sudden you won and you got all the

3452
01:57:31,039 --> 01:57:36,719
fame and you're all happy and it

3453
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:39,760
but then you wake up and you go

3454
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:42,000
now what i don't have a next and and

3455
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:43,840
also because there was nothing for her

3456
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,158
there was no

3457
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:47,760
there was no path set out for kayla that

3458
01:57:46,158 --> 01:57:49,439

3462
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:57,279

we're going to give you a job and here's

3468
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:08,238
what you're going to do you know if

3469
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:10,399
you'd like to take it there was nothing

3470
01:58:08,238 --> 01:58:12,399
for her like i remember doing the

3471
01:58:10,399 --> 01:58:13,679
interview at the olympics with her

3472
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:16,158
and they said are you going to compete

3473
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:18,079
in the next olympics and i said no like

3474
01:58:16,158 --> 01:58:19,359
why she already two-time gold medalist

3475
01:58:18,079 --> 01:58:21,359
what does three-time gold medalist do

3476
01:58:19,359 --> 01:58:23,679
for her nothing right it doesn't

3477
01:58:21,359 --> 01:58:25,439
motivate her to do it again

3478
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:27,760
they said are you doing mma i said no

3479
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:29,678
why would she do on me that's ridiculous

3480
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:32,400
like she doesn't need mma she should be

3481
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:34,800
able to make a living off of what she's

3482
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:37,679
accomplished in this sport for the rest

3483
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:39,840
of her life yes but what happens is and

3484
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:42,480
what most people don't understand is

3485
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:45,679
once you say i'm retired i'm no longer

3486
01:58:42,479 --> 01:58:47,919
competing in the in the sport of judo

3487
01:58:45,679 --> 01:58:50,960
you don't get a salary from usa judo

3488
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:53,359
anymore which she was getting

3489
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:56,000
i think she got like 72 000 a year from

3490
01:58:53,359 --> 01:58:57,359
from usa judo at the time

3491
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,960
you don't get

3492
01:58:57,359 --> 01:59:01,198
a stipend from the olympic committee

3493
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:03,118
anymore goes away

3494
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:05,039
your sponsor like the new york athletic

3495
01:59:03,118 --> 01:59:07,039
club was a great sponsor for her for all

3496
01:59:05,039 --> 01:59:09,118
those years in fact she could have never

3497
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:11,519
been the athlete she became without the

3498
01:59:09,118 --> 01:59:13,279
support of the nyc because i talked to

3499
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:15,199
them when she was 15 i said hey i got a

3500
01:59:13,279 --> 01:59:17,759
girl that's really good

3501
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:19,919
someday like if you invest in her now

3502
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,440
i promise you she'll pay back for you

3503
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,880
and they said and i remember the day she

3504
01:59:21,439 --> 01:59:25,039
won the olympic gold i called the guy up

3505
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:27,679
and said hey i told you

3506
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:29,118
so but you know they can no longer give

3507
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:30,719
you stipends because you're not

3508
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:32,799
competing and representing them anymore

3509
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:35,279
so that goes away

3510
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:37,039
um all of your sponsorships and all of

3511
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:38,880
your money that you would make from your

3512
01:59:37,039 --> 01:59:40,719
tv commercials or whatever that didn't

3513
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:42,639
happen for her after the olympics

3514
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:44,399
because judo is an obscure sport right

3515
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:45,599
so she didn't have any opportunities for

3516
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:47,439
that

3517
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:49,599
at the end of the day she has no no

3518
01:59:47,439 --> 01:59:51,919
revenue coming in how do you live you

3519
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:53,599
get a bonus of 25 grand from the olympic

3520
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:55,520
committee or whatever for for winning a

3521
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:58,159
gold but aside from that you're not

3522
01:59:55,520 --> 02:00:00,400
going to live on that money so no

3523
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:02,319
purpose no goal right what am i going to

3524
02:00:00,399 --> 02:00:03,920
wake up and do tomorrow i don't know so

3525
02:00:02,319 --> 02:00:05,198
she has no direction and at the same

3526
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:06,319
then at the same time she has no money

3527
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:08,960
coming in

3528
02:00:06,319 --> 02:00:10,960
so everything shuts off so now it's like

3529
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:13,520
where do you turn what do you do

3530
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:15,439
you know and that leads to

3531
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:17,280
being depressed because yeah even though

3532
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:19,359
i've accomplished all this stuff

3533
02:00:17,279 --> 02:00:20,880
i'm kind of lost in life like what's

3534
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:22,799
next for me

3535
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:25,039
and i guess you just have to ride that

3536
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:27,440
out because

3537
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:28,560
when you're a great human being great

3538
02:00:27,439 --> 02:00:30,319
champion

3539
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:32,880
life has a way of

3540
02:00:30,319 --> 02:00:34,960
helping you find a way right i mean she

3541
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:37,599
she's in mixed martial arts now but she

3542
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:40,239
has a lot of stuff going on right

3543
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:42,319
well her kids she she adopted her her

3544
02:00:40,238 --> 02:00:44,158
sister's kids so she's their legal

3545
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:46,079
guardian now so that is her purpose

3546
02:00:44,158 --> 02:00:48,319
right raising raising these kids and

3547
02:00:46,079 --> 02:00:50,399
making them part of her family and

3548
02:00:48,319 --> 02:00:52,158
um she's fortunate enough that she has

3549
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:54,638
enough money that she can do that and

3550
02:00:52,158 --> 02:00:55,839
she can give them a good life you know

3551
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:57,679
i'm going to ask you to start some

3552
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:59,760
trouble but i heard that she said

3553
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:01,840
somewhere that she can beat khabib

3554
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:03,039
nurmagomedov in judo

3555
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:04,639
what do you think

3556
02:01:03,039 --> 02:01:06,800
to be honest with you i mean i don't

3557
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:08,000
know what level of judoka yeah i don't

3558
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:09,360
know i don't know what level he's but i

3559
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:12,079
do know that

3560
02:01:09,359 --> 02:01:14,880
that russian system respects judo

3561
02:01:12,079 --> 02:01:17,279
immensely what i will tell you is this

3562
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:19,118
i trained with kayla and i was an

3563
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:20,079
olympic medalist and a world champion in

3564
02:01:19,118 --> 02:01:22,000
judo

3565
02:01:20,079 --> 02:01:24,880
and granted i was older when i trained

3566
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,560
with her but you have to go as a man you

3567
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:29,440
have to go 100

3568
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:31,599
or she will smash you yeah as a man and

3569
02:01:29,439 --> 02:01:34,319
i could tell you that if khabib

3570
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:35,440
doesn't do a lot of just judo it doesn't

3571
02:01:34,319 --> 02:01:37,279
like you know

3572
02:01:35,439 --> 02:01:38,879
gripping and doesn't understand like if

3573
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:39,840
he's you know if he can throw that's one

3574
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,760
thing

3575
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,760
but if he doesn't really understand you

3576
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:45,520
at a high level

3577
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:47,760
she will throw him she would beat him in

3578
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:49,679
a match in a judo contest not in a mixed

3579
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:52,400
martial arts contest not in a wrestling

3580
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:54,800
contest not in a submission contest in a

3581
02:01:52,399 --> 02:01:56,000
pure judo match where he cannot grab

3582
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,760
legs

3583
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:02,079
and he has to grip up and just throw

3584
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:04,320
i'd put my money on kayla

3585
02:02:02,079 --> 02:02:05,760
unless he's you know and if he could go

3586
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:07,679
placed in the nationals in russia he

3587
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:09,280
would beat her but if he's not at that

3588
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:10,800
level of judo he's more like a brown

3589
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:12,479
belt or he's not

3590
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:14,239
he's not a high level judo player she

3591
02:02:12,479 --> 02:02:16,399
will win i saw her

3592
02:02:14,238 --> 02:02:17,359
take some of our best juniors in this

3593
02:02:16,399 --> 02:02:19,920
country

3594
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:21,759
some of the some of the um

3595
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:23,440
guys that went and won our meddled in

3596
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:26,560
our senior nationals

3597
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:28,559
i've seen her smash all of them in judo

3598
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:30,239
now she's not going to do that to a

3599
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:32,000
travis stevens she's not going to do

3600
02:02:30,238 --> 02:02:34,718
that you know to a

3601
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,439
to a senior national champion you know

3602
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:39,599
or olympian in our sport but she will go

3603
02:02:37,439 --> 02:02:43,439
toe-to-toe with

3604
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:43,440
every other male if black belts are not

3605
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:49,920
speaking of khabib and russia um

3606
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:51,520
vladimir putin

3607
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:53,520
i don't know if you have heard of him

3608
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:56,560
he's the president of russia but he's

3609
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:59,040
also judoka yes have you gotten a chance

3610
02:02:56,560 --> 02:03:01,599
to uh see him do judo what do you think

3611
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:03,359
about his judo if you were to and so i

3612
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:06,000
i'm actually really good friends with

2012 came to our studio

3623
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:32,399
and lived here for a month in boston

3624
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:34,000
they went to school in boston i brought

3625
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:35,439
them to my house they had three olympic

3626
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,960
champions

3627
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:39,118
um

3628
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:40,800
they oh my god

3629
02:03:39,118 --> 02:03:42,238
they all came and lived here in boston

3630
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:45,360
for a month they wanted to be part of

3631
02:03:42,238 --> 02:03:47,759
like experience america type program so

3632
02:03:45,359 --> 02:03:48,880
i've seen all of them with putin in

3633
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:50,560
russia

3634
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:52,560
at their national training center

3635
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:54,320
working out with them and taking falls

3636
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:57,199
and doing judo with him so

3637
02:03:54,319 --> 02:03:58,799
um you know it's hard when you're older

3638
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:01,678
to move in judo i mean i was at a high

3639
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:03,520
level and i'm you know now 51.

3640
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:06,399
it's hard for me to move like i used to

3641
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:08,960
so at his age he's got to be what 60

3642
02:04:06,399 --> 02:04:11,198
between 62 65-ish

3643
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:13,039
i mean it moves really well for somebody

3644
02:04:11,198 --> 02:04:14,719
that's that age

3645
02:04:13,039 --> 02:04:17,039
you know and probably hasn't done very

3646
02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:18,880
much judo for the last however many

3647
02:04:17,039 --> 02:04:20,880
years right so that tells you he at one

3648
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:22,960
point he had to be a really good year

3649
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:25,199
player yeah he put in a lot of work at

3650
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:27,679
some point to develop the technique you

3651
02:04:25,198 --> 02:04:30,158
can tell when a great judo player even

3652
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:32,719
if they haven't practiced it

3653
02:04:30,158 --> 02:04:34,319
even if they're up there in age

3654
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:36,078
like just the way they move right the

3655
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:38,399
way they're going for sayanagi the way

3656
02:04:36,078 --> 02:04:39,920
they go for a particular throw the way

3657
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:41,679
they do foot sweeps and all that kind of

3658
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:42,960
stuff you could just tell he's uh he's

3659
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:44,880
good at judo and that's kind of

3660
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:46,158
fascinating

3661
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:47,760
um

3662
02:04:46,158 --> 02:04:49,359
it's fascinating to see political

3663
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,639
leaders i've gotten to interact with

3664
02:04:49,359 --> 02:04:53,759
quite a few

3665
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:54,960
for whom judo was a formative experience

3666
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:56,719
in their life

3667
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:59,039
and that's so interesting that for a lot

3668
02:04:56,719 --> 02:05:00,719
of people judo was played a big part in

3669
02:04:59,039 --> 02:05:02,880
their life early development it's

3670
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:04,319
similar to like uh if you served in the

3671
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,000
military

3672
02:05:04,319 --> 02:05:08,960
there's just something about judo it's

3673
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,880
the um as a martial art it's not just

3674
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:12,399
the technique so yes

3675
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:15,118
there's something about gaining

3676
02:05:12,399 --> 02:05:16,960
confidence through becoming aware of

3677
02:05:15,118 --> 02:05:19,359
what like your body can do

3678
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:20,399
the sort of uh the artistry and the

3679
02:05:19,359 --> 02:05:22,399
skill of it

3680
02:05:20,399 --> 02:05:24,719
also the power being able to dominate

3681
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:27,439
another human being with technique but

3682
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:28,960
also like the um

3683
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:31,039
i don't know the formality the

3684
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:33,840
discipline of just

3685
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:36,960
uh honoring the tradition of it so all

3686
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:39,199
of that mixed together somehow creates

3687
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:41,679
memories it creates memories that kind

3688
02:05:39,198 --> 02:05:43,519
of define you as a human being and you

3689
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:45,440
carry that forward throughout your life

3690
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:48,400
and i've just been surprised to know how

3691
02:05:45,439 --> 02:05:49,359
many powerful people internationally

3692
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:50,238
have

3693
02:05:49,359 --> 02:05:52,319
uh

3694
02:05:50,238 --> 02:05:54,799
like in their heart in their who they

3695
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:56,960
are judo for sure

3696
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:59,360
it makes you the human being that you

3697
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:01,760
are it really does like it it becomes a

3698
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:03,679
fabric of if peop the people that stick

3699
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:05,039
with it right that stay with it and it

3700
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:07,440
because it

3701
02:06:05,039 --> 02:06:09,118
i i mean it teaches you so many lessons

3702
02:06:07,439 --> 02:06:10,960
it's so memorable because of what you

3703
02:06:09,118 --> 02:06:12,960
talked about the tradition

3704
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:15,118
um but it's also

3705
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:17,198
you grow with other people you know and

3706
02:06:15,118 --> 02:06:18,960
you learn from other people and you

3707
02:06:17,198 --> 02:06:21,439
experience things with other people it's

3708
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,800
it's such a hands-on sport

3709
02:06:21,439 --> 02:06:24,799
that um

3710
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:26,960
it's very memorable and

3711
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:29,119
people love it so much like

3712
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:31,599
right now at my dojo we have like four

3713
02:06:29,118 --> 02:06:32,799
generations like somebody that judo with

3714
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:35,279

toddler program at my school like we're

3722
02:06:48,399 --> 02:06:52,799
talking four generations and they all

3723
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:54,880
loved the experience so much and what it

3724
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:56,880
did for them in their lives that they

3725
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:59,599
wanted the next generation to also

3726
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:01,920
experience the same thing

3727
02:06:59,599 --> 02:07:03,440
this is a tricky question but if if

3728
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:05,359
people are interested in judo and want

3729
02:07:03,439 --> 02:07:06,719
to start learning it in the united

3730
02:07:05,359 --> 02:07:08,719
states there's

3731
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:11,359
thousands of jiu-jitsu schools for

3732
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:13,679

02:07:11,359 --> 02:07:14,719
to people interested in judo

3734
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:17,679

maybe to jiu jitsu

3736
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:21,440

3737
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:23,920
gym owners like how how how do you get

judo as part of your life

3739
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:29,199
in america well i'm if you're fortunate

3740
02:07:26,319 --> 02:07:31,279
to live near another dojo right a place

3741
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:33,439
that has judo locally then that's your

3742
02:07:31,279 --> 02:07:36,158
best opportunity to learn is to go learn

3743
02:07:33,439 --> 02:07:37,759
from another school um unfor

3744
02:07:36,158 --> 02:07:39,920
unfortunately

3745
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:41,840
sometimes the nearest dojo might not be

3746
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:43,760
for two hours or three hours away from

3747
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:45,199
where you're at which is

3748
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,920
an obstacle you're not going to do that

3749
02:07:45,198 --> 02:07:47,839
so

3750
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:50,319
i mean travis and i did start the

3751
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:51,159
american judo system online

3752
02:07:50,319 --> 02:07:52,719
it's at

3753
02:07:51,158 --> 02:07:55,359
usajudo.com

3754
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:56,960
and we've broken down every single judo

3755
02:07:55,359 --> 02:07:59,679
technique

3756
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:02,880
to the very very basic elements of just

3757
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:04,719
movement so we teach every technique of

3758
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:06,719
how you do it mechanically with just

3759
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:09,279
your feet then how you incorporate your

3760
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:11,439
hands and your feet together

3761
02:08:09,279 --> 02:08:13,920
how you do it in all directions moving

3762
02:08:11,439 --> 02:08:16,319
forward sideways backwards how to then

3763
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:17,920
introduce a partner into the into the

3764
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:19,599
movement

3765
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:22,960
how to do basic

3766
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:24,800
uchi komi or repetitions with a partner

3767
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:26,719
then moving with a partner then how to

3768
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:29,440
throw your opponent static how to throw

3769
02:08:26,719 --> 02:08:31,039
your opponent so basically from the very

3770
02:08:29,439 --> 02:08:32,960
foundation of the movement all the way

3771
02:08:31,039 --> 02:08:35,279
to the most advanced level

3772
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:36,800
we've documented this uh through

3773
02:08:35,279 --> 02:08:40,158
separate videos

3774
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:42,320
and we've taken now i think 12 to 15 of

3775
02:08:40,158 --> 02:08:44,559
standing techniques combined with a

3776
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:46,399
whole bunch of groundwork techniques and

3777
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:49,039
our goal is just to continue to build

3778
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:51,198
this platform out so that anybody

3779
02:08:49,039 --> 02:08:53,039
anywhere can learn online

3780
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:54,960
and can ask questions we have a live

3781
02:08:53,039 --> 02:08:57,039
training class every couple weeks every

3782
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:58,399
two weeks he or i answer questions

3783
02:08:57,039 --> 02:09:01,279
online

3784
02:08:58,399 --> 02:09:03,759
for our our members

3785
02:09:01,279 --> 02:09:05,920
ideally what we'd like to do is have a

3786
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:08,560
standing curriculum for jiu jitsu

3787
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:10,158
instructors that want to learn

3788
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:11,679
and become black belts in judo here's

3789
02:09:10,158 --> 02:09:13,198
how these are the techniques you need to

3790
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:15,760
know this is how many reps you need to

3791
02:09:13,198 --> 02:09:18,399
do this is how efficient you need to get

3792
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:20,159
at that at those techniques to become

3793
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:21,679
certified as an instructor or become a

3794
02:09:20,158 --> 02:09:23,519
black belt

3795
02:09:21,679 --> 02:09:25,520
and eventually have an online promotion

3796
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:27,119
system where anybody anywhere can just

3797
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:27,920
submit videos

3798
02:09:27,118 --> 02:09:29,198
and

3799
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:30,880
show us that they can do those

3800
02:09:29,198 --> 02:09:32,399
techniques and obviously we'll have

3801
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:34,560
people review them and

3802
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:36,319
this is a dream and a vision but we've

3803
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:38,239
already started the platform

3804
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:40,719
we're about to do a collaborative effort

3805
02:09:38,238 --> 02:09:42,000
with usa judo where all of their members

3806
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:44,560
will start to get access to this

3807
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:47,520
platform as well and if we can get that

3808
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:49,520
uh influx of of money and people on the

3809
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:51,760
platform it'll allow us to

3810
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:53,520
to hire and grow it faster

3811
02:09:51,760 --> 02:09:55,039
so you also want to do like

3812
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:58,639
certification

3813
02:09:55,039 --> 02:10:01,599
there it's not just instruction correct

3814
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:03,359
that would be amazing yeah um i mean for

3815
02:10:01,599 --> 02:10:06,000
me personally sort of i mean mostly in

3816
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:08,078
austin texas now right and there's a few

3817
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:10,078
judo schools but

3818
02:10:08,078 --> 02:10:12,238
it's not not really

3819
02:10:10,078 --> 02:10:14,078
right there's not uh and it's just one

3820
02:10:12,238 --> 02:10:16,479
of those cities that doesn't quite have

3821
02:10:14,078 --> 02:10:18,479
i mean there's a few it's basically just

3822
02:10:16,479 --> 02:10:20,799
like a few random judo people that kind

3823
02:10:18,479 --> 02:10:23,919
of kind of gather together a couple of

3824
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:25,920
times a week but it's not a system a

3825
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:27,440
dojo uh

3826
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:29,599
an instructor

3827
02:10:27,439 --> 02:10:30,559
or integrated into a jiu jitsu school or

3828
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:33,520
not

3829
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:34,960
the problem with most judo dojos right

3830
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:36,560
now is that

3831
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:39,039
most of them cater towards the

3832
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:41,440
competitive side

3833
02:10:39,039 --> 02:10:42,800
also a lot of them do it recreationally

3834
02:10:41,439 --> 02:10:44,399
meaning this isn't how they make a

3835
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,000
living so they're there three nights a

3836
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:47,359
week or they're there five even if

3837
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,039
they're there five nights a week it's

3838
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:50,880
still only

3839
02:10:49,039 --> 02:10:53,198
one junior class and one senior class

3840
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:54,639
and that's it and it's one size fits all

3841
02:10:53,198 --> 02:10:56,479
doesn't matter what level you're at it's

3842
02:10:54,639 --> 02:10:58,159
one size fits all so

3843
02:10:56,479 --> 02:10:59,279
you can't get out of the training what

3844
02:10:58,158 --> 02:11:00,799
you're looking to get out of the

3845
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:03,439
training it's whatever the instructor's

3846
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:04,880
teaching you know

3847
02:11:03,439 --> 02:11:06,479
and you can't learn because it's not at

3848
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:08,239
the appropriate level for you and

3849
02:11:06,479 --> 02:11:09,598
usually you're pushed into doing randori

3850
02:11:08,238 --> 02:11:11,598
where you have no choice but to do the

3851
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:12,960
randori part of the training

3852
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:14,719
um

3853
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:16,800
so it's it's a challenge to go learn and

3854
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:18,000
then a lot of times the the schools are

3855
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:19,840
old school

3856
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,439
so they go make you do falls for a half

3857
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:22,880
hour they make you do thing you know

3858
02:11:21,439 --> 02:11:24,399
make you do things maybe you're a jiu

3859
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:26,239
jitsu person who knows how to fall

3860
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:28,000
already but you haven't proven it to the

3861
02:11:26,238 --> 02:11:29,598
judo instructor and they don't break the

3862
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,520
norm i say you still have to fall for

3863
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:33,760
six months which turns a lot of people

3864
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:34,960
away as well so it's

3865
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,599
you know

3866
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:40,719
it's like any business if you don't

3867
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:41,760
deliver on your customers expectations

3868
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:44,399
you're not going to have very many

3869
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:45,679
customers which is the way it is now

3870
02:11:44,399 --> 02:11:47,598
so

3871
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:49,760
a lot of people who listen to this but

3872
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:52,719
in general in the united states practice

3873
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:54,880
brazilian jiu jitsu which has a lot of

3874
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:57,279
similarities to judo as obviously its

3875
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:59,359
origins in judo

3876
02:11:57,279 --> 02:12:01,039
how would you compare the two arts from

3877
02:11:59,359 --> 02:12:04,000
the perspective of people just

3878
02:12:01,039 --> 02:12:06,158
interested about both arts

3879
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:08,479
do you recommend people who do jiu jitsu

3880
02:12:06,158 --> 02:12:10,719
get into judo

3881
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:12,399
how can enrich their jiu jitsu how do

3882
02:12:10,719 --> 02:12:14,239
you compare the two arts the actual

3883
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:15,519
practice of it and why it might be

3884
02:12:14,238 --> 02:12:17,678
useful to you

3885
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:20,800
i mean i think that judo is a hard sport

3886
02:12:17,679 --> 02:12:22,719
for adults to do um it just is you know

3887
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:24,320
especially people that are haven't

3888
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:27,039
fallen in a long time haven't you know

3889
02:12:24,319 --> 02:12:28,799
aren't very athletic you know haven't

3890
02:12:27,039 --> 02:12:31,439
i think i think about my own experience

3891
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:33,840
right outs other than judo when did i

3892
02:12:31,439 --> 02:12:35,759
ever do like a forward somersault maybe

3893
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:37,679
when i was in grade school right that's

3894
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:39,119
the last time i've left my feet was in

3895
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:40,399
grade school

3896
02:12:39,118 --> 02:12:42,639
most people

3897
02:12:40,399 --> 02:12:44,879
haven't got off of a chair or a couch

3898
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:46,400
they spend eight to ten hours a day

3899
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:48,639
either working behind a computer or

3900
02:12:46,399 --> 02:12:50,638
sitting on a college watching tv right

3901
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:52,960
and they're not that athletic and they

3902
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:54,880
haven't done anything athletic at least

3903
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:56,639
probably since high school yeah right

3904
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:58,560
that's their last athletic endeavor most

3905
02:12:56,639 --> 02:13:01,118
of them so you're talking about as an

3906
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:03,280
adult that's 35 or 40 wanting to start a

3907
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:05,759
sport judo is a really hard sport to

3908
02:13:03,279 --> 02:13:07,920
start especially in today's

3909
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:09,280
dojos that don't have a recreational

3910
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:10,880
adult program

3911
02:13:09,279 --> 02:13:13,439
or you know when it's one size fits all

3912
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:15,599
it's hard so for those people jiu-jitsu

3913
02:13:13,439 --> 02:13:17,359
makes a heck of a lot of sense

3914
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:19,599
good self-defense

3915
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:21,439
it's cerebral where you got to use your

3916
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:23,840
brain you're a smaller person you have

3917
02:13:21,439 --> 02:13:25,598
to use technique and you know it teaches

3918
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:28,078
all the same things as judo but it's a

3919
02:13:25,599 --> 02:13:30,239
safe way to do it and

3920
02:13:28,078 --> 02:13:32,639
because of the validation it has with

3921
02:13:30,238 --> 02:13:34,799
the ufc and mma today

3922
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:37,039
right everybody knows jujitsu so now

3923
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:38,960
they can be part of mainstream society

3924
02:13:37,039 --> 02:13:41,039
and talk intelligently about what they

3925
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:42,560
see on television or what's going on on

3926
02:13:41,039 --> 02:13:43,760
espn today right they have some

3927
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:46,320
knowledge so

3928
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:47,760
they they have an identity and also

3929
02:13:46,319 --> 02:13:49,519
there's a good culture in jiu jitsu

3930
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,760
where it's becoming a family you know

3931
02:13:49,520 --> 02:13:54,000
the dojo is the family place you go to

3932
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:55,360
feel good you go to see your friends you

3933
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,800
go to get fit

3934
02:13:55,359 --> 02:13:58,319
and you have a good time

3935
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:59,760
right so it makes a lot of sense why

3936
02:13:58,319 --> 02:14:01,679
it's growing

3937
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:04,639
judo on the other hand i think is a

3938
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:05,520
better sport for children to do it's

3939
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:07,039
more

3940
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:09,119
i would say

3941
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:11,519
fun and interactive it's a little easier

3942
02:14:09,118 --> 02:14:13,679
to teach the kids how to do the throwing

3943
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:15,920
skills and for safety and things like

3944
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:17,920
that their body can handle more than the

3945
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:18,880
adults can they're less likely to get

3946
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:20,960
injured

3947
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,639
you know they can it makes them better

3948
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:24,719
athletes because it's a lot more

3949
02:14:22,639 --> 02:14:26,719
three-dimensional in my opinion

3950
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:28,319
you know um so i think there's a good

3951
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:31,118
fit between

3952
02:14:28,319 --> 02:14:34,000
judo can thrive from kids till

3953
02:14:31,118 --> 02:14:36,639
you know whatever high school college

3954
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,880
jiu jitsu thrives from that 18 year old

3955
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:40,400
up right right now that's kind of where

3956
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:42,239
it is

3957
02:14:40,399 --> 02:14:44,719
so as a dojo you have to kind of focus

3958
02:14:42,238 --> 02:14:46,158
on the the teens and the college like

3959
02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:48,639
early 20s

3960
02:14:46,158 --> 02:14:50,000
that kind of or you need to have if

3961
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:52,840
you're going to be a successful judo

3962
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:55,760
dojo you have to have that

3963
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:57,920
recreational fundamental adult program

3964
02:14:55,760 --> 02:15:01,119
in your school where people actually

3965
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:03,920
come to judo learn the moves but aren't

3966
02:15:01,118 --> 02:15:05,598
pushed into randori training and pushed

3967
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:07,920
into things where they're uncomfortable

3968
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:11,119
and they can't control the situation

3969
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:11,118
because there's too many unknowns

3970
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:16,480
you uh got an education of browns you're

3971
02:15:14,399 --> 02:15:18,638
somebody is amazing because as an

3972
02:15:16,479 --> 02:15:20,078
olympian and an olympic coach you always

3973
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:22,560
emphasize kind of balance and

3974
02:15:20,078 --> 02:15:24,960
educational

3975
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:26,880

3977
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:31,920

3978
02:15:29,439 --> 02:15:34,158

02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:41,599
so i have to ask what advice would you

3982
02:15:38,158 --> 02:15:46,399
give to young people today high school

3983
02:15:41,599 --> 02:15:49,360

how to be successful in their career or

3985
02:15:49,359 --> 02:15:55,198
just in life in general how to

3986
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:55,199
live a life they can be proud of

3987
02:15:55,599 --> 02:15:59,760
i think you have to be true to yourself

3988
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:02,159
you have to decide what it is you really

3989
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:04,079
want to do with your life like

3990
02:16:02,158 --> 02:16:05,839
and it's hard because when i grew up i

3991
02:16:04,078 --> 02:16:07,198
didn't know i was going to be successful

3992
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:08,400
when i was you know when i was young i

3993
02:16:07,198 --> 02:16:10,559
didn't know i was going to be an olympic

3994
02:16:08,399 --> 02:16:13,118
medalist i certainly did envision myself

3995
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:14,960
owning a couple of companies that

3996
02:16:13,118 --> 02:16:16,639
that makes their living exclusively for

3997
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:18,319
martial arts or judo because that wasn't

3998
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:20,400
really an opportunity when i was a kid

3999
02:16:18,319 --> 02:16:22,238
but i've created that opportunity

4000
02:16:20,399 --> 02:16:24,238
i would just say that like pick

4001
02:16:22,238 --> 02:16:25,839
something that you're passionate about

4002
02:16:24,238 --> 02:16:27,919
you know i was stuck in a career before

4003
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:30,078
where i wasn't passionate about it and

4004
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:33,200
it was my wife who said you know jimmy

4005
02:16:30,078 --> 02:16:34,879
if you can figure out how to

4006
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:36,240
make your living exclusively from

4007
02:16:34,879 --> 02:16:38,079
martial arts

4008
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:39,760
you know where your brain and your heart

4009
02:16:38,079 --> 02:16:41,920
and your passion is all towards one

4010
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:43,840
thing that you really like

4011
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:45,920
then you'll be successful and i left the

4012
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:46,719
job i had three kids i was working for

4013
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:49,599
um

4014
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:51,039
monster.com i was in internet marketing

4015
02:16:49,599 --> 02:16:52,880
and i was working for that company great

4016
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:55,359
company nothing wrong with the company

4017
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:57,759
but sitting behind the desk from eight

4018
02:16:55,359 --> 02:17:00,559
till five and then i get to go to judo

4019
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:02,000
from six until nine at night you know my

4020
02:17:00,558 --> 02:17:04,079
whole day is tied up doing something

4021
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,318
that i'm really not passionate about she

4022
02:17:04,079 --> 02:17:08,159
said if you know if you can figure out

4023
02:17:06,318 --> 02:17:10,159
how to make money from your dojo and

4024
02:17:08,159 --> 02:17:11,679
other things judo related

4025
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:13,280
then i think you'll be successful and so

4026
02:17:11,679 --> 02:17:14,960
she's the one that my wife marie gave me

4027
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:16,639
that advice and i would give that to

4028
02:17:14,959 --> 02:17:18,638
others find something that you love

4029
02:17:16,638 --> 02:17:20,239
doing where it doesn't feel like work

4030
02:17:18,638 --> 02:17:22,398
something you're passionate about and if

4031
02:17:20,239 --> 02:17:24,079
the opportunity doesn't exist how to

4032
02:17:22,398 --> 02:17:25,119
make money on it you can create the

4033
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:27,439
opportunity

4034
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:29,599
be resourceful figure it out don't let

4035
02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:32,000
anybody tell you you can't do it right i

4036
02:17:29,599 --> 02:17:34,398
i didn't know that i could have a 200

4037
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:36,079
person judo school that only taught judo

4038
02:17:34,398 --> 02:17:37,039
because that really didn't exist in this

4039
02:17:36,079 --> 02:17:38,879
country

4040
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:40,399
you know that it actually charges money

4041
02:17:38,879 --> 02:17:42,239
like jiu jitsu charges right we're

4042
02:17:40,398 --> 02:17:43,679
talking not there's plenty of clubs out

4043
02:17:42,239 --> 02:17:45,519
there that charge 10 bucks a month that

4044
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:47,280
might have 100 people but there's not

4045
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:50,719
many that you know with the tuition is

4046
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:52,319
150 a month having 200 people so that's

4047
02:17:50,718 --> 02:17:54,799
a successful business

4048
02:17:52,318 --> 02:17:56,318
um but it wasn't done before but be

4049
02:17:54,799 --> 02:17:58,159
passionate about it understand you're

4050
02:17:56,318 --> 02:18:00,239
going to fail understand you're going to

4051
02:17:58,159 --> 02:18:02,398
get knocked down beat up

4052
02:18:00,239 --> 02:18:04,159
right there's going to be dark days but

4053
02:18:02,398 --> 02:18:06,478
you got to persevere you got to believe

4054
02:18:04,159 --> 02:18:08,318
in yourself you got to have a plan

4055
02:18:06,478 --> 02:18:09,519
you have to be willing to learn from

4056
02:18:08,318 --> 02:18:11,920
other people

4057
02:18:09,519 --> 02:18:13,760
and that's what i did i i if i didn't

4058
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:15,359
know it i brought somebody in to tell me

4059
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:16,880
what am i doing wrong like look from the

4060
02:18:15,359 --> 02:18:18,639
outside what do you see

4061
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:20,159
okay great then you got to be willing to

4062
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:21,279
change you're going to be willing to

4063
02:18:20,159 --> 02:18:22,558
adapt

4064
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:25,840
you know and

4065
02:18:22,558 --> 02:18:27,759
i think listening believing in myself

4066
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:29,200
and you know creating opportunity and

4067
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:30,478
the other thing is

4068
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:33,679
helping others

4069
02:18:30,478 --> 02:18:34,879
something i always did in my in my judo

4070
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:36,879
life

4071
02:18:34,879 --> 02:18:38,959
and in my business life

4072
02:18:36,879 --> 02:18:40,879
if somebody came to me and asked for

4073
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:42,398
help with hey man is there something you

4074
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:44,239

you know

4079
02:18:50,478 --> 02:18:54,079
i was creative and trying to figure out

4080
02:18:52,079 --> 02:18:56,159
a way to help them make it work because

4081
02:18:54,079 --> 02:18:57,840
if that really was their dream and i

4082
02:18:56,159 --> 02:19:01,359
could help them do their dream

4083
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:03,359
i felt like that person would then

4084
02:19:01,359 --> 02:19:05,439
give nothing but good good comments

4085
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:06,399
about us good good like they'll remember

4086
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:08,398
it forever

4087
02:19:06,398 --> 02:19:10,398
they become like family and they've been

4088
02:19:08,398 --> 02:19:12,079
the best advocates for your business

4089
02:19:10,398 --> 02:19:13,760
ever and so

4090
02:19:12,079 --> 02:19:15,519
the kids that i taught at my dojo were

4091
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:17,439
treated that way the people that worked

4092
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:18,398
for me get treated that way the people

4093
02:19:17,439 --> 02:19:20,159
that

4094
02:19:18,398 --> 02:19:22,239
my customers that i work with and

4095
02:19:20,159 --> 02:19:24,079
building their dojos

4096
02:19:22,239 --> 02:19:25,599
get treated that way people that ran

4097
02:19:24,079 --> 02:19:27,920
tournaments whether it was grappler's

4098
02:19:25,599 --> 02:19:30,000
quest years ago and helping that guy

4099
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:31,280
with a full set of mats for his brian

4100
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,558
simmons with his

4101
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:34,159

4107
02:19:42,558 --> 02:19:46,558
you know and i think it goes a long way

4108
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:49,439
well and i gotta comment so in a small

4109
02:19:46,558 --> 02:19:51,438
way i've uh people may not know i think

4110
02:19:49,439 --> 02:19:54,720
it's still on youtube we previously

4111
02:19:51,439 --> 02:19:57,359
talked many years ago and i remember

4112
02:19:54,719 --> 02:19:59,199
it uh you were so kind to me and you

4113
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:01,680
didn't really know who i was you just

4114
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:03,200
took me as a human being you welcomed me

4115
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:05,359
into your dojo and we just had a

4116
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:06,960
conversation on a podcast or whatever

4117
02:20:05,359 --> 02:20:10,880
the heck you call that thing

4118
02:20:06,959 --> 02:20:13,679
and you were just very kind and

4119
02:20:10,879 --> 02:20:16,318
and you were also just

4120
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:18,398
it was the last conversation i had when

4121
02:20:16,318 --> 02:20:20,239
i showed up to mit

4122
02:20:18,398 --> 02:20:23,119
and it stayed with me

4123
02:20:20,239 --> 02:20:26,239
so i've resumed doing this podcast but

4124
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:29,040
it stayed with me because you said

4125
02:20:26,239 --> 02:20:30,879
you said that i did a good job at this

4126
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:32,800
and people especially at that time

4127
02:20:30,879 --> 02:20:34,959
didn't tell me that

4128
02:20:32,799 --> 02:20:36,879
you know didn't and just that that

4129
02:20:34,959 --> 02:20:38,318
little act of kindness is probably just

4130
02:20:36,879 --> 02:20:40,719
a regular part of your day you had a

4131
02:20:38,318 --> 02:20:43,279
busy day it was the end of the day just

4132
02:20:40,719 --> 02:20:45,199
saying that that was powerful and and

4133
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:46,479
that pays off somehow

4134
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:48,800
um

4135
02:20:46,478 --> 02:20:51,279
so thank you for that yeah

4136
02:20:48,799 --> 02:20:52,318
but i was sincere right it was genuine i

4137
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:54,319
felt like

4138
02:20:52,318 --> 02:20:55,840
i had been to so many interviews when

4139
02:20:54,318 --> 02:20:57,680
it's around the olympic time there's

4140
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:58,960
lots of beat reporters that come out and

4141
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:00,000
they're trying to get your time and

4142
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:01,199
they're just

4143
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,280
they're there because they have to get

4144
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:05,120
the story yeah for their newspaper or

4145
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:08,159
their television show and a lot of times

4146
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:10,160
those people show up right and

4147
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:12,239
they pronounce my name wrong or they get

4148
02:21:10,159 --> 02:21:14,239
something wrong about the background or

4149
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:16,478
they offend me because

4150
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:17,840
they call me five minutes before that

4151
02:21:16,478 --> 02:21:19,199
they're supposed to be there and say oh

4152
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:21,359
sorry we're running late we'll be there

4153
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:23,359
an hour and a half well i'm a busy guy

4154
02:21:21,359 --> 02:21:25,840
too and you know like yeah you were

4155
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:28,318
somebody that showed up was so prepared

4156
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:31,520
with your notes knew everything about

4157
02:21:28,318 --> 02:21:33,840
like the history of what i had done

4158
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:35,920
the questions you asked were intelligent

4159
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:38,398
questions they were well thought out and

4160
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:40,879
at the end of that that interview i was

4161
02:21:38,398 --> 02:21:42,719
really genuinely impressed

4162
02:21:40,879 --> 02:21:44,559
and i wanted to let you know you did a

4163
02:21:42,719 --> 02:21:45,920
great job because you stood out from the

4164
