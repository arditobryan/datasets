1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,919
sarah walker a nestor biologist and

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,638
theoretical physicist at arizona state

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,960
university and the santa fe institute

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,839
she's interested in the origin of life

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,000
how to find life on other worlds and in

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,079
general the more fundamental question of

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,160
what even life is

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,239
she seeks to discover the universal laws

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,518
that describe living systems on earth

11
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:27,358
and elsewhere using physics biology and

12
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:29,439
computation

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,280
quick mention of our sponsors athletic

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,880
greens netsuite blinkist and magic spoon

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,200
check them out in the description to

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,440
support this podcast as a side note let

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,000
me say that my hope for this podcast is

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,479
to try and alternate between technical

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,799
and non-technical discussions to jump

20
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,799
from the big picture down to specific

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,919
detailed research and back to the big

22
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,679
picture and to do so with scientists and

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,280
non-scientists

24
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,600
long term i hope to alternate between

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
discussions of cutting-edge research in

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,198
ai physics biology

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,280
to topics of music sport and history and

28
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,560
then back to ai

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,200
ai is home

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,519
i hope you come along with me for that

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,600
wild oscillating journey

32
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,599
some people message me saying to slow

33
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,599
down since they're falling behind on the

34
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,839
episodes of this podcast

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,679
to their disappointment i have to say

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,478
that i'll probably do more episodes not

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,400
less

38
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,560
but you really don't need to listen to

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,960
every episode just listen to the ones

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
that spark your curiosity think about it

41
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,640
like a party full of strangers you don't

42
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,158
have to talk to everyone

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,159
just walk over to the ones who look

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,759
interesting and get to know them

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,520
and if you're lucky that one

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,519
conversation with a stranger might

47
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,599
change the direction of your life

48
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,438
and it's a short life so be picky with

49
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,438
the strangers you talk to at this

50
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,679
metaphorical party

51
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,919
this is the lex friedman podcast and

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
here is my conversation with sarah

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,920
walker

54
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,399
how did life originate on earth what are

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,200
the various hypotheses for how life

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,640
originated on earth yeah so

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,478
i guess you're asking a historical

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,879
question which is always a good place to

59
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,118
start thinking about life um

60
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,120
so there's a lot of ideas about how life

61
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,080
started on earth um probably the most

62
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,599
popular is what's called the rna world

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,360
scenario um so this idea is probably the

64
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,959
one that you'll see most reported in the

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,200
news

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,400
and is based on the idea that there are

67
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,238
um

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,239
molecules in our bodies um that uh relay

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,480
genetic information and we know those as

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,759
dna obviously but there's also sort of

71
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,799
an intermediary called rna ribonucleic

72
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,199
acid

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,719
that also plays the role of proteins

74
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,639
and

75
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,560
people came up with this idea in the 80s

76
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,000
that maybe that was the first genetic

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,199
material because it could play both

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,159
roles of being genetic and performing

79
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,799
catalysis and then somehow that idea got

80
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,439
reduced to this idea that there was a

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,760
molecule that emerged on early earth and

82
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,199
underwent darwinian evolution and that

83
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,280
was the start of life

84
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,399
so there's a lot of assumptions

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,158
packed in there that we could unpack but

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,680
that's sort of the leading hypothesis

87
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,919
there's also other ideas about life

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,760
starting as metabolism and so that's

89
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,359
more connected to the geochemistry of

90
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,959
early earth

91
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,640
and it would be kind of more focused on

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,878
this idea that you get some kind of

93
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,559
catalytic cycle of molecules that can

94
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:26,798
reproduce themselves and form some kind

95
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,479
of metabolism and then life starts

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,920
basically as self-organization and then

97
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,199
you have to explain how evolution comes

98
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,039
later

99
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,679
right so that's the difference between

100
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,679
sort of uh energy and genetic code so

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,599
like energy and information are those

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,560
are the two kind of yeah

103
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,639
yeah i think that's a good way of

104
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,000
putting that it's um

105
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,878
it's kind of funny because i think most

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,799
of the people that think about these

107
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,840
things are really disciplinary bias so

108
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
the people that tend to think about

109
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,840
genetics come from a biology background

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,200
and they're really evolution focused and

111
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,959
so they're worried about where does the

112
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,158
information come from and how does it

113
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,759
change over time but they're talking

114
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:59,039
about information in a really narrow way

115
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,120
where they're talking about a genetic

116
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,878
sequence and then most of people that

117
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,360
think about

118
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,959
metabolism origins of life scenarios

119
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,560
tend to be people like physicists or

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,400
geochemists that are worried about what

121
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,000
are the energy sources and what you know

122
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
like what kinds of organization can you

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,160
get out of those energy sources okay so

124
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,358
which one is your favorite i don't like

125
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,120
either

126
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,000
okay all right can we talk about them

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
for a little bit longer though

128
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,000
uh so okay so there's uh early earth

129
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,799
what was that like was there just mostly

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,639
covered by oceans was there heat sources

131
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,360
energy sources so if we

132
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,439
uh talk about the metabolism view of the

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,600
origin of life like where was the source

134
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,680
of energy probably the most popular view

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
for where the original life happened on

136
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,680
earth is hydrothermal vents because they

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,720
had sufficient energy

138
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,160
and so we don't really know a lot about

139
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,560
early earth

140
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,919
we have you know some ideas about when

141
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,519
oceans first formed and things like that

142
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,478
but the time of the original life is

143
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,959
kind of

144
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,478
um not well understood or pinned down

145
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,079
and the conditions on earth at that time

146
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,758
are not well known

147
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,839
but a lot of people do think that there

148
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,479
was probably hydrothermal vents which

149
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,560
are really hot

150
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:13,120
chemically active regions say on the sea

151
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,038
floor in modern times which also would

152
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,800
have been present on early earth and

153
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,079
they would have provided energy and

154
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,439
organics

155
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,439
and basically all of the right

156
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,800
conditions for

157
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,680
the origins of life which is one of the

158
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,120
reasons that we look for these

159
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,199
hydrothermal systems when we're talking

160
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,918
about life elsewhere too

161
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,080
okay and for the genetic code

162
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,319
the idea is that the rna is the first

163
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,560
like why would rna

164
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,519
be the first moment you can say it's

165
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,399
life

166
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,879
i guess the idea is it could both

167
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,038
have persistent information

168
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:47,839
and then it can also do some of the work

169
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,038
of like what creating a self-sustaining

170
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,918
organism

171
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,719
yeah that's the basic idea so the idea

172
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,478
is you have in an rna molecule you have

173
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,720
a sequence of characters say so you can

174
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:01,038
treat it like a string in a computer

175
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,639
and it can be copied so information can

176
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,478
be propagated

177
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,519
which is important for

178
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,758
evolution because evolution happens by

179
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,519
having inheritance of information so for

180
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,759
example you know like my eyes are brown

181
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,079
because my mother's eyes were brown

182
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,160
so you need that copying of information

183
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,120
but then

184
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,120
you

185
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
also have the ability to perform

186
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,439
catalysis which means that that rna

187
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,360
molecule is not inert in that

188
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,719
environment but it actually interacts

189
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,919
with something that could potentially

190
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,880
mediate say a metabolism that could then

191
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,359
fuel

192
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,240
the actual reproduction of that molecule

193
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,680
so

194
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
in some ways

195
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,000
people think that rna gives you

196
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,680
you know

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the most bang for your buck in a single

198
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
molecule and therefore

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
you know it gives you all the features

200
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,199
that you might think are life um

201
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,800
and so that this is sort of where this

202
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,478
rna world conjecture came from is

203
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,240
because of those two properties

204
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:01,038
isn't it amazing that rna came to be

205
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,598
in general isn't it yes that is amazing

206
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,360
okay so we're not talking down about rna

207
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,279
no no i love rna it's one of my favorite

208
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,800
molecules i think it's beautiful it's

209
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,198
just not step one

210
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,038
yeah i think i think the issue it's not

211
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,720
even the rna world is a problem and

212
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:19,439
actually if you really um dig into it

213
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,199
the rna world is not one hypothesis it

214
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,918
is a set of hypothesis

215
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,720
hypotheses sorry and they range from

216
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,439
a

217
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,599
molecule of rna spontaneously emerged on

218
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,120
the early earth and started evolving

219
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,719
which is kind of like the hardest rna

220
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,280
world scenario which is the one i cited

221
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,680
and i get a little um

222
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,000
uh animated about because it seems so

223
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,439
blatantly wrong to me but that's a

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,918
separate story and then the other one is

225
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,800
actually something i agree with which is

226
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,399
that

227
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
you can say there was an rna world

228
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,959
because rna was the first genetic

229
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,959
material for life on earth so an rna

230
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,839
world could just be

231
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,918
the earliest organisms that had

232
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,719
genetics in a modern sense didn't have

233
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,719
dna evolved yet they had rna

234
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
right and so that's sort of a softer rna

235
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
world scenario in the sense that it

236
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,120
doesn't mean it was the first thing that

237
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,758
happened

238
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,598
but it was a thing that definitely

239
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,720
was part of the lineage of events that

240
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,719
led to us

241
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,120
so if life was a

242
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,039
like a best of album it would be on the

243
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,959
maybe one of the songs on there yes one

244
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,800
of the early songs okay it's on the

245
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,680
greatest hits greatest hits that's the

246
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,000
word i was looking for okay did life do

247
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,240
you think originate once

248
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,240
twice three times on earth multiple

249
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,639
times what do you think i think that's a

250
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,918
really difficult question um and an

251
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,598
important question it's a super

252
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,759
important question no that no it's a

253
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,479
really important question um and so

254
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,240
there there's some so there's

255
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,639
there's a lot of questions in that

256
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,120
question um so one of the first ones

257
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,879
that i think needs to be addressed is is

258
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,720
the original life a continuous process

259
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,080
on our planet so

260
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,720
we think about the original life is

261
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,480
something that happened on earth um say

262
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,240
almost four billion years ago because we

263
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,839
have evidence of life emerging very

264
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,639
early on our planet

265
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
um

266
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,360
and then an original life event quote

267
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,160
unquote a singular event whatever that

268
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,440
was happened and then all life on earth

269
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,679
that we know

270
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,839
is a descendant of that particular event

271
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,199
in our universe right and so

272
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,080
um but

273
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,160
uh we don't have um

274
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,879
any idea one way or the other if the

275
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,159
original life is happening repeatedly

276
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,519
and maybe it's just not taking off

277
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,519
because life is already established

278
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,720
that's a argument that people will make

279
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,560
or

280
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,600
maybe there are alternative forms of

281
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,799
life on earth that we don't even

282
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
recognize

283
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,599
um so this is the idea of a shadow

284
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
biosphere that there actually might just

285
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,759
be completely other life on earth but

286
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,799
it's so alien that we don't even know

287
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,399
what it is

288
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,319
i'm gonna have to talk to you about the

289
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,159
shadow biosphere

290
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,360
in a second but first let me ask for the

291
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,079
other alternative which is panspermia

292
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,759
right so that's the idea the hypothesis

293
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,759
that life exists elsewhere in the

294
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,879
universe and got to us through like an

295
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,720
asteroid

296
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,559
or a planetoid or some

297
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,959
uh according to wikipedia space dust

298
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,799
whatever the heck that is

299
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,759
uh it sounds fun but basically rode

300
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,439
along

301
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,838
yeah whatever

302
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,959
kind of rock and got to us

303
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,440
do you think that's at all a possibility

304
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,518
sure so i think the reason that most

305
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,040
original life scientists are interested

306
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,799
in the origin of life on earth and say

307
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,919
not the original life

308
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,719
um

309
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,000
you know on mars and then panspermia you

310
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,079
know the exchange of life between

311
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,440
planets being the explanation is once

312
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,759
you start removing the original life

313
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,000
from earth you know even less about it

314
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,679
than you do if you study it on earth

315
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,200
although i think there are ways of

316
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,879
reformulating the problem this is why i

317
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,480
said earlier like oh you mean the

318
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,559
historical original life problem you

319
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,159
don't mean the problem of how does life

320
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,679
arise in the universe and what the

321
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,278
universal principles are because there's

322
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,439
this historic problem how did it happen

323
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,600
on early earth and there's a more

324
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
tractable general problem of how does it

325
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,560
happen

326
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,320
and how does it happen is something we

327
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,399
can actually ask in the lab how does it

328
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
how did it how did it happen on early

329
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,839
earth is

330
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,679
a much more detailed and nuanced

331
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,959
question and requires detailed knowledge

332
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,879
of what was happening on early earth

333
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,479
that we don't have

334
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,000
and i'm personally more interested in

335
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,278
general mechanisms so to me it doesn't

336
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,120
matter if it happened on earth or it

337
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,879
happened on mars

338
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
it just matters that it happened we have

339
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,759
evidence that happened

340
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,799
the question is did it happen more than

341
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:26,078
once in our universe and so the reason i

342
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:28,639
don't find panspermia as a particularly

343
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,519
i think it's a fascinating um hypothesis

344
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,319
i definitely think it's possible um and

345
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,360
um

346
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,720
and i in particular i think it's

347
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,320
possible once you get to the stage of a

348
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,480
life where you have technology because

349
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,640
then you you obviously can spread out

350
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,120
into the cosmos um but it's also

351
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,519
possible for microbes because we know

352
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,159
that um certain microorganisms can

353
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,919
survive the journey in space and we you

354
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,278
know they can live in a rock and go

355
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,639
between mars and earth like people have

356
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:56,399
done experiments to try to prove that

357
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,360
could work um so in that scenario it's

358
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,360
super cool because then you get

359
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,959
planetary exchange but say we go find we

360
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,399
go look for life on mars and it ends up

361
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,479
being exactly the same life we have on

362
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,679
earth biochemically speaking then we

363
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,680
haven't really discovered something new

364
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,599
about the universe what kind of aliens

365
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,078
are possible were there other original

366
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,920
life events if we find if all the life

367
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,359
we ever find is the same original life

368
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,078
event in the universe it doesn't help me

369
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,919
solve my problem but it's possible that

370
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:23,519
that would be a sign that you could

371
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,919
separate the environment from the

372
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,759
basic ingredients yes so that's true you

373
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,078
can have like a life gun

374
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,439
that you shoot throughout the universe

375
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,439
and then uh

376
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,120
like once you shoot it it's like the

377
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,680
simpsons with a makeup gun that was a

378
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,959
great episode uh when you shoot this

379
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,199
life gun

380
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:44,078
it'll he'll find the earth's it'll like

381
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,040
get sticky it'll stick to the earth's

382
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,078
and that kind of reduces the barrier of

383
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,639
uh

384
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,120
like the time it takes the the luck it

385
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,440
takes to actually from nothing from the

386
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,480
basic chemistry from the basic physics

387
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,320
the universe for the life to spring up

388
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,120
yeah i think this is actually super

389
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,079
important to just think about like does

390
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,720
life

391
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,239
getting seated on a planet have to be

392
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,920
geochemically compatible with that

393
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,000
planet so you're suggesting like we

394
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:13,439
could just shoot guns in space and like

395
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,320
life could go to mars and then it would

396
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,399
just live there and be happy there um

397
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,519
but that's actually an open question so

398
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,600
one of the things i was going to say in

399
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,039
response to your question about

400
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,360
whether the original life happened once

401
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,799
or multiple times is for me personally

402
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,440
right now in my thinking although this

403
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,879
changes on a weekly basis but um is that

404
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,720
i think of life more as a planetary

405
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,120
phenomena so i think the original life

406
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,278
because um because life is so

407
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,360
um intimately tied to planetary cycles

408
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,559
and planetary processes and this goes

409
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,879
all the way back through the history of

410
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,559
our planet that the original life itself

411
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,480
grew out of geochemistry and became

412
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,078
coupled and controlled geochemistry and

413
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
and when we start to talk about life

414
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,278
existing on the planet is when we have

415
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,519
evidence of life

416
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,159
actually influencing properties of the

417
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,198
planet um and so

418
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,360
so if life is a planetary property um

419
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,799
then going to mars is not a trivial

420
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
thing because you basically have to make

421
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,719
ours

422
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,560
mars more earth-like um and so in some

423
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,560
sense um like when i think about sort of

424
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,679
long-term vision of humans in space for

425
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,119
example

426
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,278
really what you're talking about when

427
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,039
you're saying let's send our

428
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,399
civilization to mars is you're not

429
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,639
saying let's send our civilization to

430
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,720
mars you're saying let's reproduce our

431
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,240
planet on mars like the information from

432
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,240
our planet actually has to go to mars

433
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,360
and make mars more earth-like which

434
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,959
means that you're now having a

435
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,480
reproduction process like a cell

436
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,479
reproduces itself to propagate

437
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,759
information in the future

438
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,519
planets have to figure out how to

439
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,838
reproduce their conditions including

440
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,440
geochemical conditions on other planets

441
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,959
in order to actually reproduce life in

442
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,800
the universe which is kind of a little

443
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,719
bit radical but i think

444
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,198
for long-term sustainability of life on

445
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,879
a planet that's absolutely essential

446
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,799
okay so

447
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,639
if we were to think about life as a

448
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,120
planetary phenomenon

449
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,440
and so life on mars would be best if

450
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,519
it's way different than life on earth

451
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,560
we have to ask the very basic question

452
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,440
of

453
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,278
what

454
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,800
is life

455
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,159
i actually don't think that's the right

456
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,359
question to ask

457
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,838
it took me a long time to get there

458
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,680
right so cross it out yeah you cross it

459
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,240
off your list it's wrong

460
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,078
no question um no no no i mean i think

461
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,320
it has an answer but i think the part of

462
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,679
the problem is um you know most of the

463
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
places in science where we get really

464
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,120
stuck is because we don't know what

465
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,559
questions to ask um and so you can't

466
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,240
answer a question if you're asking the

467
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:30,000
wrong question um and i think uh the way

468
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,440
i think about it is obviously i'm

469
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,639
interested in what life is so i'm being

470
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,079
a little cheeky when i say that's the

471
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,000
wrong question to ask that's exactly

472
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,679
like the question that's like the core

473
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,799
of my existence but

474
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,278
um

475
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,679
but i think the way of framing that is

476
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,159
what is it about our universe that

477
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:49,039
allows features that we associate life

478
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,399
to be there um and so really what i

479
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,559
guess when i'm asking that question what

480
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,879
i'm after is an explanatory framework

481
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:57,278
for what life is right and so most

482
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,000
people they try to go in and define life

483
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,919
and they say well life is uh say a

484
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,278
self-reproducing chemical system capable

485
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,838
of darwinian evolution that's a very

486
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,240
popular definition for life um or life

487
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,079
is something that metabolizes and eats

488
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,399
that is not how i think about life what

489
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,319
i think about life is there are

490
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,519
principles and laws that govern our

491
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
universe

492
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,399
that we don't understand yet

493
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,399
that have something to do with

494
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,399
how information interacts with the

495
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,399
physical world i don't know exactly what

496
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,039
i mean even when i say that um because

497
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,278
we don't know these rules um but it's a

498
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,439
little bit like um i like to use

499
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,278
analogies you'll give me time to be like

500
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,399
a little long-winded for a second even

501
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,519
in as i um but um but sort of like if

502
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,600
you look at the history of physics for

503
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,720
example this is like so we are in the

504
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,720
period of the development of

505
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,959
thought on our planet where we don't

506
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,800
understand what we are yet right um

507
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,919
there was a period of thought in the

508
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,758
history of our planet where we didn't

509
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,599
understand what gravity was

510
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,919
um and we didn't understand for example

511
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,759
that planets in the heavens

512
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,278
you know were actually planets or that

513
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,000
they operated by the same laws that we

514
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,160
did

515
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,078
um and so there has been this sort of

516
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,400
progression of getting a deeper

517
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,078
understanding of explaining basic

518
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,439
phenomena like i'm not gonna drop the

519
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,678
cup i'll drop the water bottle there you

520
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,079
go okay that fell right but why did that

521
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,280
fall um

522
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,959
this is why i'm a theorist not an

523
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,639
experiment

524
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,240
i could have gone wrong in so many ways

525
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,439
i know i could have especially if i did

526
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,400
the confidence smash anyway

527
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,759
um so um so if you think you take this

528
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,720
view that there's sort of some missing

529
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,279
principles i associate them uh to

530
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,360
information and what it what the sort of

531
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,440
feeling there is there's some missing

532
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,359
explanatory framework for how our

533
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,400
universe works and if we understood that

534
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,759
physics it would explain what we are um

535
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,559
it might also explain a lot of other

536
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,879
features we don't associate to life um

537
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,558
and so it's a little like um people

538
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,799
accept the fact that gravity is a

539
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,639
universal phenomena but when we want to

540
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,839
study gravity we study things like large

541
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,038
scale

542
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,639
you know galactic structures or black

543
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,319
holes or planets

544
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,919
if we want to understand information and

545
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,439
how it operates in the physical world we

546
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,038
study intelligent systems or living

547
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,120
systems because they are the

548
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:12,558
manifestation of that physics

549
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,399
and the fact that we can't see that

550
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,319
clearly yet or we don't have that

551
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,440
explanatory framework i think it's just

552
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,439
because we haven't been thinking about

553
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,360
the problem deeply enough but i feel

554
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,880
like if you're explaining something

555
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,038
you're deriving it from some more

556
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,840
fundamental property and of course

557
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:30,160
um i have to say i'm wearing my my

558
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,119
physicist hat so i have a huge bias of

559
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,279
liking

560
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,558
simple elegant explanations of the

561
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,519
universe that

562
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,519
um

563
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,119
you know really are compelling but i

564
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,839
think one of the things that i've sort

565
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,678
of

566
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,199
maybe in some ways rejected my training

567
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,280
as a physicist is that most of the

568
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,279
elegant explanations that we have so far

569
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,038
don't include us in the universe and i

570
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,240
can't help but think there's something

571
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:51,759
really special about what we are and

572
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,880
there have to be some deep principles at

573
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,480
play there

574
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,960
um

575
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,440
and so so that's sort of my perspective

576
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,919
on it now when you ask me what life is i

577
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,919
have some ideas of what i think it is

578
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,840
but i think that we haven't

579
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,000
gotten there yet because we haven't been

580
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,279
able to see that structure and it's and

581
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,279
just go back to the gravity example it's

582
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,200
a little like you know in ancient times

583
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,720
they didn't know i was talking about

584
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,798
stars and heavens and things they didn't

585
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,400
know those were um you know governed by

586
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,319
the same principles as that starting to

587
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,360
experiment here's where i was going with

588
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,200
it once you realize like newton did that

589
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,479
you know heavenly emotions and earthly

590
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,240
emotions are governed by the same

591
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,679
principles and you unify terrestrial and

592
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,120
celestial motion you get these more

593
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,000
powerful ideas

594
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,399
um and i i think where life is is

595
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,480
somehow unifying these abstract ideas of

596
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
computation and information

597
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,279
with the physical world with matter and

598
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,279
realizing that there's some explanatory

599
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,000
framework that's not physics and it's

600
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,519
not computation but it's something

601
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,480
that's deeper

602
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,000
so

603
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,200
answering the question of what is life

604
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,038
requires

605
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,519
deeply understanding something about the

606
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,440
universe as information processing

607
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,558
universe is computation

608
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,120
something about

609
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,599
like would uh once you come up with an

610
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,759
answer to what is life well the words

611
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,079
information and computation be in the

612
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,839
paragraph no i don't think so oh damn it

613
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,599
okay i know it doesn't help does it i

614
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,639
know i i hate actually i hate this about

615
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,639
what i do because it's so hard to

616
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,120
communicate right with words like when

617
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,679
you have words that are

618
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,199
um ideas that have historically

619
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,960
described one thing and you're trying to

620
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,759
describe something people haven't seen

621
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,679
yet right and the words just don't fit

622
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,679
so what uh what's wrong is it too

623
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,759
ambiguous the word information we could

624
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,679
switch to binary if you want yeah no i

625
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,000
don't think it's binary either i think

626
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,280
information is just loaded i use it so

627
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,279
the other way i might talk about it is

628
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,119
the physics of causation but i think

629
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,720
that's worse because causation is even

630
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,000
more loaded word than

631
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,240
um

632
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,119
information causation is fundamental you

633
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,880
think i do yeah and um in some sense i

634
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,639
think the physics so this is the really

635
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,240
radical part some sense like when i

636
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,480
really think about it sort of most

637
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,319
deeply uh what i think life is is

638
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,360
actually the physics of existence what

639
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,798
gets to exist and why um and you know

640
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,918
for simple elementary particles that's

641
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,359
not very complicated because the

642
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,679
interactions are simple but for things

643
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,199
like um you know you and me and human

644
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,038
civilizations

645
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,400
um you know what comes next in the

646
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,558
universe is really dependent on what

647
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,320
came before and there's a huge space of

648
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,399
possibilities of things that can exist

649
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,359
and when i say information and causation

650
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,120
what i mean is why is it that

651
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,959
cups evolved in the universe and not

652
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,599
some other object that could deliver

653
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,440
water and not spill it

654
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,199
i don't know what you would call it uh

655
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,919
maybe it wouldn't be a cup but um but

656
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,600
it's a huge it it's um

657
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,038
you know you know people talk about the

658
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,879
space of things that could exist as

659
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,879
being actually infinitely large right i

660
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,360
don't know if i believe in infinity

661
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,360
um but i do think that

662
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,759
there is something very interesting

663
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,759
about

664
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,919
the problem of what exists in its

665
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,799
relationship to life so do you think

666
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,480
this

667
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:57,839
the set of things that could exist is

668
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,759
finite

669
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,639
it's very large but like if we were to

670
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,919
think

671
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,240
about the physics of existence

672
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,400
like how how many shapes of mugs can

673
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,319
there be like is uh

674
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,880
in the initial programming i should go

675
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,879
to the math department for that but

676
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,240
so that's not a topology question i just

677
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,080
mean

678
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,319
maybe another way to ask is what do you

679
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:23,519
think is fundamental to the universe and

680
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,439
what is emergent so if existence i was

681
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,279
supposed to think of that as somehow

682
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,880
fundamental you think so there's a

683
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,480
couple problems in physics that i think

684
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,240
this is related to one is why does

685
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,200
mathematics work at describing reality

686
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,679
so well

687
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,600
um and then there is this problem of we

688
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,519
don't understand why the laws of physics

689
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,359
are the way they are or why certain

690
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,960
things get to exist or

691
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,558
what put in place the initial condition

692
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,319
of our universe right there's all of

693
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:50,158
these sort of really deep and big

694
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:52,158
problems and they they all um

695
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,039
indirectly are related i think to the

696
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,880
same kind of thing that um

697
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,960
you know our physics is really good if

698
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,880
you specify the initial condition at

699
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,360
specifying a certain sequence of events

700
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,120
but it doesn't deal with the fact that

701
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,558
other things could have happened which

702
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,639
is kind of an informational property

703
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,440
like a counter factual property

704
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,559
um

705
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,440
and it's not good at explaining

706
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,798
uh

707
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,720
you know this conversation right now

708
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,639
it's just it there are certain things

709
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,480
that are outside the explanatory reach

710
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,799
of current physics and

711
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,960
um i think they require looking at it

712
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,480
from a completely different direction

713
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,919
um and so i don't want to have to

714
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,159
fine-tune the initial condition of the

715
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,520
universe to specify precisely all the

716
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
information in this conversation i think

717
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,119
that's a ridiculous assertion um but

718
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,879
that's sort of like how people want to

719
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,759
frame it when they talk about

720
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,760
um

721
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,079
you know the standard model is

722
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,519
sufficient if we had computing power to

723
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,678
basically explain all life in our

724
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,918
existence an interesting thing you said

725
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,798
is the way we think about information

726
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,440
computation is by observing a particular

727
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,839
kind of systems on earth

728
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,759
that exhibit something we think of as

729
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,000
intelligence but that's

730
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,519
that's like uh looking at i guess the

731
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,119
tip of an iceberg and we should be

732
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,158
really looking at the fundamentals of

733
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,759
like the iceberg like like like what

734
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,480
makes

735
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,960
water and ice and and and the chemistry

736
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,558
that from which intelligence emerges

737
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,319
essentially

738
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,759
we can't just couple the information

739
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,200
from the physics and i think that's what

740
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:20,558
we've gotten really good at doing

741
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,919
especially with

742
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,720
sort of

743
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,400
the modern age where you know software

744
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,000
is so abstracted

745
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,440
um from

746
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,119
hardware

747
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,679
but the entire process of biological

748
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,599
evolution has basically been built like

749
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,600
been building layers of increasing

750
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,000
abstraction and so it's really hard to

751
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,399
see that physics in us but it's much

752
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,480
clearer to see it in molecules

753
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,159
yeah but i guess i'm trying to figure

754
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,480
out what what do you think are the best

755
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,240
tools to look at it

756
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,360
what do you think

757
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,558
an open mind is that a tool

758
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,918
what's the physics of an open mind

759
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:59,599
i think if we saw that we'll solve

760
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,759
everything i'm saying an open mind

761
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,678
because i think the biggest stumbling

762
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,000
block um

763
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,919
to understanding sort of the things i've

764
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,119
been trying to articulate or and when i

765
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,679
talk also with colleagues that are

766
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,038
thinking deeply about these same issues

767
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,038
is

768
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,400
none of it is inconsistent with what we

769
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,400
know it's just such a radically

770
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,840
different perception perception of the

771
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,679
way we understand things now that it's

772
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,199
hard for people to get there and in some

773
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,960
ways you have to almost forget what

774
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,720
you've learned in order to learn

775
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,558
something new right so i feel like most

776
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,600
of my career trying to understand the

777
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:34,158
problem of life has been variously

778
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:36,558
forgetting and then relearning things

779
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,400
that i learned in physics and and i

780
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,319
think you have to

781
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,559
you have to have a capacity

782
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,399
to learn things but then accept that

783
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,918
things that you were you you learned

784
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,200
might not be true

785
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,480
um

786
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,038
or

787
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,839
or might need refinement or reframing

788
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:53,440
um

789
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:54,720
and the best way i can say that is just

790
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,320
like with a physics education there are

791
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,000
just certain things you're told in

792
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,879
undergrad that are like facts about the

793
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,960
world

794
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,640
and your physics professors never tell

795
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,720
you that those facts actually emerge

796
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,240
from a human mind right so we're taught

797
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,360
to think about say the laws of physics

798
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,640
for example

799
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,158
as this like

800
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,600
autonomous thing that exists outside of

801
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,159
our universe and tells our universe how

802
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,918
it works yeah um but the laws of physics

803
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,520
were invented by human minds to describe

804
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,038
things that are regularities in our

805
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,558
everyday experience

806
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,879
right they don't exist autonomous to the

807
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:24,558
universe right so it's like turtles on

808
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,559
top of turtles but

809
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,480
eventually gets the human mind and then

810
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,119
you have to explain the human mind with

811
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,440
the turtles yes so you have to yeah it

812
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,959
comes from humans this understanding the

813
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,200
simplification of the universe these

814
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,360
models yeah there's a guy named stephen

815
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,080
wolfram there's a

816
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,759
concept called cellular automata so

817
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:47,038
there's a

818
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:49,359
there's some mysteries in these um

819
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,119
systems that are computational in nature

820
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,879
that have

821
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,119
maybe echoes

822
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,770
of the kind of mysteries we should

823
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,038
need to solve to understand what is life

824
00:26:57,769 --> 00:27:00,480
[Music]

825
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,640
so

826
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,720
if we could talk take a

827
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,520
computational view of things do you

828
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,759
think there's something compelling to

829
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,079
reducing everything down to computation

830
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,879
like the universe is computation and

831
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,158
then trying to understand

832
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,919
life so

833
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,000
throw away the biology throw away the

834
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,240
chemistry throw away even the physics

835
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,558
that you you learn undergrad in graduate

836
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,640
school and more look at these simple

837
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,558
little systems whether it's cellular

838
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,240
automata or whatever the heck kind of

839
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,240
computational systems that operate on

840
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,159
simple local rules and then create

841
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,240
complexity

842
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,640
as they evolve

843
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,200
is is it uh at all do you think

844
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,440
productive to focus on those kinds of

845
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,240
systems to get an inkling of what is

846
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,840
life

847
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,679
and if it is

848
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,678
do you do you think it's

849
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,399
it's possible to come up with some kind

850
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,880
of laws and principles about what makes

851
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,079
life in those computational

852
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,600
systems

853
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,319
so i like cellular automata i think

854
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,000
they're good toy models um but mostly

855
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,240
like where i've thought about them and

856
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,670
use them is to actually

857
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,640
um

858
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:09,360
[Music]

859
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,880
let's say poke at sort of the current

860
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,558
conceptual framework that we have and

861
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,799
see where the flaws are

862
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,158
um so i think like the part that you're

863
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:17,839
talking about that people find

864
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,600
intriguing is that if you have like a

865
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,519
fairly simple rule

866
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,959
and you specify some initial condition

867
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,960
and you run that rule and that initial

868
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,360
condition you could get really complex

869
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,600
patterns emerging and ooh doesn't that

870
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,959
look lifelike um

871
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:32,319
yeah

872
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,919
well it's like really surprising isn't

873
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,798
it it is really surprising and they're

874
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,278
beautiful um and i i think they have a

875
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:42,558
lot of nice features associated to them

876
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:45,679
um i think the things that i find yeah

877
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:47,359
so so i i do think um as a proof of

878
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,960
principle that you can get complex

879
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,000
things emerging from simple rules

880
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,960
they're great

881
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,599
um as a sort of proof of principle about

882
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,840
some of the ways that we might think of

883
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,158
computation as being sort of a

884
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,918
fundamental principle for dynamical

885
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,080
systems and maybe the the evolution of

886
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,600
the universe as a whole they're a great

887
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,000
model system

888
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:09,038
as an explanatory framework for life i

889
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,359
think

890
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,038
they're a bit problematic for the same

891
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,479
reason that

892
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,919
the laws of physics are a bit

893
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,558
problematic um and the clearest way i

894
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,520
can articulate that is like cellular

895
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,359
automata are actually cast in sort of a

896
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,798
conceptual framework for how the

897
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,918
universe should be described that goes

898
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,278
all the way back

899
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,600
to newton in fact with this idea that we

900
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:37,119
can have a fixed law of motion

901
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,719
which exists sort of it's given to you

902
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,398
you know the great programmer in the sky

903
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,480
gave you this equation

904
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,278
or this rule and then you just run with

905
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,200
it um and the rule doesn't have so a

906
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,679
good feature of the rule is it doesn't

907
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,759
have specified in the rule information

908
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,399
about the patterns it generates so you

909
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,558
wouldn't want for example the my cup or

910
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,158
my water bottle or you know me sitting

911
00:29:56,558 --> 00:29:59,440
here to be specified in the laws of

912
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,039
physics that would be ridiculous because

913
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,240
it wouldn't be a very simple explanation

914
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:03,599
of all things happening i'd have to

915
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,038
explain everything

916
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,480
so and tell your time to have that

917
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:07,599
feature

918
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,640
and the laws of physics have that

919
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,199
feature

920
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,759
um but but you know you also need to

921
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,159
specify the initial condition um and it

922
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,480
also it basically means that everything

923
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,799
that happens is sort of a consequence of

924
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,200
that initial condition and i think this

925
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:26,558
kind of framework is just not the right

926
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,120
one for biology um and part of the way

927
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,879
that it's easiest to see this is

928
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,359
um a lot of people talk about

929
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,840
self-reference being important in life

930
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:39,119
the fact that um you know like the

931
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:41,278
genome has information encoded in it

932
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,119
that information gets read out

933
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,038
um it specifies something about the

934
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,479
architecture of a cell

935
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,079
the architecture of the cell includes

936
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,759
the genome so the genome has basically

937
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,158
self-referential information

938
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,519
self-reference obviously comes up in

939
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,960
computational law because it's kind of

940
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,558
foundational um to turing's work and

941
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,360
what girdle did with the incompleteness

942
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,278
theorems and things so there's a lot of

943
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,599
parallels there and and people have

944
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,720
talked about that at depth um but the

945
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,798
other way of kind of thinking about it

946
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,159
in terms of like a more physics-y way of

947
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,480
talking about it

948
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,200
is that what it looks like in biology is

949
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,960
that the rules or the laws depend on the

950
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,798
state this is typical in computer

951
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,240
science this is obvious to you you know

952
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:21,679
the update rule depends on the state of

953
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,599
the machine right but and you know you

954
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,759
don't think about um

955
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,079
uh you know that being sort of the

956
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,679
dynamic and physics it's you know the

957
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,839
rules given to you and then it you know

958
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,440
it's a it's a very special subclass say

959
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:35,199
of computations if

960
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,679
you know you don't ever change the

961
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,600
update um but in biology it seems to be

962
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,200
that the state and the law change

963
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,079
together as a function of time and we

964
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,519
don't have that as a paradigm in physics

965
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,599
and so a lot of people talked about this

966
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,679
as being kind of a perplexing feature

967
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,599
that maybe there are certain scenarios

968
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,080
where the laws of physics or the laws

969
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,599
that govern a particular system actually

970
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,319
change as a function of state of that

971
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:01,839
system that's trippy so yeah the the

972
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:04,158
hope of physics it's a hope i guess but

973
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:07,038
often stated as a

974
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,080
underlying assumption is that the law

975
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:12,079
is uh static right

976
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,839
okay and even having laws that vary in

977
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:16,240
time and not even as a function of the

978
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,720
state is very radical

979
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,240
when you the time in general like yeah

980
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,519
you want to remove time from the

981
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,278
equation as much as possible yeah i i do

982
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,120
um there's some interesting things in

983
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,640
this like when we think it's sort of

984
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,918
deep more deeply about the actual

985
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,000
physics that we're trying to propose

986
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,600
governs life um with me with

987
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,278
collaborators and then also other people

988
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,798
that think about similar things that

989
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:38,880
time might actually be fundamental and

990
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,639
there really is an ordering to time

991
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,559
um and that events in the universe are

992
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,640
unique because they have a particular

993
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:46,079
you know they they happen like an object

994
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,159
in the universe requires a certain

995
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,599
history of events in order to exist

996
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,720
which therefore suggests that time

997
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,759
really does have an ordering i'm not

998
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,278
talking about the flow of time and our

999
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,440
perception of time just the ordering of

1000
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,640
events causation yes causation there's

1001
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,558
that word again

1002
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,720
so causation that's when you say time

1003
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:03,678
you mean causation yes

1004
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,079
in your proposed model

1005
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,320
of the physics of life the the

1006
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,319
fundamental thing would be causation if

1007
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:13,278
you were to bet your money on on one

1008
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:15,439
particular horse or whatever yes and

1009
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:19,119
then space is emergent

1010
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,679
yes so everything's emergent except time

1011
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:23,359
kind of yeah or causation

1012
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,559
change all the time why it look like

1013
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:29,119
laws are the same laws well because uh

1014
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:30,240
well one way um and i actually this idea

1015
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,918
comes from lee cronin because i work

1016
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,359
with him very closely on these things is

1017
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,360
that the laws of physics look the way

1018
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,558
they do because they're low memory laws

1019
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:38,079
so they don't require a lot of

1020
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:39,678
information to specify them they're very

1021
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,918
easy for the universe to implement but

1022
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,600
if you get something like me for example

1023
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,038
i require 4 billion year history to

1024
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,959
exist in the universe i come with a lot

1025
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,798
of historical baggage

1026
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,558
and that's part of what i am as a set of

1027
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:55,038
causes that exist in the universe

1028
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,480
so i have local rules that apply to me

1029
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,158
that are associated with sort of the

1030
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,839
information in my history

1031
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,278
that aren't universal to every object in

1032
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,798
the universe

1033
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,200
and there are some things that are very

1034
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,879
easily easy to implement low memory

1035
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,639
rules that apply to everything in the

1036
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,519
universe

1037
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,720
so there's no shortcuts to you no i so

1038
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,239
yeah i don't believe in like things like

1039
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,239
boltzmann brains or

1040
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,559
uh you know fluctuations out of the

1041
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,358
vacuum that can produce things like your

1042
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,440
desk ornaments

1043
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,960
i actually think they require a

1044
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,398
particular causal chain of events to

1045
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,240
exist

1046
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,960
well i appreciate the togetherness of

1047
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,838
that but uh so how does that

1048
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,679
if we have to simulate the entire

1049
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:37,039
universe to create the ornaments and the

1050
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,599
two of us

1051
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,719
how are we supposed to create

1052
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,559
engineer life yeah that's not

1053
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,078
this goes back to sort of the critique

1054
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,000
of the rna world i think one of the

1055
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,200
problems and i'll get to answering your

1056
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,800
question but i think this is kind of

1057
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,719
relevant here one of the problems with

1058
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,399
the rna world

1059
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,918
when we test it in the laboratory is how

1060
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:57,199
much information we're putting into the

1061
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,039
experiment

1062
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,919
we specify the flasks we make pure

1063
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,920
reagents we mix them we take them out we

1064
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,000
put them in the next flask we change the

1065
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,079
ph we change the uv light and then we

1066
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,519
get a molecule and it's not even an rna

1067
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,480
molecule necessarily it might just be a

1068
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,320
base right um and so

1069
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,559
people don't usually think about the

1070
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,480
fact that we're agents in the universe

1071
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,759
making that experiment and therefore we

1072
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,880
put a little bit of life into that

1073
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
experiment

1074
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,039
um

1075
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,880
because it's part of our biological

1076
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,719
lineage in the same sense that a couple

1077
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,640
or i am a part of the biological lineage

1078
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:29,679
the experimental ideas

1079
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,838
are

1080
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:33,199
injecting life yes

1081
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,880
and the constraints that we put on the

1082
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:37,118
experiments because those conditions

1083
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,280
wouldn't exist in the universe on planet

1084
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,280
earth at that time without us as the

1085
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,720
boundary condition right so

1086
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,040
even though we're not actually adding

1087
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,598
any actual like chemistry or biology

1088
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:49,279
that it could be identified as life

1089
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,119
are the constraints we're adding to the

1090
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,079
experiment the design of the experiment

1091
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,280
yeah you can think of a design

1092
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,280
experiment as a program you put

1093
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,119
information in it's an algorithmic

1094
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,839
procedure that you design the experiment

1095
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,160
and so um so the original life problem

1096
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,799
becomes one of minimizing the

1097
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,480
information we put into physics

1098
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,480
to actually watch the spontaneous

1099
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,240
original life can we can we have so can

1100
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,880
is it possible in the lab to have an

1101
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,959
information vacuum then so like if we

1102
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,559
could we would that would be amazing i

1103
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,559
don't know that's a good question for

1104
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,400
more for lee yeah you guys by the way

1105
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:21,119
for people who don't know lee cronin is

1106
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,400
uh

1107
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,838
you guys are uh colleagues and uh

1108
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,680
i've gotten a chance to listen to the

1109
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:28,960
two of you talking there's great sort of

1110
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,039
chemistry and you're brilliant

1111
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,119
brainstorming together and there's

1112
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:35,358
there's a really exciting

1113
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,280
community here of of brilliant people

1114
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,679
from different disciplines working on

1115
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,880
the problem yeah of life of complexity

1116
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,319
of uh

1117
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,800
i don't know whatever

1118
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,559
the words fail us to describe the exact

1119
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,240
problem we're trying to actually

1120
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,078
understand here intelligence all those

1121
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,679
kinds of things

1122
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,359
okay so

1123
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,078
what what uh

1124
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:58,639
from a lab perspective so lee i guess

1125
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,400
would you call him a chemist no i think

1126
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:01,358
by training he's a chemist but i think

1127
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,480
most of the people that work in the

1128
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,519
field we do have lost their discipline

1129
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,800
that's why i couldn't answer your

1130
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,320
question

1131
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,760
okay i don't know what you call them

1132
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,838
yeah i don't know what i call myself i

1133
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,520
don't know what i call any of my friends

1134
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:16,880
so why why is it so hard to create uh

1135
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:19,280
and it's an interesting question to

1136
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,760
create biological life in the lab

1137
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,920
like from your perspective

1138
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,599
is that an important problem to work on

1139
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,000
to try to recreate the historical origin

1140
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,079
of life on earth or echoes of the

1141
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,239
historical origin i think echoes is more

1142
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,160
appropriate i don't think asking the

1143
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:37,838
question of what was the exact

1144
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,559
historical sequence of events and

1145
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,639
engineering every step in the process to

1146
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,880
make exactly the chemistry of life on

1147
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,879
earth as we know it is a meaningful way

1148
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,920
of asking the question and it's a little

1149
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,599
bit like

1150
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,119
um you know if

1151
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,200
since you're in computer science like if

1152
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,800
you know the answer to a problem it's

1153
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,239
all it's easier to find a program to

1154
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,079
specify the output right but if you

1155
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,000
don't know the answer or priority you

1156
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,359
know finding an algorithm for like say

1157
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,119
finding a prime or something it's easy

1158
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,358
to um you know

1159
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,039
uh verify it's a prime number it's hard

1160
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:10,559
to find the next prime um and uh

1161
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,960
the way the original life is structured

1162
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,719
right now in the historical problem is

1163
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,559
you know the answer and you're trying to

1164
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:17,679
retrodict it by breaking it down into

1165
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,679
the set of procedures where you're

1166
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,480
putting a lot of information in and what

1167
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,679
we need to do is ask the question of

1168
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,519
how is it

1169
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:27,598
that the rules of how our universe is

1170
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,679
structured permits things like life to

1171
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,280
exist and what is the phenomena of life

1172
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,598
and those questions are obviously

1173
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,160
essentially the same question and so

1174
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,280
you're looking essentially for this

1175
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,960
missing

1176
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,640
physics this missing explanation for

1177
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,000
what we are and you need to set up

1178
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:43,519
proper experiments that are going to

1179
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,480
allow you to probe

1180
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,920
the vast complexity of chemistry in an

1181
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,639
unconstrained way with as little

1182
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,079
information put in as possible to see

1183
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:53,838
when things

1184
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,280
when does information actually emerge

1185
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,279
how does it emerge

1186
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,320
what is it

1187
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,000
and

1188
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,039
part of the the sort of conjecture we

1189
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,039
have is

1190
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,039
that this physics only becomes relevant

1191
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,679
or at least this is this is my personal

1192
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,279
conjecture and um and it's sort of

1193
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,039
uh validated by this kind of theory

1194
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,920
experiment collaboration

1195
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,400
um

1196
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,440
that we we have working in this area

1197
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,639
um that this you know sort of i made the

1198
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,119
point about like gravity existing

1199
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,879
everywhere right but when you study um

1200
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,559
an atomic nucleus you don't care about

1201
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,599
gravity it's not relevant physics there

1202
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,199
right it's it's weak it doesn't matter

1203
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,119
and so

1204
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,679
this idea that that there's kind of a

1205
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,800
physics associated with information

1206
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:36,000
for me

1207
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,760
it's very

1208
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
evident that that physics doesn't become

1209
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,839
relevant until you need information to

1210
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,159
specify the existence of a particular

1211
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,239
object and the scale of reality where

1212
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:49,279
that happens is in chemistry because of

1213
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:52,000
the combinatorial diversity of chemical

1214
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,920
objects that can exist far outs

1215
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,599
exceeds the amount of resources in our

1216
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,039
universe so if you want to you can't

1217
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,640
make every possible protein of length um

1218
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,599
you know 200 amino acids there's not

1219
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,358
enough resources so in order for this

1220
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,920
particular protein to exist and this

1221
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,078
protein to exist in high abundance means

1222
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,519
that you have to have a system that has

1223
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,599
knowledge of the existence of that

1224
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,838
protein and can build it so existence

1225
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,440
comes to be at the chemical level so

1226
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,239
existence is most

1227
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,079
uh is uh best understood at the chemical

1228
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,759
level it's most evident

1229
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,359
it's a little bit like nobody argues

1230
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,200
that gravity doesn't exist in an atomic

1231
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:29,838
nucleus it's just not relevant physics

1232
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,358
there so the physics of information

1233
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,199
is everywhere it exists at every

1234
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:34,639
combinatorial scale but it becomes more

1235
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,639
and more relevant the more set of

1236
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,400
possibilities that could exist

1237
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,920
because you're you're you're you have to

1238
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,920
specify more and more about why this

1239
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,599
thing exists and not the infinite it's

1240
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,200
not an infinite set but you know the set

1241
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,160
of undefined set of other things that

1242
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:50,480
could exist so can ask a weird

1243
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,440
yeah question which is

1244
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,159
so let's look into the future

1245
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,079
i try that every day it never works

1246
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:02,078
so say a nobel prize is given in physics

1247
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,560
maybe chemistry

1248
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:09,200
for discovering the origin of life

1249
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,880
no not but not the historical origin

1250
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,799
some kind of thing that we're talking

1251
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,039
about

1252
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,119
what exactly

1253
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,519
would

1254
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,400
what do you think

1255
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,639
that like what do you think that person

1256
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,160
maybe you did to get that nobel prize

1257
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:27,118
like what would they have to have done

1258
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:29,440
because you could do a bunch of

1259
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,559
experiments that go like with an aha

1260
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,679
moment

1261
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,920
like you rarely get the nobel prize

1262
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:38,559
for like you've solved everything we're

1263
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,680
done right it's like some inkling of

1264
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,119
some deep truth right like what do you

1265
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:45,919
think that would actually look like

1266
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,000
would it be an experimental result

1267
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,680
uh i mean it will have to have some kind

1268
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,159
of experimental maybe validation

1269
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,559
component so what would that look like

1270
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:55,679
this is an excellent question

1271
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,119
i want to

1272
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,879
sorry i'm going to make a quick point

1273
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,000
which is just a slight tangent but you

1274
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,760
know like when people ask about the

1275
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,280
origin of mass you know and like looking

1276
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,880
for the higgs mechanism and things they

1277
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,640
never like we need to find the

1278
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,079
historical origins of life in the early

1279
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,639
unit although those things are related

1280
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,079
right so um so this problem of origins

1281
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:14,078
of life in the lab i think is really

1282
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,760
important but the the higgs is a good

1283
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,680
example because you had theory to guide

1284
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,480
it so somehow you need to have an

1285
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,919
explanatory framework

1286
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,599
that

1287
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,920
can say that we should be looking for

1288
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,838
these features

1289
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,680
and explain why they might be there and

1290
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:31,039
then be able to do the experiment and

1291
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,118
demonstrate that it matches with the

1292
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,279
theory but it has to be something

1293
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,880
that is outside sort of the paradigm of

1294
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,480
what we might expect based on what we

1295
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,760
know right so this is a really sort of

1296
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,519
tall order

1297
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,319
um and

1298
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,759
i think um

1299
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:46,960
i mean i i guess the way people would

1300
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,720
think about it is like you know if you

1301
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,159
had a bacteria that climbed out of your

1302
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:51,519
test tube or something and it was like

1303
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:52,960
you know moving around on the surface

1304
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,960
that would be ultimate validation you

1305
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,079
saw the original life in an experiment

1306
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,280
but i don't think that's quite what

1307
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:03,839
we're looking for i think what what

1308
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:06,960
we're looking for is evidence of when

1309
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,480
information that originated within

1310
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,960
the bounds of your experiment and you

1311
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,960
can demonstratively prove emerge

1312
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,559
spontaneously in your experiment wasn't

1313
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,119
put in by you

1314
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,078
actually started to govern the future

1315
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,480
dynamics of that system and specify it

1316
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,318
and you could somehow relate those two

1317
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,240
features directly so you know that the

1318
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,599
program specifying

1319
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:29,759
what's happening in that system is

1320
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,000
actually internal to that system like

1321
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,040
say you have a chemical thing in a box

1322
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,599
well

1323
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,599
so that's that's one nobel prize with

1324
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,838
the experiment which is like

1325
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,280
information in some fundamental way

1326
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:42,719
originated

1327
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,720
within the constraints of the system

1328
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,879
without you injecting anything but

1329
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:50,078
another experiment is

1330
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,200
you injected something yeah

1331
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,880
and got out information yes so like you

1332
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,879
injected

1333
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,519
i don't know like uh

1334
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,440
like some sugar and like something

1335
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,639
something that doesn't necessarily feel

1336
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,880
like it should be information yeah so i

1337
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,318
actually no i mean sugar is information

1338
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,079
right so part of the argument here is

1339
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:11,440
that every physical object

1340
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,599
is

1341
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,679
well it's information but it's a set of

1342
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,200
causal histories and also a set of

1343
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,598
possible futures so there's an

1344
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,439
experiment um that i've talked a lot

1345
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,720
about uh with lee cronin but also with

1346
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,960
michael lockman and chris kempies who

1347
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,399
are at santa fe about this idea that

1348
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,358
sometimes we talk about is like seating

1349
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,920
assembly um which is you take a high

1350
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,519
high complexity like a an object that

1351
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,760
exists in the universe because of a long

1352
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:38,800
causal history and you seed it into a

1353
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,720
system of lower causal history and then

1354
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,560
suddenly you see all of this complexity

1355
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,959
being generated so i think another

1356
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:47,440
validation of the physics would be

1357
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,639
say you engineer an organism by by

1358
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,000
purposefully

1359
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:51,920
introducing something where you

1360
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
understand the relationship between the

1361
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,880
causal history of the organism

1362
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,119
and the say very complex chemical set of

1363
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,960
ingredients you're adding to it and then

1364
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,358
you can predict the future evolution of

1365
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,559
that system to some

1366
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,799
statistical

1367
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,199
uh set of constraints and possibilities

1368
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,280
for what it will look like

1369
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,399
in the future

1370
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,119
you know i'm a physical structure

1371
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,280
obviously like i i'm composed of atoms

1372
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,358
the configuration of them and the fact

1373
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,319
that they happen to be me

1374
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:25,440
is because i'm not actually my atoms i

1375
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:28,880
am a informational pattern that keeps

1376
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:33,039
re-patterning those atoms into sarah um

1377
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:35,200
and i have also associated to me is like

1378
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,159
a space of possible things that could

1379
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,679
exist

1380
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:40,239
that i can help mediate come into

1381
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,078
existence because of the information in

1382
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,118
my history

1383
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,680
and so

1384
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,838
when you understand sort of that

1385
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,159
time is a real thing embedded in a

1386
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:52,960
physical object

1387
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,000
then it becomes possible to talk about

1388
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,800
how

1389
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,559
histories when they interact

1390
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,560
and history is not a unique thing it's a

1391
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,039
set of possibilities when they interact

1392
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,318
how do they specify what's coming next

1393
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:05,679
and then where does the novelty come

1394
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:06,880
from in that structure because some of

1395
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,480
it is kind of things that haven't

1396
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,760
existed in the past can exist in the

1397
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,679
future

1398
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,119
let me ask about this entity that you

1399
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,960
call sarah yes i talk to myself about

1400
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,480
myself in third person sometimes i don't

1401
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,358
know why

1402
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,358
uh

1403
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:24,639
so maybe this is a good time to bring up

1404
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,639
consciousness sure

1405
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:27,519
it's been here all along

1406
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,679
wow

1407
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,358
has it so what i mean at least in this

1408
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,039
conversation i think i've been conscious

1409
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,199
most of it but maybe i haven't well yeah

1410
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,480
speak so speak for yourself you're

1411
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,318
you're you're projecting your

1412
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,559
consciences onto me you don't know if

1413
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:43,279
i'm conscious or not is it

1414
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,039
um you're right is that uh

1415
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,960
he talked about the physics of existence

1416
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:51,519
he talked about the emergence of um

1417
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,599
of causality uh sorry you talked about

1418
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:56,000
causality and time being fundamental to

1419
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,400
the universe

1420
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,358
does consciousness fit into all of this

1421
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,639
like uh

1422
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:05,440
do you draw any kind of inspiration or

1423
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:08,639
value with the idea of pan psychism

1424
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,559
that maybe one of the things that we

1425
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,000
ought to understand is the physics of

1426
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:12,960
consciousness

1427
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,199
like

1428
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,920
one of the missing pieces

1429
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,279
in the physics view of the world is

1430
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,480
understanding the physics of

1431
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,040
consciousness or like that word

1432
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,800
has so many concepts underneath it but

1433
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:29,279
let's put it

1434
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,119
let's put consciousness as a label on a

1435
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,319
black box of mystery that we don't

1436
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,358
understand

1437
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,558
do you think

1438
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:38,960
that black box holds the key

1439
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,640
to uh finally answering the question of

1440
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,400
the physics of life

1441
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,639
the problems are absolutely related i

1442
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,920
think um most and i'm interested in both

1443
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,598
because i'm just interested in what we

1444
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,599
are and to me the most interesting

1445
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,200
feature of what we are is our minds and

1446
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,559
the way they interact with other minds

1447
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:53,759
like minds are the most beautiful thing

1448
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,119
that exists in the universe so how did

1449
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,960
they come to be

1450
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,280
i'm sorry to interrupt so when you say

1451
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,760
we you mean humans i mean humans right

1452
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,200
now but i but that's because i'm a human

1453
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,480
i think i am you think there's something

1454
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:08,399
special to this particular no no no um

1455
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,199
no um

1456
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,280
i don't i'm not a human-centric thinker

1457
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:15,358
but are you one entity you said a bunch

1458
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,400
of stuff came together to make a sarah

1459
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:17,199
like

1460
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,280
yourself

1461
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:20,960
as one entity are you just

1462
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,720
a bunch of different components like is

1463
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,280
there any value to understand the

1464
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,439
physics of sarah like or are you just a

1465
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,800
bunch of different things that are like

1466
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,400
a nice little temporary side effect yeah

1467
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,160
you could think of me as a bundle of

1468
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,639
information that just became temporarily

1469
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:38,480
aggregated or individual yeah that's

1470
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:40,400
fine i agree with that view

1471
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,760
um

1472
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,838
okay i think that is a compliment

1473
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,920
actually but you you've

1474
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:48,000
but nevertheless that bundle of

1475
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,960
information has become conscious or at

1476
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,800
least keeps calling her self-conscious

1477
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,280
yeah i think i'm conscious right now but

1478
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,280
i might not be but that's okay um or you

1479
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,119
wouldn't know um so yeah so this is the

1480
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,559
problem so yeah usually people when

1481
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,240
they're talking about consciousness are

1482
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,000
worried about the subjective experience

1483
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,199
and so i think that's why you're saying

1484
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,960
i don't know if you're conscious because

1485
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,558
i don't know if you're experiencing this

1486
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,800
conversation right now

1487
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,240
um and nor do you know if i'm

1488
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,119
experienced in the conversation right

1489
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:14,239
now

1490
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,680
and so this is why this is called the

1491
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,519
hard problem of consciousness because it

1492
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,519
seems impenetrable from the outside to

1493
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,358
know if something's having a conscious

1494
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,599
experience um

1495
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,440
and i really like um

1496
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,920
the idea of also like the hard problem

1497
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,920
of matter which is related to the hard

1498
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,599
problem of consciousness which is you

1499
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,599
don't know the intrinsic properties of

1500
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,720
an electron not interacting say for

1501
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,039
example with anything else in the

1502
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,558
universe all the properties of anything

1503
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:40,159
that exists in the universe are divine

1504
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,760
by its interaction because you have to

1505
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:44,078
interact with it in order to be able to

1506
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,359
observe it so we can only actually know

1507
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,200
the things that are observable from the

1508
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,880
outside and so this is one of the

1509
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,039
reasons that consciousness is hard for

1510
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,720
science because you're asking questions

1511
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,639
about something that's subjective and

1512
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,879
supposed to be intrinsic to what that

1513
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:59,118
thing is as it exists and how it feels

1514
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,240
about existing

1515
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,400
and so

1516
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,879
i have thought a lot about this problem

1517
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,800
and its relationship to the problem of

1518
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,318
life and the only thing i can come up

1519
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,160
with to try to make

1520
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,880
that problem

1521
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,519
scientifically tractable

1522
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,920
and also related to how i think about

1523
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,239
the physics of life

1524
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,318
is to ask the question

1525
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,558
are there things that can only happen in

1526
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,558
the universe because

1527
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,720
there are physical systems that have

1528
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,800
subjective experience

1529
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:32,558
so does subjective experience have

1530
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,519
different causes

1531
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,400
that things that it can cause to occur

1532
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,480
um

1533
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,000
that would happen in the absence of that

1534
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,920
i don't know the answer to that question

1535
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,599
but i think that's a meaningful ask way

1536
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,159
of asking the question of consciousness

1537
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,079
i can't ask if you're having experience

1538
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,000
right now but i can ask if you having

1539
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,680
experience right now changes something

1540
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,679
about you and the way you interact with

1541
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,799
the world

1542
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,279
so

1543
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,119
does stuff happen it's just it's a good

1544
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,280
question to ask this stuff happen if

1545
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,119
consciousness is

1546
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,559
then it's a real physical thing right it

1547
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,720
has physical consequences i'm a

1548
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,480
physicist i'm biased so i don't you know

1549
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:11,519
i can't get rid of that bias it's really

1550
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,760
deeply ingrained um i've tried

1551
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:15,599
but but i mean you're saying information

1552
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,280
is physical too so like virtual reality

1553
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,280
and stimulation all that program is

1554
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,880
physical too yes everything's physical

1555
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,880
it's just not physical the way it's

1556
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,240
represented in our minds

1557
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,800
right so you i love your twitter so you

1558
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:30,399
tweet these like deep thoughts

1559
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,280
and deep dust that's what a theorist

1560
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,358
does when she's trying to experiment

1561
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,760
is tweet it's just like

1562
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,279
sitting there i mean i can just imagine

1563
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,119
you sitting there for like hours and all

1564
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,400
of a sudden just like this thought comes

1565
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,720
out and you get a little um

1566
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,000
like inkling into the thought process

1567
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,480
yeah usually it's like when i'm running

1568
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,480
between things

1569
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,039
articulate one of the things you tweeted

1570
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:59,440
is ideologically there are many

1571
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:02,079
parallels between the search for neural

1572
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,480
correlates of consciousness and for

1573
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,640
chemical correlates of life how the

1574
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,639
neuroscience and astrobiology

1575
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,400
communities treat those correlates is

1576
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:13,279
entirely different

1577
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,358
can you elaborate against this kind of

1578
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,079
yeah the parallels it has to do a little

1579
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,440
bit with the consciousness and the

1580
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,680
and the matter thing you're talking

1581
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,119
about yeah it does and i i can't

1582
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,679
remember what state of mind i was when i

1583
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,760
was actually thinking about that but um

1584
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:29,279
but i think part of it is but you never

1585
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,280
thought you're gonna have to analyze

1586
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,839
your own twitter no i didn't it's an

1587
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:37,280
interesting uh historical juxtaposition

1588
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:38,078
of thinking so the tweet is a historical

1589
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,599
uh

1590
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,720
you're doing an assembly experiment

1591
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,240
right now because you're bringing a

1592
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:44,239
thought from the past into the present

1593
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,239
and trying to actually in the lab

1594
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,239
yeah yeah this is this is experimental

1595
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,199
science right here okay on the podcast

1596
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:50,639
live

1597
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,639
um

1598
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:55,519
so so go let's see how the consciousness

1599
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:57,679
evolves on this one yeah so um in

1600
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,759
neuroscience it's kind of accepted that

1601
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:02,558
we can't get the subjective

1602
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,640
aspect of consciousness so people are

1603
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,800
very interested in what would be a

1604
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,598
correlate of consciousness so

1605
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,640
um

1606
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,880
so

1607
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:11,838
that's a correlation a correlate is a

1608
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,559
feature

1609
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:17,920
that relates to conscious activity so

1610
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:20,079
for example um you know a verbal report

1611
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,519
is a correlate of consciousness because

1612
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,800
um you know i can tell you when i'm

1613
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:25,039
conscious

1614
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,720
and then when i'm sleeping for example i

1615
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,159
can't tell you i'm conscious so we have

1616
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:29,439
this assumption that you're not

1617
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:31,279
conscious when you're sleeping and

1618
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,838
you're conscious when you're awake yeah

1619
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,920
um and so so that's sort of like a a

1620
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:38,000
very obvious example but uh

1621
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,519
neuroscientists which you know i'm no

1622
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,519
neuroscientist and i'm not an expert in

1623
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:43,440
this field so um but you know they have

1624
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,119
very sophisticated ways of measuring you

1625
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,159
know activity in our brain and trying to

1626
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,599
relate that to verbal report and other

1627
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:52,318
proxies for whether someone is

1628
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,640
experiencing something um and that's

1629
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,880
what is meant by neural correlates

1630
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:58,558
um and then so when people are trying to

1631
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,838
think about

1632
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,839
um

1633
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:04,639
studying consciousness or developing

1634
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,880
theories for consciousness they often

1635
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,679
are trying to build an experimental

1636
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,280
bridge to these neural correlates

1637
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:14,078
recognizing the fact that a neural

1638
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,160
correlate may or may not correspond

1639
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,079
to consciousness because that problem's

1640
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,679
hard and there's all these associated

1641
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,519
issues to it

1642
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:23,118
so that that's from a neuroscience

1643
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,119
perspective it's like fake it till you

1644
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,039
make it so you pretty much yeah you fake

1645
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,318
whatever the correlates are and

1646
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,039
hopefully that

1647
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,719
the uh that's going to uh summon

1648
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,239
the thing that is consciousness or

1649
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,000
something like that and so the same

1650
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,239
thing on the chemical

1651
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
correlates of life is it that sounds

1652
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:41,679
like that's an awesome concept is that

1653
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,519
something that people no i just made

1654
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,519
that up okay that was the originals to

1655
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,759
that tweet you can cite the tweet

1656
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,920
maybe i'll write it in a paper someday

1657
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,079
uh chemical correlates of life that's a

1658
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,838
good title i mean first of all your your

1659
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,680
papers too that people should check out

1660
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:58,078
have great titles

1661
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:00,639
or paper papers you're involved with

1662
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,720
so your tweets and titles are are

1663
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:03,920
stellar and also your ideas but the

1664
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,959
tweets and titles are much more

1665
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,559
important of course so these will live

1666
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,838
longer

1667
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,160
yeah

1668
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:14,000
they're much more diffused though um

1669
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:16,000
well it's yeah it's the

1670
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,159
tweet is the trojan horse or the idea

1671
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,599
that that sticks on for a long time okay

1672
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,920
so is there anything to say about the

1673
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,240
chemical coils you're saying

1674
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,760
there are similar kind of ways of

1675
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,159
thinking about it

1676
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,559
but uh

1677
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:33,279
you you mentioned about the communities

1678
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,440
yeah so i think in astrobiology it's not

1679
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,880
um

1680
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,480
there's no concept of chemical

1681
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,000
correlates of life we don't think about

1682
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,719
it that way we think if we find

1683
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,480
molecules that are involved in biology

1684
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:47,199
we found life

1685
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,719
so i think i i i think one of my

1686
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,000
motivations there was just to separate

1687
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,639
the fact that

1688
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,960
life has abstract properties associated

1689
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:57,759
to it they become imprinted in in

1690
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,440
material substrates um and those

1691
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,040
substrates are correlates for that thing

1692
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,240
but they are not necessarily the thing

1693
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:03,920
we're actually looking for the thing

1694
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,519
that we're looking for is the physics

1695
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,680
that's organizing that system to begin

1696
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,920
with not the particular molecules

1697
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:13,199
um in the same sense that that you know

1698
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,720
your consciousness is not your brain

1699
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:16,798
it's it's it

1700
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,639
it's instantiated in your brain that you

1701
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:20,239
know it has to have a physical substrate

1702
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:21,759
but it's not the

1703
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,838
the matter is not the thing that you're

1704
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,920
looking at it's some other at least not

1705
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,838
in the way that we have come to look at

1706
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,039
matter you know with traditional physics

1707
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:30,558
and things there's there's something

1708
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:32,079
else there and it might be this feature

1709
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,880
of history i was talking about our time

1710
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,720
being

1711
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,760
actually you know physically represented

1712
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:37,118
there

1713
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,559
do you think consciousness can be

1714
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,920
engineered

1715
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,440
yes

1716
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,720
in the same way that life can be well

1717
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,559
that was a fast answer i didn't even

1718
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:46,480
think about that that's interesting

1719
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,160
you don't have a free will that was no i

1720
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,760
do have free will but it's interesting

1721
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:51,838
because some i mean

1722
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,599
i you know you know you're backtracking

1723
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:57,599
no no that was predestined yeah no no

1724
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,880
no i do believe in free will but i also

1725
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,480
think that there's kind of kind of an

1726
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,240
interesting um

1727
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,519
you know like what you're you speaking

1728
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:05,598
about consciousness what are you

1729
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,759
consciously aware of versus like what is

1730
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,680
your subconscious brain actually

1731
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,119
processing and doing and and sometimes

1732
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:13,039
there's conflict between your

1733
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,798
consciousness and your subconsciousness

1734
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:17,358
or your consciousness a little slower

1735
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,798
than your subconscious and intuition is

1736
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:20,558
a really important feature of that and

1737
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:22,159
so a lot of the ways i do my science is

1738
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,839
guided by intuition

1739
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:24,879
so when i give fast answers like that i

1740
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:26,239
think it's usually because i haven't

1741
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,680
really thought about them and therefore

1742
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:29,838
that's probably

1743
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,279
telling me something let's continue the

1744
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:33,279
deep analysis of your tweets

1745
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,760
[Laughter]

1746
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,599
you said that determinism in a tweet

1747
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,359
determinism and randomness play

1748
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,400
important roles in understanding what

1749
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:42,480
life is

1750
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,599
so let me ask on this topic of free will

1751
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,679
what is determinism what is randomness

1752
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,240
and why the heck do they have anything

1753
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:51,199
to do with understanding life

1754
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:52,719
yeah

1755
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:54,879
and you threw free will in there just

1756
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,039
throwing all the the stuff in the bag

1757
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,039
are they not related no no they are they

1758
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:00,798
are related then no no that's all right

1759
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,400
i was being unfair you didn't even

1760
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:05,199
capitalize the tweet by the way it was

1761
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,119
all lower case i must have been angry oh

1762
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:08,798
that was was saying can you analyze the

1763
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,680
emotion behind that no i actually did

1764
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:13,599
frustration yeah maybe so

1765
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,519
i already argued that i don't think that

1766
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:18,318
can happen without that whole causal

1767
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:21,280
history and so i guess in some sense um

1768
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,798
the determinism for me arises because of

1769
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,200
the causal history

1770
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:28,079
um and i'm not really sure actually

1771
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:30,558
about whether the universe is random or

1772
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,400
deterministic i just had this sort of

1773
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,240
intuition for a long time i'm not sure

1774
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,680
if i agree with it anymore but it's

1775
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:37,598
still kind of lingering and i don't know

1776
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:40,000
what to do with this question but it

1777
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,760
seems to me you know so there's you ask

1778
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,920
the question what is life but you could

1779
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,760
also why life why does life exist what

1780
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,200
does the universe need life for not that

1781
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,400
the universe has needs but you know we

1782
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:51,279
have to anthropocentrize things

1783
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,838
sometimes to talk about them um and i

1784
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,720
had this feeling that if it was possible

1785
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:56,798
for

1786
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,798
a cup or a desk ornament or a phone on

1787
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:00,559
mars to spontaneously fluctuate into

1788
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:02,000
existence the universe didn't need life

1789
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,519
to create those objects it wasn't

1790
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,480
necessary for their existence it was

1791
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:08,480
just a random fluke event and so somehow

1792
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,240
to me it seems that

1793
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,480
it can't be that those things formed by

1794
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:15,358
rand random processes they actually have

1795
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,358
to have a set of causes that

1796
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:19,199
accrue and form those things and they

1797
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:21,679
have to have that history and so it

1798
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:24,000
seems to me that that life was

1799
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:26,078
somehow deeply related to the question

1800
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,838
of whether the underlying rules of our

1801
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,359
universe had randomness in them or they

1802
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:31,119
were fully deterministic and in some

1803
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,759
ways you can think about life as being

1804
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:36,160
the most deterministic part of physics

1805
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,119
because it's where the causes are

1806
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,239
um

1807
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:42,880
precise in some sense um or most stable

1808
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:45,199
so like most stable yes most reliable

1809
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,200
most reliable for for our

1810
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:49,279
for how we for the tools of physics but

1811
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:51,439
what um right well so where's the

1812
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,880
randomness come from then if okay so you

1813
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,679
you were at

1814
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,798
uh speaking with i've gone in a tangent

1815
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:00,798
so i'm not sure where we are in the yeah

1816
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:03,838
all of the universe is a kind of tangent

1817
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:05,440
so uh we're embracing the tangent so

1818
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:07,199
free will

1819
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,880
you believe

1820
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,879
at this current time that you have free

1821
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,519
will i believe my whole life i have free

1822
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,119
will what is illusion

1823
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:18,880
i still believe it you still believe it

1824
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:20,798
so uh at the same time you think that

1825
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,039
in your conception of the universe

1826
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:25,440
causality seems to be pretty fundamental

1827
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,358
that's right which kind of wants the

1828
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,200
universe to be deterministic

1829
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:30,639
so how the heck

1830
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,919
because i mean you think you have a free

1831
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:35,118
will and yet you value causality

1832
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,559
um

1833
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:40,640
because i depart from the

1834
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,599
conception of physics that you can write

1835
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:43,440
down

1836
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,680
an initial condition and a fixed law of

1837
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,599
motion and that will describe everything

1838
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:49,679
there's no incompatibility if you are

1839
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,599
willing to reject that assertion so

1840
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:54,078
where is the randomness where's the

1841
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,838
magic that gives birth to the free will

1842
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,880
is it the randomness of the laws of

1843
01:00:55,838 --> 01:00:58,480
physics

1844
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,640
no free um

1845
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,599
in my mind what free will is is the fact

1846
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:03,759
that i

1847
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,599
i as a physical system have causal

1848
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,040
control over certain things i don't have

1849
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,440
causal control over everything but i

1850
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:10,400
have a certain set of things and i'm

1851
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,358
also

1852
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,200
um you know as i described sort of a

1853
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:16,318
nexus of a particular set of histories

1854
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:17,679
that exist in the universe on a

1855
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:18,960
particular set of futures that might

1856
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:20,798
exist

1857
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,199
and those futures that might exist are

1858
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:25,358
in part specified by my physical

1859
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:26,639
configuration as me

1860
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:27,838
um and

1861
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:29,759
therefore

1862
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:31,358
you know it may not be free will in the

1863
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,480
traditional sense i don't even know what

1864
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,000
people mean when they're talking about

1865
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,838
free will honestly it's like the whole

1866
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,480
discussion is really muddled but in the

1867
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:39,838
sense that i am a causal agent if you

1868
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,519
want to call it that that exists in the

1869
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,920
universe and there are certain things

1870
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:47,358
that happen because i exist as me

1871
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,720
then yes i have free will no but

1872
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:50,639
do you

1873
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:53,598
sarah have a choice about what's going

1874
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:56,318
to happen next oh i see um if the

1875
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,480
universe could i have if i run this yes

1876
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:00,318
i think so you have a choice

1877
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,679
where's the choice come from is it i

1878
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:02,880
think that's related to the physics of

1879
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:04,639
consciousness so one of the things i

1880
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,400
didn't say about that i don't know maybe

1881
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:08,159
this is me just being hopeful

1882
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,760
um because i maybe i just want to have

1883
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,279
free will but i don't think that we can

1884
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,119
rule out the possibility because i don't

1885
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,039
think that we understand enough about

1886
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,318
any of these problems but i think one of

1887
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,079
the things that's interesting for me

1888
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:19,920
about the sort of inversion of the

1889
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,039
question of consciousness that i

1890
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,200
proposed

1891
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,880
is one of the features that

1892
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:27,199
that we do

1893
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,640
is we have imagination right and people

1894
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:30,159
don't think about imagination as a

1895
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:32,879
physical thing but it is a physical

1896
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:34,480
thing it exists in the universe right um

1897
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,798
and so i'm like really intrigued by the

1898
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,240
fact that say humans for

1899
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:39,679
you know another physical system could

1900
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:42,399
do this too it's not special to humans

1901
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:44,480
but uh you know for centuries imagined

1902
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,079
flying machines and rockets and then we

1903
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,679
finally built them right so they were

1904
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,000
they were represented in our minds and

1905
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,519
on the pages of things that we drew

1906
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,798
for hundreds of years before we could

1907
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:53,920
build those physical objects in the

1908
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:56,480
universe

1909
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,798
but certainly the existence of rockets

1910
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,719
is in part

1911
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:02,239
causally

1912
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:03,598
you know caused by the fact that we

1913
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:06,000
could imagine them

1914
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:08,240
um and so um

1915
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,318
so there seems to be this property that

1916
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:12,078
some things don't exist they've never

1917
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:13,679
physically existed in the universe but

1918
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:16,400
we can imagine the possibility of them

1919
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:18,798
existing and then cause them to exist

1920
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,119
maybe individually or collectively um

1921
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,639
and i think that property is related to

1922
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:24,240
what i would say about having choice or

1923
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:25,759
free will because that set of

1924
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:27,759
possibilities that thing those set of

1925
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,200
things that you can imagine is not

1926
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,960
constrained to your local physical

1927
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:32,159
environment and history and this is

1928
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,798
what's a little bit different about

1929
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:37,118
intelligence as we see it in humans and

1930
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:38,559
ai that we want to build than biological

1931
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,720
intelligence because biological

1932
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,000
intelligence is predicated completely on

1933
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:44,318
the history of things it's seen in the

1934
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,559
past but something happened with the

1935
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:48,558
neural architectures that evolved in

1936
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,400
multicellular organisms that they don't

1937
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,319
just have access to the past history of

1938
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,400
their particular you know set of events

1939
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:56,558
but they can imagine things that haven't

1940
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,599
happened aren't on their timeline and as

1941
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:59,519
long as they're consistent with the laws

1942
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,119
of physics make them happen

1943
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:02,960
so

1944
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,358
this is fascinating

1945
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,679
physics but it exists so there you go i

1946
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:10,480
mean in some sense if you look at like

1947
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,838
general relativity and gravity morphing

1948
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,760
space time

1949
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:16,159
in that same way maybe whatever the

1950
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,839
physics of consciousness might be

1951
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:20,399
it might be morphing that's like what

1952
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:23,599
free will is it's morphing like

1953
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,960
the space just like ideas make rockets

1954
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,119
come to life

1955
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,760
it's somehow

1956
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,480
changing the space of possible

1957
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,720
realizations of like whatever's

1958
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,920
yeah okay but life is kind of basically

1959
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:37,759
if you want to think about it like life

1960
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,358
is sort of changing the probability

1961
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,520
distributions over what can exist that's

1962
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:42,960
the physics of what life is and then

1963
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,038
consciousness is a sort of layered

1964
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,880
property your imagination on top of it

1965
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,599
that kind of scrambles that a little bit

1966
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,440
more and like has you know access to i

1967
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,720
don't i don't know it's it's kind of

1968
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,920
it we don't know how to describe it

1969
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:56,000
right like that's why it's interesting

1970
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,880
but it's probabilistic so you do think

1971
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,480
like god plays dice so let me um no i

1972
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,318
think the description's probabilistic i

1973
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,679
don't necessarily think

1974
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:06,318
the um

1975
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:08,318
underlying physics is probabilistic i

1976
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:10,239
think i think i think the way that we

1977
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:12,318
can describe this physics is going to be

1978
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:13,919
probabilistic and statistical but the

1979
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:15,519
under like when we take measurements in

1980
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,119
the lab but the underlying physics

1981
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,920
itself might still be deterministic i

1982
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,640
don't

1983
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,480
i don't know maybe i'm i it's hard to

1984
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,078
know what concepts to hold on to so i

1985
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,838
find myself constantly rejecting

1986
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,079
concepts but then i have to grab another

1987
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,838
one and try to hold on to something from

1988
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,359
intellectual history right well it's

1989
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:33,199
possible that our mind is not able to

1990
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:34,960
hold the correct concepts of mind at all

1991
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:36,480
like right we're not able to even

1992
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,280
conceive of them correctly maybe the

1993
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,358
words deterministic or random are not

1994
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,359
the right even words concepts to be to

1995
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:45,279
be holding but

1996
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:47,679
maybe you can talk to the theory of

1997
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,680
everything uh the this attempt in the

1998
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:53,118
current set of physical laws to try to

1999
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,000
unify them is there any hope that

2000
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,920
once

2001
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,358
a theory of everything is developed and

2002
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,838
by theory of everything i mean in a

2003
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:02,318
narrow sense of unifying quantum field

2004
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:05,838
area and general relativity do you think

2005
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:08,558
that will contain some

2006
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:10,960
like in order to do that unification you

2007
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,720
would have to get something that would

2008
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,880
then give hints about the physics of

2009
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,639
life physics of existence

2010
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,519
physics of consciousness yeah

2011
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:21,920
i used to not but i actually uh i have

2012
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,759
become increasingly convinced that

2013
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,159
it probably will

2014
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,000
um and part of the reason is um i think

2015
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:30,159
i've talked a little bit already about

2016
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,639
these holes in physics like these

2017
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:34,159
the the theories we have in physics you

2018
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:36,318
know they have problems they have lots

2019
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,920
of problems um and they're very deep

2020
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:40,318
problems um and we don't know how to

2021
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,680
patch them um and some of those problems

2022
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:43,679
become very evident when you try to

2023
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:45,598
patch um quantum mechanics and general

2024
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:47,118
relativity together

2025
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,720
so there is this kind of interesting

2026
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,920
feature that some of the ways of

2027
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:53,038
patching that might actually um closely

2028
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,720
resemble

2029
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,640
uh the physics of life and so the place

2030
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,159
where that actually comes up most and

2031
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,358
actually we just had a workshop in the

2032
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:00,480
beyond center where i work at arizona

2033
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:02,159
state university

2034
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,838
um and lee smolin made this point that

2035
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:05,358
he thinks that the theory of quantum

2036
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,838
gravity when we solve it is going to be

2037
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:10,719
the same theory that gives rise to life

2038
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:12,000
um and i think that i agree with him on

2039
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:14,159
some levels because there's something

2040
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,239
very interesting where if you look at

2041
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,879
these sort of causal set theories of

2042
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:20,159
gravity where they're looking for space

2043
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,680
um

2044
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:23,519
as being emergent

2045
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:25,679
and so space time is an emergent concept

2046
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,119
from a causal set which is is also sort

2047
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,358
of related i think to what wolfram's

2048
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:30,960
doing with his physics project um it's

2049
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:32,318
the same kind of underlying math that we

2050
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,760
have in in this theory that we've been

2051
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:36,558
developing related to life called

2052
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:38,880
assembly theory um which is you know

2053
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:42,000
basically trying to look at

2054
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:44,160
complex objects like molecules and

2055
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,760
bacteria and living things

2056
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:47,519
as

2057
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,079
sort of uh

2058
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:52,239
as basically being assembled from a set

2059
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,760
of component parts

2060
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:55,279
and that they actually encode all the

2061
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,520
possible histories that they could have

2062
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,960
in that physical object so the

2063
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:00,079
mathematically all these ideas i think

2064
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,358
are related i think a lot of people are

2065
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,318
thinking about this from

2066
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:04,318
different perspectives and then

2067
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:05,920
constructor theory um that david deutsch

2068
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:07,599
and kiara marletto have been developing

2069
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,119
is a totally different angle on it but i

2070
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,318
think getting at some similar ideas so

2071
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,160
it's a really interesting time right now

2072
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:14,239
i think for the frontiers of physics and

2073
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,399
how it's relating um to maybe deeper

2074
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:20,639
principles about what life is so short

2075
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:22,719
answer yes long-winded answer rewind

2076
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,600
can we talk about aliens

2077
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,960
anytime

2078
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,880
so one

2079
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,119
i think one interesting way to sneak up

2080
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,920
on the question of what is life

2081
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:35,519
is

2082
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,359
to ask what should we look for in alien

2083
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,000
life

2084
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:42,798
you know if we were to look out into our

2085
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:46,000
galaxy and enter the universe and come

2086
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:47,439
up with a framework of how to detect

2087
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,600
alien life

2088
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:50,719
what should we be looking for

2089
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,719
is there

2090
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:55,359
like set of rules

2091
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:58,000
uh like it's both the tools

2092
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,920
and the tools that are

2093
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,600
service census for certain kind of

2094
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,158
properties of life

2095
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,640
so what should we look for

2096
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:08,238
in alien life yeah so we have a paper

2097
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,480
actually coming out monday which is

2098
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:12,399
collaboration um it's actually really

2099
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,439
lee cronin's lab but my group worked

2100
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,759
with him on it and we're working on the

2101
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,639
theory which is this idea that we should

2102
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:20,238
look

2103
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:22,239
for life um as high assembly objects

2104
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:23,838
what we mean by that is

2105
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,879
which is actually observationally

2106
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:26,479
measurable and this is one of the

2107
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,719
reasons that i started working with leon

2108
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,399
these ideas is because being a theorist

2109
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,719
it's easy to work in a vacuum it's very

2110
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:34,238
hard to connect abstract ideas about the

2111
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,798
nature of life to anything that's

2112
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:39,678
experimentally tractable

2113
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:42,319
but what his lab has been able to do is

2114
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:44,640
develop this method where they look at a

2115
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,640
molecule and they break it apart into

2116
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,319
all its component parts and so you say

2117
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,319
you have some elementary building blocks

2118
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:51,440
and you can build up all the ways of

2119
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,279
putting those together to make the

2120
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:55,519
original object and then you look for

2121
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,560
the shortest path in that space

2122
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:01,280
and you say that's sort of the assembly

2123
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,520
number associated to that object

2124
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:06,000
and if that number's higher it assumes

2125
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,760
that a longer causal history is

2126
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,679
necessary to produce that object or more

2127
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,360
information is necessary to specify the

2128
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:12,880
creation of that object in the universe

2129
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:14,719
now that kind of

2130
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:17,199
idea at a superficial level has existed

2131
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,679
for a long time that kind of idea as a

2132
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:21,519
physical observable of molecules is

2133
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:22,800
completely novel and what his lab has

2134
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,000
been able to show

2135
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,760
is that if you look at a bunch of

2136
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,198
samples of non-biological things and

2137
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,000
biological things there's this kind of

2138
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:32,559
threshold

2139
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,800
of assembly where

2140
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,039
as far as the experimental evidence is

2141
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,079
and also your intuitive intuition would

2142
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:40,479
suggest

2143
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:43,198
that by non-biological systems don't

2144
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:45,039
produce things with high assembly number

2145
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:46,559
so this goes back to the idea like a

2146
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:48,158
protein is not going to spontaneously

2147
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,600
fluctuate into existence on the surface

2148
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:51,279
of mars it requires an evolutionary

2149
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,440
process and a biological architecture to

2150
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:56,079
produce a protein you generalize that

2151
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:58,799
argument you know a complex molecule

2152
01:10:56,079 --> 01:11:00,319
or a cup or a desk ornament

2153
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,440
in this sort of abstract idea of

2154
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:05,119
assembly spaces as being the causal

2155
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:07,279
history of objects and you can talk

2156
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:09,359
about the shortest path from elementary

2157
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:10,880
objects to an object given an elementary

2158
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:13,198
set of operations

2159
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,199
and you can experimentally measure that

2160
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:17,759
with mass spec and that's basically sort

2161
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:19,439
of the idea that's really fascinating i

2162
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,679
can't get out of my head and start

2163
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:23,519
imagining legos and all the legos i've

2164
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,679
ever built and how many steps what is

2165
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,320
the shortest path to the final right

2166
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:30,480
right to find a little lego castles

2167
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:31,840
so they so yeah so then like asking

2168
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:33,119
about going to look for alien life the

2169
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,119
idea is

2170
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,880
you know most the instruments that nasa

2171
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:38,079
builds for example or any of the space

2172
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,400
agencies looking for life in the

2173
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:42,479
universe are looking for chemical

2174
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:44,319
correlates of life right but here we

2175
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:46,399
have something that

2176
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:49,039
is based on properties of molecules it's

2177
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:50,479
not a chemical correlate it's agnostic

2178
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:51,840
it doesn't care about the molecule it

2179
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:54,559
cares about

2180
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,239
what is the history necessary to produce

2181
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,920
this molecule

2182
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:59,839
how complex is it in terms of how much

2183
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,440
time is needing how much information is

2184
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,719
required to produce it so when you

2185
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:06,399
observe a thing on another planet you're

2186
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:07,840
essentially

2187
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,519
the process looks like reverse

2188
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,520
engineering trying to figure out what is

2189
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,239
the shortest path to create that thing

2190
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:16,080
yeah so most yeah and i would say most

2191
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:17,678
like most examples of biology or

2192
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:19,198
technology don't take the shortest path

2193
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,640
right but the shortest path is a bound

2194
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:23,919
on how hard it is for the universe to

2195
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,520
make that yeah and so i guess what you

2196
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,760
and lee are saying that there's a

2197
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:30,480
heuristic that's a good

2198
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,880
metric for uh like better perhaps than

2199
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:35,198
chemical correlates yes because it

2200
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,600
doesn't it's not contingent on looking

2201
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:38,879
for the chemistry of life on earth on

2202
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,520
other planets

2203
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,760
and it also has a deeper explanatory

2204
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,120
framework associated to it as far as the

2205
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,360
kind of theory that we're trying to

2206
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:48,880
develop associated to what life is and i

2207
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,319
think this is one of the problems i have

2208
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,039
in my my field personally in

2209
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:56,158
astrobiology is people observe something

2210
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:58,880
on earth say oxygen in the atmosphere or

2211
01:12:56,158 --> 01:13:00,960
an amino acid in a cell and then they

2212
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,159
say let's go look for that on another

2213
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,158
planet

2214
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:06,319
let's look for oxygen on exoplanets or

2215
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:08,319
let's look for amino acids on mars and

2216
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:09,359
then they assume that's a way of looking

2217
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:10,559
for life

2218
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:12,000
um

2219
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,080
and it

2220
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,439
or even phosphine on venus but you know

2221
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:18,000
like there's all these examples of let's

2222
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:20,879
look for one molecule a molecule is not

2223
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,560
life life is a system that patterns

2224
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,800
particular structures into matter that's

2225
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,640
like it's that's what it is and it

2226
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,320
doesn't care what molecules are there

2227
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,199
it's something about the patterns and

2228
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:33,119
and that structure and that history um

2229
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:34,799
and if you're looking for a molecule

2230
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:36,479
you're not testing any hypotheses about

2231
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,400
the nature of what life is it doesn't

2232
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:39,839
tell me anything if we discover oxygen

2233
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:42,158
and exoplanet about what kind of life is

2234
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,079
there just oxygen on an exoplanet it's

2235
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:45,839
not there there's

2236
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:47,359
i i guess i think like when you think

2237
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,039
about the question are we alone in the

2238
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:50,559
universe that's a pretty freaking deep

2239
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:51,840
question it should have a freaking deep

2240
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,600
answer it shouldn't just be there's a

2241
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,199
molecule and an exoplanet wow we solved

2242
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,719
the problem it should tell us something

2243
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,519
meaningful about our existence and i

2244
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:01,679
feel like we've fallen short on how

2245
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:05,199
we're searching for life in terms of

2246
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:08,239
actually searching for things like us

2247
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:10,319
in this kind of deeper way

2248
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:12,479
but how do you do that initial kind of

2249
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:14,479
say i'm walking down the street and i'm

2250
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:15,439
looking for that double take test of

2251
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:17,839
like

2252
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:19,599
like what the hell is that like that

2253
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,159
that initial

2254
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,320
like how do we look for

2255
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,719
the possibility of weirdness at the

2256
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:28,880
possibility of high assembly number well

2257
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,880
yeah

2258
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,359
if they don't have two eyes and are

2259
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:34,639
green

2260
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:36,319
you know i would have probably already

2261
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,920
solved the problem right there's another

2262
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:38,719
nobel prize in there somewhere i think

2263
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,760
actually

2264
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,760
um

2265
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,920
well i think it's it's kind of so so

2266
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,600
there is a bias here right so

2267
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,840
we've evolved to recognize life on earth

2268
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,280
right like i you know children at a very

2269
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,199
early age can tell the difference

2270
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:53,599
between a puppy and a plant and then the

2271
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:56,639
plant and a chair for example you know

2272
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,800
like it just it seems innate um and so i

2273
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,840
think and also because we're life

2274
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,679
um

2275
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,119
you know i think like there's this

2276
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,239
implicit bias that we should know it

2277
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:06,238
when we see it and it should be

2278
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:07,839
completely obvious to us

2279
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:09,678
um but there are a lot of features of

2280
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,119
our universe that are not completely

2281
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:13,279
obvious to us like the fact that this

2282
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,880
table is made of atoms and that i'm

2283
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:18,319
sitting in a gravitational potential

2284
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:20,239
well right now um and i guess um

2285
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:21,039
my point with this is i think life is

2286
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:23,519
much

2287
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:25,119
less obvious than we think it is

2288
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,920
and so it could be in many more forms

2289
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:29,119
than we think it is um and i guess let's

2290
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,760
go back to the point about being

2291
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:33,519
open-minded that we may not know what

2292
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:35,360
alien life looks like it might not even

2293
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,480
be possible to interact with alien life

2294
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:38,719
because maybe

2295
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:40,479
something about you know our our

2296
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,800
informational lineage it makes it

2297
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:45,039
impossible for information from an alien

2298
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,239
to be copied to us therefore there's no

2299
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:47,840
you know

2300
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:49,759
so to speak communication channel and i

2301
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,640
don't mean you know verbal communication

2302
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,520
just

2303
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,360
it's not in our observational space like

2304
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,880
you know like you know there's there's

2305
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:58,238
fundamental questions about why we

2306
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,719
observe the universe in position rather

2307
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:02,079
than momentum but we also you know

2308
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,679
observe it in terms of certain

2309
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:04,960
informational patterns and things like

2310
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,440
that's what our brain constructs and

2311
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,640
maybe aliens just interact with a

2312
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:10,479
different part of reality than we do

2313
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,840
that's wildly speculative but i think i

2314
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:13,519
think um

2315
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,360
it's possible it's possible and i think

2316
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,120
it's consistent with the physics so i

2317
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:18,319
think the best ways we can ask questions

2318
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:20,479
are about

2319
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:22,479
life and chemistry and asking questions

2320
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:25,039
about if information is a real physical

2321
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:26,000
thing what would its signatures be in

2322
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:26,880
matter

2323
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,439
um

2324
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,520
and and how do we recognize those and i

2325
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:33,198
think the ones that are most obvious are

2326
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,040
the ones i've already articulated you

2327
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:36,799
have these objects that seem completely

2328
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:38,640
improbable for the universe to produce

2329
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,960
because the universe doesn't have the

2330
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,400
design of that object in the laws

2331
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:46,800
so therefore an object had to evolve

2332
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:48,639
we we talked we call it evolution but it

2333
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,360
had to be produced by the universe that

2334
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,039
then had all of the possible tasks to

2335
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:55,839
make that object

2336
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:59,039
um specified i mean there's some like

2337
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:01,360
there's an engineering question here of

2338
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:03,279
are there sensors we can create that can

2339
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:05,839
give us uh

2340
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:08,399
can help us discover certain pockets of

2341
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,440
high assemblies yeah aliens

2342
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:12,158
like

2343
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:14,479
i mean there is a hope

2344
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:17,359
setting dogs and chairs aside

2345
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:19,439
there's a hope that visually

2346
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:21,519
and we could detect

2347
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:23,439
like

2348
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,800
because our universe i mean at least the

2349
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:27,119
way we look at it now like this

2350
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:29,279
three-dimensional like space-time

2351
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:31,679
we can visually comprehend it

2352
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:33,840
it's interesting to think like if we got

2353
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:35,840
to hang out you know if there's an alien

2354
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,920
in this room

2355
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,719
like would we be able to detect it with

2356
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,399
our current sensors not the fancy kinds

2357
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,279
but but like what you're standing over

2358
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:45,119
there

2359
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:46,399
yeah standing over there or maybe like

2360
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:48,800
in this carpet see there's all these

2361
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:49,679
kinds of patterns right yeah uh i don't

2362
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,960
know

2363
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:52,800
if if

2364
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,920
i don't know if this carpet is an alien

2365
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,079
well so

2366
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,760
i see what you're saying um

2367
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:59,439
so assembly theory is pretty general

2368
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,520
like i mean we've been applying it to

2369
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:03,519
molecules because it makes sense applied

2370
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,199
to molecules but it's supposed to

2371
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,280
explain life

2372
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:08,799
um you know like the physics of life so

2373
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:11,359
it should explain you know the things in

2374
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,679
this room in addition to molecules um so

2375
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:16,719
i guess uh and you can apply it to

2376
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:19,279
images and things so i guess the idea

2377
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:21,359
you know you could explore is just

2378
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:23,359
looking at everything on planet earth in

2379
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:24,479
terms of its assembly structure and then

2380
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:25,839
looking for

2381
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:27,519
things that aren't part of our

2382
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,440
biological lineage if they have high

2383
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,800
assembly they might be aliens on earth i

2384
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,799
mean that that is a very kind of

2385
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,920
rigorous computer vision question can we

2386
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,480
visually

2387
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,079
is there a strong correlation

2388
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:39,919
between certain kind of high assembly

2389
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:42,079
objects when they get to the scale where

2390
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,880
they're visually observable

2391
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:44,719
and

2392
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:47,520
some like when it's

2393
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:49,600
say uh projected onto a 2d plane can we

2394
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,880
right can we figure out something right

2395
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,239
i am glad you brought up a computer

2396
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,760
vision point because for a while i had

2397
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:55,519
this kind of thought in my mind that we

2398
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,719
can't even see ourselves clearly so one

2399
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,920
of the things you know people are

2400
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,039
worried about artificial intelligence

2401
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,480
for a lot of reasons but i think it's

2402
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:01,760
really fascinating because it's like the

2403
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:04,319
first time

2404
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,400
in history that we're building a system

2405
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:08,079
that can help us understand ourselves

2406
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:10,319
so like you know people talk about ai

2407
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:12,000
physics but like um

2408
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:13,679
you know when i when i look at another

2409
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,760
person i don't see them as a four

2410
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:18,158
billion year lineage but that's what

2411
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:19,039
they are and so is everything here right

2412
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:21,359
so

2413
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,479
imagine that we built artificial systems

2414
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:24,238
that could actually

2415
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:26,479
see that feature of us

2416
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:28,639
what else would they see

2417
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:31,279
and i think that's what you're asking

2418
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:33,600
and i think i think that would be so

2419
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:33,599
cool

2420
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:37,039
i want that to happen but i think i

2421
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,480
think we're a little ways off from it

2422
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:40,158
but yeah

2423
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:43,039
we're going there i hope

2424
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:44,719
okay let me ask you uh i apologize ahead

2425
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:46,640
of time but let me ask you the internet

2426
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:49,039
question so you're a physicist you ask

2427
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,400
rigorous questions about the physics of

2428
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:52,880
existence and

2429
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:55,039
these models of high assembly objects

2430
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:57,199
now when the internet would see an alien

2431
01:19:55,039 --> 01:20:00,560
they would ask two questions one can i

2432
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:02,719
eat it and two can have sex with it yes

2433
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,719
so

2434
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,920
so you kind of mentioned that it's very

2435
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,079
difficult it's possible that we may not

2436
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,520
be even able to communicate with it

2437
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:20,000
right but i think the internet has more

2438
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:21,760
hope than we do yes it's a hopeful place

2439
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,880
yes uh do you

2440
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,159
do you think in terms of like

2441
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:28,079
interacting on this very primal level of

2442
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:30,238
of sharing resources like what would

2443
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:31,679
aliens eat what would we eat would we

2444
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:34,000
eat the same thing would could we

2445
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,560
potentially eat each other uh one one

2446
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,719
person eats the other or or the aliens

2447
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,800
eat us and the same thing with

2448
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:43,520
not sex in general reproduction but

2449
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:46,480
genetically mixing stuff like would we

2450
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,480
would be able to mix genetic information

2451
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:49,678
maybe not genetic but maybe information

2452
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:51,279
right and i think part of your question

2453
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:53,119
is like so

2454
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:55,039
so if you if you think of life as like

2455
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:56,479
this history of events that happen in

2456
01:20:55,039 --> 01:20:58,000
the universe like there's this question

2457
01:20:56,479 --> 01:20:59,919
of like how divergent are those

2458
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,520
histories right so when we get to the

2459
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,880
scale of technology it's possible to

2460
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,480
imagine

2461
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,520
imagine although we can't even do it

2462
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:06,879
like imagine all the possible

2463
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,080
technologies that could exist in the

2464
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,679
universe but if you think about all the

2465
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:11,359
possible chemistries somehow that seems

2466
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:13,520
like a lower dimensional space and a

2467
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:15,198
lower set of possibilities so it might

2468
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,440
be that like when we interact with

2469
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:18,238
aliens we do have to go back to those

2470
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:20,719
more

2471
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:22,079
basal levels to figure out sort of what

2472
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:25,039
the map is

2473
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:27,198
right um like the sort of where we have

2474
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:29,198
a common history we all we must have a

2475
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:31,279
common history somewhere in the universe

2476
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:33,039
but in order to be able to actually

2477
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:34,158
interact in a meaningful way you have to

2478
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:35,439
have some shared history i mean the

2479
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:37,759
reason we can exchange genetic

2480
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:39,439
information in each other's food or eat

2481
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,199
each other as food

2482
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:42,638
is because we have a shared history so

2483
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:44,079
we have to find that shared history the

2484
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,639
other we have to find the common

2485
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:47,600
ancestor in this causality map the the

2486
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:49,440
something yes

2487
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,199
yes and we have a last universal common

2488
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:52,399
ancestor for all life on earth which i

2489
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,638
think is sort of the nexus of that

2490
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:57,198
causality map for life on earth but the

2491
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:59,039
question is where would other aliens

2492
01:21:57,198 --> 01:22:00,479
diverge on that sound

2493
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,679
and i mean

2494
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:03,599
that

2495
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:06,399
so say there's a lot of aliens out there

2496
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:08,239
in the universe each each set of

2497
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:10,238
organisms will probably have like a

2498
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:11,039
number you know like erdos number of

2499
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:13,198
like

2500
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:16,079
how far

2501
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:18,238
like how far our common ancestor is and

2502
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:19,600
so the closer the common ancestor like

2503
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:21,599
it is on earth

2504
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,440
the more like each other the more likely

2505
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,880
we are to be able to have sexual

2506
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:26,158
reproduction well it's like sort of like

2507
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,719
humans having common culture and

2508
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:30,158
languages right yeah exactly language

2509
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:31,600
communication

2510
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:33,279
it might take a lot of work though with

2511
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,520
an alien because you really have to get

2512
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:38,880
over a language barrier

2513
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:43,360
oh boy so it says communication it's uh

2514
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,359
uh resources i mean it's all the whole

2515
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:48,080
and i think tied into that is the

2516
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,239
questions of like who's gonna harm who

2517
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:51,600
right and actually definitions parents

2518
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:52,718
approve you know all those kind of

2519
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,639
questions

2520
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:57,920
whether the common ancestor approves

2521
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:59,760
yeah that's just very true uh

2522
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,679
how many alien civilizations do you

2523
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:04,480
think are out there

2524
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:06,480
i don't have intuition for that

2525
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:08,799
um which i i have always thought was

2526
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:10,158
deeply intriguing so and and part of

2527
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,760
this uh

2528
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:13,039
i mean i say it specifically is i don't

2529
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,400
have intuition for that because it's

2530
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:15,920
like one of those questions that you

2531
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:19,679
feel around for a while and you really

2532
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:21,840
just you you can't see it um even though

2533
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:23,039
it might be right there and

2534
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,239
um

2535
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:25,920
in that sense it's a little like the

2536
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:27,119
quantum to classical transition you're

2537
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,719
like really talking about two different

2538
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:29,599
kinds of physics and i think that's kind

2539
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,719
of part of the problem once we

2540
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,560
understand the physics that question

2541
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:35,840
might become more meaningful

2542
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:37,679
um but there's also this other issue um

2543
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,199
uh and this was really instilled in me

2544
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,199
by my mentor paul davies when i was a

2545
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:43,599
postdoc because he always talks about

2546
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:46,799
how you know whether aliens are common

2547
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,320
or rare is kind of just um you know it's

2548
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,159
like you know it follows a wave of

2549
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:52,000
popularity and it just depends on like

2550
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:53,679
the mood of you know what the culture is

2551
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,359
at the time and i always thought that

2552
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:57,199
was kind of an intriguing observation

2553
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:58,960
but but also there's this you know set

2554
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:00,238
of points about if you go by

2555
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:03,920
observational evidence which we're

2556
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:04,799
supposed to do with scientists right um

2557
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,199
you know

2558
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,639
we have evidence of

2559
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:10,638
us

2560
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:12,560
and one original life event from which

2561
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:14,239
we emerged and people want to make

2562
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,679
arguments that because that event was

2563
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:17,279
rapid

2564
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:18,800
or because there's other planets that

2565
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:20,719
have properties similar to ours that

2566
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,239
that event should be common but you

2567
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,760
actually can't reason on that because

2568
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:25,839
our existence observing that event is

2569
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,039
contingent on that event happening which

2570
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,520
means it could have been completely

2571
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:30,960
improbable or very common

2572
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,639
and brandon carter like clearly

2573
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,480
articulated that in terms of anthropic

2574
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:36,639
arguments um

2575
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:38,799
a few decades ago so so there is this

2576
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:40,480
kind of issue that we have to contend

2577
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,239
with dealing with life that's closer to

2578
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:44,319
home than we have to deal with with any

2579
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:45,678
other problems in physics which we're

2580
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:46,799
talking about the physics of ourselves

2581
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:48,560
and when you're asked about the original

2582
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,400
life event that event happening in the

2583
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,199
universe at least is like our existence

2584
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:54,238
is contingent on it um and so you can

2585
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:55,678
think about sort of fine tuning

2586
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:58,718
arguments um

2587
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:00,319
that way too so um but the the sort of

2588
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,279
odder part of it is like when i think

2589
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:04,000
about

2590
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:06,319
uh how likely it is i think it's because

2591
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,359
we don't understand this mechanism yet

2592
01:25:06,319 --> 01:25:09,039
about

2593
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:10,719
how information can be generated

2594
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:12,560
spontaneously

2595
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,399
that i like because i can't see that

2596
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,440
physics clearly yet even though i have a

2597
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:16,879
lot of

2598
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:19,198
you know like some things around the

2599
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,079
space of it in my mind i can't

2600
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:24,079
articulate how likely that process is

2601
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:25,840
um so my honest answer is i don't know

2602
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:27,039
and it sometimes feels like a cop-out

2603
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,400
but i feel like that's a more honest

2604
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:31,119
answer and a more meaningful way of

2605
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:33,198
making progress than um what a lot of

2606
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:34,800
people want to do which is say oh well

2607
01:25:33,198 --> 01:25:36,399
we have a one-in-ten chance of having on

2608
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,920
an exoplanet with earth-like properties

2609
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:39,439
because there's lots of earth-like

2610
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,520
planets out there and life happen fast

2611
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:43,119
on earth well so

2612
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,199
i have kind of a follow-up question but

2613
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:47,279
as a side comment

2614
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:49,198
what i really am enjoying about the way

2615
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:50,800
you're talking about human beings is you

2616
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:52,000
always say not to make yourself

2617
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,400
conscious about it because i really

2618
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,198
really enjoy it do you say we

2619
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:59,839
yes you don't say humans

2620
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:01,039
you say because often times like and you

2621
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,639
know i don't know evolutionary

2622
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:04,079
biologists will kind of

2623
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,319
put yourself out

2624
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:08,158
yes as an observer but you're

2625
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:09,679
it's it's kind of fascinating to think

2626
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:11,039
that you as a human are struggling about

2627
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:14,480
your own origins

2628
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:17,039
yes that's the problem and yeah and i i

2629
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:18,879
think um i don't do that deliberately

2630
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:20,399
but i do think that way and this is sort

2631
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,159
of the inversion from the logic of

2632
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:24,399
physics because physics as it's always

2633
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:26,399
been constructed has treated us as

2634
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:27,839
external observers of the universe and

2635
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:29,519
we are not part of the universe and this

2636
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,520
is why the problem of life i think

2637
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,760
demands completely new thinking because

2638
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,760
we have to think about ourselves as

2639
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,840
minds that exist in the universe and are

2640
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,760
at this particular moment in history and

2641
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,920
looking out at the things around us and

2642
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,000
trying to understand what we are inside

2643
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,399
the system not outside the system we

2644
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,238
don't have descriptions at a fundamental

2645
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:49,759
level that describe us as inside the

2646
01:26:48,238 --> 01:26:51,839
system and this was my problem with

2647
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,760
cellular automata also you're always an

2648
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,279
external observer for a cellular

2649
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,480
automata you're not in the system what

2650
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:58,800
does the cellular automata look like

2651
01:26:56,479 --> 01:27:00,079
from the inside

2652
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,760
i think you just broke my brain with

2653
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:04,319
that question exactly but i thought

2654
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,360
about that for a long time

2655
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,759
i'm gonna

2656
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:10,079
uh yeah that's a that's a really clean

2657
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:12,400
formulation of a very fundamental

2658
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:13,920
question because you can only to

2659
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:16,479
understand cellular autonomy you have to

2660
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:20,000
be inside of it

2661
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:22,319
but as a human sort of a poetic romantic

2662
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,760
question does it make you sad does it

2663
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:25,519
make you

2664
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,239
hopeful

2665
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:31,040
whether we're alone or not like in the

2666
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:33,839
different possible versions of that

2667
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:36,079
if we're the highest assembly object in

2668
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,400
the entire universe

2669
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:40,559
does that at this moment in time at this

2670
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:42,079
moment in the causality because we might

2671
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,520
i assume we have a future well we

2672
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:46,559
definitely have a future and the

2673
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,880
question is well yeah where that future

2674
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,400
decreases the assembly like it could be

2675
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,800
where at the peak

2676
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:54,399
or we could be just um

2677
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,039
that would be inconsistent with the

2678
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:59,198
physics in my mind but

2679
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:00,880
so so i i should give a caveat i've

2680
01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:02,559
given the the caveat that i'm biased as

2681
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,960
a physicist but i'm also biased as an

2682
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,960
eternal optimist so pretty much all of

2683
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,279
my modes of operation for building

2684
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,880
theories about the world are not like an

2685
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:12,158
occam's razor what's the simplest

2686
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,719
explanation but what's the most

2687
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:16,479
optimistic explanation

2688
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:18,800
and part of the reason for that is if

2689
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:20,319
you really think explanations have

2690
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,239
causal power

2691
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:23,359
um in the sense that our theo like the

2692
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:25,119
fact that we have theories about the

2693
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:26,799
world has enabled technologies and

2694
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:29,039
physically transformed the world around

2695
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,159
us i think i have to take seriously that

2696
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:31,279
as a part of the physics i want to

2697
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:32,879
describe

2698
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:34,319
and try to

2699
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,719
build

2700
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:38,158
theories of reality that are optimistic

2701
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,760
about what's coming next because the

2702
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:42,238
theories are in part the causes of what

2703
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:44,639
comes next

2704
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:46,799
so there could be a physics of

2705
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:47,840
hope or physics of optimism in there too

2706
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,520
yes

2707
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,920
because um

2708
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,560
that seems like also i mean optimism

2709
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:57,840
does seem to be a kind of engine that

2710
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,520
results in innovation yes so this is dr

2711
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,920
like what why the hell

2712
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:04,239
are we trying to come up with new stuff

2713
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,440
oh so um so i made this point about

2714
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,959
thinking life is the physics of

2715
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:09,519
existence and it's not just the physics

2716
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,279
of existence it's the physics of

2717
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,280
more things existing

2718
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:15,840
so i think one of these drives

2719
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:18,559
the yeah creativity like optimism the

2720
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,159
story so if you like people like entropy

2721
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,679
i don't i don't like entropy as it was

2722
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:24,879
formulated in the 1800s i think it's an

2723
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:27,520
antiquated concept but um but this idea

2724
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:29,199
of maximizing over the possible number

2725
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,960
of states that could exist imagine the

2726
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:32,079
universe is actually trying to maximize

2727
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,920
over the number of things that could

2728
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:35,279
physically exist what would be the best

2729
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,560
way to do that the best way to do that

2730
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:38,319
would be evolve intelligent

2731
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,800
technological things that could explore

2732
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:40,799
that space

2733
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,520
so okay that's talking about alien life

2734
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,960
out there in the universe but you've

2735
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,400
also earlier in the conversation

2736
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:52,960
mentioned

2737
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:55,679
the shadow biosphere so is it possible

2738
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:58,399
that we have weird life here

2739
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:01,119
on earth that we're just not

2740
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:04,719
like even in a high assembly formulation

2741
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:07,119
of life yeah that we're just not

2742
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:09,359
paying attention to we're blind to like

2743
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:11,039
life we're potentially able to detect

2744
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:13,198
but we're blind to and maybe you could

2745
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:15,119
say what is the shadow bias sure sure

2746
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:16,799
yeah the shadow biosphere is this idea

2747
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:18,479
that there might have been other

2748
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,760
original life events that happened on

2749
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:22,238
earth

2750
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,639
that were independent from the original

2751
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:27,759
life event that led to us and all of the

2752
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:29,920
life that we know on earth and therefore

2753
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:32,079
there could be aliens in the sense they

2754
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:35,520
have a different origin event

2755
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:38,158
living among us um uh and it was

2756
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,000
proposed by a number of people um

2757
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:41,519
but one of them was a paul davies that i

2758
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,039
mentioned earlier as my mentor and he

2759
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,800
has a really a cute way of saying that

2760
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:48,319
aliens could be right under our noses or

2761
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:49,760
even in our noses

2762
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:52,880
uh with a british accent it sounds

2763
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:54,719
better but um but uh but anyway so the

2764
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,039
idea is like it could literally be

2765
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,399
anywhere around us um and if you think

2766
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,479
actually about the discovery of like

2767
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:01,519
viruses and bacteria you know for a long

2768
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:04,000
time we didn't they were kind of a

2769
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:06,480
shadow biosphere it was life that was

2770
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,158
around us but invisible

2771
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:09,678
um and

2772
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:11,439
but this takes it a little bit further

2773
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:13,359
in saying that you know all of those

2774
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:15,279
examples viruses bacteria and everything

2775
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:16,719
that we've discovered so far has this

2776
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:18,880
common ancestry in the last universal

2777
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:20,480
common ancestor of life on earth so

2778
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,719
maybe there was a different origin event

2779
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:25,279
and that life is weirder still

2780
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,560
and might be among us and we could find

2781
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:27,840
it

2782
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,000
we don't have to go out and stars live

2783
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,079
for aliens just here on earth do you

2784
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,158
think that's a serious

2785
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:35,760
possibility that we should explore with

2786
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:38,960
the tools of science like this should be

2787
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:40,400
a serious effort i think um yes and no

2788
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,239
um and

2789
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:45,198
i mean yes because i think it's a

2790
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:47,839
serious hypothesis um and i think it's

2791
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:50,238
worth exploring and it is certainly more

2792
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,560
economical to look for

2793
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:54,718
signs of alien life on earth than it is

2794
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,639
to go and build spacecraft and send

2795
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:58,399
robots to other planets and that was one

2796
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:00,560
of the reasons it was proposed is well

2797
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:02,479
if we do find an example of another

2798
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,000
original life on earth it's hugely

2799
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:05,599
informative because it means the

2800
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,560
original life is not a rare event if it

2801
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,400
happened

2802
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,760
twice on the same planet that means it's

2803
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:11,198
probably pretty probable given

2804
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,520
conditions are right

2805
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:15,198
um so it has huge potential scientific

2806
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,800
impact not to mention the fact that you

2807
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:18,479
might have like biochemistry and stuff

2808
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,760
that's informative for like medicine and

2809
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:20,638
stuff like that but

2810
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,320
um

2811
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:23,679
but i think that the thing for me that's

2812
01:32:22,319 --> 01:32:25,198
challenging about it and this really

2813
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:26,880
comes from my own work like thinking

2814
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:28,960
about

2815
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,960
life as a planetary scale process and

2816
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,000
also trying to understand

2817
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,760
sometimes what i call like the

2818
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,679
statistical mechanics of biochemistry

2819
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:38,400
but large scale statistical patterns in

2820
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:40,719
the chemistry that life uses on earth

2821
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:44,000
there are a lot of regularities there

2822
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:46,480
and life does seem to have planetary

2823
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
scale organization that's consistent

2824
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:49,519
even with some of the patterns that we

2825
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,960
see at the individual scale so if you

2826
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,199
think life is a planetary scale

2827
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,399
phenomena and the chemistry of life has

2828
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:55,198
to be sort of

2829
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:57,599
um

2830
01:32:55,198 --> 01:32:59,599
not just it's not an individual is not

2831
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,360
necessarily the fundamental unit of life

2832
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,920
right the fundamental you know life is

2833
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:06,158
these uh informational lineages and

2834
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,039
they're kind of you know they intersect

2835
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:09,519
over

2836
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,198
spatial scales so everything on earth is

2837
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:14,080
kind of related by the common causal

2838
01:33:11,198 --> 01:33:15,439
history yeah so it's hard for me

2839
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:18,079
based on the way i think about the

2840
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:20,000
physics and also some of the stuff that

2841
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:21,439
my group has done to really think that

2842
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
there could be

2843
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:25,519
uh evidence or there could be a second

2844
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,039
sample of life on earth but i think

2845
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,679
there are ways that we need to be more

2846
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:32,079
concrete about that and i have thought a

2847
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:33,600
little bit about like um you know like

2848
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:36,639
you can represent the chemistry in an

2849
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:38,400
individual cell as a network and then

2850
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:39,279
those networks something my group has

2851
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:41,359
shown

2852
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:43,119
actually scale

2853
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:44,559
with the same properties so ecosystems

2854
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:46,639
have the same properties as individuals

2855
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,480
as planetary scale and then you could

2856
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:50,159
imagine if you had alien chemistry

2857
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:52,319
intermixed in there that scaling would

2858
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:54,479
be broken so if there's some robustness

2859
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:56,000
property or something associated to it

2860
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:57,599
and you get alien chemistry in there it

2861
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:02,079
just breaks everything and you don't

2862
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:03,920
have a planetary ecosystem functioning

2863
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:06,079
an individual's functioning across all

2864
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:07,840
these scales so i guess what i'm arguing

2865
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:10,319
is life is not a scale-dependent

2866
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,679
phenomena it's not just cellular life so

2867
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:12,960
if you have a shadow biosphere it has to

2868
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:15,440
be integrated with all of these other

2869
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,719
scales in it and that and that would

2870
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:20,238
lose the meaning of the word shadow

2871
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:21,840
biosphere i think so yeah so so i i it's

2872
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:23,439
an open question right and i think it

2873
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,760
would it would tell us a lot so there

2874
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:28,000
has been very minimal effort of people

2875
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,920
to look for a shadow biosphere

2876
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,760
but then the question it could be

2877
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:35,199
possible that uh

2878
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:37,920
there's like sufficiently distinct

2879
01:34:35,198 --> 01:34:40,399
planets within one planet meaning like

2880
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:42,399
environments within one planet yeah like

2881
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:44,559
i don't know

2882
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:46,638
i've been looking uh recently

2883
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,719
uh because of having a chat with

2884
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,480
catherine declare about io the moon of

2885
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,319
jupiter that's like all volcanoes and

2886
01:34:50,479 --> 01:34:53,769
volcanoes a badass but like yeah

2887
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,920
imagining

2888
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:57,920
[Laughter]

2889
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:00,079
imagining life inside volcanoes right

2890
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:01,520
like yeah it seems like sufficiently

2891
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:02,960
chemically

2892
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,360
different

2893
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:07,359
like to be living in the darkness right

2894
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:09,359
where there's a lot of heat and maybe

2895
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:11,679
you could have different earths on like

2896
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:13,198
a planet yeah or like if you go deep

2897
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:14,480
enough in the crust maybe there's like a

2898
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:16,158
layer where there's no life and then

2899
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:18,479
there's suddenly life again and maybe

2900
01:35:16,158 --> 01:35:20,719
those you know lizard

2901
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:23,359
men or whatever that people dream about

2902
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:25,039
are really down there um i know that's a

2903
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:26,880
little flippant but but really like

2904
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:29,118
there could be like chemical cycles deep

2905
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:31,039
in those crests that might be alive and

2906
01:35:29,118 --> 01:35:33,359
are completely distinct in chemical or

2907
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:34,880
origin to surface life

2908
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:36,000
right that they wouldn't be interacting

2909
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,600
with each other yeah and that's one of

2910
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,118
the proposals for the shadow biosphere

2911
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,000
is like sometimes people talk about it

2912
01:35:39,118 --> 01:35:43,920
as being geologically or geographically

2913
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,600
distinct that it might be you know you

2914
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,199
have no life for this region and then a

2915
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,639
different example and then sometimes

2916
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:50,638
people talk about it being chemically

2917
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:51,760
distinct that the chemistry is

2918
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,679
sufficiently different that it's

2919
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,039
completely orthogonal or non-interacting

2920
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:56,800
with our chemistry it seems to me at

2921
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:58,800
least the chemistry is

2922
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:02,320
a a more powerful

2923
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:04,000
boundary yes than than than geographic

2924
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:07,359
it just seems like life

2925
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,158
finds a way literally to travel yeah

2926
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:10,559
yes

2927
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:14,000
what do you think about all these ufo

2928
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:16,000
sightings so to me it's really inspiring

2929
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,840
it's yet another

2930
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,399
localized way to dream about right the

2931
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,639
mysterious that is out there yeah

2932
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:26,719
so i've actually been more intrigued by

2933
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:28,639
the cultural phenomena ufos than the

2934
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:31,279
phenomena ufos themselves because i

2935
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:32,159
think it's intriguing about how

2936
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:35,519
uh

2937
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:38,079
we are preparing ourselves mentally

2938
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:40,080
for understanding others and how we have

2939
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:41,439
thought about that historically and what

2940
01:36:40,079 --> 01:36:44,238
the sort of

2941
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:45,759
modern incarnations of that are um

2942
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:47,759
it's more like

2943
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:50,400
i want an explanation for us that's my

2944
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,159
motivation and having some you know

2945
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:54,079
streaks across the sky or something and

2946
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:55,118
saying that's aliens it doesn't tell you

2947
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:56,880
anything

2948
01:36:55,118 --> 01:36:58,559
um so unless you have a deeper

2949
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,920
explanation and you have you know more

2950
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,600
lines of

2951
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,679
uh you know where is this going to take

2952
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:05,520
us in the future it's just not as

2953
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:07,520
interesting to me as the problem of

2954
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:09,119
understanding life itself and aliens as

2955
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,960
a more general phenomenon i do think

2956
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:12,880
it's uh just as you said

2957
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:15,439
a good way to psychologically and

2958
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:17,440
sociologically prepare ourselves to sort

2959
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:19,359
of like what would that look like right

2960
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:21,439
and very importantly which is what a lot

2961
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:24,559
of people talk about politically

2962
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:26,638
sort of uh there's this idea from the so

2963
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:29,679
it came from the soviet union of like

2964
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:32,239
the cold war and we have to hide secrets

2965
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:33,920
yeah there's some way in us searching

2966
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:36,079
for life on other planets are searching

2967
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:37,760
for life in general

2968
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:39,519
the

2969
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:42,639
the way we've done government in the

2970
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:45,360
past yeah we tend to think of all new

2971
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:47,039
things as potential military secrets so

2972
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,960
we want to hide them

2973
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:51,600
and one of the ways that people kind of

2974
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,439
look at ufo sightings is like

2975
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:55,199
like maybe we shouldn't hide this stuff

2976
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:57,359
like what is the government hiding right

2977
01:37:55,198 --> 01:37:58,719
i think that's a really

2978
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:01,599
you know in one sense it's a

2979
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:03,439
conspiratorial question but i think

2980
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:06,560
in another it's an

2981
01:38:03,439 --> 01:38:09,919
inspiration to change the way we do

2982
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:11,600
government to where secrets don't uh

2983
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,600
maybe there are times when you want to

2984
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:15,280
keep secrets as military secrets but

2985
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:18,480
maybe we need to release a lot more

2986
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:20,399
stuff and see us as a human species as

2987
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:22,319
together in this whole search yeah the

2988
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:24,158
public engagement part there is really

2989
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:25,920
interesting

2990
01:38:24,158 --> 01:38:27,920
and it's almost like a challenge to the

2991
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,840
way we've done stuff in the past in

2992
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:31,840
terms of keeping secrets when they're

2993
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:34,239
not so like

2994
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:36,880
the the first step if you don't know how

2995
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:39,919
something how something works if there's

2996
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:41,760
a mysterious thing the the first

2997
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:44,319
instinct should not be like let's hide

2998
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,079
it put it in the closet right so that

2999
01:38:44,319 --> 01:38:48,158
the chinese or the russian government or

3000
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:50,639
whatever government doesn't uh doesn't

3001
01:38:48,158 --> 01:38:52,719
find it maybe the first one the first

3002
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:54,159
instinct should be let's understand it

3003
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:55,679
yeah perhaps let's understand it

3004
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:57,759
together right

3005
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,279
no i think that's good and and something

3006
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:00,400
i realized recently that i never thought

3007
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:02,719
was going to be a problem but i think

3008
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:05,759
this actually helps with quite a bit

3009
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:08,239
is because so many um people nowadays

3010
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,039
believe we've already made contact

3011
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:11,839
that

3012
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:13,439
as an astrobiologist if we you know

3013
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,360
actually want to understand life and

3014
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:16,719
make contact we kind of have to

3015
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:18,158
deconstruct

3016
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:19,920
the narratives we've already built from

3017
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:21,679
ourselves and kind of unteach ourselves

3018
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:23,520
that we've learned about aliens and then

3019
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:26,399
reteach ourselves so there's this really

3020
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:27,920
interesting sort of dialogue there um

3021
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:29,198
and making it open to the public that

3022
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,480
they actually have to think critically

3023
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:31,919
about it and they see the evidence for

3024
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:33,759
themselves i think is really important

3025
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,000
for that process

3026
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:39,280
yeah the restriction that aliens might

3027
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,520
be way weirder than we can imagine yes

3028
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:44,079
yes i'm i'm pretty sure they're probably

3029
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:46,560
weirder than we can imagine

3030
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:49,198
okay we've uh in 2020

3031
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:52,159
and still living through a pandemic

3032
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:54,399
setting the the the the political and

3033
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:56,158
all those kinds of things aside i've

3034
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:58,158
always found

3035
01:39:56,158 --> 01:39:59,920
viruses fascinating

3036
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,719
as as living

3037
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,319
as

3038
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,319
dynamical systems i was going to say

3039
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:05,840
living systems but

3040
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:08,238
i've always kind of thought of them as

3041
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:10,480
living you know but that's a whole

3042
01:40:08,238 --> 01:40:13,439
nother kind of discussion maybe

3043
01:40:10,479 --> 01:40:15,599
it'd be great to put that on the table

3044
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:18,158
one do you find viruses

3045
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:20,239
beautiful slash terrifying and two do

3046
01:40:18,158 --> 01:40:21,439
you think they're living

3047
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:23,839
things

3048
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:26,399
or there's some aspect to them

3049
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:27,679
for our discussion of life that makes

3050
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:29,118
them living

3051
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:30,639
i mean living in a pandemic saying

3052
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:33,279
viruses are beautiful is probably a hard

3053
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:35,279
thing but i do find them

3054
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:38,639
beautiful to a degree i think

3055
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:40,319
even even even in the sense of mediating

3056
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:42,319
a global pandemic there's something like

3057
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:44,079
deeply intriguing there because

3058
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:46,639
you know these these are tiny

3059
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:48,158
tiny little things right and yet they

3060
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:51,359
can um

3061
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:52,960
uh you know essentially um

3062
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:54,880
like cause a seizure like you know

3063
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,118
handicap an entire civilization at a

3064
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:59,199
global scale so just that intersection

3065
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:02,158
of between you know our perceived

3066
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:03,919
invincibility and our susceptibility to

3067
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:05,839
things and also the interaction across

3068
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:09,199
scales of those things is just

3069
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:11,279
a really amazing feature of our world

3070
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:12,638
most technology whether it's viruses or

3071
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:16,158
ai

3072
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:18,880
that can scale scale in an exponential

3073
01:41:16,158 --> 01:41:20,158
way like right kind of run

3074
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,560
you know like

3075
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:23,839
as opposed to like one thing makes

3076
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,840
another thing

3077
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:27,440
makes another thing it's one thing makes

3078
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:29,920
two things and those two things make

3079
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:32,158
four things and then like that kind of

3080
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:35,440
process

3081
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:36,960
also seems to be fundamental to life yes

3082
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:39,279
and uh

3083
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:42,639
it's terrifying because in in a matter

3084
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:45,198
of in a very short time scale

3085
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:47,359
it can uh

3086
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:49,439
if it's good at being life

3087
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:51,920
whatever that is yeah it can quickly

3088
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:53,439
overtake the the other competing forms

3089
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:56,639
of life right

3090
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:58,319
and that's scary both for ai and

3091
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:00,560
for viruses and it seems like

3092
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:02,479
understanding these processes

3093
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:04,480
that are underlying viruses and i don't

3094
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:07,118
mean like on the virology or biology

3095
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:09,198
side but on some kind of

3096
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:10,799
more computational physics yeah

3097
01:42:09,198 --> 01:42:14,559
perspective as we've been talking about

3098
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:17,520
yeah seems to be really important to

3099
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:19,039
figure out how humans can

3100
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,480
survive

3101
01:42:19,039 --> 01:42:23,039
right

3102
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:25,158
along with these kinds of

3103
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:27,840
this kind of life and perhaps becoming a

3104
01:42:25,158 --> 01:42:30,399
multi-planetary species is

3105
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,840
is a part of that like there's no maybe

3106
01:42:30,399 --> 01:42:33,920
like what we'll figure out from a

3107
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,600
physics perspective is like there's no

3108
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:38,000
way

3109
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:40,400
any living system

3110
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,560
can be stable for a prolonged period of

3111
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:44,479
time and survive unless it expands

3112
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:47,760
exponentially throughout like

3113
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:49,198
we have to multiply otherwise

3114
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:51,039
anything that doesn't multiply

3115
01:42:49,198 --> 01:42:52,799
exponentially will die eventually maybe

3116
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:54,079
that's a fundamental law

3117
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,279
um

3118
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:56,880
maybe

3119
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:58,319
i don't know i you know i always get

3120
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:59,840
really bothered by these darwinian

3121
01:42:58,319 --> 01:43:01,679
narratives that are like you know like

3122
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:03,039
the fittest replicator wins and things

3123
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:04,719
and i don't i just don't feel like

3124
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:06,479
that's exact exactly what's going on i

3125
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:07,359
think like the copying of information is

3126
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:09,118
sort of

3127
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:10,399
ancillary to this other process of

3128
01:43:09,118 --> 01:43:12,559
creativity

3129
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:14,879
right so like the drive is actually the

3130
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:16,719
drive is creativity but if you want to

3131
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:18,319
keep the creativity that's existed in

3132
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:19,279
the past it has to be copied into the

3133
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:21,599
future

3134
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:23,198
right so replication like if you

3135
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,520
so that for me is

3136
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:27,678
so i had this set of arguments um with

3137
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:29,520
michael lachman and lee cronin about the

3138
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,719
like life being about persistence they

3139
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,239
thought it was about persistence and

3140
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:33,760
like survival of fittest kind of thing

3141
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:35,678
and i'm like no it's about existence

3142
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,920
it's like because when you're talking

3143
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:39,600
about that it's easy to say that in

3144
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,520
retrospect you can post select on the

3145
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,960
things that survived and then say why

3146
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:45,040
they survived

3147
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,158
but um but you can't do that going

3148
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:47,920
forward

3149
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:50,879
that's really profound

3150
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:53,520
that survival is just a nice little

3151
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:55,440
side effect feature of

3152
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:57,679
maximizing creativity but it doesn't

3153
01:43:55,439 --> 01:44:00,079
need to be there yeah

3154
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:02,000
i like people yeah yeah like i said i

3155
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:03,279
like optimistic theories well i don't

3156
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,279
know if that's up to me that that could

3157
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:08,000
be terrifying to people because

3158
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:11,039
yeah because uh you know a system that

3159
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,198
maximizes creativity may very quickly

3160
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:15,760
get rid of humans for some reason if it

3161
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:17,279
comes up with some other creative

3162
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,960
i mean yeah

3163
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:21,359
forms of existence

3164
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,679
yeah right this is the ai thing it's

3165
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:26,238
like the moment you have an ai

3166
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:28,880
system that can

3167
01:44:26,238 --> 01:44:31,039
that can flourish in the space of ideas

3168
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:33,199
or in some other space much more

3169
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:35,359
effectively than humans

3170
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:37,039
and it's sufficiently integrated into

3171
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:39,118
into the physical space to be able to

3172
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:40,639
modify the environment

3173
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:42,079
i think we'll just be like the core

3174
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:44,719
genetic architecture or something we'll

3175
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:46,399
be like the dna for ai right it's like

3176
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:47,840
we haven't lost the past informational

3177
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:49,759
architectures on this planet they're

3178
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:52,639
still there

3179
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:55,679
yeah also they'll ai will use our brains

3180
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:57,920
in some part to like like ride like

3181
01:44:55,679 --> 01:45:00,880
it'll accelerate the exchange of ideas

3182
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:03,359
that's the neural link dream is that

3183
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:05,440
well the humans will be still around

3184
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:06,479
because you're saying architecture yeah

3185
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:08,319
but i don't i don't even think they

3186
01:45:06,479 --> 01:45:10,000
necessarily need to tap in our brains i

3187
01:45:08,319 --> 01:45:11,599
mean just collectively we do interesting

3188
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,118
things what if they were just using like

3189
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:14,639
the patterns in our communication or

3190
01:45:13,118 --> 01:45:15,519
something

3191
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:17,359
oh

3192
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,280
without controlling it just

3193
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:20,639
observing well i i don't know in what

3194
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:23,198
sense do you control the chemistry

3195
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,159
happening in your body

3196
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:25,118
hmm

3197
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:27,439
yeah

3198
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:29,039
i i mean i i obviously i don't know i'm

3199
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:30,559
just i i just

3200
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:32,158
like the way i look at like people look

3201
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:34,159
at ai and then they look at this thing

3202
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:36,000
that's bigger than us and is coming in

3203
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:37,920
the future and is smarter than us

3204
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,760
and i think though that looking at the

3205
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,199
past history of life on the planet and

3206
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,039
what information has been doing for the

3207
01:45:41,198 --> 01:45:44,960
last four billion years is probably very

3208
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:46,560
informative to asking questions about

3209
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,679
what's coming next

3210
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:50,560
um

3211
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:52,560
and i don't

3212
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,719
one is planetary scale transitions are

3213
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,080
really important for new phases so the

3214
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:57,439
global internet and sort of global

3215
01:45:56,079 --> 01:45:58,880
integration of our technology i think

3216
01:45:57,439 --> 01:46:01,198
it's an important thing so that's again

3217
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,719
life is a planetary scale phenomena but

3218
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:04,319
we're an integrated component of that

3219
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:06,480
phenomenon i don't really see that the

3220
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:07,679
technology is going to replace us

3221
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:08,959
in that way it's just going to keep

3222
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:10,880
scaffolding

3223
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,158
and building and and i also don't have

3224
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,960
an idea that we're going to build ai in

3225
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:16,960
a box i think ai is going to emerge agi

3226
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,840
to be is a planetary scale phenomena

3227
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,840
that's going to emerge from our

3228
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:22,480
technology

3229
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,440
planetary scale phenomena but do you

3230
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:26,000
think

3231
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:28,238
an agi is not distinct from humans we're

3232
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,000
the whole package the whole package

3233
01:46:28,238 --> 01:46:31,519
comes as a planetary scale phenomenon

3234
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,039
and that goes back to the fact that like

3235
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,719
you were you know asking questions about

3236
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:36,000
you as an individual

3237
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:38,158
like what are you as an individual

3238
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,079
you're like a packet of information that

3239
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:42,479
exists in the particular physical thing

3240
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:44,158
that is you we're all just

3241
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,759
packets of information and some of us

3242
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:47,198
are aggregates in certain ways but it's

3243
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:49,600
all just kind of exchanging and

3244
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:51,118
propagating right and processing

3245
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:53,679
is your

3246
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:56,000
packet of information that you've

3247
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:57,359
continually referred to as sarah

3248
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,679
afraid

3249
01:46:57,359 --> 01:47:01,839
of the dissipation of the

3250
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:02,880
death of that packet are you afraid of

3251
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:04,560
death

3252
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,199
do you ponder death

3253
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:11,280
does death have meaning in this process

3254
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:13,118
of creativity i think i have the natural

3255
01:47:11,279 --> 01:47:14,559
biological urge that everyone has to

3256
01:47:13,118 --> 01:47:15,439
fear death

3257
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,199
um

3258
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:18,638
i think the thing that i think is

3259
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:20,079
interesting is if i think about it

3260
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:21,760
rationally

3261
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:23,920
i'm not necessarily afraid of death for

3262
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,800
me because i won't be aware of being

3263
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,639
dead

3264
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:29,039
um but i am afraid like for my kids

3265
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:30,719
because it matters to them if i die

3266
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:33,039
um so

3267
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:35,039
so again like i think death becomes more

3268
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:37,198
significant as a collective property not

3269
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:39,198
as an individual one

3270
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:40,079
yeah but isn't there something to fear

3271
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:42,879
about

3272
01:47:40,079 --> 01:47:44,079
the fact that the way

3273
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:46,880
like

3274
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:48,880
the creative uh

3275
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:52,319
the complexity of information that's

3276
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:54,719
been like created in you yeah the the

3277
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:56,079
fact that it kind of

3278
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:57,679
breaks apart

3279
01:47:56,079 --> 01:47:58,800
and disappears

3280
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:02,239
it doesn't but i don't think it

3281
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:05,440
disappears it's just not me anymore

3282
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:07,198
right so you're but the that process of

3283
01:48:05,439 --> 01:48:08,960
you it being not you anymore that

3284
01:48:07,198 --> 01:48:10,719
doesn't scare you

3285
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:12,719
of course it does the mystery of it i

3286
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:14,079
mean the yeah but i guess i'm heartened

3287
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:15,760
by the fact that there will be some

3288
01:48:14,079 --> 01:48:17,920
imprints of the fact that i existed

3289
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:20,560
still in the universe after i leave it

3290
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:21,920
yeah but there'll be a okay and also

3291
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:24,159
that has to do with my perception of

3292
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:25,520
time right so you know i perceive time

3293
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:27,599
as flowing but that might not be the

3294
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:29,119
case

3295
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:31,199
i mean this is you know standard

3296
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:33,359
physicists comfort is you know every

3297
01:48:31,198 --> 01:48:34,960
time moment exists you know and is you

3298
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:36,719
know there's no and the flow of time is

3299
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:40,480
just our perception of

3300
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:41,520
you know us um you know us changing

3301
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:42,959
um

3302
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:45,119
so you can travel back in time and

3303
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,319
that's comforting like from a physics

3304
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:47,839
condition no no i'm not talking about

3305
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:50,399
traveling back in time i'm just saying

3306
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,239
that the moments in the past still exist

3307
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:54,319
um now whether the moments in the future

3308
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,000
exist or not is a different question

3309
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:57,519
that's not comforting to me in terms of

3310
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,920
death

3311
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:02,560
the flow of time is not that does not i

3312
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:04,639
think uh i think it's i think there's no

3313
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,480
comfort in the face of death for what we

3314
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:08,079
are uh

3315
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:10,559
because we like existing and i think

3316
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:11,519
it's especially true if you if you love

3317
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,599
life

3318
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:14,960
and you love what life is

3319
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:16,079
do you think there's a certain sense in

3320
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,679
which

3321
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:20,158
the fear of death or the fear of

3322
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:21,359
non-existence maybe fear is not the

3323
01:49:20,158 --> 01:49:25,679
right word

3324
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:28,000
is the actual very phenomena that gives

3325
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:30,560
birth to existence like maybe death is

3326
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,560
fundamental like this it just feels like

3327
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,400
freaking out oh

3328
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:36,080
this ride ends

3329
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:37,279
is actually like

3330
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:38,079
the

3331
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:39,599
that's

3332
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:43,118
that's the thing that gives birth to

3333
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:45,440
this this whole thing yeah that like

3334
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:48,079
it's constantly

3335
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:49,678
is matter constantly freaking out about

3336
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:51,599
the fact that it's good enough no i

3337
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:53,520
think i think things like to exist i

3338
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:56,719
think they want to exist yeah there's a

3339
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:58,159
there's a desire whatever to exist yeah

3340
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:00,480
and there's a drive to exist and there's

3341
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:02,960
a drive for more things to exist i guess

3342
01:50:00,479 --> 01:50:06,079
um yeah i would like to i like existing

3343
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:08,880
i like i like i like it a lot um

3344
01:50:06,079 --> 01:50:11,359
and i don't know it any other way

3345
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:13,760
but see i don't even know if i like

3346
01:50:11,359 --> 01:50:17,198
existing i think i really don't like not

3347
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:18,239
existing yes yeah that's you

3348
01:50:17,198 --> 01:50:19,678
uh yeah

3349
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:21,759
yeah maybe it's that i

3350
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,639
some days i you know i might like

3351
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:26,639
existing less than others but

3352
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:28,639
yes but like i think those are like

3353
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:30,000
surface feelings there is yeah it seems

3354
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:31,920
like there's something fundamental about

3355
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,800
wanting to exist no i think that's right

3356
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,840
but i

3357
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,760
but i think

3358
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:37,599
to your point that that might go back to

3359
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:39,520
the more fundamental

3360
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:41,279
idea that you know if life is the

3361
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:43,280
physics of existence and maximizing

3362
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:45,439
existence individual organisms of course

3363
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:47,519
want to maximize their existence

3364
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:49,279
and everything you know like wants to

3365
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:50,560
exist but i guess for me the small

3366
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:54,399
comfort is

3367
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:56,560
my existence matters to future existence

3368
01:50:54,399 --> 01:50:59,439
speaking of future existence is there

3369
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,800
advice you can give to future pockets of

3370
01:50:59,439 --> 01:51:03,198
existences

3371
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:05,520
aka young people

3372
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:07,919
about life you've had uh

3373
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:09,280
you've worn many hats you've taken on

3374
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,239
some of the biggest problems in the

3375
01:51:09,279 --> 01:51:16,079
universe is there advice you can give to

3376
01:51:12,238 --> 01:51:18,399
young people about life about career

3377
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:20,719
about existing

3378
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:23,039
uh maybe not about the last one

3379
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:24,880
um you know a lot of people ask me this

3380
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:26,719
question about like like working on such

3381
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:28,400
hard problems like how can you make a

3382
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:29,760
successful career out of that but i

3383
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:32,479
think for me

3384
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:34,159
it couldn't be otherwise like i have to

3385
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:35,759
to be fulfilled you have to work on

3386
01:51:34,158 --> 01:51:38,079
things you care about and that's always

3387
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:40,159
kind of driven me and that's been

3388
01:51:38,079 --> 01:51:41,198
disciplined department

3389
01:51:40,158 --> 01:51:42,000
um

3390
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:44,158
uh

3391
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,238
and sort of superficial level problem

3392
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:48,319
independent because i'm i

3393
01:51:46,238 --> 01:51:50,158
i started at community college actually

3394
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:51,198
and i was taking a physics class and i

3395
01:51:50,158 --> 01:51:53,519
learned about

3396
01:51:51,198 --> 01:51:54,719
uh you know magnetic monopoles and they

3397
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,480
we didn't know if they existed in the

3398
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:58,158
universe and but we could predict them

3399
01:51:56,479 --> 01:51:59,678
and we could go look for them and i was

3400
01:51:58,158 --> 01:52:01,439
so deeply intrigued by this idea that we

3401
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:02,880
had this mathematical formula to go look

3402
01:52:01,439 --> 01:52:04,158
for things

3403
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:05,599
and then i wanted to become a

3404
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:07,198
theoretical physicist because of that

3405
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:09,279
but that actually wasn't my driving

3406
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:10,079
question i realized my driving question

3407
01:52:09,279 --> 01:52:11,679
is

3408
01:52:10,079 --> 01:52:13,279
the nature of the correspondence between

3409
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:14,319
our minds and physical reality and what

3410
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:15,359
we are

3411
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:16,799
and

3412
01:52:15,359 --> 01:52:18,479
that question's very deep so you can

3413
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,599
work across a lot of fields doing that

3414
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:21,519
but i think without that driving

3415
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:23,279
question i never would have been able to

3416
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:25,679
do all the things that i've done it's

3417
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:27,279
really the passion that drives it and i

3418
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:30,079
and usually when when students ask me

3419
01:52:27,279 --> 01:52:31,920
these kind of questions i i tell them

3420
01:52:30,079 --> 01:52:33,840
like you have to find something you

3421
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:35,760
really care about working on because if

3422
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,840
you don't really care about it a you're

3423
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:39,440
not going to be your best at it

3424
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:40,800
and b it's not going to be worth your

3425
01:52:39,439 --> 01:52:41,839
time why would you spend your time

3426
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,159
working on something you're not

3427
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:45,920
interested in so find the driving

3428
01:52:44,158 --> 01:52:47,920
questions yeah find the driving question

3429
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,760
find your your passion i mean i think

3430
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,199
passion makes a huge difference in terms

3431
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,679
of creativity

3432
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:55,039
talent and potential and also being able

3433
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:57,760
to tolerate all the hard things that

3434
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:59,519
come with any career or life

3435
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:01,920
yeah i've had a bunch of moments in my

3436
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:04,800
life where i've just been captivated by

3437
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:06,880
some beautiful phenomena and i guess

3438
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:08,320
being rigorous about it and asking what

3439
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:11,039
is the question underlying this

3440
01:53:08,319 --> 01:53:14,079
phenomenon phenomena like

3441
01:53:11,039 --> 01:53:16,158
robots bring a smile to my face and yeah

3442
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:18,559
that's cool forming a

3443
01:53:16,158 --> 01:53:20,960
question of like why the hell is this so

3444
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:23,199
fascinating yeah why is this uh

3445
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:25,520
specifically the human robot

3446
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:27,039
interaction question that's something

3447
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,800
beautiful

3448
01:53:27,039 --> 01:53:30,719
is brought to life when humans and

3449
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:33,520
robots interact

3450
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:35,520
understanding that deeply yeah

3451
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:37,119
it's like okay so this is going to be my

3452
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:38,639
life work then i don't know what the

3453
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:39,519
hell it is but that that's what i want

3454
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:41,599
to do

3455
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:43,119
interesting and doing that doing that

3456
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:45,279
for whatever the hell gives you that

3457
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:46,319
kind of feeling i guess is the point

3458
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:48,319
yeah

3459
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:49,679
am i allowed to ask you a question sure

3460
01:53:48,319 --> 01:53:52,639
okay um

3461
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:53,920
on that point because i like um at this

3462
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:56,000
colleague that suggests the idea that

3463
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:58,158
like consciousness might be contagious

3464
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,238
and so interacting with things you know

3465
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:02,000
isn't it no yeah it's an interesting

3466
01:54:00,238 --> 01:54:03,198
idea right so i'm i'm wondering like

3467
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,719
sort of

3468
01:54:03,198 --> 01:54:06,719
you know the motivation there is it the

3469
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:08,480
motivation that you want

3470
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:10,079
more of the universe

3471
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:11,759
to appreciate

3472
01:54:10,079 --> 01:54:14,559
things the way we do and appreciate

3473
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,000
those interactions or is it really more

3474
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:18,080
the enjoyment of the human in those

3475
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,198
interactions like is it

3476
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:20,479
is it

3477
01:54:19,198 --> 01:54:22,960
i don't do you know what i'm asking yeah

3478
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:26,399
yeah see i think consciousness is

3479
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:28,158
created in the interaction between

3480
01:54:26,399 --> 01:54:30,319
yes things yes

3481
01:54:28,158 --> 01:54:32,879
so the joy is in the creation of

3482
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:35,039
consciousness and i see i really

3483
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:37,039
like the idea that

3484
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:38,880
it doesn't

3485
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:41,118
just have to be two humans creating

3486
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:43,679
costumes together it could be

3487
01:54:41,118 --> 01:54:45,759
humans and other entities yeah we talked

3488
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:47,599
offline about dogs and other pets and so

3489
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:48,960
on there's a magic i mean i've been

3490
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:50,960
calling it

3491
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:53,118
love is

3492
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:55,520
this beauty of the human experience

3493
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:58,158
that's created and it just feels like

3494
01:54:55,520 --> 01:55:02,840
fascinating that you could do that

3495
01:54:58,158 --> 01:55:06,079
with a robotic system right and

3496
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:08,079
right there's something really powerful

3497
01:55:06,079 --> 01:55:10,479
at least to me about

3498
01:55:08,079 --> 01:55:12,000
engineering systems that allow you to

3499
01:55:10,479 --> 01:55:13,359
create some of the magic of the human

3500
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,560
experience because then you get to

3501
01:55:13,359 --> 01:55:17,118
understand

3502
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:19,520
what it takes at least get inklings of

3503
01:55:17,118 --> 01:55:22,319
what it takes to uh

3504
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:23,920
to to create consciousness and i i don't

3505
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:25,359
get this um

3506
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:27,279
you know philosophers get really upset

3507
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:28,880
about this idea that sort of

3508
01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:30,719
the illusion of consciousness is

3509
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:32,719
consciousness but

3510
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:35,439
i really like the idea of engineering

3511
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:37,840
systems that fool you

3512
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:40,079
into thinking they're conscious right

3513
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:42,560
because that's sufficient to create the

3514
01:55:40,079 --> 01:55:43,679
magical experience right because it's

3515
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:46,639
the interaction yeah it's the

3516
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:48,158
interaction yeah right and this is the

3517
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:49,118
russian head i wear which is like i

3518
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:50,960
think

3519
01:55:49,118 --> 01:55:53,359
i think there's an ocean of loneliness

3520
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:55,920
in the world i think we're deeply lonely

3521
01:55:53,359 --> 01:55:57,839
we're not even allowing ourselves to

3522
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:00,480
acknowledge that and i kind of think

3523
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:01,920
that's what love is between romantic

3524
01:56:00,479 --> 01:56:04,718
love and friendship

3525
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,760
is two people kind of getting a little

3526
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:07,039
bit

3527
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:11,280
like

3528
01:56:07,039 --> 01:56:13,679
like uh alleviating for a brief moment

3529
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:16,559
that loneliness that loneliness but not

3530
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:18,319
but we're not they're it's not the full

3531
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:20,320
aspect of that loneliness like we're

3532
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:23,679
desperately alone we're desperately

3533
01:56:20,319 --> 01:56:26,158
afraid of not existing right i have that

3534
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:29,199
kind of sense and i just want to explore

3535
01:56:26,158 --> 01:56:31,679
that ocean of loneliness more right

3536
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:33,678
like create a submarine that goes into

3537
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:35,840
the depth of that loneliness

3538
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:38,560
so creating systems that can truly hear

3539
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:41,119
you right truly listen make the universe

3540
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:43,440
a less lonely place exactly uh let me

3541
01:56:41,118 --> 01:56:46,479
ask you about uh the meaning you've

3542
01:56:43,439 --> 01:56:48,719
brought up why yeah the physics of why

3543
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:49,919
what do you think is the meaning of our

3544
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:51,118
particular

3545
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:53,920
planets

3546
01:56:51,118 --> 01:56:55,359
set of existences and uh the universe in

3547
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:58,000
general

3548
01:56:55,359 --> 01:56:59,439
um the meaning of life yes someone once

3549
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,599
told me as a physicist i'm not allowed

3550
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:02,799
to ask why questions but i don't believe

3551
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:04,079
that so

3552
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:05,440
um

3553
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:06,639
i think

3554
01:57:05,439 --> 01:57:09,118
i think

3555
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:11,039
what we are is

3556
01:57:09,118 --> 01:57:13,439
the creative process in the universe i

3557
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:16,880
think and i for me that's the meaning

3558
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:18,799
um the ability to yeah to create

3559
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,400
more possibilities and more things to

3560
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:22,320
exist

3561
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:24,238
how what what is uh

3562
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:26,799
dostoevsky has the saying beauty will

3563
01:57:24,238 --> 01:57:30,479
save the the world

3564
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:33,199
what is uh is there a connection between

3565
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:34,959
creation and beauty

3566
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:36,238
i think so

3567
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,560
so is that like

3568
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:41,198
are they is his beauty a correlate of

3569
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:43,280
creation it might be i don't know um i

3570
01:57:41,198 --> 01:57:44,319
mean why is it i you know

3571
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:45,840
a lot of people have asked these kind of

3572
01:57:44,319 --> 01:57:47,519
questions but like why is it we have

3573
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:49,840
such an emotional response to

3574
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:51,599
intellectual activity or creativity

3575
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:53,279
um and that seems kind of a deep

3576
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:54,960
question to me like it seems very

3577
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:56,639
intrinsic to

3578
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,840
what we are so i

3579
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:59,840
i do

3580
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,440
have an interest in the questions i ask

3581
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:04,159
because i think they're beautiful and i

3582
01:58:01,439 --> 01:58:06,638
think the universe is beautiful and

3583
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:08,719
um i'm just so deeply fascinated by the

3584
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:10,400
fact that i exist at all

3585
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:13,198
um

3586
01:58:10,399 --> 01:58:15,198
and so maybe maybe it's that

3587
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:17,359
you know that that intrinsic feeling of

3588
01:58:15,198 --> 01:58:19,118
beauty that's in part driving you know

3589
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:22,079
the physics of creating more things so

3590
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:23,679
they could be deeply related in that way

3591
01:58:22,079 --> 01:58:26,559
well i don't think there's a better way

3592
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:29,279
to end it i think this conversation was

3593
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:31,119
beautiful thank you so much for uh

3594
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:33,519
wasting all your valuable time with me

3595
01:58:31,118 --> 01:58:35,279
today i really really appreciated sarah

3596
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:37,520
this is an honor i hope we get a chance

3597
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:39,039
to talk again i hope uh like i mentioned

3598
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:42,880
to you offline we get a chance to talk

3599
01:58:39,039 --> 01:58:45,039
with lee you guys have a beautiful um

3600
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:46,560
like intellectual chemistry that's

3601
01:58:45,039 --> 01:58:48,560
fascinating to listen to so i'm a huge

3602
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,480
fan of both of you and i can't wait to

3603
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:53,039
see what you do next thanks so much

3604
01:58:50,479 --> 01:58:54,079
great to be here

3605

in three words i can sum up everything

3615
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:17,119
i've learned about life
