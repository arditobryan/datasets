00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,878
john le his second time in the

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,679
podcast he is the chief ai scientist at

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:13,919
meta formerly facebook professor at nyu

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,000
touring award winner one of the seminal

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,480
figures in the history of machine

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,800
learning and artificial intelligence

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,600
and someone who is brilliant and

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,920
opinionated in the best kind of way and

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,000
so is always fun to talk to

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,840
this is a lex friedman podcast to

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,238
support it please check out our sponsors

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:36,000
in the description and now here's my

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:38,320
conversation with yon lacoon

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,719
you co-wrote the article self-supervised

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,520
learning the dark matter of intelligence

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
great title by the way with ishan mizrah

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,480
so let me ask what is self-supervised

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,760
learning and why is it the dark matter

20
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,319
of intelligence

21
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,359
i'll start by the dark matter part

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,600
uh

23
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:59,119
there is obviously a kind of learning

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,600
that humans and animals are

25
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,839
are doing that we currently are not

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,159
reproducing properly with machines with

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
ai right so the most popular approaches

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,320
to machine learning today are

29
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,640
or paradigms i should say are supervised

30
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,039
running and reinforcement learning

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,799
and they are extremely inefficient

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,680
supervised learning requires many

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,759
samples for learning anything

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,759
and reinforcement learning requires a

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
ridiculously large number of

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,959
trials and errors to for you know a

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,959
system to run anything

38
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,799
and that's why we don't have

39
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,719
self-driving cars

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,640
that's a big leap from one to the other

41
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:41,359
okay so that to solve difficult problems

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,280
you have to have a lot of uh human

43
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,118
annotation for supervised learning to

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,640
work and to solve those difficult

45
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:47,840
problems with reinforcement learning you

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,079
have to have

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,680
some way to maybe simulate that problem

48
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:53,279
such that you can do that large scale

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,759
kind of learning that reinforcement

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,239
learning requires right so how is it

51
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,799
that you know most teenagers can learn

52
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,078
to drive a car in about 20 hours of

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,960
practice

54
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,759
whereas uh even with millions of hours

55
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,079
of

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,000
simulated practice a self-driving car

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
can't actually learn to drive itself

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
properly

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,719
um and so obviously we're missing

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,400
something right and it's quite obvious

61
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,919
for a lot of people that

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
you know the immediate response you get

63
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,878
from

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,719
many people is well you know humans use

65
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,759
their background knowledge

66
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,439
to learn faster and they're right

67
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,000
now how was that background knowledge

68
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,000
acquired and that's the big question

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,439
so now you have to ask

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,120
you know how do

71
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,959
babies in the first few months of life

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,640
learn how the world works

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,120
mostly by observation because they can

74
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,479
hardly act in the world

75
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
and they learn an enormous amount of

76
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,280
background knowledge about the world

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
that may be the

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,598
the basis of what we call common sense

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,239
this type of learning

80
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,719
it's not learning a task it's not

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,480
being reinforced for anything it's just

82
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,239
observing the world and figuring out how

83
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,000
it works

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,039
building world models learning world

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,039
models

86
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,719
how do we do this and how do we

87
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,239
reproduce this in in machines so cell

88
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,039
supervision learning

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,878
is

90
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,799
you know one

91
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,959
instance or one attempt at trying to

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,080
reproduce this kind of learning

93
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,400
okay so

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,560
you're looking at just observation so

95
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,560
not even the interacting part of a child

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
it's just sitting there watching mom and

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,158
dad walk around pick up stuff

98
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,079
all of that that's the that's what you

99
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,079
mean by background knowledge perhaps not

100
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
even watching mom and dad just you know

101
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
watching the world go by

102
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,120
just having eyes open or having eyes

103
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,318
closed or the very act of opening and

104
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,158
closing eyes

105
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,958
that the world appears and disappears

106
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:41,280
all that basic information

107
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,959
and you're saying in in order to learn

108
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,719
to drive

109
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,199
like the reason humans are able to learn

110
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,479
to drive quickly some faster than others

111
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,479
is because of the background knowledge

112
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,598
they were able to watch cars operate in

113
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,598
the world

114
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,438
in the many years leading up to it the

115
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,560
physics of basics objects all that kind

116
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,479
of stuff that's right i mean the basic

117
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,840
physics of objects you don't even know

118
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,359
you don't even need to know you know how

119
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,878
a car works right because that you can

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,640
learn fairly quickly i mean the example

121
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,560
i use very often is uh you're driving

122
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,518
next to a cliff

123
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,280
and you know in advance because of your

124
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,200
you know understanding of intuitive

125
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
physics that if you turn the wheel to

126
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,560
the right the car will veer to the right

127
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,079
we'll run off the cliff

128
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,759
fall off the cliff and nothing good will

129
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,240
come out of this right

130
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,160
um but if you are a sort of

131
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,918
you know tabularized reinforcement

132
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
learning system that doesn't have a

133
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,839
model of the world

134
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,439
you have to repeat falling off this

135
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,198
cliff thousands of times before you

136
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,959
figure out it's a bad idea and then a

137
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,280
few more thousand times before you

138
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,959
figure out how to not do it and then a

139
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,478
few more million times before you figure

140
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,399
out how to not do it in every situation

141
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,959
you ever encounter

142
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,839
so self-supervised learning still has to

143
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,918
have

144
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,560
some source of truth

145
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,879
being told to it by somebody and is so

146
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,839
you have to figure out a way without

147
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,519
human

148
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,839
assistance or without significant amount

149
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,039
of human assistance to get that truth

150
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,000
from the world

151
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,560
so the mystery there is um

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,079
how much signal is there how much truth

153
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,000
is there that the world gives you

154
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,519
whether it's the human world

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,800
like you watch youtube or something like

156
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,799
that or it's the more natural world

157
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,199
so how much signal is there

158
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,478
so here's the trick there is way more

159
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,478
signal

160
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,639
in sort of a self-supervised setting

161
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,399
than there is in either a supervised or

162
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,120
reinforcement setting

163
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,439
and this is going to my you know analogy

164
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,439
of the cake

165
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,199
the you know low cake as someone has

166
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,800
called it where

167
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,280
when you try to figure out how much

168
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
information you ask the machine to

169
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,719
predict and how much feedback you give

170
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,079
the machine at every trial

171
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,600
in reinforcement learning you give the

172
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,680
machine a single scaler you tell the

173
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
machine you did good you did bad and you

174
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,439
you and you only

175
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,879
tell this to the machine once in a while

176
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,918
when i say you it could be the the

177
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,079
universe telling the machine right

178
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,599
but it's just one scalar so as a

179
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,879
consequence there is you you cannot

180
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,479
possibly learn something very

181
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,439
complicated without many many many

182
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,839
trials where you get many many feedbacks

183
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,519
of this type

184
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:08,719
supervision you you give a few bits to

185
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,038
the machine

186
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,199
at every every sample

187
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,680
let's say you're training a

188
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,919
system on you know recognizing images on

189
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
imagenet there is 1000 categories that a

190
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,918
little less than 10 bits of information

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,680
per sample

192
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,478
but star supervisory here is a setting

193
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,160
you

194
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,079
ideally we don't know how to do this yet

195
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,319
but ideally you would

196
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,800
show a machine a segment of

197
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,240
a video and then stop the video and ask

198
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,199
me ask the machine to predict what's

199
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,199
going to happen next

200
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,719
so you let the machine predict and then

201
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,360
you let time

202
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,919
go by and show the machine what actually

203
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,840
happened and hope the machine will you

204
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,598
know learn to do a better job at

205
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,119
predicting next time around there's a

206
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,038
huge amount of information you give the

207
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,560
machine because it's an entire video

208
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,360
clip

209
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,038
of uh you know of the future after the

210
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,120
video clip you fed it

211
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,800
in the first place so both for language

212
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,399
and for vision

213
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,800
there's a

214
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,959
subtle seemingly trivial construction

215
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,720
but maybe that's representative of what

216
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,758
is required to create intelligence which

217
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,599
is

218
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,840
filling the gap

219
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:16,319
so in the

220
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,239
gaps it

221
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,598
sounds dumb but can you

222
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,360
it's

223
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,918
it is possible you can solve all of

224
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,199
intelligence in this way just for both

225
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,318
language

226
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,759
just

227
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,759
give a sentence

228
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,000
and continue it or give a sentence and

229
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,000
there's a gap in it uh

230
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,598
some words blanked out and you fill in

231
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,800
what words go there

232
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,038
for vision

233
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
you give a sequence of images

234
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,680
and predict what's going to happen next

235
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,280
or you fill in what happened in between

236
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,478
do you think it's possible that

237
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:50,878
formulation alone

238
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,959
as a signal for self-supervised learning

239
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,720
can solve intelligence for vision and

240
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,478
language i think that's our best shot at

241
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,800
the moment um so whether this will take

242
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,240
us all the way to you know human level

243
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
intelligence or something or just cat

244
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,519
level intelligence

245
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,360
uh it's not clear but

246
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,799
among all the possible approaches that

247
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,479
people have proposed i think is our best

248
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,360
shot so

249
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,120
i think this idea of uh

250
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,038
an intelligent system filling in the

251
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,199
blanks either

252
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,240
you know predicting the future inferring

253
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,478
the past

254
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,720
filling in missing information

255
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,639
uh you know i'm currently filling the

256
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,400
blank of what is behind your head and

257
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,800
what you what your head looks like and

258
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,399
you know from from the back uh because i

259
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,799
have you know basic knowledge about how

260
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,000
humans are made and i don't know if

261
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,038
you're gonna you know what are you gonna

262
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,158
say at which point you're gonna speak

263
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,439
whether you're gonna move your head this

264
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,278
way or that way which way you're gonna

265
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,200
look but i know you're not gonna just

266
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,080
dematerialize and reappear three meters

267
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,278
uh

268
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,360
down the hall uh you know because i know

269
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,200
what's possible and what's impossible uh

270
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,720
according to into the physics so you

271
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,920
have a model of what's possible what's

272
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,680
impossible and then you'd be very

273
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,759
surprised if it happens and then you'll

274
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,199
have to reconstruct your model

275
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,200
right so that that's the model of the

276
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,800
world it's what tells you you know what

277
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,320
fills in the blanks so given your

278
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,079
partial information

279
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,519
about the state of the world given by

280
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,920
your perception

281
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,919
uh your your model of the world fills in

282
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,599
the missing information and that

283
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,079
includes predicting the future

284
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,600
retrodicting the past uh you know

285
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,278
filling in things you don't immediately

286
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,639
perceive and that doesn't have to be

287
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,360
purely

288
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,759
generic vision or visual information or

289
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,440
generic language you can go to specifics

290
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,799
like

291
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,320
predicting

292
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,759
what control decision you make when

293
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,519
you're driving in a lane you have a

294
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,799
sequence of images from a vehicle

295
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,120
and then you could

296
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,838
you have information if you recorded on

297
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,240
video where the car ended up going so

298
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,080
you can go back in time and predict what

299
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,000
the car went based on the visual

300
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,360
information that's very specific domain

301
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,039
specific

302
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,360
right but the question is whether we can

303
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,039
come up with sort of a generic

304
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,759
uh method

305
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,278
for

306
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,958
you know training machines to do this

307
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,439
kind of prediction or filling in the

308
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,838
blanks so right now

309
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,079
uh this type of approach has been

310
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,320
unbelievably successful in the context

311
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,759
of natural language processing uh every

312
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
modern natural language processing is

313
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,078
pre-trained in self-supervised manner

314
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,439
to fill in the blanks to you you show it

315
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:16,958
a sequence of words you remove 10

316
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,480
percent of them and then you train some

317
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,759
gigantic neural net to predict the words

318
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,159
that are missing

319
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:24,240
that and once you've pre-trained that

320
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,719
network you can use the

321
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,839
internal representation learn by it as

322
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
input to

323
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,720
you know

324
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,720
something that you train supervised or

325
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,959
whatever that's been incredibly

326
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,440
successful not so successful in images

327
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,559
although it's making progress

328
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,720
and uh and it's based on uh sort of

329
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,799
manual data augmentation uh we can go

330
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,360
into this later but what has not been

331
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,278
successful yet is training for video so

332
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,360
getting a machine to learn to represent

333
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,439
the visual world for example

334
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,600
by just watching video nobody has really

335
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
succeeded in doing this okay well let's

336
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,079
kind of give a high level overview

337
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,200
what's the difference in

338
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,039
kind

339
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,040
and in difficulty between vision and

340
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,599
language so you said

341
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,519
people haven't been able to

342
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,440
really kind of crack the problem of

343
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,679
vision open in terms of self-supervised

344
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
learning but that may not be necessarily

345
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,278
because it's fundamentally more

346
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,159
difficult maybe like when we're talking

347
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,240
about achieving like passing

348
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,000
the turing test and the full spirit of

349
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,759
the turing test in language might be

350
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,240
harder than vision that's that's not

351
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,278
obvious so what in your view which is

352
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,959
harder

353
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,039
or perhaps are they just the same

354
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,799
problem when uh

355
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,480
the farther we get to solving each the

356
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,799
more we realize it's all the same thing

357
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,320
it's all the same cake i think

358
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,879
what i'm looking for are methods that

359
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,800
make make them look essentially like the

360
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,240
same cake but currently they're not and

361
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,039
the main issue

362
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,639
with

363
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,078
learning water models or learning

364
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,000
predictive models

365
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,879
is that

366
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,679
the prediction is never a single

367
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,759
thing

368
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,120
because the world is not entirely

369
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,639
predictable

370
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,759
it may be deterministic or stochastic we

371
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,480
can get into the philosophical

372
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,759
discussion about it but uh but even if

373
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,278
it's deterministic it's not entirely

374
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,720
predictable

375
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,639
and so

376
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,560
if i play

377
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,000
a short video clip and then i ask you to

378
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,359
predict what's going to happen next

379
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,600
there's many many plausible

380
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,879
continuations for that

381
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,920
video clip and the number of

382
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,439
continuation grows with the

383
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,319
interval of time that you're asking the

384
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,440
system to make a prediction uh for

385
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,079
and so

386
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,800
one big question with supervision is how

387
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,479
you

388
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,599
represent this uncertainty how you

389
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,360
represent

390
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
multiple discrete outcomes how you

391
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,278
represent a sort of continuum of

392
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,560
possible outcomes

393
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,720
etc and you know if you are a

394
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,399
sort of a classical machine learning

395
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,040
person you say oh you just represent a

396
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,120
distribution right

397
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,719
and that we know how to do

398
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
when we're predicting words missing

399
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,399
words in the text because

400
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,479
uh you can have a neural net give a

401
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,000
score for every word in a dictionary

402
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,120
it's a big you know it's a big list of

403
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,958
numbers you know maybe a hundred

404
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,879
thousand or so and you can turn them

405
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,719
into a probability distribution that

406
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,439
gives that tells you when i say a

407
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,600
sentence you know the

408
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,800
you know the cat is chasing the blank in

409
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
the kitchen

410
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,559
you know there are only a few words that

411
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,639
make sense there you know it could be a

412
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,399
mouse or it could be a laser spot or you

413
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,440
know something like that right

414
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,159
uh

415
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,839
and and if i if i say the the blank is

416
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,679
changing the blank in the savannah you

417
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,519
also have a bunch of plausible options

418
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,919
for those two words right

419
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,600
um that that because you you have kind

420
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,958
of a you know underlying reality that

421
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,959
you can refer to to sort of fill in

422
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,000
those those blanks

423
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,518
um

424
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,919
so

425
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,919
you cannot say for sure in the savannah

426
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,319
if it's a you know a lion or cheetah or

427
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,519
whatever you cannot know if it's a

428
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,240
zebra or

429
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,480
glue or you know whatever wildebeest the

430
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,120
same thing um

431
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,879
but uh

432
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,679
but you can represent the uncertainty by

433
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,360
just a long list of numbers now

434
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,439
if i uh if i do the same thing with

435
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,919
video and i ask you to predict a video

436
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,720
clip it's not a discrete set of

437
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,319
potential frames you have to have

438
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,079
somewhere representing a sort of

439
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,360
infinite number of plausible

440
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,599
continuations

441
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,839
of multiple frames in a you know high

442
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,079
dimensional continuous space and we just

443
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,720
have no idea how to do this properly

444
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,078
uh finite high dimensional

445
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,240
so like you because it's fine

446
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:28,719
dimensional yes just like the words i

447
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,720
try to get it to uh

448
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,399
down to a small finite set of like under

449
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
a million something like that something

450
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,039
like that i mean it's kind of ridiculous

451
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,919
that

452
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,599
we're

453
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,799
doing a distribution over every single

454
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,399
possible word for language and it works

455
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,759
it feels like that's a really dumb way

456
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,799
to do it

457
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,360
um like there seems to there seems to be

458
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,039
like there should be some more

459
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,199
compressed representation of the

460
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,360
distribution of the words you're right

461
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,519
about that and so i agree do you have

462
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,039
any interesting ideas about how to

463
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,720
represent all the reality in a

464
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,159
compressed way such you can form a

465
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,600
distribution over it that's one of the

466
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,600
big questions you know how do you do

467
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,120
that right i mean what's what's kind of

468
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,480
you know another thing that that really

469
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,879
is

470
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,879
stupid about um i shouldn't say stupid

471
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,439
but like simplistic about current

472
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,278
approaches to cell supervision in in uh

473
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,839
nlp in text

474
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,919
is that not only do you represent a

475
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,760
giant distribution over words but for

476
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,879
multiple words that are missing those

477
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,078
distributions are essentially

478
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,240
independent of each other

479
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,399
and you know you don't pay too much of a

480
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,320
price for this so you you so you can't

481
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,919
so the you know the system

482
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,600
you know in the the the sentence that i

483
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,439
gave earlier

484
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,839
if he gives a certain probability for a

485
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,600
lion and and uh cheetah and then a

486
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,880
certain probability for

487
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,879
uh you know gazelle uh wildebeest and

488
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,759
and and zebra

489
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,000
uh

490
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,440
those two probabilities are independent

491
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,198
of each other

492
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,639
uh and it's not the case that those

493
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:00,799
things are independent lions actually

494
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,159
attack like bigger animals than than she

495
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,599
does so

496
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:06,639
you know there's a huge independence

497
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,480
hypothesis in in this process which is

498
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,680
not actually true the reason for this is

499
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,039
that we don't know how to represent uh

500
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,078
properly distributions over

501
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:18,000
combinatorial uh sequences of symbols

502
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,519
essentially whenever because the number

503
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,120
goes exponentially with the length of

504
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,639
the of the symbols

505
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,879
and so we have to use tricks for this

506
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,959
but um those techniques can

507
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,799
you know get around like don't even deal

508
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,879
with it so

509
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,198
so the big question is like would there

510
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,439
be some sort of abstract

511
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,879
latent representation of text

512
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,040
that would say that

513
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,559
you know when i when i switch

514
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,439
lion for gazelle

515
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,359
lion for cheetah i also have to switch

516
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,639
zebra for gazelle

517
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,879
yeah so

518
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,720
this independence assumption let me

519
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,799
throw some criticism at you that i often

520
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,959
hear and see how you respond

521
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,958
so this kind of filling in the blanks is

522
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,799
just statistics you're not learning

523
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,679
anything

524
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:04,959
like the deep underlying concepts you're

525
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:07,198
just mimicking stuff from

526
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,558
the past you're not learning anything

527
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,839
new such that you can use it to

528
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,599
generalize about the world

529
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,078
or okay let me just say the crude

530
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,558
version which is it's just statistics

531
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,240
it's not intelligence uh what do you

532
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,599
have to say to that what do you usually

533
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,279
say to that if you kind of hear this

534
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,958
kind of thing i don't get into those

535
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,838
discussions because they are they're

536
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,440
kind of pointless um so first of all

537
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,279
it's quite possible that intelligence is

538
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,000
just statistics it's just statistics of

539
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,839
a particular kind yes uh where this is

540
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,640
the philosophical question it's kind of

541
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,399
is

542
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,440
is intel is it possible that

543
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,320
intelligence is just statistics yeah

544
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,038
but what kind of statistics so

545
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,960
uh if you are asking the question

546
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,879
are the model of the world the models of

547
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,279
the world that we learn um do they have

548
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,280
some notion of causality yes

549
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,319
so if the criticism comes from people

550
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,160
who say

551
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,759
you know current machine learning system

552
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,798
don't care about causality which by the

553
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,919
way is wrong

554
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,599
uh

555
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,280
you know i agree with them yeah you

556
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,678
should you know your model of the world

557
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,960
should have your actions as one of your

558
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,559
of the inputs

559
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,558
and that will drive you to learn causal

560
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,720
models of the world where you know what

561
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,879
you know what uh intervention in the

562
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,960
world will cause what results or you can

563
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,120
do this by observation of other agents

564
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,319
uh acting in the world and and observing

565
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,079
the effect

566
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:28,240
uh other humans for example so i think

567
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,720
you know at some level of description uh

568
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,120
intelligence is just statistics

569
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,038
uh but that doesn't mean you don't you

570
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,678
don't you know you won't have models

571
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,599
that have you know deep mechanistic

572
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,600
explanation for what goes on

573
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,639
uh the question is how do you learn them

574
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,839
that's that's the question i'm

575
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,360
interested in

576
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,199
uh because

577
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,359
you know a lot of people who actually

578
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,279
voice their criticism

579
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,639
say that those mechanistic model has to

580
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,000
have to come from someplace else they

581
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,320
have to come from human designers they

582
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,119
have to come from i don't know what and

583
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:00,639
obviously we learn them

584
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,038
or if we don't learn them as an

585
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,520
individual nature

586
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:07,200
learn them for us using evolution so

587
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,160
regardless of what you think those

588
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,798
processes have been learned somehow

589
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,558
so if you look at the the human brain

590
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,240
just like when we humans introspect

591
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,798
about how the brain works

592
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,279
it seems like when we think about what

593
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,960
is intelligence we think about

594
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,558
the high level stuff like the models

595
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,240
we've constructed concepts like

596
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,359
cognitive science like concepts of

597
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,679
memory

598
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,599
and reasoning module almost like these

599
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,280
high-level modules

600
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,279
is there's is this service a good

601
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,759
analogy

602
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,678
like are we ignoring

603
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,599
the uh

604
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,759
the dark matter the

605
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,359
the basic low-level mechanisms just like

606
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,519
we ignore the way the operating system

607
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,678
works we're just using the

608
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,119
uh the the high-level software we're

609
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,640
ignoring that

610
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,319
at the low level

611
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,320
the neural network might be doing

612
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,839
something like statistics

613
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,359
like me

614
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,439
sorry to use this word probably

615
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,199
incorrectly and crudely but doing this

616
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,720
kind of fill in the gap kind of learning

617
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,558
and just kind of updating the model

618
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,279
constantly in order to be able to

619
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,798
support the raw sensory information to

620
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,440
predict it and then adjust to the

621
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,119
prediction when it's wrong but like kyla

622
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,360
when we look at our brain at the high

623
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,038
level it feels like we're doing like

624
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,279
we're playing chess like

625
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,038
we're we're like playing with high level

626
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,639
concepts and we're stitching them

627
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,119
together and we're putting them into

628
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,240
long-term memory but really what's going

629
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,519
underneath

630
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,919
is something we're not able to

631
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,480
introspect which is this kind of

632
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,038
uh simple large neural network that's

633
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,558
just filling in the gaps right well okay

634
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,400
so there's a lot of questions there are

635
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,678
answers there okay so first of all

636
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,600
there's a whole school of thought in

637
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,200
neuroscience computational neuroscience

638
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,599
in particular

639
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,000
that likes the idea of predictive coding

640
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,439
which is really related to the idea i

641
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,720
was talking about in self-supervised

642
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,558
learning so everything is about

643
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,240
prediction the essence of intelligence

644
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,759
is the ability to predict

645
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,038
and everything the brain does is trying

646
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,200
to predict

647
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,359
uh predict everything from everything

648
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,080
else okay and that's really sort of the

649
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,240
underlying principle if you want that

650
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,079
uh cell supervisor learning is trying to

651
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,759
kind of reproduce this idea of

652
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,038
prediction that's kind of an essential

653
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,839
mechanism

654
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,158
of

655
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,319
task independent learning if you want

656
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,440
the next step is

657
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,158
what kind of intelligence are you

658
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,679
interested in reproducing and of course

659
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,280
you know we all think about you know

660
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,240
trying to reproduce sort of you know

661
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,918
high-level cognitive processes in humans

662
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,440
but like with machines we're not even at

663
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,200
the level of

664
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,159
even reproducing the

665
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,000
learning processes in a in a cat brain

666
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,760
um you know the most intelligent or

667
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,200
intelligent systems don't don't have as

668
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,440
much common sense as as a house cat

669
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,360
so um how is it that cats learn and you

670
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,798
know cats don't do a whole lot of uh

671
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,038
reasoning they certainly have causal

672
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,200
models they certainly have

673
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,558
uh because you know many cats can figure

674
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,038
out like how they can act on the world

675
00:21:54,558 --> 00:22:00,480
to get what they want um they certainly

676
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:03,200
have uh a fantastic model of intuitive

677
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,960
physics uh certainly of the the the

678
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,558
dynamics of their own bodies but but

679
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,759
also of praise and things like that

680
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,000
right so

681
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,679
um they they're they're pretty smart

682
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,519
they only do this with about 800 million

683
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,640
neurons

684
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,599
we are not anywhere close to reproducing

685
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,240
this kind of

686
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,199
thing so to some extent i could i could

687
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,519
say

688
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,159
let's not even worry about like the high

689
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,359
level cognition

690
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,880
and kind of you know long-term planning

691
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,399
and reasoning that humans can do until

692
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,400
we figure out like you know can we even

693
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,600
reproduce what cats are doing

694
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,038
now that said this ability to

695
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,798
learn world models i think is the key to

696
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,960
the possibility of

697
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,400
learning machines that can also reason

698
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,840
so whenever i give a talk i'd say there

699
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,960
are there are three challenges in the

700
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,480
three main challenges in machine

701
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,919
learning the first one is

702
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,679
uh you know getting machines to learn to

703
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,640
represent the world

704
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,400
and proposing salt supervised running

705
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,400
the second is

706
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,240
getting machines to reason in ways that

707
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,519
are compatible with

708
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,720
essentially gradient-based learning

709
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,119
because this is what deep learning is

710
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,640
all about really

711
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,158
and the third one is something we have

712
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,440
no idea how to solve at least i have no

713
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,200
idea to solve

714
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,640
is uh

715
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,120
can we get machines to learn

716
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,880
hierarchical representations of action

717
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,319
plans

718
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
you know like you know we know how to

719
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,839
train them to learn hierarchical

720
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,639
representations of

721
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:23,759
perception you know with computational

722
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,000
nets and things like that and

723
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,000
transformers but what about action plans

724
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,759
can we uh get them to spontaneously

725
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,319
learn good hierarchical representations

726
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,640
of actions also gradient based

727
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,319
yeah all of that you know needs to be

728
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,559
somewhat differentiable so that you can

729
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,839
apply sort of gradient-based learning uh

730
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,000
which is really what deep learning is

731
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,319
about

732
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,200
so it's background

733
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,200
knowledge ability to reason in a way

734
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,679
this differentiable that

735
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:55,839
is somehow connected deeply integrated

736
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,519
with that background knowledge or builds

737
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,119
on top of that background knowledge and

738
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,519
then given that background knowledge be

739
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:04,479
able to make hierarchical plans right in

740
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,839
the world so if if you take classical

741
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,759
optimal control there's something in

742
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,639
classical optimal control called

743
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:10,400
uh

744
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,159
model predictive control

745
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,679
and it's you know it's been around since

746
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,679
the early 60s

747
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,759
nasa uses that to compute trajectories

748
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,480
of rockets and the basic idea is that

749
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,319
you have a pretty predictive model

750
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,360
of the rocket let's say or whatever

751
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,240
system you are you intend to control

752
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,240
which

753
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,919
given the state of the system at time t

754
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,240
and given an action

755
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,480
that you're taking the system so for

756
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,079
rocket to be thrust and you know all the

757
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,759
controls you can have

758
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,599
uh it gives you the state of the system

759
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:40,879
at time t plus delta t right so

760
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,639
basically a differential equation

761
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,159
something like that

762
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,159
um

763
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,200
and if you have this model and you have

764
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,278
this model

765
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,600
in the form of some sort of neural net

766
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,440
or some sort of uh set of formula that

767
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,399
you can back propagate gradient through

768
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,960
you can do what's called model

769
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,679
predictive control or gradient based

770
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,038
uh model predictive control so you have

771
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,840
uh you can unroll that

772
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:08,079
that model in time you you

773
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,959
you you feel it a

774
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:13,119
hypothesized sequence of actions

775
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,120
and then you have some objective

776
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,798
function that measures how well at the

777
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,399
end of the trajectory the system has

778
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:19,200
succeeded or matched what you wanted to

779
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,360
do

780
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,440
um you know is it a robot harm have you

781
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,759
grasped the object you want to grasp if

782
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,440
it's a rocket you know are you at the

783
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,960
right place near the space station

784
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,880
things like that

785
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,960
and by back propagation through time and

786
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,039
again this was invented in the 1960s by

787
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,519
optimal control theorists

788
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,558
you can figure out uh what is the

789
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:43,119
optimal sequence of actions that will

790
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,038
you know get my system to the the best

791
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,239
final state

792
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,599
so

793
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,759
that's a form of reasoning it's

794
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,278
basically planning and a lot of planning

795
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,798
uh systems in robotics are actually

796
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,480
based on this

797
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:55,679
and uh

798
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
and you can think of this as a form of

799
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,880
reasoning so

800
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,278
you know to take the example of the

801
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,799
teenager driving a car again you have a

802
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,240
pretty good dynamical model of the car

803
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,158
it doesn't need to be very accurate but

804
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,599
you know again that if you

805
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,039
turn the wheel to the right and there is

806
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,158
a cliff you're gonna run off the cliff

807
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:11,919
right you don't need to have a very

808
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,679
accurate model to predict that

809
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,919
and you can run this in your mind and

810
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,440
decide not to do it for that reason

811
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,880
because you can predict in advance that

812
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,960
the result is going to be bad so you can

813
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,120
sort of imagine different scenarios

814
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,720
and and then you know employ

815
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,479
uh or take the first step in the

816
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,839
scenario that is most favorable and then

817
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,839
repeat the process of planning that's

818
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,199
called receding horizon model predictive

819
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,599
control so even you know all those

820
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,679
things have names you know uh going back

821
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,879
you know decades um

822
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,200
and so

823
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,640
if you're not not uh you know classical

824
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,640
optimal control the model of the world

825
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,240
is not generally learned

826
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,600
uh there's you know sometimes a few

827
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,759
parameters you have to identify that's

828
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,359
called systems identification but

829
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,879
uh but generally

830
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,879
the model is

831
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,760
mostly deterministic and mostly built by

832
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,360
hand so the big question of ai

833
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,919
i think the big challenge of ai for the

834
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,759
next decade is how do we get machines to

835
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,080
learn predictive models of the world

836
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,839
that deal with uncertainty and deal with

837
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,000
the real world in all this complexity so

838
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,079
it's not just the trajectory of a rocket

839
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,759
which you can reduce to first principles

840
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,839
it's not it's not even just a trajectory

841
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,480
of a robot arm which again you can model

842
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,678
by you know careful mathematics but it's

843
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,798
everything else everything you observe

844
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,440
in the world you know people behavior

845
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,679
um you know physical systems that

846
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,960
involve collective phenomena

847
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,278
like water or or you know

848
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,480
trees and you know branches in a tree or

849
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:33,679
something or

850
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,278
or

851
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,559
like complex things that you know humans

852
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,398
have no trouble

853
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,240
developing abstract representations in

854
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,839
predictive model for but we still don't

855
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,558
know how to do with machines where do

856
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:47,199
you put in in these three maybe in the

857
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,558
in the planning stages

858
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,960
the game theoretic nature of this world

859
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,879
where your actions not only respond to

860
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,440
the dynamic nature of the world the

861
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,919
environment but also affected

862
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,120
so if there's other humans involved is

863
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,880
this is this

864
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,398
point number four or is it somehow

865
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,559
integrated into the hierarchical

866
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,558
representation of action in your view i

867
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,240
think it's integrated it's just um it's

868
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:11,839
just that now your model of the world

869
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,759
has to deal with you know it just makes

870
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:16,079
it more complicated right the fact that

871
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,119
uh humans are complicated and not easily

872
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,720
predictable

873
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,239
that makes your model of the world much

874
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,038
more complicated that much more

875
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,200
complicated well there's a chat i mean i

876
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:28,720
suppose chess is an analogy

877
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:32,159
so monte carlo tree search

878
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,960
there's a i go you go i go you go like

879
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,760
um andre kapatha recently gave a talk at

880
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,960
mit about car doors

881
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,759
i think there's some machine learning

882
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,600
too but mostly car doors and there's a

883
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,519
dynamic nature to the cart like the

884
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,959
person opening the door checking

885
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,480
and he wasn't talking about that he was

886
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,480
talking about the perception problem of

887
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,960
what the ontology of what defines a car

888
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,558
door this big philosophical question but

889
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,720
to me it was interesting because like

890
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,319
it's obvious that the person opening the

891
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,079
car doors they're trying to get out like

892
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,359
here in new york trying to get out of

893
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,119
the car

894
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,479
you slowing down is going to signal

895
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,639
something you speeding up is going to

896
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,599
signal something and that's a dance it's

897
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,200
a

898
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:11,839
asynchronous

899
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,880
chess game i don't know

900
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,678
so

901
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,600
i it feels like um

902
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,440
it's not just i mean i guess you can

903
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,639
integrate all of them into one giant

904
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,399
model like the entirety of the the

905
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,840
these little interactions because it's

906
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,678
not as complicated as chess it's just

907
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:29,839
like a little dance we do like a little

908
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,120
dance together and then we figure it out

909
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,678
well in some ways it's way more

910
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:35,839
complicated than chess because uh

911
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,600
because it's continuous it's uncertain

912
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,839
in a continuous manner

913
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,199
uh it doesn't feel more complicated but

914
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,119
it doesn't feel more complicated because

915
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,558
that's what we are we've evolved to

916
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,319
solve this is the kind of problem we've

917
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:47,599
evolved to solve and so we're good at it

918
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,398
because you know

919
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,398
nature has made us good at it

920
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:55,519
nature has not made us good at chess we

921
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:57,599
completely suck at chess yeah um

922
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,240
in fact that's why we designed it as a

923
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,678
game is to be challenging

924
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,079
and if there is something that you know

925
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,480
recent progress in chess and go

926
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,000
has made us realize is that humans are

927
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,240
really terrible at those things like

928
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,960
really bad you know there was a story

929
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,038
right before alphago that uh

930
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,558
uh you know the best go players thought

931
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,480
there were maybe two or three stones

932
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,079
behind you know an ideal player that

933
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,720
they would call god

934
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,199
uh in fact no they are like nine or ten

935
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,919
stones behind i mean we're just bad

936
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,319
so we're not good at and it's because we

937
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,159
have limited uh working memory we we're

938
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:33,759
not very good at like doing this uh tree

939
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,520
exploration that you know computers are

940
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,359
much better

941
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,278
at doing than we are but we are much

942
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:40,398
better at learning differentiable models

943
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,240
of the world

944
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,439
i mean i said differentiable in the kind

945
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,798
of

946
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,159
you know i should say

947
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:47,759
not differentiable in the sense that you

948
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,360
know we went back for up to it but in

949
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:50,480
the sense that

950
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,359
our brain has some mechanism for

951
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,278
estimating gradients uh of some kind

952
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:58,959
yeah and that's what you know makes us

953
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:01,200
uh efficient so if you have an agent

954
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,600
that consists of

955
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,120
a a model of the world which you know in

956
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,079
the human brain is basically the entire

957
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:08,079
front half of your brain

958
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,278
an objective function

959
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,359
which

960
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,440
uh in human in in humans is a

961
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,519
combination of two things there is your

962
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,880
sort of intrinsic motivation module

963
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,240
which is in the basal ganglia you know

964
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,480
at the base of your brain that's the

965
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,599
thing that measures pain and hunger and

966
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,839
things like that like immediate

967
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,839
feelings and emotions

968
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,038
and then there is

969
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,720
you know the equivalent of what people

970
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:35,919
in reform spectrum called a critic which

971
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,919
is a sort of module that predicts ahead

972
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,519
what the outcome

973
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,759
of a uh

974
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,839
of a situation will be

975
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,278
and so it's it's not a cost function but

976
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,439
it's sort of not an objective function

977
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,200
but it's sort of a

978
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,120
you know trained predictor of the

979
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,600
ultimate objective function and that

980
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,959
also is differentiable and so if all of

981
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,519
this is differentiable your cost

982
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,319
function your your critic your

983
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,558
uh

984
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,678
you know your your role model then you

985
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,278
can use

986
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,919
gradient-based type methods to do

987
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,599
planning to the reasoning to do learning

988
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,880
uh you know to do all the things that

989
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:11,759
would like an intelligent agent uh

990
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,159
to do

991
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,240
and the gradient-based learning like

992
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,320
what's your intuition that's probably at

993
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,000
the core of what can solve intelligence

994
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,678
so you don't need

995
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,519
like a

996
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,798
logic based reasoning uh in your view i

997
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,720
don't know how to make logic based

998
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:30,879
reasoning compatible with

999
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,159
efficient learning yeah and

1000
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,919
okay i mean there is a big question

1001
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,559
perhaps a philosophical question i mean

1002
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,320
it's not that philosophical but uh that

1003
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,278
we can ask is is that you know all the

1004
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:41,759
learning

1005
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,119
algorithms we know from engineering and

1006
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,038
computer science

1007
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,398
proceed by optimizing some objective

1008
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,158
function

1009
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,798
yeah right

1010
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,679
so one question we may ask is

1011
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,119
is

1012
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,720
does learning in the brain minimize an

1013
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,278
objective function

1014
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,558
it could be a you know a composite of

1015
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,880
multiple objective functions but it's

1016
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:03,440
still an objective function

1017
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,720
uh second if it does optimize an

1018
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,278
objective function

1019
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,519
does it do does it do it by

1020
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,720
some sort of gradient estimation

1021
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,399
you know it doesn't need to be back prop

1022
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,640
but you know some way of estimating the

1023
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,398
gradient in efficient manner

1024
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,120
whose complexity is on the same order of

1025
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,079
magnitude as you know actually running

1026
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,479
the

1027
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,480
inference

1028
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,000
because you can't afford to do things

1029
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,359
like you know perturbing a weight in

1030
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
your brain to figure out what the effect

1031
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,519
is and then sort of uh you know you can

1032
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,398
do sort of estimating gradient by

1033
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,880
perturbation it's it to me it seems very

1034
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:38,798
imp implausible that the brain uses some

1035
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,278
sort of

1036
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:42,879
you know zeroth order black box gradient

1037
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,278
free optimization

1038
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,799
because it's so much less efficient than

1039
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,119
gradient optimization so it has to have

1040
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,519
a way of estimating gradients

1041
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:54,719
is it possible that some kind of logic

1042
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,200
based reasoning emerges in pockets as a

1043
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,480
useful like you said if the brain is an

1044
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,080
objective function maybe it's a

1045
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,120
mechanism for creating objective

1046
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,839
functions

1047
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:06,398
it's it's a mechanism for

1048
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,799
creating knowledge bases for example

1049
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,319
that can then be queried like maybe it's

1050
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,519
like an efficient representation of

1051
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,119
knowledge that's learned in a

1052
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,119
gradient-based way or something like

1053
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,720
that well so i think there is a lot of

1054
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,399
different types of

1055
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,000
intelligence so first of all i think the

1056
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:21,118
type of logical reasoning that we think

1057
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,719
about

1058
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,639
that we are

1059
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,158
you know maybe stemming from

1060
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,878
you know sort of classical ai of the

1061
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,358
1970s and 80s

1062
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,799
i think humans use that relatively

1063
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,639
rarely

1064
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,440
and are not particularly good at it but

1065
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,480
we judge each other based on our ability

1066
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,800
to uh

1067
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,679
solve those rare problems it's called an

1068
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,119
iq test i think so like i'm i'm not very

1069
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,358
good at chess

1070
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,399
yes i'm judging you this whole time

1071
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,719
because

1072
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,078
well we we actually with your with your

1073
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,358
uh you know heritage i'm sure you're

1074
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,079
good at chess

1075
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,838
no stereotypes not all stereotypes are

1076
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,560
true

1077
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,759
well i'm terrible at chess so um

1078
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,599
you know but i think perhaps uh another

1079
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,560
type of intelligence that i have is this

1080
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,480
uh

1081
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,559
uh you know ability of sort of building

1082
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,480
models of the world from

1083
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,239
uh you know

1084
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,760
reasoning obvious obviously but also

1085
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,118
also data

1086
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,119
and those those models generally are

1087
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,000
more kind of analogical right so it's

1088
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,160
it's

1089
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,838
it's reasoning by simulation

1090
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,519
and by analogy

1091
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,358
where you use one model to apply to a

1092
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,159
new situation even though you've never

1093
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,598
seen that situation you can sort of

1094
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,960
connect it to a situation you've

1095
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,838
encountered before

1096
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,599
uh and and your reasoning is more

1097
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:39,838
you know akin to some sort of internal

1098
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,280
simulation so you you're kind of

1099
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,960
stimulating what's happening when you're

1100
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,119
building i don't know a box out of wood

1101
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,280
or something right you can imagine

1102
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,480
in advance like what would be the result

1103
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,160
of you know cutting the wood in this

1104
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,719
particular way are you going to use you

1105
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,000
know screws on nails or whatever

1106
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,078
when you are interacting with someone

1107
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,119
you also have a model of that person and

1108
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,280
and sort of interact with that person

1109
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,320
you know having this model in mind uh to

1110
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,320
kind of

1111
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,920
uh tell the person what you think is

1112
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,200
useful to them so

1113
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,599
i think this

1114
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,960
this ability to construct most of the

1115
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,559
world is

1116
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,679
basically the essence the essence of

1117
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,239
intelligence

1118
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:19,279
and the ability to use it then to

1119
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:22,959
plan uh actions that will

1120
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,440
uh fulfill a particular criterion

1121
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,199
of course is is necessary as well so i'm

1122
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,358
going to ask you a series of impossible

1123
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,879
questions as we keep asking is that been

1124
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,719
doing so

1125
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,720
so if that's the fundamental sort of

1126
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,959
dark matter of intelligence this ability

1127
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,719
to form a background model what's your

1128
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,280
intuition about

1129
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,039
how much knowledge is required

1130
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,440
you know you know i think dark matter

1131
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,599
you put a percentage

1132
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,838
on it

1133
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,440
of uh the composition of the universe

1134
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:55,440
and how much of it is dark matter how

1135
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:58,079
much of his dark energy how much

1136
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,760
information do you think is required to

1137
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,359
to be a house cat

1138
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,000
so you have to be able to uh when you

1139
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:06,078
see a box going it when you see a human

1140
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,838
compute the most evil action

1141
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,519
if there's a thing that's near an edge

1142
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:10,880
you knock it off

1143
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,800
all of that

1144
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,760
plus the extra stuff you mentioned which

1145
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,760
is a

1146
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,560
great self-awareness of the physics of

1147
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,000
your of your own body and in the world

1148
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,799
how much knowledge is required do you

1149
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,320
think to solve it um i don't even know

1150
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,839
how to measure

1151
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,599
an answer to that question i'm not sure

1152
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:32,159
how to measure it but whatever it is it

1153
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,920
fits in about about 800 000 neurons uh

1154
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,239
800 million neurons or the

1155
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,838
representation does

1156
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,879
everything all knowledge everything

1157
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,838
right

1158
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,838
um

1159
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,759
it was less than a billion a dog is two

1160
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:45,358
billion but a cat is less than one

1161
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,640
billion

1162
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:48,159
and uh

1163
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,799
so multiply that by a thousand and you

1164
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:53,279
get the number of synapses and i think

1165
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,519
almost all of it is is learned through

1166
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,839
this you know a sort of supervised

1167
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,440
running although you know i think a tiny

1168
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:00,719
flavor is learned through reinforcement

1169
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,760
running and certainly very little

1170
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,118
through

1171
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,320
you know classical supervised running

1172
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,559
although it's not even clear how

1173
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,640
supervised learning actually works in uh

1174
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,679
in a biological world

1175
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:14,239
um so i think almost all of it is uh is

1176
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:17,039
self supervision but it's driven

1177
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:19,919
by uh the the sort of ingrained

1178
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,519
objective functions that a cat or human

1179
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,280
have at the base of their brain which

1180
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,400
kind of drives their

1181
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,280
um their behavior so you know nature

1182
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,760
tells us uh you're hungry

1183
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,040
it doesn't tell us how to feed ourselves

1184
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,520
that's that's something that the rest of

1185
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,559
our brain has to figure out right

1186
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,039
well it's interesting because there

1187
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,199
might be more like deeper objective

1188
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,000
functions underlying the whole thing

1189
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,399
so

1190
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,159
hunger may be some kind of

1191
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,240
now you go to like neurobiology it might

1192
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:50,000
be just the brain

1193
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,319
uh

1194
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,719
trying to maintain homeostasis

1195
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,039
so hunger is just one of the

1196
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:59,358
human perceivable

1197
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,440
symptoms of the brain being unhappy with

1198
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,119
the way things are currently right it

1199
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,880
could be just like one really dumb

1200
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,200
objective function at the core but

1201
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,079
that's how that's how behavior is is

1202
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,919
driven uh the the fact that you know the

1203
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,760
orbital ganglia

1204
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,400
uh drive us to do things that are that

1205
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,079
are different from saying a wong tong or

1206
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,920
certainly a cat

1207
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,839
is what makes you know human nature

1208
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,119
versus orangutan nature versus scat

1209
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:24,799
nature

1210
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,519
so for example

1211
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,480
uh you know our basal ganglia drives us

1212
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:30,639
to

1213
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,079
seek the company of

1214
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,239
other humans

1215
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,079
and that's because nature has figured

1216
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,838
out that we need to be social animals

1217
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,519
for our species to survive and it's true

1218
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,119
of many

1219
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:43,039
primates

1220
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,760
it's not true orangutons orangutans are

1221
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:47,599
solitary animals um they don't seek the

1222
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,119
company of others in fact they avoid

1223
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,320
them

1224
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,358
in fact they scream at them when they

1225
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,559
come too close because they're

1226
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,279
territorial

1227
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,960
because for for their survival you know

1228
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,079
uh evolution has figured out that's the

1229
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,679
best thing

1230
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,079
i mean they're occasionally social of

1231
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:04,480
course for you know

1232
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,720
reproduction and stuff like that but um

1233
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,719
but but they're mostly solitary so

1234
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,239
so all of those behaviors are not part

1235
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:11,358
of intelligence you know people say oh

1236
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,399
you're never going to have intelligent

1237
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:14,318
machines because you know human

1238
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,639
intelligence is social but then you look

1239
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:18,559
at orangutans you look at octopus

1240
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,879
octopus never know their parents

1241
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,719
they barely interact with any other and

1242
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,400
and they get to be really smart in less

1243
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,239
than less than a year in like half a

1244
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,760
year

1245
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,639
you know in a year they're adults in two

1246
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,720
years they're dead so

1247
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,719
there are things that we think

1248
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,480
as humans are intimately linked with

1249
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,679
intelligence like

1250
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,240
social interaction like language

1251
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,799
we think i think we give way too much

1252
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,639
importance to language as a substrate of

1253
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,400
intelligence as humans

1254
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:51,358
because we think our reasoning is so

1255
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,760
linked with language so for to solve the

1256
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,519
house cat intelligence problem you think

1257
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,960
you could do it on a desert island you

1258
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,960
could have pretty much you could just

1259
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,720
have a cat sitting there

1260
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,559
um

1261
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:05,759
looking at the waves that the ocean

1262
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,679
weighs and figure a lot of it out it

1263
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,520
needs to have sort of you know the right

1264
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,118
set of drives

1265
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,559
uh to kind of

1266
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,559
you know get it to do the thing and

1267
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,000
learn the appropriate things right but

1268
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,838
uh

1269
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,559
like for example you know

1270
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,318
baby humans are driven to

1271
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,639
learn to stand up and walk

1272
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,318
okay you know it's not that's kind of

1273
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,318
this desire is hard-wired how to do it

1274
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:30,880
precisely is not that's learned

1275
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,719
but the desire to to walk move around

1276
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,800
and stand up

1277
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,399
that's sort of

1278
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,800
probably hardwired it's very simple to

1279
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,760
hardwire this kind of stuff

1280
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,359
oh like the desire to well

1281
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,440
that's interesting you're hardwired to

1282
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,199
want to walk

1283
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,200
that's not a

1284
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,239
there's got to be a deeper need for

1285
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:52,318
walking

1286
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,318
i think it was probably socially imposed

1287
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:56,000
by society that you need to walk all the

1288
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:57,838
other bipedal

1289
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,480
like a lot of simple animals that you

1290
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,799
know would probably work without ever

1291
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,519
watching any other members of the

1292
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,920
species it seems like a scary thing to

1293
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,400
have to do because you suck it by peter

1294
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,838
walking at first it seems crawling is

1295
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,280
much safer

1296
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,519
much more

1297
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,440
like why are you in a hurry

1298
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:20,159
well because because you have this thing

1299
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,159
that drives you to do it you know um

1300
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,759
which is sort of part of uh the sort of

1301
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:28,159
human development is that understood

1302
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,680
actually what not entirely no what is

1303
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:31,519
what's the reason to get on two feet

1304
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,440
it's really hard like most animals don't

1305
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,358
get on two feet well they get on four

1306
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,119
feet you know many mammals get on four

1307
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,400
feet yeah they very quickly some of them

1308
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,039
extremely quickly

1309
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,480
but i don't you know like from the last

1310
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,920
time i've interacted with the table

1311
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,920
that's much more stable than the thing

1312
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,440
then two legs it's just a really hard

1313
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,519
problem yeah how many birds have figured

1314
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,838
it out with two feet

1315
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:53,039
well technically we can go into ontology

1316
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,639
they have four

1317
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,239
i guess they have two feet they have two

1318
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,318
feet chickens

1319
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:01,358
you know dinosaurs had two feet many of

1320
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:03,199
them allegedly

1321
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,598
i'm just now learning that t-rex was

1322
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:07,039
eating grass not other animals t-rex

1323
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,079
might have been a friendly

1324
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:12,400
friendly pet what do you think about uh

1325
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,640
i don't know if you looked at

1326
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,400
the test for general intelligence that

1327
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,239
francois chile put together i don't know

1328
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,519
if you got a chance to look at that kind

1329
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,679
of thing like

1330
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:24,079
what's your intuition about how to solve

1331
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:26,000
like an iq type of test i don't know i

1332
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,079
think it's so outside of my radar screen

1333
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,480
that it's not really

1334
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,760
relevant i think in the short term

1335
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,559
well i guess one way to ask another way

1336
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,839
perhaps more closer to what

1337
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:42,559
to your work is like how do you solve

1338
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:44,239
mnist uh with very little example data

1339
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:45,920
that's right and that's the answer to

1340
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:47,519
this probably is supervised running just

1341
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,559
learn to represent images and then

1342
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:49,280
learning

1343
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,960
uh

1344
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,720
you know to recognize handwritten digits

1345
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,119
on top of this will only require a few

1346
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:58,000
samples and we observe this in humans

1347
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,000
right you you show a young child a

1348
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,760
picture book with a couple pictures of

1349
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
an elephant and that's it

1350
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,079
the child knows what an elephant is and

1351
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,519
we we see this today with practical

1352
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,960
systems that we

1353
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,480
you know we train image recognition

1354
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,358
systems with

1355
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,079
uh

1356
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,679
enormous amounts of of images either

1357
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,079
either completely self-supervised or

1358
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,199
very weakly supervised for example

1359
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,318
you can

1360
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:21,919
train a

1361
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,920
neural net to predict uh whatever

1362
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,200
hashtag people type on instagram right

1363
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,639
then you can do this with billions of

1364
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,399
images because there's billions per day

1365
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,358
that are showing up

1366
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,639
so the

1367
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,159
amount of training data there is

1368
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,440
essentially unlimited

1369
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,879
and then you take the output

1370
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,400
representation

1371
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,599
you know a couple layers down from the

1372
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,280
output

1373
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,920
of what the system learned

1374
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,359
and feed this as input to a classifier

1375
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,280
for any object in the world that you

1376
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:47,440
want and it works pretty well so that's

1377
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,200
transfer learning okay

1378
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,119
or weekly supervised

1379
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,879
transfer learning uh

1380
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,880
people are making very very fast

1381
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,800
progress using self-supervised running

1382
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,920
uh for for with this kind of scenario as

1383
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,560
well

1384
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,480
um and you know my guess is that that's

1385
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,880
that's gonna be the future for

1386
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,679
self-supervised learning how much

1387
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,079
cleaning do you think is needed for

1388
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,639
filtering um

1389
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,240
uh malicious signal or what's a better

1390
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,639
term but like a lot of people use

1391
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,919
hashtags on instagram

1392
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:21,199
to uh get like good seo

1393
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,880
that doesn't fully represent the

1394
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,639
contents of the image

1395
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,519
like they'll put a picture of a cat and

1396
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:29,679
hashtag it would like science awesome

1397
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,358
fun i don't know all kind of

1398
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,519
why would you put science that's not

1399
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:35,119
very good seo the way the way my

1400
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,079
colleagues who worked on this project at

1401
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,800
uh

1402
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,200
at facebook now meta meta

1403
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,560
a few years ago uh dealt with this is

1404
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,799
that they only selected something like

1405
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:48,159
17 000 tags that correspond to kind of

1406
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,960
physical things or or situations like

1407
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,239
you know that has some visual content

1408
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,079
um

1409
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,078
so you know

1410
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,960
you wouldn't have like tbt or anything

1411
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,160
like that

1412
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,000
also they keep a very select set of

1413
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,920
hashtags is what you're saying yeah okay

1414
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,199
but it's still instead on the order of

1415
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,880
uh you know 10 to 20 000 so it's fairly

1416
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,318
large okay

1417
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,000
can you uh tell me about data

1418
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:15,119
augmentation what the heck is data

1419
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,119
augmentation and how is it used maybe

1420
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,318
contrast of learning

1421
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,720
for uh

1422
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:22,480
for video what are some cool ideas here

1423
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,318
right so data augmentation i mean first

1424
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,079
data augmentation you know is the idea

1425
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,880
of artificially increasing the size of

1426
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,640
your training set by distorting the

1427
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,400
images that you have in ways that don't

1428
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:34,000
change the nature of the image right so

1429
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,440
you take you you're doing this you can

1430
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,039
do data augmentation on any list and

1431
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,920
people have done this since the 1990s

1432
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,759
right you take a in this digit and you

1433
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,440
shift it a little bit or you

1434
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,680
change the size or

1435
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,159
rotate it skew it

1436
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:50,799
you know etc add noise

1437
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:52,639
add noise etc and it it works better if

1438
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,839
you train a supervised classifier with

1439
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:55,519
augmented data you're going to get

1440
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,799
better results

1441
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:02,159
now it's become really interesting over

1442
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,079
the last couple years because

1443
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,480
a lot of supervised learning techniques

1444
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,920
to pre-train vision systems are based on

1445
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,519
data augmentation

1446
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,519
and the

1447
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:13,199
the basic techniques is originally

1448
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:14,400
inspired by uh

1449
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,078
techniques that

1450
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,599
i worked on in the early 90s and jeff

1451
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,359
intern worked on also in the early 90s

1452
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,519
there was sort of parallel

1453
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:23,838
work i used to call this siamese network

1454
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,519
so basically you take

1455
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,599
two identical copies of the same network

1456
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:30,159
they share the same weights

1457
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,680
and you show two

1458
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,118
different views of the same object

1459
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,199
either those two different views may

1460
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,559
have been obtained by data augmentation

1461
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,199
or maybe it's two different views of the

1462
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,720
same scene from a camera that you moved

1463
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,399
or at different times or something like

1464
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:44,399
that right or two pictures of the same

1465
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,639
person things like that

1466
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,318
and then you train this neural net those

1467
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:50,799
two identical copies of this neural net

1468
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,318
to produce an output representation a

1469
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,839
vector

1470
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:55,358
in such a way that the representation

1471
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:56,558
for those two

1472
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:58,719
images

1473
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,559
are as close to each other as possible

1474
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,959
as identical to each other as possible

1475
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,040
right because you want the system to

1476
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,720
basically learn a function that will

1477
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,239
that will be invariant that will not

1478
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,679
change whose output will not change when

1479
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:11,759
you transform those

1480
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:13,919
inputs uh in in those in those

1481
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,520
particular ways right

1482
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,280
so that's easy to do

1483
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:18,880
what's complicated is how do you make

1484
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,160
sure that when you show two images that

1485
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,838
are different the system will produce

1486
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,679
different things

1487
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:26,000
because if you don't

1488
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:28,318
have a specific provision for this

1489
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,599
the system will just ignore the input

1490
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:30,880
when you train it it will end up

1491
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,480
ignoring the input and just produce a

1492
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,920
constant vector that is the same for

1493
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,039
every input right yes that's called a

1494
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,880
collapse

1495
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,719
now how do you avoid collapse so there's

1496
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,559
two ideas

1497
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:43,199
one idea that i proposed in the early

1498
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,240
90s with my colleagues at bell labs jane

1499
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:48,159
bromley and a couple other people

1500
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:49,919
which we now call contrastive learning

1501
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,358
which is to have negative examples right

1502
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,240
so you have pairs

1503
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:56,400
of images that you know are different

1504
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,239
and you show them to the network and

1505
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,920
uh those two copies and then you you

1506
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,879
push the two output vectors away from

1507
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,960
each other

1508
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,720
and they will eventually guarantee that

1509
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,480
things that are semantically similar

1510
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:07,519
produce similar representations and

1511
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,159
things that are different produce

1512
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,079
different representations

1513
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,399
we actually came up with this idea for a

1514
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,200
project of doing signature verification

1515
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,200
so we would collect signature

1516
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:20,960
signatures from like multiple signatures

1517
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:21,919
on the same person and then train a

1518
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,199
neural net to produce the same

1519
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,559
representation

1520
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,679
and then uh

1521
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,760
you know

1522
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,799
force the system to produce different

1523
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,480
representations for different signatures

1524
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,960
this was actually the the problem was

1525
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,880
proposed by people from uh what was a

1526
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,079
subsidiary of atnt at the time called

1527
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,240
ncr

1528
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,240
and they were interested in storing a

1529
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:44,479
representation of the signature on the

1530
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,719
80 bytes of the

1531
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,240
magnetic strip of a credit card so we

1532
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,159
came up with this idea of having a

1533
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:51,919
neural net with 80 outputs

1534
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:53,759
you know that we would quantize on bytes

1535
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,960
so so that we could encode the

1536
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,640
and that encoding was then used to

1537
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,318
compare whether the signature matches or

1538
00:49:56,639 --> 00:49:58,960
not that's right so then you would you

1539
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:00,318
know

1540
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,599
sign you would run through the neural

1541
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:03,119
net and then you would compare the

1542
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,559
output vector to whatever is stored on

1543
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,240
your card it actually worked

1544
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,240
it worked but they ended up not using it

1545
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,359
because nobody cares actually i mean the

1546
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:14,639
american you know financial payment

1547
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:16,960
system is

1548
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:19,039
incredibly lags in that respect compared

1549
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,800
to europe oh with the signatures what's

1550
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:22,558
the purpose of signatures anyway this is

1551
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,318
very nobody looks at them nobody cares

1552
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,920
yeah it's uh yeah yeah no so so that

1553
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,519
that's contrastive learning right so you

1554
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,440
need positive and negative pairs and the

1555
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:33,358
problem with that is that

1556
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,559
you know even though i at the original

1557
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:36,719
paper on this

1558
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,079
i'm actually not very positive about it

1559
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:39,838
because it doesn't work in high

1560
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,160
dimension if your presentation is high

1561
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:44,159
dimensional there's just too many ways

1562
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:45,838
for two things to be different

1563
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:48,078
and and so you would need lots and lots

1564
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,400
and lots of negative pairs

1565
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,480
so there is a particular implementation

1566
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,119
of this which is relatively recent from

1567
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,519
actually the google toronto group

1568
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,280
uh where you know jeff intern is the

1569
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:02,079
senior member there it's called sim

1570
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,680
clear sim clr

1571
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,920
and you know basically a particular way

1572
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,598
of implementing this idea of contracting

1573
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,559
running the particular objective

1574
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,760
function

1575
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,440
now

1576
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,359
what i'm much more

1577
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,519
enthusiastic about these days is

1578
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:17,039
non-contrasting methods so other ways to

1579
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:18,559
guarantee that

1580
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,279
uh

1581
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,720
the

1582
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,240
representations would be different for

1583
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,239
different

1584
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:27,679
different inputs

1585
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:29,439
and it's actually based on an idea that

1586
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:31,759
jeff intern proposed in the early 90s

1587
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,280
with a student at the time sue becker

1588
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,480
and it's based on the idea of maximizing

1589
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,559
the mutual information between the

1590
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,318
outputs of the two systems you only show

1591
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,079
positive pairs you only show pairs of

1592
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:41,440
images that you know are somewhat

1593
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,200
similar

1594
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,880
and you train the two networks to be

1595
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,318
informative

1596
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,400
but also to be

1597
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,079
as informative

1598
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,079
of each other as possible so basically

1599
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,720
one representation has to be predictable

1600
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,039
from the other essentially

1601
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:58,558
uh and you know he proposed that idea

1602
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,159
had you know

1603
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,079
a couple papers in the early 90s and

1604
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,639
then nothing was done about it for

1605
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,440
decades and i kind of revived this idea

1606
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,960
together with my postdocs at fair

1607
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,519
uh particularly a postdoc called

1608
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:15,039
stefanoni who's now a junior professor

1609
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:17,358
in in finland at university of alto

1610
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:19,119
we came up with something called that we

1611
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:21,440
call barlow twins

1612
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,318
and it's a particular way of maximizing

1613
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,960
the information content of

1614
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,800
a vector you know using some

1615
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,039
hypotheses

1616
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,559
and we have kind of a

1617
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,880
another version of it that's more recent

1618
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,960
now called vikreg vic reg that that

1619
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,720
means variance in variance covariance

1620
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,400
regularization and i'm it's the thing

1621
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,078
i'm the most excited about in machine

1622
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,760
learning in the last 15 years i mean i'm

1623
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,960
i'm not i'm really really excited about

1624
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,559
this what uh kind of data augmentation

1625
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,079
is useful for that non-contrasting

1626
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,440
learning method

1627
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,079
are we talking about does that not

1628
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,480
matter that much or it seems like a very

1629
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,160
important part of the step yeah how you

1630
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,079
generate the images that are similar but

1631
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:01,598
sufficiently different yeah that's right

1632
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,119
it's an important step and it's also an

1633
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:06,160
annoying step because you need to have

1634
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,240
that knowledge of what the augmentation

1635
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:10,318
you can do that do not change the nature

1636
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:11,838
of the of the object

1637
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:13,519
and so

1638
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:14,880
the standard scenario which you know a

1639
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:18,318
lot of people working in this area are

1640
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,519
using is you use uh the the type of

1641
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:21,440
distortion

1642
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:23,280
so so basically you do geometric

1643
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,400
distortion so one basically just shifts

1644
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,480
the image a little bit it's called

1645
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,400
crabbing another one kind of changes the

1646
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,079
scale a little bit another one kind of

1647
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,160
rotates it another one changes the

1648
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,160
colors you know you can do a shift in

1649
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:36,719
color balance or something like that

1650
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:38,719
uh saturation another one sort of blurs

1651
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,719
it another one adds noise so you have

1652
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:42,239
like a catalog of kind of standard

1653
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:44,078
things and people try to use the same

1654
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:45,679
ones for different algorithms so that

1655
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,280
they can compare

1656
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,960
but some algorithms uh some cell

1657
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,400
supervisor algorithm actually can deal

1658
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,400
with much bigger

1659
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,240
like more aggressive data augmentation

1660
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,838
and some don't so

1661
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,439
that kind of makes the whole thing

1662
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:59,679
difficult but but that's the kind of

1663
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,240
distortions we're talking about and

1664
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,440
and so you you you you train with those

1665
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,519
distortions

1666
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,519
and then uh you

1667
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:10,960
you chop off the last layer a couple

1668
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:12,639
layers of the of the network

1669
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,280
and you use the representation as input

1670
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,239
to a classifier you train the classifier

1671
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,640
um

1672
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:20,479
on imagenet let's say or whatever and

1673
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:21,519
measure the performance

1674
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,760
and

1675
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,119
interestingly enough the methods that

1676
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,040
are really good at eliminating the

1677
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,838
information that is irrelevant which is

1678
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:32,318
the distortions between those images

1679
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:34,880
do a good job at eliminating it

1680
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:36,639
and uh as a consequence you cannot use

1681
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,960
those the representations in those

1682
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:40,400
systems for things like object detection

1683
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,559
and localization because that

1684
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,160
information is gone

1685
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,920
so the type of data augmentation you

1686
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,039
need to do depends on the task you want

1687
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,680
eventually

1688
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,880
the system to to solve and the type of

1689
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:52,798
data augmentation standard data

1690
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,720
determination that we use today are only

1691
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:56,159
appropriate for object recognition or

1692
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,000
image classification they're not

1693
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,838
appropriate for things like can you help

1694
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,280
me out understand what uh why the

1695
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,119
localization is so you're saying it's

1696
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,480
just not good at the negative

1697
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,920
uh like

1698
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,000
classifying the negative so that's why

1699
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,480
it can't be used for the localization no

1700
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,239
it's just that you train the system

1701
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,519
you know you you you give it an image

1702
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:15,358
and then you give it the same image

1703
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:17,199
shifted and scaled and you tell it

1704
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,039
that's the same image

1705
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:20,798
so the system basically is trained to

1706
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,920
eliminate the information about position

1707
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:23,119
and size

1708
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,280
so now

1709
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,960
and now you want to use that oh yeah

1710
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,798
like figure out where an object is and

1711
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,199
what size is like a bounding box like to

1712
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:33,599
be able to actually okay it can still

1713
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,838
find it can still find the object in the

1714
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,519
image it's just not very good at finding

1715
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:38,880
the exact boundaries of that object

1716
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,318
interesting

1717
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,160
interesting which

1718
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,798
you know that's an interesting sort of

1719
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:46,639
philosophical question how important how

1720
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:49,599
important is object localization anyway

1721
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:51,118
we're like obsessed by measuring like

1722
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,280
image segmentation

1723
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,680
obsessed by measuring perfectly knowing

1724
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,760
the boundaries of objects when

1725
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,598
arguably

1726
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,000
that's not

1727
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,680
that essential to understanding what are

1728
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,760
the contents of the scene

1729
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:08,159
on the other hand i think evolutionarily

1730
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,079
the first vision systems in animals were

1731
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:12,399
basically all about localization very

1732
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,240
little about recognition

1733
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,639
and in the human brain you have two

1734
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:19,598
separate pathways for

1735
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,798
recognizing the nature of a scene an

1736
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,599
object

1737
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:25,119
and localizing objects so you use the

1738
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,000
first pathway called a ventral pathway

1739
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,960
for

1740
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,639
you know telling what you're looking at

1741
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,440
the other path for the dorsal pathway is

1742
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,118
used for navigation for grasping for

1743
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,798
everything else and you know basically a

1744
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,160
lot of the things you need for survival

1745
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:41,440
are

1746
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,440
localization and detection

1747
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,079
is similarity learning or contrast of

1748
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:47,679
learning are these non-contrastive

1749
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,720
methods the same as understanding

1750
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:50,719
something

1751
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:52,879
just because you know a distorted cat is

1752
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:54,480
the same as a non-distorted cat does

1753
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,559
that mean you understand

1754
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,480
what it means to be a cat

1755
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,559
to some extent i mean it's a superficial

1756
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,240
understanding obviously but like what is

1757
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,839
the ceiling of this method do you think

1758
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:05,838
is this just one

1759
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:08,078
trick on the path to

1760
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:09,920
doing cell supervised learning can we go

1761
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,920
yeah really really far

1762
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,400
i think we can go really far so if we

1763
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,559
figure out how to

1764
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,000
uh use techniques of that type perhaps

1765
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,359
very different but you know the

1766
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,318
signature

1767
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:22,558
to

1768
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:25,759
train a system from from video to do

1769
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:28,240
video prediction essentially

1770
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,079
i think we'll have a path um you know

1771
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:31,519
towards uh

1772
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,240
you know i wouldn't say unlimited but

1773
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,280
but a path towards some level of

1774
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:37,118
uh

1775
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,599
you know physical common sense in

1776
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,720
machines and i also think that um

1777
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,280
that

1778
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:47,598
ability to learn how the world works

1779
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,760
from a sort of high throughput channel

1780
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:54,079
like like vision

1781
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,839
is a necessary step towards uh sort of

1782
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,079
real artificial intelligence in other

1783
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,920
words i believe in ground intelligence i

1784
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,000
don't think we can train a machine to be

1785
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,760
intelligent purely from text

1786
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,960
because i think the amount of

1787
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,880
information about the world that's

1788
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:11,440
contained in text is tiny compared to

1789
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,760
what we need to know

1790
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,599
so for example let's uh and you know

1791
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,440
people have attempted to do this for for

1792
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,359
30 years right the psych project and

1793
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,838
things like that right of basically kind

1794
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:22,159
of writing down all the facts that are

1795
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:23,759
known and

1796
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:25,759
hoping that some some sort of common

1797
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,839
sense will emerge um i think it's

1798
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,520
basically hopeless but let me take an

1799
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,440
example you take an object

1800
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,599
i i describe the situation to you i take

1801
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,079
an object i put it on the table and i

1802
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,599
push the table it's completely obvious

1803
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,519
to you that the object will be pushed

1804
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,680
with the table right because it's

1805
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:43,280
sitting on it

1806
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:44,960
there's no text in the world i believe

1807
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,839
that explains this

1808
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,599
and so

1809
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:52,639
if you train a machine as powerful as it

1810
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:54,480
could be you know your gpt 5000

1811
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,239
or whatever it is it's never going to

1812
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,199
learn about this

1813
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:00,879
um that information is just not is not

1814
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,719
present in any text

1815
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,400
well the question like with the psyc

1816
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:06,399
project the dream i think is to have

1817
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,000
like

1818
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,480
like 10 million

1819
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,119
say facts like that

1820
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,358
that give you a head start

1821
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:17,119
like a parent guiding you

1822
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:19,119
now we humans don't need a parent to

1823
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,640
tell us that the table will move uh

1824
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,680
sorry the smartphone will move with the

1825
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:22,960
table

1826
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:25,759
but

1827
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,358
we get a lot of guidance in other ways

1828
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,520
so it's possible that we can give it a

1829
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:30,880
quick shortcut what about cat the guy

1830
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,280
knows that

1831
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,599
no but they evolved so

1832
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,798
no they learn like us

1833
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,680
the the sorry the physics of stuff

1834
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:41,519
well

1835
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:42,399
yeah so you're saying it's

1836
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:44,960
uh

1837
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,440
see you're putting a lot of intelligence

1838
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,119
onto the nurture side not the nature yes

1839
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,838
we seem to have um

1840
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,920
you know there's a very inefficient

1841
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:57,759
arguably process of evolution that got

1842
00:59:53,920 --> 01:00:00,318
us from bacteria to who we are today

1843
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,000
started at the bottom now we're here so

1844
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:04,480
true uh

1845
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,239
the question is how okay so the question

1846
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,559
is how fundamental is that the the

1847
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:10,399
nature of the whole hardware

1848
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,760
and then

1849
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,519
is there any way to shortcut it if it's

1850
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,880
fundamental if it's not if it's most of

1851
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,039
intelligence most of the cool stuff

1852
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,200
we've been talking about is mostly

1853
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:22,000
nurture mostly trained we figure it out

1854
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:24,639
by observing the world we can form that

1855
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,318
uh big beautiful sexy background model

1856
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:28,879
that you're talking about just by

1857
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:31,759
sitting there

1858
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,920
then okay then you need to then like

1859
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,720
maybe

1860
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,559
uh

1861
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:37,679
it is all supervised learning all the

1862
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,599
way down

1863
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,519
so surprise learning site whatever it is

1864
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,440
that makes uh you know human

1865
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:45,199
intelligence different from other

1866
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,119
animals which you know a lot of people

1867
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:48,558
think is language and logical reasoning

1868
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,240
and this kind of stuff

1869
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,720
it cannot be that complicated because it

1870
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,159
only popped up in the last million years

1871
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:54,959
yeah

1872
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:57,118
and

1873
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,838
you know it it and it only involves you

1874
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,119
know

1875
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:00,480
less than one percent of our genome

1876
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:03,280
might be which is the difference between

1877
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,358
human genome and gyms or whatever

1878
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,798
so uh

1879
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:08,719
it can be that complicated you know it

1880
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:09,519
can be that fundamental i mean the most

1881
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:11,519
of the

1882
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:13,199
so complicated stuff already exist in

1883
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,119
cats and dogs and

1884
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:17,039
you know certainly primates non-human

1885
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,720
primates

1886
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:21,599
yeah that little thing with humans might

1887
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:23,358
be just uh something about social

1888
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,960
interaction and ability to maintain

1889
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:28,239
ideas across

1890
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:30,159
like a collective of people

1891
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:32,078
it's it sounds very dramatic and very

1892
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:33,838
impressive but it probably isn't

1893
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,400
mechanistically speaking it is but we're

1894
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:40,000
not there yet like you know we we have i

1895
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:43,280
mean this is number 634 you know in the

1896
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
list of problems to solve

1897
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,160
so basic physics of the world is is

1898
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,599
number one what do you um

1899
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:52,318
just a quick

1900
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,318
tangent on data augmentation so a lot of

1901
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:58,159
it is

1902
01:01:54,318 --> 01:02:00,719
hard-coded versus learned

1903
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:02,159
do you have any intuition that maybe

1904
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:03,519
there could be some weird data

1905
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:05,440
augmentation

1906
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,038
like generative type of data

1907
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,280
augmentation like doing something weird

1908
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,039
to images which then

1909
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,359
improves the

1910
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,960
the similarity learning process so not

1911
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:17,038
just kind of dumb

1912
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,480
simple distortions but

1913
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,799
by you shaking your head just saying

1914
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,880
that even simple distortions are enough

1915
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:26,400
i think no i think that augmentation is

1916
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,318
a temporary necessary evil

1917
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,000
so what people are working on now is is

1918
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:33,038
two things one is

1919
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,639
uh the type of self-supervisioning

1920
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,880
like trying to to translate the type of

1921
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:38,879
cell suppressant people using language

1922
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,440
translating these two images which is

1923
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,160
basically denoting autoencoder method

1924
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:47,440
right so you you take an image you you

1925
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:49,279
block you mask some parts of it

1926
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,280
and then you you train some giant neural

1927
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,760
net to reconstruct the parts that you've

1928
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,000
that are that are missing and

1929
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,520
until very recently

1930
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,920
there was no there was no working

1931
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:01,679
methods for that uh all the autoencoder

1932
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,599
type methods for images weren't

1933
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:05,838
producing very good representation but

1934
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,440
there's a paper now coming out of

1935
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:10,558
the fair group in menlo park that

1936
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,920
actually works very well so

1937
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,319
that doesn't require the documentation

1938
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,200
that requires only masking

1939
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:18,079
okay only masking for images

1940
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:20,159
uh

1941
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:22,960
okay right so you mask part of the image

1942
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:25,038
and you train a system which you know

1943
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,559
in this case is a transformer because

1944
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:29,200
you can you can

1945
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,280
the transformer represents the image as

1946
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:33,199
uh non-overlapping patches so it's easy

1947
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,200
to mask patches and things like that

1948
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:37,199
okay then my question transfers to that

1949
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:40,239
problem the masking like why should the

1950
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:41,679
mask be a square or rectangle so it

1951
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:43,759
doesn't matter like you know i think

1952
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:46,000
we're gonna come up probably in the

1953
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,920
future with sort of uh

1954
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,679
you know ways to mask that are is you

1955
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,358
know kind of

1956
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,759
random essentially well i mean they are

1957
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,639
random already but no no but like

1958
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,839
something that's challenging

1959
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,400
like

1960
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:02,318
optimally challenging so like i mean

1961
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,358
maybe it's a metaphor that doesn't apply

1962
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:07,679
but you're it seems like there's an data

1963
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:09,759
augmentation or masking

1964
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,440
there's an interactive element with it

1965
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,400
like you're almost like playing with an

1966
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,159
image

1967
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,000
and like it's like the way we play with

1968
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:17,598
an image in our minds no but it's like

1969
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,599
dropout it's like boston machine

1970
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,920
training you um

1971
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,039
you know every every every time you see

1972
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,240
a percept

1973
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,000
you also

1974
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:30,000
you you can you can perturb it in some

1975
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,358
way and then uh the the principle of the

1976
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,039
training procedure

1977
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:34,960
is to minimize the difference of the

1978
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,520
output of the representation

1979
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,240
between the the clean version and the

1980
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:41,920
corrupted version essentially right and

1981
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:43,679
you you can do this in real time right

1982
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,318
so you know what's the machine work like

1983
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:47,919
this right you you you show a percept

1984
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:50,159
and you tell the machine that's a good

1985
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,440
combination of activities or your input

1986
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:55,358
neurons

1987
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,400
uh and then you either uh

1988
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:58,480
let them

1989
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,480
go their merry way without

1990
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,639
clamping them to values or you only do

1991
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,719
this with a subset yeah and what you're

1992
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:05,920
doing is you're training the system so

1993
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:07,919
that the

1994
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,519
the stable state of the entire network

1995
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,440
is the same regardless of whether it

1996
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:13,038
sees the entire input or whether it is

1997
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,960
only part of it

1998
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,640
um you know the nozzling autoencoder

1999
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,318
method is basically the same thing right

2000
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,318
you you're you're training a system to

2001
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:22,239
reproduce the input the complete inputs

2002
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:24,239
and filling the blanks regardless of

2003
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:26,318
which which parts are missing and that's

2004
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:27,919
really the underlying principle and you

2005
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:29,358
could imagine sort of a even in the

2006
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,920
brain some sort of neural principle

2007
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:34,000
where you know neurons gonna

2008
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:35,519
oscillate right so they they take their

2009
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,719
activity and then temporarily they kind

2010
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:37,599
of shut off

2011
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:39,358
to

2012
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,640
you know force the rest of the system to

2013
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,000
basically

2014
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:44,639
reconstruct

2015
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,798
the input without their help you know

2016
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,558
and and and

2017
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:50,480
i mean you could imagine you know you

2018
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,680
know more or less biologically possible

2019
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,000
processes

2020
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:57,199
and i guess with this uh denoising

2021
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,199
auto encoder and masking and data

2022
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,038
augmentation you don't have to worry

2023
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:02,159
about being super efficient

2024
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,319
you can just

2025
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,920
do as much as you want yeah and get

2026
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:07,440
better over time

2027
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,440
because i was thinking like you might

2028
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,358
want to be clever about the way you do

2029
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,720
all these procedures

2030
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:15,358
you know but

2031
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:17,919
that's only if it's somehow costly to do

2032
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:19,119
every iteration but it's not really not

2033
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,079
really

2034
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:21,519
maybe

2035
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,960
and then there is you know data

2036
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,038
augmentation without explicit data

2037
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,880
augmentation is data augmentation by

2038
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:29,200
waiting which is you know the the sort

2039
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,318
of video prediction

2040
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,038
you're

2041
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:35,119
observing a video clip observing the

2042
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,039
you know the continuation of that video

2043
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,640
clip and try you try to learn a

2044
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,640
representation using those joint

2045
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,639
embedding architectures in such a way

2046
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:44,879
that the representation of the future

2047
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:46,879
clip is easily predictable from the

2048
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,480
representation of the of the observed

2049
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,640
clip

2050
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,639
do you think youtube has enough

2051
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,480
raw data

2052
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:56,159
from which to learn

2053
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,679
how to be a cat

2054
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:58,639
i think so

2055
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:01,118
so the

2056
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:03,199
the amount of data is not the constraint

2057
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,079
no it would require some selection i

2058
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:05,279
think

2059
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,519
some

2060
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,119
some selection of you know maybe the

2061
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,038
right type of data you know down the

2062
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,798
rabbit hole of just cat videos that

2063
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,559
might you might need to watch some

2064
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:17,358
lectures or something

2065
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,119
no you wouldn't how meta would that be

2066
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:21,598
if it like watches

2067
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:24,400
lectures about intelligence and then

2068
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:28,440
learns watches your lectures and nyu and

2069
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,440
learns from that how to be intelligent

2070
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:33,199
uh what's your uh do you find

2071
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:35,279
multi-modal learning interesting we've

2072
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:37,279
been talking about visual language like

2073
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,400
combining those together maybe audio all

2074
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,400
those kinds of things there's a lot of

2075
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,480
things that i find interesting in the

2076
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,240
short term but are not

2077
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,679
addressing the important problem that i

2078
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:47,679
think are really kind of the big

2079
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:49,358
challenges so i think you know things

2080
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:50,480
like multitask learning continual

2081
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:53,199
learning

2082
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:55,119
uh you know

2083
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:57,598
adversarial issues i mean those have you

2084
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,280
know great practical interests in the

2085
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,720
relatively short term

2086
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,480
uh possibly but i don't think they're

2087
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:03,679
fundamental you know active learning

2088
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,199
even to some extent reinforcement

2089
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:06,639
learning i think

2090
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:08,719
those things will

2091
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,679
become either obsolete or

2092
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:14,078
or useless or easy

2093
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:15,838
once we figure out how to do

2094
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:19,199
self-improvised representation learning

2095
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:21,679
or or learning predictable models

2096
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:23,358
and so i think that's what you know

2097
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,359
the entire community should be focusing

2098
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,880
on uh at least people are interested in

2099
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,400
sort of fundamental questions or you

2100
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,279
know really kind of pushing the envelope

2101
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,719
of ai towards the next the next stage

2102
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,319
but of course there's like a huge amount

2103
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:36,480
of you know very interesting work to do

2104
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:39,359
in sort of practical questions that have

2105
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,358
you know short-term impact well you know

2106
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,960
it's it's difficult to talk about the

2107
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,239
temporal scale because

2108
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,439
all of human civilization will

2109
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:49,198
eventually be destroyed because the the

2110
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:52,079
the sun will die out and even if elon

2111
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:54,399
musk is successful multi-planetary

2112
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:55,519
colonization across the galaxy uh

2113
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,599
eventually

2114
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,159
the entirety of it would just become

2115
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,079
giant black holes and um

2116
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:04,318
that's going to take a while though

2117
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,838
so but but what i'm saying is then that

2118
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,440
logic can be used to say it's all

2119
01:09:05,838 --> 01:09:09,439
meaningless

2120
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,679
i'm saying all that to say that

2121
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:11,919
multitask learning

2122
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,600
[Music]

2123
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,440
might be

2124
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,199
your song you're calling it practical or

2125
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:18,879
pragmatic or whatever

2126
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:22,559
that might be the thing that achieves

2127
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:25,359
something very akin to intelligence

2128
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,759
while we're trying to solve the more

2129
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,759
uh general problem of self-supervised

2130
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,679
learning and background knowledge so the

2131
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,520
reason i bring that up maybe one

2132
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,679
way to ask that question i've been very

2133
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,040
impressed by what tesla auto poly team

2134
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,279
is doing i don't know if you got a

2135
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:40,479
chance to glance at this particular one

2136
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,560
example of

2137
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:44,798
multi-task learning where they're

2138
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:47,359
literally taking the problem

2139
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:50,238
like i don't know charles darwin starts

2140
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:52,239
studying animals they're studying

2141
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:53,599
the problem of driving and asking okay

2142
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:54,959
what are all the things you have to

2143
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,079
perceive

2144
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,679
and

2145
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:59,198
the way they're solving it is one

2146
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,560
there's an ontology where you're

2147
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:02,158
bringing that to the table so you're

2148
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,520
formulating a bunch of different tasks

2149
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:04,559
it's like over a hundred tasks or

2150
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,880
something like that then they're

2151
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,640
involved in driving and then they're

2152
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,560
deploying it and then getting data back

2153
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,159
from people that run into trouble and

2154
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,400
they're trying to figure out do we add

2155
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:16,639
tasks do we like we focus on each

2156
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:18,799
individual task separately sure in fact

2157
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,960
half so the i would say i'll classify

2158
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,400
andre carpathi's talk in two ways so one

2159
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,840
was about doors

2160
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:25,279
and the other one about how much image

2161
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,880
net sucks

2162
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:29,039
he kept going

2163
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,359
back and forth on those two topics which

2164
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:34,000
image that sucks meaning you can't just

2165
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:35,439
use a single benchmark there's so like

2166
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,840
you you have to have

2167
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:39,599
like a giant suite of benchmarks to

2168
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,360
understand how well your your system

2169
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,760
actually i agree with him i mean he's uh

2170
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:44,960
he's a very sensible guy

2171
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,199
now

2172
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,679
okay it's it's very clear that if you're

2173
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:51,359
faced with a an engineering problem that

2174
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:54,000
you need to solve in a relatively short

2175
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:55,759
time particularly if you have it almost

2176
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,960
breathing down your neck

2177
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,480
you're going to have to take shortcuts

2178
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,239
right you you

2179
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:02,639
you might think about the the fact that

2180
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:04,479
the the the right thing to do in the

2181
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,880
long-term solution involves you know

2182
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:07,919
some fancy self-supervisioning but you

2183
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,359
have

2184
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,480
you know you know almost reading on your

2185
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:14,399
neck uh and you know this involves uh

2186
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:16,399
you know human lives and so

2187
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:18,639
you you have to

2188
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:21,039
basically just do the systematic uh

2189
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,920
engineering and you know

2190
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:23,679
uh

2191
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,158
fine tuning and refinements and trial

2192
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:27,679
and error and and all that stuff um

2193
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,039
there's nothing wrong with that that's

2194
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,560
that's called engineering that's called

2195
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:34,319
you know uh

2196
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:37,199
putting technology out uh in the

2197
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:39,759
in the world um and and you have to kind

2198
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:42,079
of ironclad it before before you do this

2199
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,079
you know

2200
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:46,800
so much for you know grand grand ideas

2201
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:48,158
and principles

2202
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,320
um

2203
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:52,960
but you know i'm placing myself sort of

2204
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:54,559
you know some

2205
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,480
you know upstream of this queen or quite

2206
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,280
a bit of stream of this your plato think

2207
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:01,439
about platonic forms you're you're

2208
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:04,079
platonic because eventually

2209
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:06,719
i want that stuff to get used but uh

2210
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:08,238
it's okay if it takes five or ten years

2211
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,239
for the community to realize this is the

2212
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:12,718
right thing to do i've i've done this

2213
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:14,879
before it's been the case before that

2214
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,960
you know i've made that case i mean if

2215
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,560
you look back in the mid-2000s for

2216
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,399
example and you ask yourself the

2217
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,840
question okay i want to recognize cars

2218
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:23,839
or faces or whatever

2219
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:28,158
you know i can use convolutional net so

2220
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,600
i can use a more conventional

2221
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:31,439
kind of computer vision techniques you

2222
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,159
know using uh interest point detectors

2223
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:36,238
or swift density features and you know

2224
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,719
sticking an svm on top at that time the

2225
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:39,678
data sets were so small that

2226
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:41,840
those

2227
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,679
methods that use more hand engineering

2228
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,440
worked better than companies there was

2229
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,279
just not enough data for comnets and

2230
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:48,960
contests were were a little a little

2231
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:50,639
slow with the kind of hardware that was

2232
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,279
available at the time

2233
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,360
and there was a c change when uh

2234
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:57,759
basically when you know

2235
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:59,759
data sets become bigger and and gpus

2236
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,440
became available that that's what

2237
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,679
you know those

2238
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:05,359
two of the main factors that basically

2239
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,600
made people change their change their

2240
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:07,599
mind

2241
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:11,679
and you can

2242
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,480
you can look at the history of

2243
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:16,239
like all sub-branches of ai or pattern

2244
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:18,559
recognition

2245
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:20,639
and there's a similar trajectory

2246
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,880
followed by techniques where people

2247
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,640
start by you know engineering the hell

2248
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,079
out of it

2249
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,199
um you know

2250
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:29,119
be it

2251
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:30,879
optical character recognition

2252
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:32,800
speech recognition

2253
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,800
computer vision like image recognition

2254
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,119
in general uh natural language

2255
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,320
understanding like you know translation

2256
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:40,399
things like that right you start to

2257
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:42,559
engineer the hell out of it

2258
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:44,079
um you start to acquire all knowledge

2259
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,840
the prior knowledge you know about image

2260
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:48,640
formation about you know the shape of

2261
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,800
characters about you know morphological

2262
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,320
operations about like feature extraction

2263
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,760
fourier transforms

2264
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:55,439
you know very quickly moments you know

2265
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,600
whatever right people have come up with

2266
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:59,759
thousands of ways of representing images

2267
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:02,079
so that they could be easily uh

2268
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,159
classified afterwards same for speech

2269
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,600
recognition right there is you know two

2270
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:08,879
decades for people to figure out a good

2271
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,560
front end uh to pre-process uh

2272
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,319
speech signals so that you know the

2273
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,320
information about what is being said is

2274
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:16,479
preserved but most of the information

2275
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:18,158
about the identity of the speaker is

2276
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:20,000
gone um

2277
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:23,279
you know kestrel coefficients or

2278
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:26,479
whatever right um and same for for text

2279
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:30,000
right uh you do need entity recognition

2280
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:30,879
and you parse and you you you do tagging

2281
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,679
of

2282
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,440
of of the parts of speech and you know

2283
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:37,440
you do this sort of tree representation

2284
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:40,879
of clauses and all that stuff right

2285
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,879
before you can do anything

2286
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,520
so

2287
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,440
that's how it starts right just engineer

2288
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,960
the hell out of it and then you start

2289
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:50,639
having data

2290
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,158
and maybe you have more powerful

2291
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,000
computers maybe you know something about

2292
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:55,198
statistical learning so you start using

2293
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,880
machine learning and it's usually a

2294
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:58,399
small sliver on top of your kind of

2295
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,679
handcrafted system where you know you

2296
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:03,279
extract features by hand okay and now

2297
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,719
you know nowadays the standard way of

2298
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:05,920
doing this is that you train the entire

2299
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:07,679
thing end to end with the deep learning

2300
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,480
system and it learns its own features

2301
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:10,480
and

2302
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:13,359
and you know speech recognition systems

2303
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:15,198
nowadays uh ocr systems are completely

2304
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:17,519
end-to-end it's uh you know it's some

2305
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:18,799
giant neural net that takes raw

2306
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,320
waveforms

2307
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,400
and produces a sequence of characters

2308
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:24,639
coming out and it's just a huge neural

2309
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:26,719
net right there's no you know minecraft

2310
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,800
model there's no language model that is

2311
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,399
explicit other than you know something

2312
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,000
that's ingrained in the in the sort of

2313
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:34,079
neural language model if you want same

2314
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,520
for translation same for all kinds of

2315
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:37,359
stuff so you see this

2316
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,199
continuous evolution

2317
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:41,439
from

2318
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:43,279
you know less and less hand crafting and

2319
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:44,238
more and more learning

2320
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:45,439
um

2321
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:48,079
and uh

2322
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:50,559
i i think

2323
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:52,800
it's true in biology as well

2324
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:56,159
so i mean we might disagree about this

2325
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:59,440
maybe not uh in this one little piece at

2326
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:01,599
the end you mentioned active learning

2327
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:03,359
it feels like active learning which is

2328
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,679
the selection of data and also the

2329
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,599
interactivity needs to be part of this

2330
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,279
giant neural network you cannot just be

2331
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,600
an observer to do self-supervised

2332
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:13,759
learning you have to well

2333
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,079
i don't self supervise learning is just

2334
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,079
a word but i would whatever this giant

2335
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:21,039
stack of a neural network that's

2336
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:22,800
automatically learning it feels my

2337
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:24,079
intuition is

2338
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,960
that

2339
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:30,399
you have to have a system whether it's a

2340
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:32,239
physical robot or a digital robot that's

2341
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:34,639
interacting with the world

2342
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:36,799
and doing so in a flawed way and

2343
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:40,320
improving over time

2344
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,440
in order to to form the self-supervised

2345
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:44,158
learning

2346
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:46,879
well you can't just give it a giant sea

2347
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:50,079
of data okay i agree and i disagree okay

2348
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:52,239
i agree in the sense that i think uh

2349
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:53,679
i agree i agree in two ways the first

2350
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:54,959
the first way i agree is that if you

2351
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,960
want uh

2352
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,399
and you certainly need a causal model of

2353
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,319
the world that allows you to predict the

2354
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:01,679
consequences of your actions

2355
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,079
to train that model you need to take

2356
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:06,000
actions right you need to be able to act

2357
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:07,920
in a world and see the effect

2358
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,279
for you to be to learn causal models of

2359
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,359
the world well so that's not that's not

2360
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:12,880
obvious because you can observe others

2361
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:14,960
you can observe others and you can infer

2362
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,400
that they're similar to you and then you

2363
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,800
can learn from that yeah but then you

2364
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,079
have to kind of hardwire that part right

2365
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,079
you know mirror neurons and all that

2366
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:23,439
stuff right so um

2367
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:25,039
and it's not clear to me how you would

2368
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:26,319
do this in a machine so

2369
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:29,279
um

2370
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:31,920
so i think the the action part would be

2371
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:33,359
necessary for having causal models of of

2372
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:35,920
the world

2373
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:37,920
the second reason it may be

2374
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,800
necessary or at least more efficient is

2375
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,679
that

2376
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,840
uh

2377
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:43,520
active learning basically you know goes

2378
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,800
for the jiggler of what you're what you

2379
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,560
don't know right

2380
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,400
is this you know obvious

2381
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,800
areas of uncertainty

2382
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:52,879
uh about your your world and about the

2383
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,000
how the world behaves

2384
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,039
and

2385
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,960
you can resolve this uncertainty by

2386
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,960
systematic exploration of that part that

2387
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,239
you don't you don't know and if you know

2388
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,000
that you don't know then you know it

2389
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:05,439
makes you curious you kind of look into

2390
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,319
situations that

2391
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:09,198
and uh you know across the animal uh

2392
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:11,119
world

2393
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:13,519
different species are different levels

2394
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,800
of curiosity right

2395
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,840
yeah depending on how they're built

2396
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,840
right so

2397
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,480
you know cats and rats are incredibly

2398
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,400
curious uh dogs not so much i mean less

2399
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:24,879
yeah so it could be useful to have that

2400
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:26,879
kind of curiosity so it'd be useful but

2401
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,359
curiosity just makes the process faster

2402
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,239
it doesn't make the process exist

2403
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:33,920
the

2404
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:35,519
so what process what learning process

2405
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,560
is it that

2406
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,400
active learning makes more efficient

2407
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,719
and i'm asking that first question uh

2408
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:42,719
you know

2409
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:46,000
you know we haven't answered that

2410
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:48,158
question yet so you know i worry about

2411
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,840
active learning once this question is so

2412
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:50,799
it's the more fundamental question to

2413
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,279
ask

2414
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,719
and if active learning or

2415
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:56,880
interaction

2416
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,399
increases the efficiency of the learning

2417
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,560
see sometimes

2418
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:03,519
it becomes very different if the

2419
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:05,679
increase is several orders of magnitude

2420
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,000
right like that's true

2421
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:09,920
but fundamentally still the same thing

2422
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,960
and building up the intuition about how

2423
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,800
to

2424
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,399
in a self-supervised way to construct

2425
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,760
background models efficient or

2426
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:18,479
inefficient

2427
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:20,719
is um is the core problem

2428
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:22,718
what do you think about yoshi banjos

2429
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:24,960
talking about consciousness

2430
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,158
and all of these kinds of concepts okay

2431
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,399
um

2432
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,079
i don't know what consciousness is

2433
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:31,839
but uh

2434
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:33,439
it's a good opener

2435
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,600
and to some extent a lot of the things

2436
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:36,960
that are said about consciousness remind

2437
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,159
me of

2438
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,800
the questions people were asking

2439
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:43,119
themselves in the 18th century or 17th

2440
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,279
century when they discovered that

2441
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:46,719
uh you know how the eye works and the

2442
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,238
fact that the image at the back of the

2443
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:49,520
eye was

2444
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:51,519
upside down

2445
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,840
right because you have a lens and and so

2446
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,199
on your retina the image that forms is

2447
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,119
an image of the world but it's upside

2448
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:58,000
down how is it that you see right side

2449
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:59,840
up

2450
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,359
and you know with what we know today in

2451
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,679
science you know we realize this

2452
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:05,839
question doesn't make any sense

2453
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,279
or or is kind of ridiculous in some way

2454
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,880
right so i think a lot of what is said

2455
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:10,238
about consciousness is of that nature

2456
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,039
now that said there's a lot of really

2457
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:14,319
smart people that uh for whom i have a

2458
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:16,399
lot of respect who are talking about

2459
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:19,599
this topic people like david chalmers

2460
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:21,679
who is the colleague of mine at nyu

2461
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:25,280
i have kind of a

2462
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,279
unorthodox folk

2463
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,360
speculative

2464
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:32,479
hypothesis about consciousness so we're

2465
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:34,479
talking about this audio world model and

2466
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,879
uh i think you know our entire

2467
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:40,638
prefrontal cortex basically is

2468
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:42,000
uh the engine for our world model

2469
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:44,480
but when we are

2470
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,158
attending at a particular situation

2471
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:48,479
we're focused on that situation we

2472
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:49,679
basically cannot attend to anything else

2473
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:52,079
and that

2474
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:55,679
seems to suggest

2475
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:57,679
that we basically have only one

2476
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:59,600
world model engine in our pre-photo

2477
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,279
cortex

2478
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,520
that engine is configurable to the

2479
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:06,000
situation at hand so we are building a

2480
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,600
box out of wood or we are you know

2481
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
driving uh

2482
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:12,480
down the highway playing chess we we

2483
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,600
basically have uh a single model of the

2484
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:15,198
world that we configure into the

2485
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,800
situation at hand

2486
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:19,039
which is why we can only attend to one

2487
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,560
task at a time

2488
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:22,800
now if there is a task that we do

2489
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,360
repeatedly

2490
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,800
it it goes from the sort of deliberate

2491
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:28,079
reasoning using model of the world and

2492
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,520
prediction and perhaps something like

2493
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:31,198
model predictive control which i was

2494
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,199
talking about earlier

2495
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:35,119
to something that is more subconscious

2496
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:36,960
that becomes automatic so i don't know

2497
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:38,238
if you've ever played against a chess

2498
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,800
grandmaster

2499
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:43,678
uh you know i get wiped out in you know

2500
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,600
10 flies right

2501
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:47,039
and you know i have to think about my

2502
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,199
move for

2503
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:51,439
you know like 15 minutes

2504
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:53,678
uh and the person in front of me the

2505
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:56,158
grandmaster you know would just like

2506
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:57,760
react within seconds right

2507
01:21:56,158 --> 01:21:59,279
you know he doesn't need to

2508
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,560
think about it that's become part of the

2509
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:01,679
subconscious because you know it's

2510
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,840
basically just

2511
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:04,639
pattern recognition at this point

2512
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,800
um

2513
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,560
same you know you the first few hours

2514
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,760
you drive a car you're really attentive

2515
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:13,039
you can't do anything else and then

2516
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,480
after 20-30 hours of practice 50 hours

2517
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:15,760
you know a subconscious you can talk to

2518
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:16,879
the person next to you you know things

2519
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,320
like that right

2520
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,679
unless the situation becomes

2521
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:20,960
unpredictable and then you have to stop

2522
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:22,880
talking

2523
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,639
so that suggests you only have one model

2524
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,920
in your head

2525
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:27,199
and

2526
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,800
it might suggest the idea that

2527
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:30,799
consciousness basically is the module

2528
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,639
that configures this world model of

2529
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,239
yours you know you need to have some

2530
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:37,199
sort of

2531
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:38,559
executive kind of overseer that

2532
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:40,479
configures your word model for the

2533
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,480
situation at hand

2534
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:44,479
and that that leads to kind of the

2535
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:46,000
really curious concept that

2536
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:48,000
consciousness is not a consequence of

2537
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,760
the power of our minds but of the

2538
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,920
limitation of our brains

2539
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:54,239
but because we have only one world model

2540
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:56,319
we have to be conscious if we had as

2541
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:58,479
many role models as

2542
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:00,639
there are situations we encounter then

2543
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:01,919
we could do all of them simultaneously

2544
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,199
and we wouldn't need this sort of

2545
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,399
executive control that we call

2546
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:06,799
consciousness

2547
01:23:04,399 --> 01:23:08,799
yeah interesting and somehow maybe that

2548
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,079
executive controller

2549
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,520
i mean the the hard problem of

2550
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:13,679
consciousness there's some kind of

2551
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,880
chemicals in biology that's creating a

2552
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:16,960
feeling

2553
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,800
like it feels to experience some of

2554
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:22,239
these things

2555
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:24,000
that's kind of like the hard question is

2556
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:26,000
what the heck is that and why is that

2557
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,238
useful maybe the more pragmatic question

2558
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,920
why is it useful to feel like

2559
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:32,000
this is really you

2560
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,199
experiencing this versus just like

2561
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,198
information

2562
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:38,158
being processed

2563
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:40,238
um it could be just a very nice side

2564
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:42,960
effect of um

2565
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:44,879
of the way we evolved that's just very

2566
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,840
useful to

2567
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,800
to uh

2568
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:50,639
feel a sense of uh ownership to the

2569
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,159
decisions you make to the perceptions

2570
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:54,639
you make to the model you're trying to

2571
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:56,479
maintain like you own this thing

2572
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,719
and it's the only one you got and if you

2573
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:01,119
lose it it's gonna really suck and so

2574
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:03,920
you should really send the brain some

2575
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,920
signals about it

2576
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:08,800
what ideas do you believe might be true

2577
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:11,119
that most or at least many people

2578
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,400
disagree with you with

2579
01:24:11,119 --> 01:24:13,599
let's say in the space of machine

2580
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:15,519
learning

2581
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,800
well it depends who you talk about but

2582
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,360
i think

2583
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,800
so certainly there is uh

2584
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:22,319
a bunch of people who are nativists

2585
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,440
right who think that a lot of the basic

2586
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:26,319
things about the world are kind of

2587
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:27,439
hardwired in our you know minds

2588
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:29,039
things like you know the world is

2589
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:32,079
three-dimensional for example is that

2590
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:34,479
hardwired things like uh you know object

2591
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:36,559
permanence is something that we learn uh

2592
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:39,439
you know before the age of three months

2593
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:41,360
or so or are we born with it and there

2594
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,359
are you know very disa you know

2595
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:45,519
white disagreement among the you know

2596
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:46,399
cognitive scientists

2597
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,600
for this

2598
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:49,198
i think those things are actually very

2599
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,000
simple to learn

2600
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:52,158
um

2601
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,238
you know is it the case that the

2602
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:56,319
oriented edge detectors in v1 are

2603
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:57,678
learned or are they hardwired i think

2604
01:24:56,319 --> 01:24:59,519
they are learned they might be learned

2605
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:01,520
before both because it's really easy to

2606
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,000
generate signals from the retina that

2607
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:05,840
actually will train edge detectors so

2608
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,880
um and again those are

2609
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,600
things that can be learned within

2610
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,039
minutes of uh opening your eyes right i

2611
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,360
mean

2612
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:14,880
you know since the 1990s we have

2613
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:17,039
algorithms that can learn oriented

2614
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,719
detectors completely unsupervised with

2615
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:19,760
the equivalent of a few minutes of real

2616
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:21,840
time so

2617
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,920
uh so those things have to be learned

2618
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,679
um and there's also those you know mit

2619
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,960
experiments where you kind of

2620
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:28,960
plug the

2621
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,800
optical nerve on the auditory cortex of

2622
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,079
a baby ferret right and that auditory

2623
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,279
cortex becomes a visual cortex

2624
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:35,198
essentially

2625
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:37,840
so you know clearly

2626
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:40,319
there's running taking place there

2627
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,840
so you know i think a lot of what people

2628
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:43,039
think are so basic that they need to be

2629
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,079
hardwired

2630
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:45,679
i think a lot of those things are

2631
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:47,760
learned because they are easy to learn

2632
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:50,239
jesus so you put a lot of

2633
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,159
value in the power of learning what kind

2634
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:53,279
of things do you suspect might not be

2635
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:54,960
learned

2636
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:55,920
is there something that could not be

2637
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:59,039
learned

2638
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:01,039
so your intrinsic drives are not learned

2639
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:02,800
they they there are the things that you

2640
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:05,198
know make humans uh

2641
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:08,159
human or make you know

2642
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:09,439
cats different from dogs right it's the

2643
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:12,799
the basic drives that are kind of

2644
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:13,919
hard-wired in our basal ganglia

2645
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,199
i mean there are people who are working

2646
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,719
on on this kind of stuff that's called

2647
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:19,039
intrinsic motivation in the context of

2648
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:20,560
reinforcement learning um so these are

2649
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:22,960
objective functions where the reward

2650
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,719
doesn't come from the external world

2651
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,480
it's computed by your own brain your own

2652
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,079
brain computes

2653
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:30,799
whether you're happy or not right it

2654
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:33,359
measures your degree of uh

2655
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,079
comfort or in comfort

2656
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:35,679
and

2657
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:37,279
and because it's your brain computing

2658
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:39,520
this presumably knows also how to

2659
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:40,880
estimate gradients of this right so

2660
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,440
um

2661
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:46,960
so it's easier to to learn when your

2662
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:49,919
objective is is intrinsic

2663
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,279
so that has to be hardwired

2664
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,679
the critic that makes long-term

2665
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:54,800
prediction of the outcome which is the

2666
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:57,679
eventual

2667
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:59,679
result of this that's learned

2668
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:01,600
and perception is learned and your model

2669
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,119
of the world is learned but let me take

2670
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,360
take an example of you know why the

2671
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:08,079
critic i mean example of how the critic

2672
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:09,599
might be learned right if i uh if i come

2673
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:11,600
to you um

2674
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,920
you know i reach across the table and i

2675
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,800
pinch your arm right complete surprise

2676
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,239
for you

2677
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,679
you would not have expected this i was

2678
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:19,359
expecting that the whole time but yes

2679
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:21,039
right let's say for the sake of the

2680
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:24,479
story yes

2681
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:26,238
um okay your visual ganglia is going to

2682
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:28,319
light up because it's going to hurt

2683
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:30,000
right

2684
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:32,238
and now your model of the world includes

2685
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,920
the fact that i may pinch you if i

2686
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:36,879
approach my uh

2687
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:39,039
my uh don't trust humans right

2688
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,960
my hand to your arm so if i try again

2689
01:27:39,039 --> 01:27:41,920
you're gonna recoil and that's your

2690
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,920
critic

2691
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,000
uh your predictive

2692
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:48,399
you know your predictor of your uh

2693
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,359
ultimate pain uh

2694
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:50,319
uh

2695
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:51,759
system

2696
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:53,198
that predicts that something bad is

2697
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,039
going to happen when you recoil right to

2698
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:57,039
avoid it so even that can be learned

2699
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:59,519
that is drawing definitely this is what

2700
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:01,600
allows you also to uh you know define

2701
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,600
some goals right so

2702
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,840
um the fact that you know you're a

2703
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:09,039
school child you wake up in the morning

2704
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:10,960
and you go to school and you know

2705
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:12,880
it's not because you necessarily like

2706
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,079
waking up early and going to school but

2707
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,159
you know that there is a long-term

2708
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:17,519
objective you're trying to optimize so

2709
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:19,679
ernest becker i'm not sure if you're

2710
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:21,679
familiar with the philosopher he wrote

2711
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:23,359
the book denial of death and his idea is

2712
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:25,520
that one of the core motivations of

2713
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:27,119
human beings is our terror of death our

2714
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,800
fear of death

2715
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:31,439
that's what makes us unique from cats

2716
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,480
cats are just surviving they do not have

2717
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:33,599
a

2718
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:35,198
deep

2719
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,639
under like

2720
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:39,119
cognizance

2721
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:41,679
introspection that

2722
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:43,439
over the horizon is the end

2723
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:44,960
and he says that i mean there's a terror

2724
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:47,359
management theory that just all these

2725
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,119
psychological experiments that show

2726
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:51,439
the basically

2727
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:53,760
this idea that

2728
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:57,279
all of human civilization everything we

2729
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,119
create is kind of trying to forget if

2730
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:00,559
even for a brief moment that we're going

2731
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:02,960
to die

2732
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,960
when when do you think humans

2733
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,719
understand that they're going to die is

2734
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,880
it learned early on

2735
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:11,760
also like

2736
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,039
i don't know at what point i mean it's a

2737
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,280
it's a question like you know at what

2738
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:17,279
point do you realize that you know what

2739
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,800
death really is and i think most people

2740
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:20,079
don't actually realize what death is

2741
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,760
right i mean most people believe that

2742
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:22,479
you go to heaven or something right well

2743
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,039
so

2744
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:28,158
to push back on that what ernest becker

2745
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:29,198
says and um sheldon solomon all of those

2746
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:30,960
folks

2747
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:32,879
and i find those ideas a little bit

2748
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,960
compelling is that there is moments in

2749
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,480
life early in life a lot of this fun

2750
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,800
happens early in life

2751
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:41,678
when you are

2752
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:44,000
uh when you do deeply experience the

2753
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,840
terror of this realization and all the

2754
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,520
things you think about about religion

2755
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,440
all those kinds of things that we kind

2756
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,560
of think about more like teenage years

2757
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:52,238
and later

2758
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,360
we're talking about way earlier no it's

2759
01:29:52,238 --> 01:29:56,079
like seven or eight years or something

2760
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:57,439
like that yeah you realize

2761
01:29:56,079 --> 01:30:00,079
holy crap

2762
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:02,719
this is uh like the mystery the terror

2763
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:04,719
like it's almost like you're a little

2764
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,880
prey a little baby deer sitting in the

2765
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,800
darkness of the jungle of the woods

2766
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:11,119
looking all around you the darkness full

2767
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:13,199
of terror i mean that's that realization

2768
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:15,519
says okay i'm gonna go go back in the

2769
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:18,079
comfort of my mind where there's a well

2770
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:20,880
there is a deep meaning where there's a

2771
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:22,079
maybe like pretend i'm immortal however

2772
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,119
way

2773
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:27,039
however kind of idea i can construct to

2774
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:29,359
help me understand that i'm immortal

2775
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:31,279
religion helps with that you can you can

2776
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:33,279
delude yourself in all kinds of ways

2777
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:35,439
like lose yourself in the busyness of

2778
01:30:33,279 --> 01:30:36,800
each day have little goals in mind all

2779
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:38,799
those kinds of things to think that it's

2780
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,880
going to go on forever and you kind of

2781
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:43,119
know you're going to die yeah and it's

2782
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,119
going to be sad but you don't really

2783
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:46,800
understand that you're going to die and

2784
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:48,479
so that's that's their idea and if i

2785
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,440
find that compelling

2786
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:53,839
because it does seem to be a core unique

2787
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:55,839
aspect of human nature that we were able

2788
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,279
to think that we're going we're able to

2789
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,440
really understand

2790
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:00,960
that this life is finite

2791
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:01,919
that seems important

2792
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,198
there's a bunch of different things

2793
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,560
there so first of all i don't think

2794
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:07,359
there is a qualitative difference

2795
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,960
between between us and cats in the term

2796
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:11,519
i think the difference is that we just

2797
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,960
have a better long-term

2798
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,440
ability to

2799
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,719
predict you know in the long term and so

2800
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:17,839
we have a better understanding of how

2801
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:19,760
the world works so we have better

2802
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,440
understanding of you know finance of

2803
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,320
life and things like that so we have a

2804
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:27,759
better planning engine than cats yeah

2805
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:29,439
okay um but what's the motivation for

2806
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,800
for planning well i think it's just a

2807
01:31:29,439 --> 01:31:32,559
side effect of the fact that we have

2808
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:35,199
just a better planning engine because it

2809
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,800
makes us uh as i said you know the

2810
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:39,198
essence of intelligence is the ability

2811
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,320
to predict and so the because we're

2812
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:41,678
smarter

2813
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:43,279
as a side effect we also have this

2814
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:45,039
ability to kind of make predictions

2815
01:31:43,279 --> 01:31:48,319
about our own

2816
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:50,639
future existence or lack thereof okay

2817
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:52,799
you say religion helps with that i think

2818
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:54,319
religion hurts actually

2819
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,920
it makes people worry about like you

2820
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:57,359
know what's going to happen after their

2821
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,440
death etc

2822
01:31:57,359 --> 01:32:00,799
if you believe that you know

2823
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:01,839
you just don't exist after that so like

2824
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,360
you know it solves completely the

2825
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,520
problem at least you're saying if you

2826
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:08,158
don't believe in god you don't worry

2827
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,920
about what happens after death yeah

2828
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:10,879
i don't know why you worry about the

2829
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,399
about

2830
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:14,079
you know this life because that's the

2831
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:16,000
only one you have

2832
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:17,600
i think it's well i don't i don't know

2833
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,800
if i were to say what ernest becker says

2834
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:23,520
and i said i agree with him more

2835
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:26,800
uh than not is um

2836
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:28,480
you do deeply worry uh if you if you

2837
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,679
believe there's no god there's still a

2838
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:34,079
deep worry like of the mystery of it all

2839
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:36,880
like how does that make any sense that

2840
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:38,639
it just ends i don't think we can

2841
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,639
truly understand

2842
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:42,960
that this ride i mean so much of our

2843
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:46,239
life the consciousness the ego

2844
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,520
is uh invested in this in this being and

2845
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:49,919
then

2846
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,360
science keeps bringing humanity down

2847
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:54,158
from its pedestal

2848
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:56,559
and yeah that's another another example

2849
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:58,479
of it that's wonderful but for us

2850
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,719
individual humans we don't like to be

2851
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:01,599
brought down from a pedestal

2852
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,000
like

2853
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:05,520
but see you're fine with it because well

2854
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,960
so what ernest becker would say is

2855
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,560
you're fine with it because that's just

2856
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,319
a more peaceful existence for you but

2857
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,080
you're not really fine you're hiding

2858
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:14,158
from in fact some of the people that

2859
01:33:12,079 --> 01:33:15,279
experience the deepest trauma

2860
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:16,879
uh that

2861
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:19,039
earlier in life

2862
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,600
they often before they seek extensive

2863
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:23,359
therapy will say i'm fine it's like when

2864
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,280
you talk to people who are truly angry

2865
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:27,599
how are you doing i'm fine

2866
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:29,359
the question is what's going on

2867
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:32,719
now i had a near death experience i had

2868
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:34,880
a very bad uh motorbike accident when i

2869
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:37,760
was 17. so

2870
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,119
but that didn't have any impact on

2871
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,880
my

2872
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:42,238
reflection on that topic so i'm

2873
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,319
basically just playing a bit of a

2874
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:45,678
devil's advocate pushing back and

2875
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:47,840
wondering

2876
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:49,359
is it truly possible to accept death and

2877
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,360
the flip side that's more interesting i

2878
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:54,479
think for ai and

2879
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:57,039
robotics is how important is it to have

2880
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:59,359
this as one of the suite of motivations

2881
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:02,238
is to

2882
01:33:59,359 --> 01:34:03,679
not just avoid

2883
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:05,279
falling off the roof or something like

2884
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:06,880
that but

2885
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:07,599
ponder

2886
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,079
the

2887
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,560
the end of the ride

2888
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:14,719
if you listen to the stoics

2889
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:18,080
it's uh it's a great motivator

2890
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:21,439
it adds a sense of urgency so maybe to

2891
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:23,198
truly fear death or be cognizant of it

2892
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:25,678
might give

2893
01:34:23,198 --> 01:34:27,599
a deeper meaning and urgency to the

2894
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,719
moment to live

2895
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,480
fully

2896
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,319
well

2897
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:34,799
maybe i don't disagree with that uh i

2898
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:36,639
mean i think what motivates me here is

2899
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,320
uh

2900
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:40,719
you know knowing more about about human

2901
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:42,399
nature i mean i think uh human nature

2902
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:44,399
and human intelligence is a big mystery

2903
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:47,279
it's a scientific mystery

2904
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:50,079
uh in addition to you know philosophical

2905
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:51,519
and etc but you know i'm a true believer

2906
01:34:50,079 --> 01:34:53,118
in science so

2907
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:56,080
um

2908
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:58,079
and and and i do have kind of a belief

2909
01:34:56,079 --> 01:35:02,399
that for complex systems like like the

2910
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:04,399
brain on the mind the the way to

2911
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:06,960
understand it is try to reproduce it

2912
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:08,719
with you know artifacts that you build

2913
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,158
because you know what's essential to it

2914
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:11,118
when you try to build it you know the

2915
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:12,719
same way

2916
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:15,679
i've used this analogy before with you i

2917
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:17,359
believe um the same way we only started

2918
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,719
to understand uh

2919
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:20,319
aerodynamics when we started building

2920
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,000
airplanes and that helped us understand

2921
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:24,079
how birds fly

2922
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,319
you know so i think there's kind of a

2923
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:28,000
similar process here where

2924
01:35:26,319 --> 01:35:29,439
we don't have a theory of a full theory

2925
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,039
of intelligence

2926
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:33,279
but building you know intelligent

2927
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:34,238
artifacts will help us perhaps develop

2928
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:36,238
some

2929
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:38,718
you know underlying theory that

2930
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:41,359
encompasses not just artificial

2931
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:43,279
implements but also

2932
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:44,719
human and biological intelligence in

2933
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:46,960
general so you're an interesting person

2934
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:49,359
to ask this question about

2935
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:51,279
sort of all kinds of different other

2936
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:53,118
intelligent entities

2937
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:55,359
or intelligences

2938
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:57,198
what are your thoughts about kind of

2939
01:35:55,359 --> 01:35:59,359
like the touring or the chinese room

2940
01:35:57,198 --> 01:36:02,879
question

2941
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:05,279
if we create an ai system that exhibits

2942
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:07,440
a lot of properties of intelligence and

2943
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:09,519
consciousness

2944
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:12,479
how comfortable are you thinking of that

2945
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:14,400
entity as intelligent or conscious

2946
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:15,839
so you're trying to build now systems

2947
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:17,679
that have intelligence and there's

2948
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:19,119
metrics about their performance but that

2949
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:20,239
metric

2950
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:22,399
is

2951
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:24,879
external

2952
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:27,118
okay so how are you are you okay calling

2953
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,880
a thing intelligent are you going to be

2954
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:30,399
like most humans

2955
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,480
and be uh

2956
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:34,319
once again unhappy to be brought down

2957
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:36,399
from a pedestal of consciousness slash

2958
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:38,479
intelligence no i'm i'll be very happy

2959
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:41,118
to

2960
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:41,118
understand

2961
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:45,519
more about human nature human mind and

2962
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,118
human intelligence

2963
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,800
through the construction of machines

2964
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:51,439
that

2965
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,679
have similar abilities and

2966
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:56,158
if a consequence of this is to bring

2967
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:57,840
down humanity one notch down from

2968
01:36:56,158 --> 01:36:59,439
it's already okay

2969
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,880
i'm just fine with it that's just the

2970
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:03,039
reality of life

2971
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:05,279
um so i'm fine with that now you were

2972
01:37:03,039 --> 01:37:06,880
asking me about things that uh opinions

2973
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:07,840
i have that a lot of people may disagree

2974
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,359
with

2975
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,520
i think

2976
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:12,799
uh

2977
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,239
if we think about the design of an

2978
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,719
autonomous intelligence system so

2979
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:18,559
assuming that we are somewhat successful

2980
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,000
at some at some level

2981
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,480
of getting machines to learn models of

2982
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,800
the world predicting models of the world

2983
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:26,399
we have we build intrinsic motivation

2984
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,079
objective functions to drive the

2985
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:29,920
behavior of that system

2986
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:31,920
the system also has perception modules

2987
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,920
that allows it to estimate the state of

2988
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:35,359
the world and then have some way of

2989
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:37,039
figuring out the sequence of actions

2990
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:39,118
that you know to optimize a particular

2991
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:41,600
objective

2992
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:43,519
if it has a critic of the type that was

2993
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,119
describing before the thing that makes

2994
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,840
you recall your arm the second time i

2995
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:48,399
tried to pinch you

2996
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:50,319
um

2997
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:51,439
intelligent autonomous machine will have

2998
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:54,158
emotions

2999
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:56,238
i think emotions are an integral part of

3000
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:58,879
autonomous intelligence

3001
01:37:56,238 --> 01:38:01,039
if you have an intelligent system

3002
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:03,840
that is driven by

3003
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:05,198
intrinsic motivation by objectives

3004
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,960
if it has

3005
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:09,198
a critic that allows you to predict in

3006
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,560
advance whether the outcome of a

3007
01:38:09,198 --> 01:38:12,238
of a situation is going to be good or

3008
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,320
bad is going to have emotions it's going

3009
01:38:12,238 --> 01:38:16,158
to have fear yes

3010
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,000
when it predicts that the outcome is

3011
01:38:16,158 --> 01:38:20,079
gonna is gonna be bad

3012
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,600
and and something to avoid is gonna have

3013
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:22,800
elation when it predicts it's gonna be

3014
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,159
good

3015
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:28,800
um uh if it has drives to

3016
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:31,118
relate with humans um you know in some

3017
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,239
ways the way humans have

3018
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:34,319
um

3019
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:36,638
you know it's it's gonna be social right

3020
01:38:34,319 --> 01:38:38,559
and so it's gonna have emotions about

3021
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:39,359
attachment and and things of that type

3022
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,760
so

3023
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,719
um so i think uh you know the the sort

3024
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,239
of

3025
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:46,239
sci-fi

3026
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:47,919
thing where you know you see commander

3027
01:38:46,238 --> 01:38:49,919
data like having an emotion chip that

3028
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,600
you can turn off right

3029
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:53,279
i think that's ridiculous

3030
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,199
so i mean here's the difficult

3031
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:57,759
philosophical

3032
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:59,839
social question

3033
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:02,320
do you think there will be a time

3034
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,520
like a civil rights movement for robots

3035
01:39:02,319 --> 01:39:05,519
where

3036
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:09,600
um okay forget the movement but a

3037
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,600
discussion like the supreme court

3038
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:15,520
that particular kinds of robots

3039
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:18,239
you know particular kinds of systems

3040
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:20,239
um deserve the same rights as humans

3041
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:22,799
because they can suffer

3042
01:39:20,238 --> 01:39:24,839
just as humans can

3043
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:27,760
all those kinds of things

3044
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:29,199
well perhaps perhaps not like imagine

3045
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:31,840
that humans were

3046
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:34,000
that that you could uh

3047
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,079
you know die and be restored like you

3048
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,920
know you could be sort of you know be 3d

3049
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:40,639
reprinted and you know your brain could

3050
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:42,158
be reconstructed in its finest details

3051
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:43,039
our ideas of rights will change in that

3052
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:45,759
case

3053
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:47,198
if you can always just

3054
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:49,760
there's always a backup you could always

3055
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:52,000
restore maybe like the importance of

3056
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:54,079
murder will go down one notch that's

3057
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,760
right but also the uh

3058
01:39:54,079 --> 01:39:57,439
your your

3059
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,039
you know desire to do dangerous things

3060
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:03,198
like you know

3061
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:05,679
you know doing skydiving or or you know

3062
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:06,879
or or you know race car driving

3063
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:09,279
you know car racing all that kind of

3064
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,118
stuff you know would probably increase

3065
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:12,639
or or you know airplane aerobatics or

3066
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:14,319
that kind of stuff right yeah it would

3067
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:15,279
be fine to do a lot of those things or

3068
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:17,039
explore

3069
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:18,479
you know dangerous areas and things like

3070
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:19,920
that it would kind of change your

3071
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:21,599
relationship so

3072
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:25,199
now it's very likely that robots would

3073
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:27,119
be like that because you know they'll be

3074
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:29,198
based on perhaps technology that is

3075
01:40:27,118 --> 01:40:30,719
somewhat similar to

3076
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:32,158
today's technology and you can you can

3077
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:34,399
always have a backup

3078
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:35,679
so it's possible

3079
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:38,238
i don't know if you like video games but

3080
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:41,279
there's a there's a game called diablo

3081
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:43,919
and um oh my my sons are huge fans of

3082
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:45,519
this yes uh

3083
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,960
and in fact they made a game that's

3084
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,760
inspired by it

3085
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,639
awesome

3086
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:52,480
like built a game my three sons have a

3087
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,000
game design studio between them yeah

3088
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:55,198
that's awesome they came out with a game

3089
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,279
like it just came out nice again last

3090
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:59,359
year no this was last year earlier about

3091
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:00,880
a year ago that's awesome but so in

3092
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:03,519
diablo there's a something called

3093
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,639
hardcore mode which if you die there's

3094
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:07,679
no

3095
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:10,560
you're gone right that's it and so it's

3096
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:12,480
possible with ai systems

3097
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,639
for them to be able to operate

3098
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:16,238
successfully and for us to treat them in

3099
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:18,400
a certain way because they have to be

3100
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:21,118
integrated in human society

3101
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:23,839
they have to be able to die no copies

3102
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:25,359
allowed in fact copying is illegal it's

3103
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:27,440
possible with humans as well like

3104
01:41:25,359 --> 01:41:28,559
cloning will be illegal even what's

3105
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:30,158
possible because

3106
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,920
cloning is not copying right i mean you

3107
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:33,279
don't reproduce the

3108
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,520
the mind of the person and like

3109
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:36,238
experience right it's just a delay twin

3110
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,239
so

3111
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:39,839
but then it's what we were talking about

3112
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:41,359
with computers that you'll be able to

3113
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,520
copy you right you'll be able to

3114
01:41:41,359 --> 01:41:45,039
perfectly save pickle

3115
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,440
the the

3116
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:49,519
the mind state and

3117
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:50,719
it's possible that that would be illegal

3118
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,360
because

3119
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:54,880
that goes against um

3120
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:55,839
that will destroy the motivations of the

3121
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:57,840
system

3122
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,719
okay so let's say you you have a

3123
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:02,319
domestic robot okay sometime in the

3124
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:05,039
future yes

3125
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:07,039
and uh the domestic robot you know comes

3126
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:08,880
to you kind of somewhat pre-trained you

3127
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:10,560
know it can do a bunch of things yes but

3128
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:11,600
it has a particular personality that

3129
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:13,119
makes it slightly different from the

3130
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:15,199
other robots because that makes them

3131
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:17,039
more interesting and then because it's

3132
01:42:15,198 --> 01:42:18,879
you know it's live with you for five

3133
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:22,479
years you've you've grown some

3134
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:24,079
attachment to it and vice versa and it's

3135
01:42:22,479 --> 01:42:25,759
learned a lot about you

3136
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:27,760
or maybe it's not a household robot

3137
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,600
maybe it's uh maybe it's a virtual

3138
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:31,360
assistant that lives in your you know

3139
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,159
augmented reality glasses or whatever

3140
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:34,479
right

3141
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:35,279
uh you know the horror movie type thing

3142
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:36,559
right

3143
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:39,519
um

3144
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,560
and that system to some extent

3145
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,400
the the

3146
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,400
intelligence in that system

3147
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:46,960
is a bit like your child or maybe your

3148
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:48,799
phd student in a sense that

3149
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:51,039
there's a lot of you in that in that

3150
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,520
machine now right yeah and so

3151
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:54,880
if it were a living thing

3152
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,880
you would do this

3153
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:59,760
for free if you want right if it's your

3154
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:02,079
child your child can you know then

3155
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,840
live his or her own life and you know

3156
01:43:02,079 --> 01:43:05,359
the fact that they learn stuff from you

3157
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,079
doesn't mean that you have any ownership

3158
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:10,319
of it right yeah but if it's a robot

3159
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:13,439
that you've trained perhaps you have

3160
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:15,439
some uh yeah intellectual property claim

3161
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:18,319
about intellectual property oh i thought

3162
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:20,158
you meant like uh permanent value in the

3163
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:22,000
sense this part of you is in well there

3164
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:24,079
is permanent value right so you would

3165
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,679
lose a lot if that robot were to be

3166
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:27,198
destroyed and you you had no backup you

3167
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:29,359
would lose a lot you know you a lot of

3168
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:31,678
investment you know kind of like a

3169
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:33,759
uh you know a person dying you know um

3170
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:35,920
that that a friend of a friend of you

3171
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:38,400
was dying or or a co-worker or something

3172
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:40,639
like that um

3173
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:42,479
but also uh you have like

3174
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:44,319
intellectual property rights in the

3175
01:43:42,479 --> 01:43:46,158
sense that that

3176
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:48,079
that system is fine-tuned to your

3177
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:50,559
particular existence so that's now a

3178
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:52,238
very unique instantiation of that

3179
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:54,080
original background model whatever it

3180
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:55,359
was that arrived

3181
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:56,800
and then there are issues of privacy

3182
01:43:55,359 --> 01:43:59,839
right because now

3183
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:01,600
imagine that that robot has its own kind

3184
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,760
of volition and decides to work from

3185
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:05,199
someone else yes or kind of you know

3186
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,199
thinks

3187
01:44:05,198 --> 01:44:09,519
life with you is sort of untenable or

3188
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:11,678
whatever right um

3189
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,600
now all the things that that system

3190
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:14,560
learned from you

3191
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,840
uh

3192
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,199
you know how

3193
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,480
can you like you know delete all the

3194
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:20,479
personal information that that system

3195
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:21,759
knows about you yeah

3196
01:44:20,479 --> 01:44:24,158
i mean that would be kind of an ethical

3197
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:27,360
question like you know can you erase the

3198
01:44:24,158 --> 01:44:30,000
the mind of a of a intelligent robot

3199
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:31,759
uh to protect your your privacy yeah you

3200
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,560
can't do this with humans you can ask

3201
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:36,159
them to shut up but that you don't have

3202
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:37,600
complete power over them can't erase

3203
01:44:36,158 --> 01:44:40,000
humans yeah it's the problem with

3204
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:41,520
relationships you know that you break up

3205
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,399
you can't you can't erase the other

3206
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:44,320
human

3207
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:46,960
with robots i think it'll have to be the

3208
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:50,079
same thing with robots that that risk

3209
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:51,840
that there has to be um

3210
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:53,840
some

3211
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,719
risk to our interactions to truly

3212
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:58,480
experience them deeply it feels like so

3213
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:59,520
you have to be able to lose your robot

3214
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:01,519
friend

3215
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:04,159
and that robot friend to go tweeting

3216
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:06,400
about how much of an you are but

3217
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:08,079
then are you allowed to you know murder

3218
01:45:06,399 --> 01:45:09,519
the robot to protect your private

3219
01:45:08,079 --> 01:45:12,079
information yeah probably decides to

3220
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:14,400
leave i have the situation that for

3221
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:16,880
robots with with certain

3222
01:45:14,399 --> 01:45:19,039
like it's almost like uh regulation if

3223
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:20,639
you declare your robot to be

3224
01:45:19,039 --> 01:45:22,880
let's call it sentient or something like

3225
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,560
that like this this robot is designed

3226
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,159
for human interaction then you're not

3227
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,480
allowed to murder these robots it's the

3228
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:30,079
same as murdering other humans well but

3229
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:32,158
what about you do a backup of the robot

3230
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:33,679
you do preserve on the on on a hard

3231
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:35,118
drive or the equivalent in the future

3232
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:36,158
that might be illegal just like it's

3233
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:38,238
like

3234
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:39,920
priority uh piracy is illegal but it's

3235
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:42,000
your own it's your own robot right but

3236
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:44,399
you can't you don't but then but then

3237
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,238
you can wipe out

3238
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,079
his brain so the this robot doesn't know

3239
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:48,879
anything about you anymore but you still

3240
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:50,479
have

3241
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:52,239
technically a certain existence because

3242
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:54,079
you backed it up and then there'll be

3243
01:45:52,238 --> 01:45:56,559
these great speeches at the supreme

3244
01:45:54,079 --> 01:45:58,319
court by saying oh sure you can erase

3245
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:00,639
the mind of the robot just like you can

3246
01:45:58,319 --> 01:46:02,559
erase the mind of a human we both can

3247
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:05,520
suffer there'll be some epic like obama

3248
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:07,360
type character with a speech that we we

3249
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,639
like the robots and the humans are the

3250
01:46:07,359 --> 01:46:11,198
same

3251
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:12,719
we can both suffer we can both hope

3252
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:14,799
we can both

3253
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:17,118
all those all those kinds of things

3254
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:19,440
raise families all that kind of stuff

3255
01:46:17,118 --> 01:46:21,039
it's it's uh interesting for these just

3256
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:24,879
like you said emotion seems to be a

3257
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:26,319
fascinatingly powerful aspect of human

3258
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:28,319
human interaction human robot

3259
01:46:26,319 --> 01:46:30,319
interaction and if they're able to

3260
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:32,238
exhibit emotions

3261
01:46:30,319 --> 01:46:33,519
at the end of the day that's probably

3262
01:46:32,238 --> 01:46:35,839
going to

3263
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:37,920
have us deeply consider

3264
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:40,239
human rights like what we value in

3265
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:42,158
humans what we value in other animals

3266
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:44,158
that's why robots and ai is great it

3267
01:46:42,158 --> 01:46:46,079
makes us ask uh really good questions

3268
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:47,759
the hard questions yeah but

3269
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:49,600
you ask about you asked about the

3270
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:51,600
chinese room type argument you know is

3271
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:53,119
it real if it looks real yeah i think

3272
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:55,039
the chinese room argument is the

3273
01:46:53,118 --> 01:46:56,639
ridiculous one so

3274
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:57,679
so so for people who don't know chinese

3275
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:59,840
room is

3276
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:02,399
uh you ca you can i don't even know how

3277
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,880
to formulate it well but basically

3278
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:06,799
you can mimic the behavior of an

3279
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:10,159
intelligent system by just following a

3280
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:12,480
giant algorithm code book that tells you

3281
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:14,719
exactly how to respond in exactly each

3282
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:16,718
case but is that really intelligent it's

3283
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:18,560
like a giant lookup table when this

3284
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:20,960
person says this you answer this when

3285
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,639
this person says this you answer this

3286
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,239
and

3287
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:26,400
if you understand how that works you

3288
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:28,479
have this giant nearly infinite lookup

3289
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:30,399
table is that really intelligence

3290
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:32,638
because intelligence seems to be

3291
01:47:30,399 --> 01:47:34,559
a mechanism that's much more interesting

3292
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:37,039
and complex than this lookup table i

3293
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:38,800
don't think so so the i mean the real

3294
01:47:37,039 --> 01:47:40,000
question comes down to

3295
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:41,360
do you think

3296
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,198
uh

3297
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:45,118
you know you can you can mechanize uh

3298
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:47,359
intelligence in some way even if that

3299
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:49,279
involves uh learning

3300
01:47:47,359 --> 01:47:50,559
and the answer is of course yes there's

3301
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:52,960
no question

3302
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:55,600
there's a second question then which is

3303
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,359
uh assuming you can uh reproduce

3304
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,280
intelligence in sort of different

3305
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:00,960
hardware than biological hardware you

3306
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:02,319
know like computers

3307
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,359
uh

3308
01:48:02,319 --> 01:48:04,719
can you

3309
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:08,319
you know

3310
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:10,480
match uh human intelligence in

3311
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:12,799
all the domains in which

3312
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:14,799
humans are intelligent

3313
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:17,440
is it possible right so that's the

3314
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,480
hypothesis of a strong ai the answer to

3315
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:20,799
this

3316
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:22,638
in my opinion is unqualified yes this

3317
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,159
will swell happen at some point there's

3318
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:25,600
no question that

3319
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:27,039
machines at some point will become more

3320
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,360
intelligent than humans in all domains

3321
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:30,880
where humans are intelligent this is not

3322
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:34,639
for tomorrow it's going to take a long

3323
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:38,000
time regardless of what you know

3324
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:40,560
elon and others have claimed or believed

3325
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:43,198
this is a lot a lot harder than many of

3326
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,639
many of those guys think it is

3327
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:46,559
and many of those guys who thought it

3328
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:48,239
was simpler than that years you know

3329
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:50,320
five years ago now i think it's hard

3330
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:52,000
because it's been five years and they

3331
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:53,198
realize it's it's gonna take a lot

3332
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,560
longer

3333
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:56,559
that includes a bunch of people deepmind

3334
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,320
for example but um oh interesting i

3335
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,719
haven't actually uh touched base with

3336
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:01,840
the deepmind folks but some of it elon

3337
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:04,639
or

3338
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:07,600
uh democracy i mean sometimes

3339
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:09,600
your role you have to kind of

3340
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:11,760
create deadlines that are nearer than

3341
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:13,520
farther away yeah to kind of create an

3342
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,119
urgency because you know you have to

3343
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:16,480
believe the impossible as possible in

3344
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:18,880
order to accomplish it and there's of

3345
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:20,000
course a flip side to that coin but it's

3346
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,520
it's a weird

3347
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,840
you can't be too cynical if you want to

3348
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:25,440
get something done absolutely i i agree

3349
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,719
with that but um

3350
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:29,279
i mean you have to inspire people right

3351
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:31,279
to work on certain ambitious things

3352
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:33,840
um

3353
01:49:31,279 --> 01:49:35,679
so you know it's it's uh it's certainly

3354
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:37,119
a lot harder than we believe but there's

3355
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:38,960
no question in my mind that this will

3356
01:49:37,118 --> 01:49:40,559
this will happen and now you know people

3357
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,439
are kind of worried about what does that

3358
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,719
mean

3359
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:44,238
for humans

3360
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:46,000
they are going to be brought down from

3361
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:47,198
their pedestal you know a bunch of

3362
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,760
notches

3363
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:50,638
with that and uh

3364
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:51,760
you know

3365
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,359
is that going to be good or bad i mean

3366
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:55,280
it's just going to give more power right

3367
01:49:53,359 --> 01:49:57,839
it's an amplifier for human intelligence

3368
01:49:55,279 --> 01:49:59,679
really so speaking of doing cool

3369
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,639
ambitious things

3370
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:02,960
fair

3371
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:05,359
the facebook ai research group has

3372
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,399
recently celebrated its 8th birthday

3373
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:08,479
or

3374
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:10,399
maybe you can correct me on that

3375
01:50:08,479 --> 01:50:12,879
looking back what has been

3376
01:50:10,399 --> 01:50:14,319
the successes the failures the lessons

3377
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:16,639
learned from the eight years affair and

3378
01:50:14,319 --> 01:50:17,519
maybe you can also give context of where

3379
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:20,159
does

3380
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:22,480
the newly minted meta ai

3381
01:50:20,158 --> 01:50:23,598
fit into how does it relate to fare

3382
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:26,559
right so let me tell you a little bit

3383
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:28,560
about the organization of all this uh uh

3384
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,639
yeah fair was created almost exactly

3385
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:32,960
eight years ago uh it wasn't called fair

3386
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:34,480
yet it took that name a few a few months

3387
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:37,679
later

3388
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:40,000
and at the time i joined facebook there

3389
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:41,199
was a group called the ai group that had

3390
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,960
about 12

3391
01:50:41,198 --> 01:50:44,638
engineers and a few science a few

3392
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:45,840
scientists like you know ten engineers

3393
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:46,880
and two scientists or something like

3394
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:49,119
that

3395
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,480
i ran it for three and a half years as a

3396
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:52,238
director

3397
01:50:50,479 --> 01:50:54,238
you know hired the first few scientists

3398
01:50:52,238 --> 01:50:56,959
and kind of set up the culture and

3399
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:58,799
organized it you know explain to the

3400
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:00,480
facebook leadership what what

3401
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,880
fundamental research was about and how

3402
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:04,879
it can work within uh

3403
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:07,118
industry and how it needs to be open and

3404
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,880
everything

3405
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:12,158
and

3406
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:13,760
i think it's been an unqualified success

3407
01:51:12,158 --> 01:51:17,519
in the sense that

3408
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:19,360
fair has simultaneously produced

3409
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,960
you know top-level research

3410
01:51:19,359 --> 01:51:22,960
and advanced the science and the

3411
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:26,480
technology provided tools open source

3412
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:30,000
tools like pytorch and many others

3413
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:31,919
but at the same time has had a direct or

3414
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,679
mostly indirect impact

3415
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:36,000
on

3416
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:38,399
facebook at the time now meta

3417
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,359
in the sense that a lot of systems

3418
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:41,598
that are

3419
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:42,960
that meta is built around

3420
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:44,319
now are

3421
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,158
are based on

3422
01:51:44,319 --> 01:51:48,880
research projects that

3423
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:50,399
started at at fair so if you were to

3424
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,520
take out you know deep learning out of

3425
01:51:50,399 --> 01:51:53,679
uh

3426
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:56,000
facebook services now and and meta more

3427
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:57,840
generally uh i mean the

3428
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,760
company would literally crumble i mean

3429
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,679
it's completely built around

3430
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:03,840
around ai these days and it's really

3431
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:06,079
essential to the operations

3432
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:08,000
so what happened after three and a half

3433
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:10,079
years is that

3434
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,599
i changed role i became chief scientist

3435
01:52:10,079 --> 01:52:12,960
so i'm i'm not doing day-to-day

3436
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:14,639
management of

3437
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:16,639
affair anymore

3438
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:18,319
i'm more of a kind of

3439
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:20,639
you know think about strategy and things

3440
01:52:18,319 --> 01:52:22,158
like that and and i carry my i conduct

3441
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:23,679
my own research i've you know my own

3442
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:25,359
kind of research group working on star

3443
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:26,399
supervision and things like this which i

3444
01:52:25,359 --> 01:52:28,079
didn't have time to do when i was

3445
01:52:26,399 --> 01:52:31,598
director

3446
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:34,000
so now uh fair is run by uh joel pineau

3447
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:35,679
and antoine board

3448
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,118
together because fair is kind of split

3449
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:39,199
in two now there's something called fair

3450
01:52:37,118 --> 01:52:40,880
labs which is sort of

3451
01:52:39,198 --> 01:52:42,879
bottom-up scientist-driven research and

3452
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:44,400
fair excel which is slightly more

3453
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:45,679
organized for bigger projects that

3454
01:52:44,399 --> 01:52:47,920
require

3455
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:49,599
a little more kind of focus and more

3456
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,920
engineering support and things like that

3457
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:54,000
so joelle needs fair lab and antoine

3458
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:56,840
bourne leads very where are they located

3459
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,599
uh it's always delocalized all over

3460
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:01,199
um so there's no question that the

3461
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:02,400
leadership

3462
01:53:01,198 --> 01:53:03,839
of the company

3463
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:05,920
believes that

3464
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:08,319
this was a very worthwhile

3465
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:10,158
investment and what that means is that

3466
01:53:08,319 --> 01:53:12,719
uh

3467
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:14,799
it's it's there for the long run

3468
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:16,399
right so there is uh

3469
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:17,920
if you if you want to talk in these

3470
01:53:16,399 --> 01:53:19,439
terms which i don't like there's a

3471
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,639
there's a business model if you want

3472
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:22,879
where where

3473
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:24,560
uh fair despite being a very fundamental

3474
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,719
research lab brings a lot of value to

3475
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:29,520
the company either mostly indirectly

3476
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:29,520
through other groups

3477
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:33,119
now what happened three and a half years

3478
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:35,519
ago when i stepped down is was also the

3479
01:53:33,118 --> 01:53:39,039
creation of facebook ai which was

3480
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:41,520
basically a larger organization that

3481
01:53:39,039 --> 01:53:43,920
covers fare so fair is included in it

3482
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:44,719
but also has other organizations that

3483
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,679
are

3484
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:46,880
uh

3485
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:50,000
focused on

3486
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:52,159
applied research or advanced development

3487
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,679
of ai technology that is more you know

3488
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:55,359
focused on the

3489
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:57,199
products of the company so less emphasis

3490
01:53:55,359 --> 01:53:58,799
on fundamental research less fundamental

3491
01:53:57,198 --> 01:53:59,839
but it's still research i mean there's a

3492
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:01,360
lot of papers coming out of those

3493
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:02,400
organizations and

3494
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:04,399
uh

3495
01:54:02,399 --> 01:54:06,799
people are awesome awesome and you know

3496
01:54:04,399 --> 01:54:10,238
wonderful to interact with and but it

3497
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:12,719
serves uh as kind of uh

3498
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:14,319
a way to you kind of scale up

3499
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:16,399
if you want um

3500
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:18,719
sort of ai technology which you know may

3501
01:54:16,399 --> 01:54:20,399
be very experimental and and sort of lab

3502
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:23,439
prototypes into things that are usable

3503
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:26,479
so fair is a subset of meta ai it's fair

3504
01:54:23,439 --> 01:54:29,359
become like kfc it it'll just keep the f

3505
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:30,319
nobody cares what the f stands for

3506
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:33,359
we'll know

3507
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:34,559
soon enough uh by uh probably probably

3508
01:54:33,359 --> 01:54:37,839
by the end of the

3509
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:39,440
of 2021 this is not a giant change mayor

3510
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:40,560
fair well mayor doesn't sound too good

3511
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:42,079
but

3512
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,360
you know the the brand people are kind

3513
01:54:42,079 --> 01:54:45,198
of deciding on this

3514
01:54:43,359 --> 01:54:46,960
and they've been hesitating for for a

3515
01:54:45,198 --> 01:54:48,319
while now and they you know they tell us

3516
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,840
they're going to come up with an answer

3517
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:51,198
as to whether fair is going to change

3518
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:53,119
name or whether we're going to change

3519
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:54,799
just the meaning of the f

3520
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:56,238
oh that's a good call i would keep fair

3521
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:57,760
and change the meaning of the f that

3522
01:54:56,238 --> 01:55:00,799
would be my preference you know i would

3523
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:02,480
tend i would turn the f into fundamental

3524
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:04,480
oh that's what i researched oh that's

3525
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:06,959
really good yeah then meta ai so this

3526
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:08,638
would be fair affair yeah but you know

3527
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:12,960
people will call it fair right yeah

3528
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:14,719
exactly i like it and now meta ai uh

3529
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,760
is part of

3530
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:19,118
the

3531
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:20,239
reality lab so you know

3532
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:22,158
meta now

3533
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:23,359
the new facebook is called meta and it's

3534
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:25,279
kind of

3535
01:55:23,359 --> 01:55:26,079
divided into

3536
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:27,759
you know

3537
01:55:26,079 --> 01:55:30,319
facebook instagram

3538
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:30,320
whatsapp

3539
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:35,840
and reality lab and reality lab is about

3540
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,719
you know ar vr

3541
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:38,639
uh

3542
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:40,639
you know telepresence communication part

3543
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:41,840
uh technology and stuff like that that's

3544
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,000
kind of the

3545
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:46,800
you can think of it as the sort of

3546
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:49,039
a combination of um

3547
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:50,880
sort of new products and and technology

3548
01:55:49,039 --> 01:55:52,800
part of uh

3549
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:54,719
of uh meta is that where the touch

3550
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,000
sensing for robots i saw that you were

3551
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:57,439
posting about that's that's what i

3552
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,840
touched on for robotics party fair

3553
01:55:57,439 --> 01:56:02,079
actually that's that's it oh it is okay

3554
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:03,840
yeah this is also the no but there is

3555
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:06,559
the the other way the

3556
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:08,159
the haptic glove right yes that has like

3557
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:09,440
that's more reality that's that's

3558
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:10,479
reality lab

3559
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:12,158
research

3560
01:56:10,479 --> 01:56:13,759
i have to have research but by the way

3561
01:56:12,158 --> 01:56:16,238
the touch sensors are super interesting

3562
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:17,280
uh like integrating that modality into

3563
01:56:16,238 --> 01:56:20,079
the whole

3564
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:21,359
uh sensing uh suite is very interesting

3565
01:56:20,079 --> 01:56:22,319
so

3566
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:23,519
uh

3567
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:25,439
what do you think about the metaverse

3568
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:28,000
what do you think about this whole

3569
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:30,238
uh this whole kind of expansion of the

3570
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,599
view of the role of facebook and meta in

3571
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:33,678
the world well i made a verse really

3572
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:36,319
should be thought of as the next step in

3573
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:38,800
the internet right sort of

3574
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:41,599
trying to

3575
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:43,119
kind of you know make the experience

3576
01:56:41,599 --> 01:56:45,520
more compelling

3577
01:56:43,118 --> 01:56:47,039
of you know being

3578
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:49,360
connected either with other people or

3579
01:56:47,039 --> 01:56:51,279
with content

3580
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:53,439
and you know we are

3581
01:56:51,279 --> 01:56:56,479
evolved and trained to

3582
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:58,638
evolve in you know 3d environments where

3583
01:56:56,479 --> 01:57:00,559
uh you know we can see other people we

3584
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:02,079
can talk to them when when we're near

3585
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:03,360
them or

3586
01:57:02,079 --> 01:57:04,719
you know and other people are far away

3587
01:57:03,359 --> 01:57:07,359
can hear us you know things like that

3588
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:09,118
right so it it there's a lot of social

3589
01:57:07,359 --> 01:57:11,598
conventions that exist in the real world

3590
01:57:09,118 --> 01:57:14,079
that we can try to transpose now what is

3591
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:16,159
going to be eventually the

3592
01:57:14,079 --> 01:57:18,238
the uh how compelling is it going to be

3593
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:19,359
like our you know uh is it going to be

3594
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:20,718
the case that people are going to be

3595
01:57:19,359 --> 01:57:22,559
willing to

3596
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:24,560
do this if they have to wear you know a

3597
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,960
huge pair of goggles all day

3598
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:29,360
maybe not right but then again if the

3599
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:31,679
experience is sufficiently compelling

3600
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:33,039
maybe so or if the device that you have

3601
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:35,039
to wear is just basically a pair of

3602
01:57:33,039 --> 01:57:36,840
glasses you know technology makes

3603
01:57:35,039 --> 01:57:40,158
sufficient progress for that

3604
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:42,319
um you know ar is a much easier

3605
01:57:40,158 --> 01:57:44,879
concept to grasp that you're going to

3606
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:45,759
have you know augmented reality glasses

3607
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:47,599
that

3608
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:49,280
basically contain some sort of you know

3609
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:51,199
virtual assistant that can help you in

3610
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:52,719
your daily lives but at the same time

3611
01:57:51,198 --> 01:57:54,479
with the ar you have to contend with

3612
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:56,158
reality with vr you can completely

3613
01:57:54,479 --> 01:57:58,399
detach yourself from reality so it gives

3614
01:57:56,158 --> 01:58:00,238
you freedom it might be easier to design

3615
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:02,000
worlds in in vr

3616
01:58:00,238 --> 01:58:04,559
yeah but you you can imagine how you

3617
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,359
know the metaverse being

3618
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:09,199
a mix a mix right or or like you can

3619
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:10,799
have objects that exist in the metaverse

3620
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:14,238
that you know pop up on top of the real

3621
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:16,800
world or only exist in virtual reality

3622
01:58:14,238 --> 01:58:18,559
okay let me ask the hard question

3623
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,560
oh because all of this was easy so this

3624
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:24,159
was easy uh

3625
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:26,800
the facebook now meta the social network

3626
01:58:24,158 --> 01:58:29,118
has been painted by the media as a net

3627
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:30,719
negative for society even destructive

3628
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:32,399
and evil at times

3629
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:35,039
you've pushed back against this

3630
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:36,399
defending facebook can you explain your

3631
01:58:35,039 --> 01:58:38,960
defense

3632
01:58:36,399 --> 01:58:40,960
yeah so the the description the company

3633
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:43,279
that is being described in the

3634
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:45,840
in some media

3635
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:47,279
uh is not the company we know when we

3636
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,279
work inside

3637
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:51,039
and you know

3638
01:58:49,279 --> 01:58:52,960
it could be claimed that

3639
01:58:51,039 --> 01:58:54,639
a lot of employees are uninformed about

3640
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,480
what really goes on in the company but

3641
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:58,000
you know i'm a vice president

3642
01:58:56,479 --> 01:58:59,279
i mean i have a pretty good vision of

3643
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,198
what goes on you know i don't know

3644
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:02,479
everything obviously i'm not involved in

3645
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:04,158
in everything but

3646
01:59:02,479 --> 01:59:05,759
certainly not in decision about like you

3647
01:59:04,158 --> 01:59:06,719
know content moderation or anything like

3648
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:08,159
this but

3649
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:10,079
but i have you know some decent vision

3650
01:59:08,158 --> 01:59:12,079
of what goes on

3651
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:13,519
and this evil that is being described i

3652
01:59:12,079 --> 01:59:15,279
just don't see it

3653
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:16,560
and then you know i think there is an

3654
01:59:15,279 --> 01:59:18,079
easy story

3655
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:20,480
to buy

3656
01:59:18,079 --> 01:59:22,238
which is that you know all the bad

3657
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:24,479
things in the in the world and you know

3658
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:25,759
the the reason your friend believe crazy

3659
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:28,000
stuff

3660
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:29,520
um you know there's an easy scapegoat

3661
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,639
right in the

3662
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:34,239
uh in in in social media in general uh

3663
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:35,760
facebook in particular

3664
01:59:34,238 --> 01:59:37,198
but you have to look at the data like is

3665
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:39,920
it the case

3666
01:59:37,198 --> 01:59:42,158
that uh facebook for example uh

3667
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:44,000
polarizes people politically

3668
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:45,118
um are there academic studies that show

3669
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,359
this

3670
01:59:45,118 --> 01:59:48,880
is it the case that uh you know

3671
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:50,559
teenagers uh

3672
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:52,000
think of themselves less if they use

3673
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:54,480
instagram more

3674
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:55,359
is it the case that uh

3675
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:58,638
you know

3676
01:59:55,359 --> 02:00:01,118
people get more riled up against

3677
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:03,279
you know opposite sides in a in a debate

3678
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:05,598
or political opinion if they if they are

3679
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:06,719
more on facebook or if they are less

3680
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:08,400
and

3681
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:10,719
study after study

3682
02:00:08,399 --> 02:00:12,238
show that none of this is true

3683
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:14,880
this is independent studies by academic

3684
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:17,198
they're not funded by facebook or meta

3685
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:18,880
um you know study by stanford by some of

3686
02:00:17,198 --> 02:00:20,238
my colleagues at nyu actually with whom

3687
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:22,480
i have no connection

3688
02:00:20,238 --> 02:00:23,279
um you know there's a study recently

3689
02:00:22,479 --> 02:00:27,919
they

3690
02:00:23,279 --> 02:00:27,920
they paid people i think it was in um

3691
02:00:28,158 --> 02:00:32,238
in in the former yugoslavia i'm not

3692
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:33,839
exactly sure in what what part but they

3693
02:00:32,238 --> 02:00:35,678
paid people to not use facebook for a

3694
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:38,239
while in the

3695
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:38,239
period

3696
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:42,320
before the anniversary of the

3697
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,319
serenity

3698
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:45,840
massacres right so you know people get

3699
02:00:44,319 --> 02:00:46,799
riled up like should you know should we

3700
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,360
have

3701
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:51,440
a celebration i mean a memorial kind of

3702
02:00:49,359 --> 02:00:54,079
celebration for it or not so they paid a

3703
02:00:51,439 --> 02:00:56,079
bunch of people to not use facebook for

3704
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:58,639
a few weeks

3705
02:00:56,079 --> 02:01:00,158
it turns out that

3706
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:02,079
those people ended up being more

3707
02:01:00,158 --> 02:01:03,279
polarized than they were at the

3708
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:06,479
beginning and the people who were more

3709
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:08,158
on facebook were less polarized

3710
02:01:06,479 --> 02:01:09,198
there's a study you know from stanford

3711
02:01:08,158 --> 02:01:11,198
of uh

3712
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:13,359
economists at stanford that

3713
02:01:11,198 --> 02:01:15,919
tried to identify the causes of uh

3714
02:01:13,359 --> 02:01:17,679
increasing polarization in the u.s

3715
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:20,399
and it's been going on for 40 years

3716
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:22,399
before you know mark zuckerberg was born

3717
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:25,519
yeah uh continuously

3718
02:01:22,399 --> 02:01:26,479
and um and uh so if there is a cause

3719
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:27,840
it's not

3720
02:01:26,479 --> 02:01:29,919
facebook or social media so you could

3721
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:32,159
say social media just accelerated but no

3722
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:34,079
i mean it's basically a continuous

3723
02:01:32,158 --> 02:01:36,079
uh evolution by some measure of

3724
02:01:34,079 --> 02:01:37,840
polarization in the us and then you

3725
02:01:36,079 --> 02:01:39,439
compare this with other countries like

3726
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:41,840
uh

3727
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:44,638
the the west half of germany because you

3728
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:47,520
can't go 40 years in east eastside or

3729
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:49,359
denmark or or other countries

3730
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:50,480
and they use facebook just as much and

3731
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:52,399
they're not getting more polarized

3732
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:54,799
they're getting less polarized so if you

3733
02:01:52,399 --> 02:01:57,439
want to look for you know a causal

3734
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,039
relationship there

3735
02:01:57,439 --> 02:02:00,638
you can find a scapegoat but you can't

3736
02:01:59,039 --> 02:02:02,399
find the cause now if you want to fix

3737
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:05,039
the problem you have to find the right

3738
02:02:02,399 --> 02:02:06,238
cause and what rise me up is that people

3739
02:02:05,039 --> 02:02:08,319
now are

3740
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:10,079
accusing facebook of bad deeds that are

3741
02:02:08,319 --> 02:02:12,158
done by others and those others are

3742
02:02:10,079 --> 02:02:14,238
we're not doing anything about them

3743
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:15,598
and by the way those others include

3744
02:02:14,238 --> 02:02:17,519
the owner of the wall street journal in

3745
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:19,440
which all of those papers were published

3746
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:22,000
so i should mention that i'm talking to

3747
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:23,678
shrek mike schrepp for on this podcast

3748
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,960
and also mark zuckerberg and probably

3749
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:26,079
these conversations you can have with

3750
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,760
them

3751
02:02:26,079 --> 02:02:29,599
because it's very interesting to me even

3752
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:31,760
if facebook has

3753
02:02:29,599 --> 02:02:33,119
some measurable negative effect

3754
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:34,800
you can't just consider that in

3755
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:36,799
isolation you have to consider about all

3756
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,719
the positive ways that it connects us so

3757
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:40,320
like every technology there's people

3758
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:41,279
it's that question you can't just say

3759
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:43,759
like

3760
02:02:41,279 --> 02:02:46,158
uh there's an increase in division

3761
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:48,079
yes probably google search engine has

3762
02:02:46,158 --> 02:02:49,839
created increase in division we have to

3763
02:02:48,079 --> 02:02:51,840
consider about how much information it

3764
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:53,760
brought to the world like i'm sure

3765
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:55,520
wikipedia created more division if you

3766
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:57,520
just look at the division we have to

3767
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:59,599
look at the full context of the world

3768
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:00,880
and didn't make a better world yeah the

3769
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:02,960
printing press has created more

3770
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:04,560
differences right exactly

3771
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:07,520
so you know when the

3772
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:09,679
printing press was invented uh the first

3773
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:11,520
books that were that were printed were

3774
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:13,599
things like the bible and that allowed

3775
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:15,280
people to read the bible by themselves

3776
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:17,279
not get the message uniquely from

3777
02:03:15,279 --> 02:03:19,759
priests in europe

3778
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:21,920
and they created you know the protest

3779
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:23,599
movement and 200 years of religious

3780
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,279
persecution and wars

3781
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:26,880
so that's a bad side effect of the

3782
02:03:25,279 --> 02:03:28,559
printing press you know social networks

3783
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:30,000
aren't being nearly as bad as the

3784
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:33,199
printing press but nobody would say that

3785
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,198
printing price was a bad idea

3786
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:36,879
yeah a lot of it's perception and

3787
02:03:35,118 --> 02:03:39,920
there's a lot of different incentives

3788
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:42,079
operating here um maybe a quick comment

3789
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:45,199
since you're one of the top leaders at

3790
02:03:42,079 --> 02:03:46,639
facebook and at meta sorry that's in the

3791
02:03:45,198 --> 02:03:48,960
tech space

3792
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:51,840
i'm sure facebook involves a lot of

3793
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:53,359
incredible technological uh challenges

3794
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:54,239
that need to be solved a lot of it

3795
02:03:53,359 --> 02:03:56,238
probably is on the computer

3796
02:03:54,238 --> 02:03:58,879
infrastructure the hardware the i mean

3797
02:03:56,238 --> 02:04:01,279
it's just a huge amount

3798
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:03,520
maybe can you give me context about

3799
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:05,599
how much of shrek's life

3800
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,760
is ai and how much of it is low level

3801
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:09,440
compute how much of it is

3802
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:11,119
flying all around doing business stuff

3803
02:04:09,439 --> 02:04:13,598
and the same with zuckerberg mark

3804
02:04:11,118 --> 02:04:15,198
zuckerberg they really focus on ai i

3805
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:17,199
mean certainly uh

3806
02:04:15,198 --> 02:04:19,839
in the uh

3807
02:04:17,198 --> 02:04:20,719
in the run-up of the creation affair and

3808
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,480
for

3809
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:24,000
you know at least a year after that if

3810
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:26,000
not more

3811
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,840
mark was was very very much focused on

3812
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,639
on ai and was spending quite a lot of

3813
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:32,000
effort um on it and that's his style

3814
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:33,679
when he gets interested in something he

3815
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,279
reads everything about it

3816
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:39,520
you know he read some of my papers for

3817
02:04:35,279 --> 02:04:41,759
example before he joined um

3818
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:43,599
and uh so he he learned a lot about it

3819
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:45,840
like notes

3820
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:45,840
right

3821
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:51,519
and uh uh you know schwepp

3822
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:53,119
was really into it also i mean tripe is

3823
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:54,400
really kind of

3824
02:04:53,118 --> 02:04:56,238
um

3825
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:57,759
you know has

3826
02:04:56,238 --> 02:05:00,319
something i've tried to preserve also

3827
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:02,480
despite my uh not so young age which is

3828
02:05:00,319 --> 02:05:04,399
a sense of wonder about science and

3829
02:05:02,479 --> 02:05:07,279
technology and he certainly certainly

3830
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:08,559
has that um he's also a wonderful person

3831
02:05:07,279 --> 02:05:09,599
i mean in terms of

3832
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:11,199
like

3833
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:13,520
as a manager like dealing with people

3834
02:05:11,198 --> 02:05:16,158
and everything mark also actually

3835
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:17,679
um so i mean they're very like you know

3836
02:05:16,158 --> 02:05:19,839
very human people

3837
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:21,920
for in the case of markets uh shockingly

3838
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:24,319
human you know given his uh

3839
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:25,279
his trajectory um

3840
02:05:24,319 --> 02:05:27,198
uh

3841
02:05:25,279 --> 02:05:28,719
i mean the personality of him that is

3842
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:29,519
painting in the press is just completely

3843
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:31,279
wrong

3844
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,119
yeah but you have to know how to play

3845
02:05:31,279 --> 02:05:35,039
the press so that's

3846
02:05:33,118 --> 02:05:35,839
i i put some of that responsibility on

3847
02:05:35,039 --> 02:05:38,639
him

3848
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:38,639
too you have to

3849
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:42,560
it's like um

3850
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:44,400
you know like the director

3851
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:47,039
the conductor of an orchestra you have

3852
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:48,158
to play the press and the public

3853
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:49,920
in a certain kind of way where you

3854
02:05:48,158 --> 02:05:51,679
convey your true self to them if there

3855
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:53,279
is a depth and kindness it's hard and

3856
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:56,319
it's hard and it's probably not the best

3857
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:58,399
at it so yeah

3858
02:05:56,319 --> 02:06:00,559
you have to learn uh and it's it's sad

3859
02:05:58,399 --> 02:06:03,839
to see and i'll talk to him about it but

3860
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:07,039
the shrek is slowly stepping down

3861
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:09,360
it's always uh sad to see folks sort of

3862
02:06:07,039 --> 02:06:12,319
be there for a long time and slowly

3863
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:13,839
i guess time i think i think he's done

3864
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:16,799
the thing he

3865
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:18,400
set out to do and you know he's he's got

3866
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:19,599
you know

3867
02:06:18,399 --> 02:06:21,359
uh

3868
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:22,078
family priorities and stuff like that

3869
02:06:21,359 --> 02:06:23,279
and

3870
02:06:22,078 --> 02:06:25,198
um

3871
02:06:23,279 --> 02:06:27,679
i understand you know after

3872
02:06:25,198 --> 02:06:29,678
13 years or something

3873
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:31,279
it's been a good run which in silicon

3874
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:33,199
valley is basically

3875
02:06:31,279 --> 02:06:36,000
a lifetime yeah you know because you

3876
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:38,479
know it's dog years so uh in europe's

3877
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,399
the conference just wrapped up uh

3878
02:06:38,479 --> 02:06:42,559
let me just go back to something else

3879
02:06:40,399 --> 02:06:44,319
you posted the paper you co-authored was

3880
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:47,920
rejected from europe

3881
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:50,799
as you said proudly in quotes rejected

3882
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:53,199
can you joke yeah i know

3883
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:55,760
uh can you describe this paper

3884
02:06:53,198 --> 02:06:58,559
and like what was the idea in it and

3885
02:06:55,760 --> 02:07:00,639
also maybe this is a good opportunity to

3886
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:02,400
ask what are the pros and cons what

3887
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:03,440
works and what doesn't about the review

3888
02:07:02,399 --> 02:07:04,799
process

3889
02:07:03,439 --> 02:07:06,078
yeah let me talk about the paper first

3890
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:08,320
i'll talk about the review we'll talk

3891
02:07:06,078 --> 02:07:09,118
about the review process uh afterwards

3892
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:11,279
um

3893
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:13,039
the paper is called vkrag so this is i

3894
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:14,960
mentioned that before variance in

3895
02:07:13,039 --> 02:07:17,198
variance covariance regularization and

3896
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:19,439
it's a technique a non-contrastive

3897
02:07:17,198 --> 02:07:21,198
learning technique for

3898
02:07:19,439 --> 02:07:23,519
what i call joint embedding architecture

3899
02:07:21,198 --> 02:07:25,359
so siamese nets are an example of joint

3900
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,800
invading architecture so gentlemen

3901
02:07:25,359 --> 02:07:29,039
architecture is

3902
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:29,039
uh

3903
02:07:29,279 --> 02:07:33,198
let me back up a little bit right so if

3904
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:36,319
you want to do supervised running

3905
02:07:33,198 --> 02:07:37,519
you can you can do it by prediction

3906
02:07:36,319 --> 02:07:38,880
so let's say you want to train your

3907
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:41,119
system to predict video right you show

3908
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:42,880
it a video clip and

3909
02:07:41,118 --> 02:07:44,960
and you train the system to predict the

3910
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:46,639
next the continuation of that video clip

3911
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:48,560
now because you need to handle

3912
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:50,000
uncertainty because there are many you

3913
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:51,440
know many continuations that are

3914
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,359
plausible

3915
02:07:51,439 --> 02:07:55,919
you need to have you need to handle this

3916
02:07:53,359 --> 02:07:58,719
in some way you need to have a way for

3917
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:00,480
the system to be able to produce

3918
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:02,560
multiple predictions

3919
02:08:00,479 --> 02:08:03,359
and the way the only way i know to do

3920
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:04,960
this

3921
02:08:03,359 --> 02:08:07,519
is through what's called a latent

3922
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:09,520
variable so you have some sort of

3923
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:11,679
hidden vector of a variable that you can

3924
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:13,760
vary over a set or draw from a

3925
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:15,520
distribution and as you vary this vector

3926
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:17,039
over a set the output the prediction

3927
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:18,320
varies over a set of plausible

3928
02:08:17,039 --> 02:08:20,840
predictions

3929
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:24,639
okay so that's called i call this a

3930
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:26,800
generative latent variable model

3931
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:28,560
okay now there is an alternative to this

3932
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:32,079
to handle uncertainty

3933
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:34,239
and instead of directly predicting the

3934
02:08:32,078 --> 02:08:35,679
the next frames of the of the of the

3935
02:08:34,238 --> 02:08:38,078
clip

3936
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:40,560
you also run those

3937
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:42,559
through another neural net

3938
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:44,400
uh so you now have two neural nets one

3939
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:45,440
that looks at the

3940
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:46,479
the uh

3941
02:08:45,439 --> 02:08:48,638
you know the

3942
02:08:46,479 --> 02:08:50,158
initial segment of the video clip and

3943
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:53,359
another one that looks at the the

3944
02:08:50,158 --> 02:08:54,879
continuation during training right

3945
02:08:53,359 --> 02:08:57,519
and what what you're trying to do is

3946
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:59,279
learn a representation

3947
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:01,760
of those two video clips that is

3948
02:08:59,279 --> 02:09:03,359
maximally informative about the video

3949
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:04,400
clips themselves

3950
02:09:03,359 --> 02:09:06,078
but

3951
02:09:04,399 --> 02:09:08,399
it's such that you can predict the

3952
02:09:06,078 --> 02:09:10,399
representation of the second video clip

3953
02:09:08,399 --> 02:09:12,158
from the representation of the first one

3954
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:13,519
easily okay

3955
02:09:12,158 --> 02:09:15,198
and you can sort of formalize this in

3956
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:16,400
terms of maximizing virtual information

3957
02:09:15,198 --> 02:09:17,919
some stuff like that but it doesn't

3958
02:09:16,399 --> 02:09:19,759
matter

3959
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:21,920
what you want is

3960
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:22,639
informative representative represent you

3961
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:24,719
know

3962
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:26,560
informative representations of the two

3963
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:28,239
video clips that are mutually

3964
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:30,000
predictable

3965
02:09:28,238 --> 02:09:31,919
what that means is that there's a lot of

3966
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,158
details in the second video clips that

3967
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:35,760
are irrelevant

3968
02:09:34,158 --> 02:09:38,799
you know

3969
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:41,840
i let's say a video clip consists in you

3970
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:43,199
know a camera panning the scene

3971
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:45,039
there's going to be a piece of that room

3972
02:09:43,198 --> 02:09:47,118
that is going to be revealed and i can

3973
02:09:45,039 --> 02:09:48,560
somewhat predict what the what that room

3974
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:51,039
is going to look like but i may not be

3975
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:52,560
able to predict the details of the

3976
02:09:51,039 --> 02:09:54,158
texture of the ground and where the

3977
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:56,239
tiles are ending and stuff like that

3978
02:09:54,158 --> 02:09:58,158
right so those are irrelevant details

3979
02:09:56,238 --> 02:09:59,519
that perhaps my representation will

3980
02:09:58,158 --> 02:10:00,719
eliminate

3981
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:02,719
and so

3982
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:05,118
what i need is to train this second

3983
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:08,000
neural net in such a way that

3984
02:10:05,118 --> 02:10:10,078
uh whenever the the

3985
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:13,359
the continuation video clip varies over

3986
02:10:10,078 --> 02:10:15,519
all the plausible continuations

3987
02:10:13,359 --> 02:10:18,238
the representation doesn't change

3988
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:20,719
got it okay so it's the yeah yeah got it

3989
02:10:18,238 --> 02:10:22,158
all over the space of representations

3990
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:25,279
doing the same kind of thing as you're

3991
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:27,920
doing with similarity learning right

3992
02:10:25,279 --> 02:10:29,599
yeah so so these are two ways to handle

3993
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:31,760
multi-modality in a prediction right in

3994
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:33,599
the first way you parameterize the

3995
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:35,840
prediction with a latin variable but you

3996
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:37,840
predict pixels essentially right in the

3997
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:39,199
second one you want you don't predict

3998
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:40,719
pixels you predict an abstract

3999
02:10:39,198 --> 02:10:41,919
representation of pixels and you

4000
02:10:40,719 --> 02:10:43,279
guarantee that this has track

4001
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:44,960
representation

4002
02:10:43,279 --> 02:10:46,880
has as much information as possible

4003
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:48,399
about the input but sort of you know

4004
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:51,840
drops all the stuff that you really

4005
02:10:48,399 --> 02:10:53,198
can't predict essentially

4006
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:54,719
i used to be a big fan of the first

4007
02:10:53,198 --> 02:10:57,198
approach and in fact in this paper with

4008
02:10:54,719 --> 02:10:58,560
the chain mishra this this blog post

4009
02:10:57,198 --> 02:11:00,799
the dark matter intelligence i was kind

4010
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:02,239
of advocating for this and in the last

4011
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:04,000
year and a half i've completely changed

4012
02:11:02,238 --> 02:11:05,359
my mind i'm now a big fan of the second

4013
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,158
one

4014
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:10,000
and it's because of

4015
02:11:08,158 --> 02:11:12,319
a small collection of algorithms that

4016
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,560
have been proposed over the last uh

4017
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:17,679
uh year and a half or so two years

4018
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:19,520
uh to do this uh including v craig

4019
02:11:17,679 --> 02:11:20,880
its predecessor called barbie twins

4020
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:23,360
which i mentioned

4021
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,920
uh a method from our friends of deepmind

4022
02:11:23,359 --> 02:11:28,158
called byol

4023
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:29,599
and and and there's a bunch of others

4024
02:11:28,158 --> 02:11:31,679
now that kind of work similarly so

4025
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:33,520
they're all based on this idea of joint

4026
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:35,440
embedding some of them have an explicit

4027
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:37,199
criterion that is an approximation of

4028
02:11:35,439 --> 02:11:39,198
mutual information some others will be

4029
02:11:37,198 --> 02:11:40,238
aol work but we don't really know why

4030
02:11:39,198 --> 02:11:41,919
and there's been like lots of

4031
02:11:40,238 --> 02:11:43,678
theoretical papers but why be where it

4032
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:45,199
works no it's not bad because we take it

4033
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:46,239
out and it still works and

4034
02:11:45,198 --> 02:11:48,960
you know blah blah blah i mean so

4035
02:11:46,238 --> 02:11:50,479
there's like a big big debate but um

4036
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:52,560
uh but the important point is that we

4037
02:11:50,479 --> 02:11:54,638
now have a collection of non-contrastive

4038
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:57,119
joint embedding methods which i think is

4039
02:11:54,639 --> 02:11:59,520
the best thing since sliced bread so i'm

4040
02:11:57,118 --> 02:12:01,118
super excited about this because i think

4041
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:03,040
it's our best shot

4042
02:12:01,118 --> 02:12:04,719
for techniques that would allow us to

4043
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:06,960
kind of build

4044
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:08,800
predictive world models and at the same

4045
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:10,800
time learn hierarchical representations

4046
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:12,159
of the world where what matters about

4047
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:14,480
the world is preserved and what is

4048
02:12:12,158 --> 02:12:15,839
irrelevant is eliminated

4049
02:12:14,479 --> 02:12:17,919
by the way the representation is the

4050
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:19,039
before and after is

4051
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:20,880
in the space

4052
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:23,039
in a sequence of images or is it for

4053
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,800
single images uh it would be either for

4054
02:12:23,039 --> 02:12:26,078
a single image for a sequence it doesn't

4055
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:27,599
have to be images this could be applied

4056
02:12:26,078 --> 02:12:29,439
to text it could be applied to just

4057
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:31,199
about any signal i'm looking at you know

4058
02:12:29,439 --> 02:12:32,799
i'm looking for

4059
02:12:31,198 --> 02:12:34,799
methods that are generally applicable

4060
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:36,320
that are not specific to you know one

4061
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:38,320
particular modality you know it could be

4062
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:40,559
audio or whatever got it so what's the

4063
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:42,719
story behind this paper this this paper

4064
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:44,320
is what is is describing one of the one

4065
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:46,239
such method this is this vikrant method

4066
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:47,198
so the cisco authored the first author

4067
02:12:46,238 --> 02:12:49,678
is a

4068
02:12:47,198 --> 02:12:52,479
student called adrian bard who is a

4069
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:55,599
resident phd student at fair paris

4070
02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:58,078
who is co-advised by me and jean ponce

4071
02:12:55,599 --> 02:13:01,440
who's a professor at economic superior

4072
02:12:58,078 --> 02:13:03,439
also a research director at inria

4073
02:13:01,439 --> 02:13:05,359
so this is a wonderful program in france

4074
02:13:03,439 --> 02:13:07,439
where phd students can basically do

4075
02:13:05,359 --> 02:13:10,319
their phd in industry and that's kind of

4076
02:13:07,439 --> 02:13:13,678
what what's happening here

4077
02:13:10,319 --> 02:13:16,238
and this paper is a follow-up on

4078
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:19,440
the this bottle twin paper by yeah my

4079
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:21,678
former post dog now stefan dunny uh with

4080
02:13:19,439 --> 02:13:23,359
li jing and and yurish montar and a

4081
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:24,560
bunch of other people from from from

4082
02:13:23,359 --> 02:13:25,359
fair

4083
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:27,679
and

4084
02:13:25,359 --> 02:13:29,598
one of the main criticism from reviewers

4085
02:13:27,679 --> 02:13:32,880
is that v craig is not different enough

4086
02:13:29,599 --> 02:13:35,520
from battle twins but

4087
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:36,719
you know my impression is that

4088
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:39,119
it's you know

4089
02:13:36,719 --> 02:13:41,760
bottle twins with a few bugs fixed

4090
02:13:39,118 --> 02:13:43,118
essentially and uh in the end this is

4091
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:46,560
what people will use

4092
02:13:43,118 --> 02:13:48,559
right so but you know i'm used to stuff

4093
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:49,840
yeah that assume it being rejected

4094
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:51,280
forward so it might be rejected and

4095
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:53,279
actually exceptional excited because

4096
02:13:51,279 --> 02:13:55,679
people use it well it's already decided

4097
02:13:53,279 --> 02:13:57,439
like a bunch of times so i mean the the

4098
02:13:55,679 --> 02:14:00,319
question is then to the deeper question

4099
02:13:57,439 --> 02:14:01,919
about peer review and conferences i mean

4100
02:14:00,319 --> 02:14:03,759
computer science is a field is kind of

4101
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:04,719
unique that the conference is highly

4102
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:07,119
prized

4103
02:14:04,719 --> 02:14:09,039
that's one right and uh it's interesting

4104
02:14:07,118 --> 02:14:11,598
because the peer review process there is

4105
02:14:09,039 --> 02:14:14,000
similar as opposed to journals but it's

4106
02:14:11,599 --> 02:14:16,319
accelerated significantly well not

4107
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,399
significantly but it goes fast

4108
02:14:16,319 --> 02:14:20,960
and it's nice way to get stuff out

4109
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:23,118
quickly uh to be reviewed quickly go to

4110
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:25,840
present it quickly to the community so

4111
02:14:23,118 --> 02:14:27,279
not quickly but quicker yeah but

4112
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:29,440
nevertheless it has many of the same

4113
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:31,279
flaws of uh peer review because it's a

4114
02:14:29,439 --> 02:14:33,519
limited number of people look at it

4115
02:14:31,279 --> 02:14:35,359
there's bias in the following like that

4116
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:37,440
if you if you want to do new ideas

4117
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:39,598
you're going to get pushed back

4118
02:14:37,439 --> 02:14:40,879
um they're self-interested people that

4119
02:14:39,599 --> 02:14:43,440
kind of

4120
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:44,880
can infer who submitted it

4121
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:46,879
and kind of

4122
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:48,400
you know be cranky about it all that

4123
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:50,800
kind of stuff yeah i mean there's a lot

4124
02:14:48,399 --> 02:14:52,399
of you know social phenomena there um

4125
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:55,039
there's one social phenomenon which is

4126
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:56,559
that because the field has been growing

4127
02:14:55,039 --> 02:14:58,479
exponentially

4128
02:14:56,560 --> 02:15:01,280
the vast majority of people in the field

4129
02:14:58,479 --> 02:15:02,479
are extremely junior yeah so as a

4130
02:15:01,279 --> 02:15:04,800
consequence and that's just a

4131
02:15:02,479 --> 02:15:07,439
consequence of the field growing right

4132
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:09,360
so as the number of the size of the

4133
02:15:07,439 --> 02:15:11,279
field kind of starts saturating you you

4134
02:15:09,359 --> 02:15:15,118
will have less of that problem

4135
02:15:11,279 --> 02:15:18,158
of reviewers being very uh inexperienced

4136
02:15:15,118 --> 02:15:20,000
a consequence of this is that you know

4137
02:15:18,158 --> 02:15:20,799
young reviewers

4138
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,800
i mean

4139
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:24,560
there's a phenomenon which is that

4140
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,920
reviewers try to make their life easy

4141
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:27,280
and to make their life easy when

4142
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:28,639
reviewing a paper

4143
02:15:27,279 --> 02:15:30,639
is very simple you just have to find a

4144
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:32,639
flaw in the paper right so

4145
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:33,760
basically they see their task as finding

4146
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:35,840
flaws

4147
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:37,520
in papers and most papers have flaws

4148
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:40,560
even the good ones yeah

4149
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:42,960
um so it's it's easy to you know

4150
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:44,719
to do that you your job is

4151
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:46,560
easier as a reviewer

4152
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:48,880
if you just focus on this but what's

4153
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:51,440
important is

4154
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:53,920
like is there a new idea in that paper

4155
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:55,439
that is likely to influence

4156
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:57,279
it doesn't matter if the experiments are

4157
02:15:55,439 --> 02:15:58,479
not that great if the protocol is you

4158
02:15:57,279 --> 02:15:59,679
know

4159
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:01,598
uh

4160
02:15:59,679 --> 02:16:04,960
so so you know things like that as long

4161
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:06,639
as there is a worthy idea in it

4162
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:08,480
that will influence the way people think

4163
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:10,480
about the problem

4164
02:16:08,479 --> 02:16:12,799
um even if they make it better you know

4165
02:16:10,479 --> 02:16:15,359
eventually i think that's uh that's

4166
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:16,560
really what what makes a paper useful

4167
02:16:15,359 --> 02:16:19,439
and so

4168
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:21,599
this combination of uh social phenomena

4169
02:16:19,439 --> 02:16:24,078
creates a a

4170
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:25,440
a disease that has plagued you know

4171
02:16:24,078 --> 02:16:27,359
other fields in the past like speech

4172
02:16:25,439 --> 02:16:29,759
recognition where basically you know

4173
02:16:27,359 --> 02:16:31,598
people chase numbers on uh

4174
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:32,478
on benchmarks

4175
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:34,000
and

4176
02:16:32,478 --> 02:16:36,318
and it's much easier to get a paper

4177
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:38,079
accepted if it brings an incremental

4178
02:16:36,318 --> 02:16:40,879
improvement on a

4179
02:16:38,079 --> 02:16:42,239
sort of mainstream well-accepted

4180
02:16:40,879 --> 02:16:44,000
method

4181
02:16:42,239 --> 02:16:46,079
or problem

4182
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,718
and those are to me boring papers i mean

4183
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:50,879
they're not useless right because uh

4184
02:16:48,718 --> 02:16:52,079
industries you know strives on on those

4185
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:53,199
kind of progress

4186
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:54,638
but they're not the one that i'm

4187
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:56,880
interested in in terms of like new

4188
02:16:54,638 --> 02:16:58,398
concepts and new ideas so uh papers that

4189
02:16:56,879 --> 02:17:00,959
are really uh

4190
02:16:58,398 --> 02:17:02,398
trying to strike kind of new advances

4191
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:04,638
generally don't make it

4192
02:17:02,398 --> 02:17:07,039
now thankfully we have archive archive

4193
02:17:04,638 --> 02:17:09,119
exactly and then there's uh open review

4194
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:11,439
type of situations where you and then i

4195
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:13,359
mean twitter is a kind of open review

4196
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:15,200
i'm a huge believer that reviews should

4197
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:18,318
be done by thousands of people not two

4198
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:20,000
people i agree uh and so archive

4199
02:17:18,318 --> 02:17:21,679
like do you see a future where a lot of

4200
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:24,079
really strong papers it's already the

4201
02:17:21,679 --> 02:17:26,239
present but a growing future where it'll

4202
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:27,840
just be archived

4203
02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:30,478
and

4204
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:32,478
you're presenting an ongoing continuous

4205
02:17:30,478 --> 02:17:33,679
conference called twitter and slash the

4206
02:17:32,478 --> 02:17:35,920
internet

4207
02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:37,519
uh slash archive sanity andre just

4208
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:40,239
released a new version

4209
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:43,280
uh so just not you know not being so

4210
02:17:40,239 --> 02:17:44,638
elitist about this particular uh gating

4211
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:46,960
it's not a question of being elitist or

4212
02:17:44,638 --> 02:17:47,920
not it's a question of uh being

4213
02:17:46,959 --> 02:17:49,119
basically

4214
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:51,519
uh

4215
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:53,519
recommendation and seal of approvals for

4216
02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:54,960
people who don't see themselves as

4217
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:57,120
having the ability to do so by

4218
02:17:54,959 --> 02:17:59,839
themselves right so it saves time right

4219
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:01,920
if you rely on other people's opinion

4220
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:02,799
and you trust those people

4221
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:06,558
or those

4222
02:18:02,799 --> 02:18:08,638
groups to evaluate a paper

4223
02:18:06,558 --> 02:18:10,398
for you

4224
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:12,558
that saves you time because you know you

4225
02:18:10,398 --> 02:18:14,159
don't have to like scrutinize uh the

4226
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:15,840
paper as much you know it is brought to

4227
02:18:14,159 --> 02:18:17,039
your attention i mean it's a whole idea

4228
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:18,639
of sort of you know collective

4229
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:20,960
recommender system right

4230
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:23,920
so i actually thought about this a lot

4231
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:25,919
um you know about 10 15 years ago uh

4232
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:29,120
because there were discussions at

4233
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:31,679
um nips and you know and were about to

4234
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:33,200
create iclear with yoshi banjo and so i

4235
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:36,079
wrote a document

4236
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:38,240
um kind of describing a reviewing system

4237
02:18:36,079 --> 02:18:39,840
which basically was you know you post

4238
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:42,799
your paper on some repository let's say

4239
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:44,478
archive or now could be open review um

4240
02:18:42,799 --> 02:18:46,318
and then you can form

4241
02:18:44,478 --> 02:18:48,398
uh a reviewing entity which is

4242
02:18:46,318 --> 02:18:51,439
equivalent to a reviewing board you know

4243
02:18:48,398 --> 02:18:53,760
a journal or a

4244
02:18:51,439 --> 02:18:55,439
program committee of a conference

4245
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,960
you have to list the members

4246
02:18:55,439 --> 02:18:58,000
and then

4247
02:18:56,959 --> 02:19:00,558
that

4248
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,398
group reviewing entity can choose to

4249
02:19:00,558 --> 02:19:04,079
review a particular paper

4250
02:19:02,398 --> 02:19:06,318
spontaneously or not there is no

4251
02:19:04,079 --> 02:19:09,039
exclusive relationship anymore between a

4252
02:19:06,318 --> 02:19:10,398
paper and a venue or reviewing entity

4253
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:12,559
any reviewing entity can review any

4254
02:19:10,398 --> 02:19:14,879
paper

4255
02:19:12,558 --> 02:19:16,478
or may choose not to

4256
02:19:14,879 --> 02:19:17,920
and then you know give an evaluation

4257
02:19:16,478 --> 02:19:20,318
it's not published or published it's

4258
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:21,599
just an evaluation and a comment which

4259
02:19:20,318 --> 02:19:23,519
would be public

4260
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:24,478
signed by the reviewing entity

4261
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:25,920
and

4262
02:19:24,478 --> 02:19:26,879
if it's time by reviewing entity you

4263
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:28,558
know it's one of the members of

4264
02:19:26,879 --> 02:19:30,558
reviewing entities so if the reviewing

4265
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:31,920
entity is you know

4266
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:33,840
lex treatments

4267
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:36,239
you know preferred papers right you know

4268
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:39,200
it's like friedman writing a review yes

4269
02:19:36,239 --> 02:19:40,079
what so for me one that's a beautiful

4270
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:42,479
uh

4271
02:19:40,079 --> 02:19:44,478
system i think but what's in addition to

4272
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:47,358
that it feels like there should be a

4273
02:19:44,478 --> 02:19:49,199
reputation system for the reviewers

4274
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:50,640
for the reviewing entities not the

4275
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:53,120
reviewers individually the reviewing

4276
02:19:50,639 --> 02:19:55,039
entities sure but even within that there

4277
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:57,200
are viewers too because uh

4278
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:59,600
i it's there's another thing here it's

4279
02:19:57,200 --> 02:20:01,600
not just the reputation it's an

4280
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:02,640
incentive for an individual person to do

4281
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:05,120
great

4282
02:20:02,639 --> 02:20:07,119
right now in in the academic setting the

4283
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:09,120
incentive is kind of uh

4284
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:10,720
internal just wanting to do a good job

4285
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:12,479
but honestly that's not a strong enough

4286
02:20:10,719 --> 02:20:14,318
incentive to do a really good job in

4287
02:20:12,478 --> 02:20:15,920
reading a paper and finding the

4288
02:20:14,318 --> 02:20:17,760
beautiful amidst the mistakes and the

4289
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:19,600
flaws and all that kind of stuff right

4290
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:22,398
like if you're the person that first

4291
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:23,840
discovered a powerful paper

4292
02:20:22,398 --> 02:20:25,039
and you get to be proud of that

4293
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:27,439
discovery

4294
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:28,880
then that gives a huge incentive to you

4295
02:20:27,439 --> 02:20:30,880
that's that's a big part of my proposal

4296
02:20:28,879 --> 02:20:33,679
actually i described that as

4297
02:20:30,879 --> 02:20:34,559
you know if if your evaluation of papers

4298
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:36,639
is

4299
02:20:34,559 --> 02:20:37,439
predictive of future success yes yes

4300
02:20:36,639 --> 02:20:39,760
okay

4301
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:42,479
then your reputation should go up as a

4302
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:44,559
reviewing entity

4303
02:20:42,478 --> 02:20:46,478
so yeah exactly i mean that

4304
02:20:44,559 --> 02:20:47,199
um i even had a master's student who was

4305
02:20:46,478 --> 02:20:49,438
a

4306
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:51,040
master student in uh library science and

4307
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:53,359
computer science actually kind of work

4308
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:55,840
out exactly how that should work with

4309
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:57,120
formulas and everything but so in terms

4310
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:58,960
of implementation do you think that's

4311
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:00,880
something that's doable i mean i've been

4312
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:02,799
sort of you know talking about this to

4313
02:21:00,879 --> 02:21:05,759
sort of various people like you know

4314
02:21:02,799 --> 02:21:07,599
andrew mccallum who started open review

4315
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:09,520
and the reason why we picked open review

4316
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:11,280
for iclear initially even though it was

4317
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:13,280
very early for them

4318
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:15,280
is because my hope was that

4319
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:16,560
iclear were it was eventually going to

4320
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:19,200
kind of

4321
02:21:16,559 --> 02:21:22,079
inaugurate this type of system so iclear

4322
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:23,680
kept the idea of open reviews

4323
02:21:22,079 --> 02:21:25,600
so where the reviews are you know

4324
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:27,280
published with the paper which i think

4325
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:28,159
is very useful

4326
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:29,840
but

4327
02:21:28,159 --> 02:21:31,039
in many ways that's kind of reverted to

4328
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:33,359
kind of more of a

4329
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:35,200
conventional type conferences for

4330
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:36,640
everything else and that

4331
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:39,120
i mean i

4332
02:21:36,639 --> 02:21:40,559
i don't run ikea i'm just the president

4333
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:42,640
of the

4334
02:21:40,559 --> 02:21:44,398
foundation but um

4335
02:21:42,639 --> 02:21:45,680
you know people who run it should make

4336
02:21:44,398 --> 02:21:47,199
decisions about how to run it and i'm

4337
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:48,960
not going to tell them

4338
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:51,359
because they're volunteers and i'm

4339
02:21:48,959 --> 02:21:53,679
really thankful that they do that so but

4340
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:55,200
i'm saddened by the fact that

4341
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:56,880
we're not being

4342
02:21:55,200 --> 02:22:00,319
innovative enough

4343
02:21:56,879 --> 02:22:01,519
yeah me too i hope that changes uh yeah

4344
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:03,039
because the communication of science

4345
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:05,359
broadly but communication computer

4346
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:07,920
science ideas

4347
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:09,600
is how you make those ideas have impact

4348
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:12,879
i think yeah and i think you know a lot

4349
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:14,000
of this is um because people have in

4350
02:22:12,879 --> 02:22:16,079
their mind

4351
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:19,120
kind of an objective

4352
02:22:16,079 --> 02:22:21,600
which is you know fairness for authors

4353
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:23,359
and the ability to count points

4354
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:24,640
basically and and give credits

4355
02:22:23,359 --> 02:22:27,120
accurately

4356
02:22:24,639 --> 02:22:28,639
but that comes at the expense of the

4357
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:30,399
progress of science

4358
02:22:28,639 --> 02:22:32,000
so to some extent we're slowing down the

4359
02:22:30,398 --> 02:22:34,159
progress of science

4360
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,920
and are we actually achieving fairness

4361
02:22:34,159 --> 02:22:38,478
and we're not achieving fairness you

4362
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:40,639
know we have biases you know we're doing

4363
02:22:38,478 --> 02:22:42,159
you know double blind review but

4364
02:22:40,639 --> 02:22:44,239
uh

4365
02:22:42,159 --> 02:22:45,280
you know the the biases are still there

4366
02:22:44,239 --> 02:22:46,639
there are different different kinds of

4367
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:48,479
biases

4368
02:22:46,639 --> 02:22:50,639
you write that the phenomenon of

4369
02:22:48,478 --> 02:22:52,478
emergence collective behavior exhibited

4370
02:22:50,639 --> 02:22:54,079
by a large collection of simple elements

4371
02:22:52,478 --> 02:22:56,000
in interaction

4372
02:22:54,079 --> 02:22:58,000
is one of the things that got you into

4373
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:00,239
neural nets in the first place i love

4374
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:02,879
cellular automata i love simple

4375
02:23:00,239 --> 02:23:05,199
interacting elements and the things that

4376
02:23:02,879 --> 02:23:07,358
emerge from them do you think

4377
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:09,680
we understand how complex systems can

4378
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:12,079
emerge from such simple components that

4379
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:13,680
interact simply no we don't

4380
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:17,039
it's a big mystery also it's a mystery

4381
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:20,079
for physicists a mystery for biologists

4382
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:22,479
you know how is it that uh

4383
02:23:20,079 --> 02:23:23,760
the uh universe around us seems to be

4384
02:23:22,478 --> 02:23:24,959
increasing in complexity and not

4385
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:27,200
decreasing

4386
02:23:24,959 --> 02:23:29,759
i mean that that is a kind of a

4387
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:32,159
curious property of uh physics that

4388
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:35,200
despite the second law of thermodynamics

4389
02:23:32,159 --> 02:23:37,039
we seem to be you know evolution and

4390
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:40,479
learning and

4391
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:42,640
etc seems to be can at least locally

4392
02:23:40,478 --> 02:23:44,398
to increase

4393
02:23:42,639 --> 02:23:47,279
complexity not decrease it so perhaps

4394
02:23:44,398 --> 02:23:48,959
the ultimate purpose of the universe is

4395
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:50,159
to just get more complex

4396
02:23:48,959 --> 02:23:51,039
have these

4397
02:23:50,159 --> 02:23:55,200
i mean

4398
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:57,359
uh small pockets of beautiful complexity

4399
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:59,600
does that to sell your automated these

4400
02:23:57,359 --> 02:24:02,800
kinds of emergence and complex systems

4401
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:04,960
give you some intuition or guide

4402
02:24:02,799 --> 02:24:06,799
your understanding of machine learning

4403
02:24:04,959 --> 02:24:08,719
systems and neural networks and so on or

4404
02:24:06,799 --> 02:24:10,719
are these for you right now desperate

4405
02:24:08,719 --> 02:24:13,519
concepts well you got it got me into it

4406
02:24:10,719 --> 02:24:16,398
you know i uh i discovered the existence

4407
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:18,239
of the perceptron when i was a college

4408
02:24:16,398 --> 02:24:19,760
student

4409
02:24:18,239 --> 02:24:22,719
you know by really good book and it was

4410
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:25,040
a debate between chomsky and piaget and

4411
02:24:22,719 --> 02:24:26,639
seymour pepper from mit was kind of

4412
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:28,720
singing the praise of the perception in

4413
02:24:26,639 --> 02:24:30,000
that book and i i the first time i heard

4414
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:31,519
about the learning machine right so i

4415
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:33,760
started digging the literature and i

4416
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:35,600
found those paper those books which were

4417
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:36,478
basically trans transcription of you

4418
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:38,559
know

4419
02:24:36,478 --> 02:24:40,079
workshops or conferences

4420
02:24:38,559 --> 02:24:42,719
from the 50s and 60s about

4421
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:44,559
self-organizing systems so there were

4422
02:24:42,719 --> 02:24:46,478
there was a series of conferences on

4423
02:24:44,559 --> 02:24:48,079
self-organizing systems and the these

4424
02:24:46,478 --> 02:24:49,199
books on this um

4425
02:24:48,079 --> 02:24:50,318
some of them are

4426
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:52,240
you can actually get them at the

4427
02:24:50,318 --> 02:24:54,079
internet archive you know the

4428
02:24:52,239 --> 02:24:54,959
digital version

4429
02:24:54,079 --> 02:24:56,799
uh

4430
02:24:54,959 --> 02:24:59,119
and there are like uh fascinating

4431
02:24:56,799 --> 02:25:00,959
articles in there by this guy whose name

4432
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:02,479
has been largely forgotten heinz von

4433
02:25:00,959 --> 02:25:04,559
firster

4434
02:25:02,478 --> 02:25:06,159
he's a the german physicist who

4435
02:25:04,559 --> 02:25:09,279
immigrated to the u.s

4436
02:25:06,159 --> 02:25:11,119
and uh worked on self-organizing systems

4437
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:13,120
uh in the in the 50s

4438
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:15,680
and in the 60s he created at you know

4439
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:18,720
serving in urbana champagne he created a

4440
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:21,520
biological computer laboratory bcl

4441
02:25:18,719 --> 02:25:22,799
which was you know all about neural nets

4442
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:24,800
unfortunately that was kind of towards

4443
02:25:22,799 --> 02:25:27,199
the end of the popularity of neural nets

4444
02:25:24,799 --> 02:25:28,799
so that that lab never kind of strived

4445
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:30,800
very much but but he wrote a bunch of

4446
02:25:28,799 --> 02:25:33,519
papers about self-organization and

4447
02:25:30,799 --> 02:25:36,159
the mystery of self-organization an

4448
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:38,079
example he has is you take imagine you

4449
02:25:36,159 --> 02:25:39,840
are in space there's no gravity you have

4450
02:25:38,079 --> 02:25:42,478
a big box with uh

4451
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:44,318
magnets in it okay um you know what kind

4452
02:25:42,478 --> 02:25:46,639
of rectangular magnets with north pole

4453
02:25:44,318 --> 02:25:48,879
on one end southbound on the other end

4454
02:25:46,639 --> 02:25:50,159
you shake the box gently and the magnets

4455
02:25:48,879 --> 02:25:52,559
will kind of stick to themselves and

4456
02:25:50,159 --> 02:25:55,039
probably form a complex structure

4457
02:25:52,559 --> 02:25:56,079
um you know spontaneously

4458
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,600
you know that could be an example of

4459
02:25:56,079 --> 02:25:58,959
self-organization but you know you have

4460
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:01,040
lots of examples neural nets are an

4461
02:25:58,959 --> 02:26:02,879
example of self-organization to

4462
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:05,520
you know in many respects

4463
02:26:02,879 --> 02:26:06,799
and it's a it's a bit of a mystery um

4464
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:09,040
you know how

4465
02:26:06,799 --> 02:26:10,559
like what what is possible with this um

4466
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:11,760
you know pattern formation in physical

4467
02:26:10,559 --> 02:26:13,600
systems

4468
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:15,920
in chaotic system and things like that

4469
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:17,200
you know you know the emergence of life

4470
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:18,159
you know things like that so you know

4471
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:19,359
how does

4472
02:26:18,159 --> 02:26:21,439
does that happen

4473
02:26:19,359 --> 02:26:23,040
it's a it's a big puzzle for for

4474
02:26:21,439 --> 02:26:24,639
physicists as well it feels like

4475
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:26,560
understanding this

4476
02:26:24,639 --> 02:26:28,799
the the mathematics

4477
02:26:26,559 --> 02:26:30,639
of emergence in some constrained

4478
02:26:28,799 --> 02:26:32,079
situations might help us create

4479
02:26:30,639 --> 02:26:35,199
intelligence

4480
02:26:32,079 --> 02:26:37,840
like uh help us add a little spice to

4481
02:26:35,200 --> 02:26:39,439
the systems because um you seem to be

4482
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:42,159
able to

4483
02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:44,479
in complex systems with emergence to be

4484
02:26:42,159 --> 02:26:46,879
able to get a lot from little

4485
02:26:44,478 --> 02:26:49,679
and so that seems like a shortcut

4486
02:26:46,879 --> 02:26:51,920
to get big leaps in performance

4487
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:54,318
but um but there's there's a missing

4488
02:26:51,920 --> 02:26:56,639
conservative concept that we are we

4489
02:26:54,318 --> 02:26:58,318
don't have yeah uh and it's uh it's

4490
02:26:56,639 --> 02:27:01,039
something also i've been fascinated by

4491
02:26:58,318 --> 02:27:03,519
since uh my undergrad days and it's how

4492
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:05,760
you measure complexity

4493
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:07,680
right so we don't actually have good

4494
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:09,680
ways of measuring or at least we don't

4495
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:11,120
have good ways of interpreting

4496
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:12,479
the measures that we we have at our

4497
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:14,720
disposal like how do you measure the

4498
02:27:12,478 --> 02:27:16,239
complexity of something right so there's

4499
02:27:14,719 --> 02:27:17,760
all those things you know like you know

4500
02:27:16,239 --> 02:27:19,920
common goal of chatting solomon of

4501
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:21,680
complexity of you know the length of the

4502
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:23,680
shortest program that would generate a b

4503
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:25,760
string can be thought of as the

4504
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:26,639
complexity of that bit string right

4505
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:28,159
um

4506
02:27:26,639 --> 02:27:31,439
i've been fascinated by that concept the

4507
02:27:28,159 --> 02:27:33,280
problem with that is that

4508
02:27:31,439 --> 02:27:35,760
that complexity is defined up to a

4509
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:37,600
constant which can be very large

4510
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:40,719
right there's there are similar concepts

4511
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:43,280
that are derived from you know

4512
02:27:40,719 --> 02:27:45,039
you know bayesian probability theory

4513
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:46,239
where you know the complexity of

4514
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:48,240
something is

4515
02:27:46,239 --> 02:27:49,680
the negative log of its probability

4516
02:27:48,239 --> 02:27:50,959
essentially right and you have a

4517
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:52,079
complete equivalence between the two

4518
02:27:50,959 --> 02:27:53,199
things

4519
02:27:52,079 --> 02:27:55,120
and there you would think you know the

4520
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:56,640
probability is something that's well

4521
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:58,479
defined mathematically which means

4522
02:27:56,639 --> 02:28:00,478
complexity is well-defined but it's not

4523
02:27:58,478 --> 02:28:02,239
true you need to have a model of

4524
02:28:00,478 --> 02:28:03,760
of of the distribution

4525
02:28:02,239 --> 02:28:05,199
and you may need to have a prior if

4526
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:07,280
you're doing bayesian inference and the

4527
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:08,560
prior plays the same role as the choice

4528
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:11,359
of the computer with which you measure

4529
02:28:08,559 --> 02:28:13,279
your graph complexity and so every

4530
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:15,120
measure of complexity we have has some

4531
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:16,159
arbitrary necessity

4532
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:18,720
um

4533
02:28:16,159 --> 02:28:21,840
you know an additive constant which

4534
02:28:18,719 --> 02:28:23,679
is can be arbitrarily large and so

4535
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:25,439
you know how can we come up with a good

4536
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:26,239
theory of how things become more complex

4537
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:29,040
if we don't have a good measure of

4538
02:28:26,239 --> 02:28:31,520
complexity yeah which we need for this

4539
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:33,600
one way that people study this in the

4540
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:35,359
space of biology the people that study

4541
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:37,680
the origin of life or try to recreate

4542
02:28:35,359 --> 02:28:39,120
the life in in the laboratory

4543
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:41,920
and the more interesting one is the

4544
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:44,479
alien one is when we go to other planets

4545
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:46,639
how do we recognize this life

4546
02:28:44,478 --> 02:28:48,959
because you know complexity we associate

4547
02:28:46,639 --> 02:28:50,559
complexity maybe some level of mobility

4548
02:28:48,959 --> 02:28:52,959
with life

4549
02:28:50,559 --> 02:28:54,639
you know we have to be able to like have

4550
02:28:52,959 --> 02:28:57,199
concrete

4551
02:28:54,639 --> 02:28:59,920
algorithms for like

4552
02:28:57,200 --> 02:29:01,600
um measuring the level of complexity we

4553
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:03,439
see in order to know the difference

4554
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:05,040
between life and non-life and the

4555
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:07,280
problem is that complexity is in the eye

4556
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:10,960
of the beholder so let me give you an

4557
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:13,840
example if i um if i give you uh

4558
02:29:10,959 --> 02:29:16,318
an image of the endless digits right and

4559
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:17,920
i flip through any digits there is some

4560
02:29:16,318 --> 02:29:19,680
obviously some

4561
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:21,280
structure to it because

4562
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:23,840
local structure you know neighboring

4563
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:25,920
pixels are correlated uh

4564
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:28,239
across the entire data set

4565
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:31,120
now imagine that

4566
02:29:28,239 --> 02:29:32,559
i apply a random permutation to all the

4567
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:34,800
pixels

4568
02:29:32,559 --> 02:29:37,359
a fixed random permutation now i show

4569
02:29:34,799 --> 02:29:39,599
you those images they will look

4570
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:41,120
you know really disorganized to you more

4571
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:42,720
complex

4572
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:44,319
in fact they're not more complex in

4573
02:29:42,719 --> 02:29:46,478
absolute terms they're exactly the same

4574
02:29:44,318 --> 02:29:48,159
as originally right and if you knew what

4575
02:29:46,478 --> 02:29:51,119
the permutation was you know you could

4576
02:29:48,159 --> 02:29:52,959
undo the permutation now

4577
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:54,479
imagine i give you special glasses that

4578
02:29:52,959 --> 02:29:56,000
undo that permutation

4579
02:29:54,478 --> 02:29:58,719
now all of a sudden what looked

4580
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,000
complicated becomes simple right so if

4581
02:29:58,719 --> 02:30:02,079
you have two

4582
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:03,840
if you have you know humans on one end

4583
02:30:02,079 --> 02:30:05,359
and then another race of aliens that

4584
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:06,799
sees the universe with permutation

4585
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:08,559
glasses yeah with the permutation

4586
02:30:06,799 --> 02:30:10,318
glasses

4587
02:30:08,559 --> 02:30:12,239
what we perceive as simple to them is

4588
02:30:10,318 --> 02:30:14,559
hardly complicated it's probably heat

4589
02:30:12,239 --> 02:30:17,520
yeah heat yeah okay and what they

4590
02:30:14,559 --> 02:30:20,318
perceive as simple to us is is random uh

4591
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:22,640
fluctuation it's heat yeah

4592
02:30:20,318 --> 02:30:23,920
so truly in the eye of the beholder it

4593
02:30:22,639 --> 02:30:25,599
depends what kind of glasses you're

4594
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:27,040
wearing right depends what kind of

4595
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:29,040
algorithm you're running in your

4596
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:30,960
perception system so i don't think we'll

4597
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:33,600
have a theory of intelligence

4598
02:30:30,959 --> 02:30:37,039
self-organization evolution things like

4599
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:39,120
that until we have a good handle on

4600
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:42,240
a notion of complexity which we know is

4601
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:44,000
in the higher the eye of the beholder

4602
02:30:42,239 --> 02:30:46,639
yeah it's sad to think that we might not

4603
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:48,639
be able to detect or interact with alien

4604
02:30:46,639 --> 02:30:49,760
species because we're wearing different

4605
02:30:48,639 --> 02:30:51,358
glasses

4606
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:52,960
um because their notion of locality

4607
02:30:51,359 --> 02:30:54,800
might be different from ours yeah this

4608
02:30:52,959 --> 02:30:56,159
actually connects with fascinating

4609
02:30:54,799 --> 02:30:58,000
questions in physics at the moment like

4610
02:30:56,159 --> 02:30:59,600
modern physics

4611
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:01,359
quantum physics like you know

4612
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:03,040
questions about like you know can we

4613
02:31:01,359 --> 02:31:04,479
recover the information that's lost in a

4614
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:06,960
black hole and things like this right

4615
02:31:04,478 --> 02:31:08,879
and uh and that relies on notions of

4616
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:10,478
complexity um

4617
02:31:08,879 --> 02:31:12,398
yeah which you know i find i find this

4618
02:31:10,478 --> 02:31:15,438
fascinating can you describe your

4619
02:31:12,398 --> 02:31:16,799
personal quest to build an expressive

4620
02:31:15,439 --> 02:31:19,680
electronic

4621
02:31:16,799 --> 02:31:22,000
wind instrument ewi

4622
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:25,040
what is it what does it take

4623
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:26,559
to uh to build it well i'm a tinkerer i

4624
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:28,160
like building things

4625
02:31:26,559 --> 02:31:30,398
i like building things with combinations

4626
02:31:28,159 --> 02:31:31,439
of electronics and you know mechanical

4627
02:31:30,398 --> 02:31:33,599
stuff

4628
02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:35,439
um you know i have a bunch of different

4629
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:37,520
hobbies but um

4630
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:39,200
you know probably my first one was

4631
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:40,399
little was building model airplanes and

4632
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:41,680
stuff like that and i still do that to

4633
02:31:40,398 --> 02:31:43,119
some extent

4634
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:46,159
but also electronics i taught myself

4635
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:47,520
electronics before i studied it

4636
02:31:46,159 --> 02:31:49,840
and the reason i taught myself

4637
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:51,359
electronics is because of music

4638
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:53,120
my cousin

4639
02:31:51,359 --> 02:31:55,280
was an aspiring electronic musician and

4640
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:57,840
he had an analog synthesizer and i was

4641
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:59,359
you know basically modifying it for him

4642
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:00,880
and building sequencers and stuff like

4643
02:31:59,359 --> 02:32:02,640
that right for him i was i was in high

4644
02:32:00,879 --> 02:32:04,318
school when i was doing this

4645
02:32:02,639 --> 02:32:05,840
that's the interesting like progressive

4646
02:32:04,318 --> 02:32:07,439
rock like 80s

4647
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:09,680
like what's what's the greatest band of

4648
02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:11,280
all time according to yala um

4649
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:14,318
there's two there's too many of them but

4650
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:15,760
you know it's a combination of uh

4651
02:32:14,318 --> 02:32:18,719
uh

4652
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:21,040
you know my vision orchestra uh

4653
02:32:18,719 --> 02:32:25,799
weather report yes

4654
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:25,800
genesis uh you know yes

4655
02:32:26,959 --> 02:32:29,839
gentle giant you know things like that

4656
02:32:28,959 --> 02:32:31,438
great

4657
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:33,200
okay so this uh this level of

4658
02:32:31,439 --> 02:32:34,880
electronics and this love of music

4659
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:37,359
combined together right so i was

4660
02:32:34,879 --> 02:32:38,959
actually trying to play a

4661
02:32:37,359 --> 02:32:41,359
baroque and renaissance

4662
02:32:38,959 --> 02:32:43,759
music and i played in a

4663
02:32:41,359 --> 02:32:45,600
orchestra when i was in high school in

4664
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:47,840
uh first years of college

4665
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:49,840
and i played the recorder chrome horn a

4666
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:52,398
little bit of oboe you know things like

4667
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:53,840
that so i'm a win instrument player but

4668
02:32:52,398 --> 02:32:55,039
i always wanted to play improvised music

4669
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:55,760
even though i don't know anything about

4670
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:58,720
it

4671
02:32:55,760 --> 02:33:00,960
uh and the only way i figured you know

4672
02:32:58,719 --> 02:33:02,079
short of like learning to play saxophone

4673
02:33:00,959 --> 02:33:03,839
was to

4674
02:33:02,079 --> 02:33:05,680
play electronic instruments so they

4675
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:08,079
behave like the fingering is similar to

4676
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:09,680
a saxophone but you know you have wide

4677
02:33:08,079 --> 02:33:12,159
variety of sound because you control the

4678
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:13,920
synthesizer with it so i had a bunch of

4679
02:33:12,159 --> 02:33:15,439
those you know going back to the late

4680
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:16,799
80s

4681
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:18,079
from either

4682
02:33:16,799 --> 02:33:21,438
yamaha or

4683
02:33:18,079 --> 02:33:22,799
akai they they're both kind of the main

4684
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:24,159
manufacturers of those so they were

4685
02:33:22,799 --> 02:33:25,279
classically you know going back several

4686
02:33:24,159 --> 02:33:26,879
decades

4687
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:28,319
uh but i've never been completely

4688
02:33:26,879 --> 02:33:30,959
satisfied with them because of lack of

4689
02:33:28,318 --> 02:33:32,559
exclusivity

4690
02:33:30,959 --> 02:33:33,759
and you know those things you know are

4691
02:33:32,559 --> 02:33:35,760
somewhat expensive i mean they measure

4692
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:37,600
the breast pressure they measure the lip

4693
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:38,318
pressure and you know

4694
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:40,079
uh

4695
02:33:38,318 --> 02:33:42,318
you have like various parameters you can

4696
02:33:40,079 --> 02:33:44,879
you can vary it with fingers but they

4697
02:33:42,318 --> 02:33:47,119
they they're not really as expressive as

4698
02:33:44,879 --> 02:33:49,358
a acoustic instrument right you um you

4699
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:50,720
hear john coltrane play two notes and

4700
02:33:49,359 --> 02:33:52,559
you hear you know his john cochrane you

4701
02:33:50,719 --> 02:33:54,559
know he's got a unique sound

4702
02:33:52,559 --> 02:33:56,079
uh or or mike davis right you can hear

4703
02:33:54,559 --> 02:33:59,119
his mice davis

4704
02:33:56,079 --> 02:34:00,398
uh playing the trumpet because the the

4705
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:02,800
sound

4706
02:34:00,398 --> 02:34:05,279
reflects their

4707
02:34:02,799 --> 02:34:06,959
you know physiology basically the shape

4708
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:08,000
of the vocal tract

4709
02:34:06,959 --> 02:34:10,239
um

4710
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:12,000
kind of shapes the the sound so how how

4711
02:34:10,239 --> 02:34:13,680
do you do this with uh electronic

4712
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:15,600
instrument and i was

4713
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:16,800
many years ago i met a guy called david

4714
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:18,800
wessel he

4715
02:34:16,799 --> 02:34:20,719
he was a professor at berkeley and

4716
02:34:18,799 --> 02:34:22,079
created the

4717
02:34:20,719 --> 02:34:24,000
center for like you know music

4718
02:34:22,079 --> 02:34:26,000
technology there and he was interested

4719
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,280
in that question

4720
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:29,600
and so i kept kind of thinking about

4721
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:31,760
this for many years and finally because

4722
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:33,520
i covered you know i was at home i was

4723
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:35,600
in my workshop my workshop serves also

4724
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:36,560
as my kind of zoom uh

4725
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:38,720
room and

4726
02:34:36,559 --> 02:34:41,920
home office and this is in new jersey in

4727
02:34:38,719 --> 02:34:43,438
new jersey and um i started uh

4728
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:46,079
really being serious about you know

4729
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:48,079
building my own ewe instrument what else

4730
02:34:46,079 --> 02:34:50,159
is going on in that new jersey workshop

4731
02:34:48,079 --> 02:34:52,478
is there some is there some crazy stuff

4732
02:34:50,159 --> 02:34:54,318
you built like just or or like left on

4733
02:34:52,478 --> 02:34:57,039
the workshop floor

4734
02:34:54,318 --> 02:34:59,359
left behind a lot of crazy stuff is uh

4735
02:34:57,040 --> 02:35:01,520
you know electronics with built with

4736
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:02,800
microcontrollers of various kinds

4737
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:06,399
and you know

4738
02:35:02,799 --> 02:35:06,398
weird flying contraptions

4739
02:35:06,559 --> 02:35:10,959
so you still love flying

4740
02:35:08,478 --> 02:35:13,358
it's a family disease my my dad got me

4741
02:35:10,959 --> 02:35:14,318
into it when i was a kid

4742
02:35:13,359 --> 02:35:15,920
and

4743
02:35:14,318 --> 02:35:18,639
he was building model airplanes when he

4744
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:20,719
was a kid and uh and he was a mechanical

4745
02:35:18,639 --> 02:35:23,119
engineer he taught himself electronics

4746
02:35:20,719 --> 02:35:24,799
also so he he built his early radio

4747
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:26,880
control systems in the

4748
02:35:24,799 --> 02:35:29,519
late 60s early 70s

4749
02:35:26,879 --> 02:35:30,959
um and so that that's what got me into i

4750
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:32,880
mean he got me into kind of you know

4751
02:35:30,959 --> 02:35:34,639
engineering and science and technology

4752
02:35:32,879 --> 02:35:36,559
do you also have an interest in

4753
02:35:34,639 --> 02:35:39,119
appreciation of flight in other forms

4754
02:35:36,559 --> 02:35:41,600
like with drones quadropters or do you

4755
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:42,560
do yes is it model airplane the thing

4756
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:44,720
you know i

4757
02:35:42,559 --> 02:35:46,318
you know before drones were

4758
02:35:44,719 --> 02:35:48,000
you know kind of a

4759
02:35:46,318 --> 02:35:50,478
consumer product

4760
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:53,520
um you know i built my own you know with

4761
02:35:50,478 --> 02:35:55,358
also building a microcontroller with uh

4762
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:57,040
gyroscopes and accelerometers for

4763
02:35:55,359 --> 02:35:58,479
stabilization writing the firmware for

4764
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:59,680
it you know and then when it became kind

4765
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:01,039
of a standard thing you could buy it was

4766
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:04,559
boring you know i stopped doing it it

4767
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:06,160
was not fun anymore um yeah

4768
02:36:04,559 --> 02:36:08,879
you were doing it before it was cool

4769
02:36:06,159 --> 02:36:10,719
yeah what uh advice would you give to a

4770
02:36:08,879 --> 02:36:12,239
young person today in high school and

4771
02:36:10,719 --> 02:36:13,760
college that

4772
02:36:12,239 --> 02:36:16,000
dreams of doing

4773
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:18,880
something big like young lacoon like

4774
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:20,959
let's talk in the space of intelligence

4775
02:36:18,879 --> 02:36:22,559
dreams of having a chance to solve some

4776
02:36:20,959 --> 02:36:23,839
fundamental problems in space of

4777
02:36:22,559 --> 02:36:26,079
intelligence

4778
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:28,639
both for their career and just in life

4779
02:36:26,079 --> 02:36:30,639
being somebody who was a part of

4780
02:36:28,639 --> 02:36:31,920
creating something special

4781
02:36:30,639 --> 02:36:33,599
so

4782
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:35,840
try to get

4783
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:36,640
interested by big questions things like

4784
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:38,719
you know

4785
02:36:36,639 --> 02:36:40,799
what is intelligence uh

4786
02:36:38,719 --> 02:36:43,358
what is the universe made of what's life

4787
02:36:40,799 --> 02:36:44,879
all about things like that

4788
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:47,359
um

4789
02:36:44,879 --> 02:36:49,679
like even like crazy big questions like

4790
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:52,079
um what's time like nobody knows what

4791
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:52,079
time is

4792
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:56,160
and

4793
02:36:54,639 --> 02:36:57,680
and then

4794
02:36:56,159 --> 02:37:00,079
learn

4795
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:01,359
basic things like basic methods either

4796
02:37:00,079 --> 02:37:03,120
from math from physics or from

4797
02:37:01,359 --> 02:37:05,359
engineering

4798
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:07,359
things that have a long shelf life

4799
02:37:05,359 --> 02:37:08,640
like if you have a choice between like

4800
02:37:07,359 --> 02:37:10,880
you know

4801
02:37:08,639 --> 02:37:12,478
learning uh you know mobile programming

4802
02:37:10,879 --> 02:37:13,839
on iphone

4803
02:37:12,478 --> 02:37:16,318
or quantum mechanics take quantum

4804
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:16,318
mechanics

4805
02:37:16,398 --> 02:37:20,799
um because you're going to learn things

4806
02:37:18,318 --> 02:37:22,959
that you have no idea exist it and you

4807
02:37:20,799 --> 02:37:25,119
may not you nev you know you may never

4808
02:37:22,959 --> 02:37:26,639
be a quantum physicist

4809
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:28,560
but you will learn about path integrals

4810
02:37:26,639 --> 02:37:29,840
and path integrals are used uh

4811
02:37:28,559 --> 02:37:31,519
everywhere it's the same formula that

4812
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:33,439
you use for you know bayesian

4813
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:36,000
integration and stuff like that so the

4814
02:37:33,439 --> 02:37:38,079
ideas the little ideas

4815
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:39,680
within quantum mechanics

4816
02:37:38,079 --> 02:37:42,000
within some of these kind of more

4817
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:44,159
solidified fields will have a longer

4818
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:47,040
shelf life that you'll somehow

4819
02:37:44,159 --> 02:37:48,639
use indirectly in in your work learn

4820
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:50,319
classical mechanics like you learn about

4821
02:37:48,639 --> 02:37:51,199
lagrangians for example

4822
02:37:50,318 --> 02:37:53,519
um

4823
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:55,280
which is like a huge

4824
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:57,200
hugely useful concept you know for all

4825
02:37:55,280 --> 02:38:00,479
kinds of different things uh

4826
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:03,200
learn uh statistical physics because uh

4827
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:04,799
all the math that comes out of you know

4828
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:07,040
for machine learning

4829
02:38:04,799 --> 02:38:08,959
uh basically comes out of uh was figured

4830
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:10,880
out by statistical physicists in the you

4831
02:38:08,959 --> 02:38:12,000
know late 19th early 20th century right

4832
02:38:10,879 --> 02:38:13,599
so

4833
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:15,600
uh and for some of them actually more

4834
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:17,920
recently for by people like giorgio

4835
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:20,399
perezi who just got a nobel prize for

4836
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:22,719
the replica method among other things um

4837
02:38:20,398 --> 02:38:25,519
it's used for a lot of different things

4838
02:38:22,719 --> 02:38:28,559
uh you know variational inference

4839
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:29,439
that math comes from statistical physics

4840
02:38:28,559 --> 02:38:30,398
so

4841
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:32,800
um

4842
02:38:30,398 --> 02:38:35,199
so a lot of those kind of you know

4843
02:38:32,799 --> 02:38:36,719
busy courses you know you'll if you do

4844
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:38,079
electrical engineering you take signal

4845
02:38:36,719 --> 02:38:39,760
processing you'll you'll learn about

4846
02:38:38,079 --> 02:38:41,680
fourier transforms

4847
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:43,760
again something super useful

4848
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:47,600
it's at the basis of things like graph

4849
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:50,079
neural nets which is an entirely new

4850
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:51,600
sub area of you know ai machine learning

4851
02:38:50,079 --> 02:38:54,239
deep learning which i think is super

4852
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:55,520
promising for all kinds of applications

4853
02:38:54,239 --> 02:38:56,799
something very promising if you're more

4854
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:58,800
interested in applications is the

4855
02:38:56,799 --> 02:39:01,358
applications of ai machine learning and

4856
02:38:58,799 --> 02:39:03,199
deep learning to science

4857
02:39:01,359 --> 02:39:04,960
or to

4858
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:06,800
science that can help solve big problems

4859
02:39:04,959 --> 02:39:09,039
in the world like i have colleagues at

4860
02:39:06,799 --> 02:39:10,478
uh at meta at fair

4861
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:12,399
we started this project called open

4862
02:39:10,478 --> 02:39:14,398
catalyst and it's

4863
02:39:12,398 --> 02:39:17,840
it's an open project collaborative

4864
02:39:14,398 --> 02:39:19,519
and the idea is to use deep learning to

4865
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:22,079
help design

4866
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:23,840
new chemical compounds or materials that

4867
02:39:22,079 --> 02:39:25,680
would facilitate the separation of

4868
02:39:23,840 --> 02:39:27,760
hydrogen from oxygen

4869
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:30,880
if you can efficiently separate oxygen

4870
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:33,359
from hydrogen with electricity

4871
02:39:30,879 --> 02:39:36,079
you you solve climate change

4872
02:39:33,359 --> 02:39:38,000
it's as simple as that because

4873
02:39:36,079 --> 02:39:40,239
you you cover you know some random

4874
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:42,398
desert with uh solar panels

4875
02:39:40,239 --> 02:39:43,920
uh and you have have them work all day

4876
02:39:42,398 --> 02:39:45,358
produce hydrogen and then you shoot the

4877
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:47,439
adrenaline wherever it's needed you

4878
02:39:45,359 --> 02:39:48,399
don't need anything else

4879
02:39:47,439 --> 02:39:51,040
uh

4880
02:39:48,398 --> 02:39:52,398
you know you you have

4881
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:55,040
controllable

4882
02:39:52,398 --> 02:39:58,239
power that's you know can be transported

4883
02:39:55,040 --> 02:40:00,000
anywhere so if we if we have a

4884
02:39:58,239 --> 02:40:03,039
large-scale efficient

4885
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:05,280
uh energy storage technology like

4886
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:06,880
producing hydrogen

4887
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:08,479
we solve climate change here's another

4888
02:40:06,879 --> 02:40:10,079
way to solve climate change

4889
02:40:08,478 --> 02:40:11,760
is uh figuring out how to make fusion

4890
02:40:10,079 --> 02:40:13,680
work now the problem with fusion is that

4891
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:15,439
you make a super hot plasma and the

4892
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:17,279
plasma is unstable and you can't control

4893
02:40:15,439 --> 02:40:19,040
it maybe with deep learning you can find

4894
02:40:17,279 --> 02:40:20,319
controllers that will sterilize plasma

4895
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:21,439
and make you know practical fusion

4896
02:40:20,318 --> 02:40:23,278
reactors

4897
02:40:21,439 --> 02:40:25,439
i mean that's very speculative but you

4898
02:40:23,279 --> 02:40:27,200
know it's worth trying because

4899
02:40:25,439 --> 02:40:28,639
um you know

4900
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:30,960
the payoff is huge there's a group at

4901
02:40:28,639 --> 02:40:32,318
google working on this led by john platt

4902
02:40:30,959 --> 02:40:34,559
so control

4903
02:40:32,318 --> 02:40:38,398
convert as many problems in science and

4904
02:40:34,559 --> 02:40:40,079
physics and biology and chemistry into a

4905
02:40:38,398 --> 02:40:41,439
into a learnable problem and see if a

4906
02:40:40,079 --> 02:40:43,520
machine can learn it

4907
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:45,680
right i mean there's properties of uh

4908
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:47,279
you know complex materials that we don't

4909
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:49,600
understand from first principle for

4910
02:40:47,279 --> 02:40:52,640
example right so you know if we could

4911
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:54,239
design uh new um

4912
02:40:52,639 --> 02:40:55,599
you know new materials

4913
02:40:54,239 --> 02:40:57,840
uh we could make more efficient

4914
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:59,279
batteries you know we could make maybe

4915
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:01,120
faster electronics we could i mean

4916
02:40:59,279 --> 02:41:03,760
there's a lot of things we can imagine

4917
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:05,680
uh doing or you know lighter uh

4918
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:07,439
materials for for cars or airplanes and

4919
02:41:05,680 --> 02:41:08,800
things like that maybe better fuel cells

4920
02:41:07,439 --> 02:41:10,398
i mean there's all kinds of stuff we can

4921
02:41:08,799 --> 02:41:12,639
imagine if we had good fuel cells

4922
02:41:10,398 --> 02:41:14,639
hydrogen fuel cells uh we could use them

4923
02:41:12,639 --> 02:41:17,039
to power airplanes and you know

4924
02:41:14,639 --> 02:41:19,039
transportation wouldn't be uh or cars

4925
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:20,880
and we wouldn't have uh

4926
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:22,560
emission problem uh co2 emission

4927
02:41:20,879 --> 02:41:25,358
problems for for

4928
02:41:22,559 --> 02:41:26,799
uh air transportation anymore so

4929
02:41:25,359 --> 02:41:30,239
there's a lot of those things i think

4930
02:41:26,799 --> 02:41:31,599
where ai you know can be used it

4931
02:41:30,239 --> 02:41:34,000
and this is not even talking about all

4932
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:35,520
the sort of medicine biology and and

4933
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,879
everything like that right

4934
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:39,040
you know like you know

4935
02:41:36,879 --> 02:41:40,398
protein folding you know figuring out

4936
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:41,920
like how can you design your proteins

4937
02:41:40,398 --> 02:41:43,278
that it sticks to another protein at a

4938
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:45,279
particular site because that's how you

4939
02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:47,439
design drugs in the end

4940
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:48,960
um so you know diploma would be used for

4941
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:51,040
all of this and those are kind of you

4942
02:41:48,959 --> 02:41:53,519
know would be sort of enormous progress

4943
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:55,439
if we could uh use it for that here's an

4944
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:57,439
example if you take

4945
02:41:55,439 --> 02:42:01,200
this is like from recent material

4946
02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:03,439
physics you take a monoatomic layer of

4947
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:05,840
graphene right so it's just carbon

4948
02:42:03,439 --> 02:42:08,880
on a hexagonal mesh and you make this

4949
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:10,639
single single atom thick

4950
02:42:08,879 --> 02:42:12,959
you put another one on top you twist

4951
02:42:10,639 --> 02:42:14,559
them by some magic number of degrees

4952
02:42:12,959 --> 02:42:16,559
three degrees or something

4953
02:42:14,559 --> 02:42:19,920
it becomes super conductor

4954
02:42:16,559 --> 02:42:19,920
nobody has any idea why

4955
02:42:20,719 --> 02:42:23,199
uh i want to know how that was

4956
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:24,159
discovered but that's the kind of thing

4957
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:26,399
that machine learning can actually

4958
02:42:24,159 --> 02:42:28,000
discover these well thanks maybe not but

4959
02:42:26,398 --> 02:42:30,000
but there is uh

4960
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:32,719
a hint perhaps that with machine

4961
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:35,279
learning we could train a system to

4962
02:42:32,719 --> 02:42:37,438
basically be a phenomenological model of

4963
02:42:35,279 --> 02:42:38,479
some complex emerging phenomenon which

4964
02:42:37,439 --> 02:42:41,040
you know

4965
02:42:38,478 --> 02:42:42,318
superconductivity is one of those

4966
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:44,160
uh

4967
02:42:42,318 --> 02:42:45,760
where you know think the the skeletal

4968
02:42:44,159 --> 02:42:47,680
phenomenon is too difficult to describe

4969
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:48,639
from first principles with the current

4970
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:50,639
you know

4971
02:42:48,639 --> 02:42:52,840
the usual sort of you know reductionist

4972
02:42:50,639 --> 02:42:55,278
type method but we could

4973
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:56,960
have deep learning systems that predict

4974
02:42:55,279 --> 02:42:59,040
the properties

4975
02:42:56,959 --> 02:43:01,278
of a system from a description of it

4976
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:04,319
after being trained with sufficiently

4977
02:43:01,279 --> 02:43:04,319
many samples

4978
02:43:04,639 --> 02:43:08,478
this guy pascal fuad epfl he has a

4979
02:43:07,120 --> 02:43:09,600
starter company

4980
02:43:08,478 --> 02:43:12,719
that

4981
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:14,559
where he basically trained uh a

4982
02:43:12,719 --> 02:43:16,639
convolutional net essentially to

4983
02:43:14,559 --> 02:43:17,760
predict the aerodynamic properties of

4984
02:43:16,639 --> 02:43:19,278
solids

4985
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:21,120
and you can generate as much data as you

4986
02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:23,120
want by just running computational free

4987
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:25,600
dynamics right so you give a

4988
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:27,040
like a

4989
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:29,520
a wing

4990
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:31,279
airfoil or something shape of some kind

4991
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:33,520
and you run computational free dynamics

4992
02:43:31,279 --> 02:43:36,800
you get as a result the

4993
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:38,800
drag and you know lyft and all that

4994
02:43:36,799 --> 02:43:40,959
stuff right and you can you can generate

4995
02:43:38,799 --> 02:43:42,239
lots of data train a neural net to make

4996
02:43:40,959 --> 02:43:44,000
those predictions and now what you have

4997
02:43:42,239 --> 02:43:47,039
is a differentiable model

4998
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:48,639
of let's say dragon and lift as a

4999
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:49,840
function of the shape of that solid and

5000
02:43:48,639 --> 02:43:51,840
so you can do backward understand you

5001
02:43:49,840 --> 02:43:54,639
can optimize the shape so you get the

5002
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:54,639
properties you want

5003
02:43:54,719 --> 02:43:58,159
yeah that's incredible that's incredible

5004
02:43:56,478 --> 02:43:59,519
and on top of all that

5005
02:43:58,159 --> 02:44:00,639
probably

5006
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:03,600
you should read a little bit of

5007
02:44:00,639 --> 02:44:04,478
literature and a little bit of history

5008
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:07,040
for

5009
02:44:04,478 --> 02:44:08,959
inspiration and for wisdom because after

5010
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:10,800
all all these technologies will have to

5011
02:44:08,959 --> 02:44:14,239
work in the human world yes and the

5012
02:44:10,799 --> 02:44:14,239
human world is complicated

5013
02:44:14,879 --> 02:44:18,559
yeah and this is um

5014
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:20,240

that's going on you're you're a beacon

5021
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:32,720
of hope for the machine learning

5022

world
