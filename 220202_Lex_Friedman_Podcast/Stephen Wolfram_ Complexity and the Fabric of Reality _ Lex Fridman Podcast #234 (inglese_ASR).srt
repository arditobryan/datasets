00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,479
stephen wolfram his third time on the

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,279
podcast he's a computer scientist

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,759
mathematician theoretical physicist and

5
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,000
the founder of wolfram research a

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,560
company behind mathematica wolf from

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,559
alpha wolfram language and the new

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:21,439
wolfram physics project

9
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,919
this conversation is a wild technical

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,719
rollercoaster ride through topics of

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,039
complexity mathematics physics computing

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:32,558
and consciousness i think this is what

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,719
this podcast is becoming a wild ride

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,599
some episodes are about physics some

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,399
about robots some are about war and

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,120
power some are about the human condition

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,239
and our search for meaning and some are

18
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,759
just what the comedian tim dillon calls

19
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:49,839
fun

20
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,679
this is the lex friedman podcast to

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
support it please check out the sponsors

22
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,679
in the description and now here's my

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,558
conversation with steven wolfram

24
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,640
almost 20 years ago you published a new

25
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,359
kind of science where you presented a

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,799
study of complexity and an approach for

27
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:11,200
modeling of complex systems so

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,560
let us return again to the core idea of

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,439
complexity

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,240
what

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,478
is

32
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,560
complexity i don't know i think that's

33
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,280
not the most interesting question it's

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,359
like

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,680
you know if you ask a biologist what is

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,519
life yeah that's not the question they

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,439
care the most about

38
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,039
what i was interested in is

39
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,359
how does

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,280
something that we would usually identify

41
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,200
as complexity arise in nature and i got

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,719
interested in that question like 50

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,079
years ago which is really embarrassingly

44
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,879
a long time ago

45
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,798
and you know i i was uh you know how

46
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,478
does snowflakes get to have complicated

47
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,399
forms how do galaxies get to have

48
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,560
complicated shapes how does you know how

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,879
do living systems get produced things

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,118
like that and the question is what's the

51
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,560
sort of underlying scientific basis for

52
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,200
those kinds of things

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,560
and the thing that i was at first very

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,640
surprised by because i've been doing

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,478
physics and particle physics and fancy

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,320
mathematical physics and so on and it's

57
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,759
like i know all this fancy stuff i

58
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,560
should be able to solve this sort of

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,239
basic science question and i couldn't

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,878
this was like early maybe

61
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,360
1980-ish time frame and it's like okay

62
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,199
what can one do to understand the sort

63
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,879
of basic secret that nature seems to

64
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,238
have because it seems like nature you

65
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,560
look around in the natural world it's

66
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,599
full of incredibly complicated forms you

67
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,000
look at

68
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,839
sort of most engineered kinds of things

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,239
for instance they tend to be you know

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,640
we've got sort of circles and

71
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,800
lines and things like this the question

72
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,199
is what secret does nature have that

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,599
lets it make all this complexity that we

74
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,679
in doing engineering for example don't

75
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:44,799
naturally seem to have and so that was

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,879
the kind of the thing that i got

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,040
interested in and then the question was

78
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,719
you know could i understand that with

79
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,959
things like mathematical physics well

80
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,878
didn't work very well so then i got to

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,120
thinking about okay is there some other

82
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,799
way to try to understand this and then

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,878
the question was if you're going to look

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
at some system in nature how do you make

85
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,479
a model for that system for what that

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,640
system does so you know a model is some

87
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,199
abstract representation of the system

88
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,878
some formal representation system what

89
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,839
are what is the raw material that you

90
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:16,719
can make that model out of and so what i

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,039
realized was well actually programs are

92
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,359
really good source of raw material for

93
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,400
making models of things and you know in

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,319
terms of my personal history the to me

95
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,680
that seemed really obvious and the

96
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,119
reason it seemed really obvious is

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
because i just spent several years

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,878
building this big piece of software that

99
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200
was sort of a predecessor to mathematica

100
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,598
and multiple language thing called smp

101
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,399
symbolic manipulation program which was

102
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:43,119
something that had this idea of starting

103
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
from just these computational primitives

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,640
and building up everything one had to

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,480
build up and so kind of the notion of

106
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,000
well let's just try and make models by

107
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,759
starting from computational primitives

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,360
and seeing what we can build up that

109
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,079
seemed like a totally obvious thing to

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,560
do

111
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,239
in uh in retrospect it might not have

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,158
been externally quite so obvious but it

113
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
was obvious to me at the time given the

114
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,598
path that i happened to have been on so

115
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
you know so that got me into this

116
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,238
question of let's use programs to model

117
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
what happens in nature

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,480
and the question then is well what kind

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,158
of programs and you know we're used to

120
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,759
programs that you write for some

121
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,000
particular purpose it's a big long piece

122
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,639
of code and it does some specific thing

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,399
but what i got interested in was okay if

124
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,840
you just go out into the sort of

125
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,359
computational universe of possible

126
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,719
programs you say

127
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,639
take the simplest program you can

128
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,800
imagine what does it do

129
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,960
and so i started studying these things

130
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,079
called cellular automata um actually i

131
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,399
didn't know at first they were called

132
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,240
cellular automata but i found that out

133
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,679
subsequently but it's just a line of

134
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,079
cells you know each one is black or

135
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,160
white and it's just some rule that says

136
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,359
the color of the cell is determined by

137
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,800
the color that it had on the previous

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,360
step and it's two neighbors on the

139
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,560
previous step and i had initially

140
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
thought

141
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,478
that's you know sufficiently simple

142
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,600
setup it's not going to do anything

143
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,478
interesting it's always going to be

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,800
simple no complexity simple rule simple

145
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,560
behavior okay but then i actually ran

146
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,720
the computer experiment which was pretty

147
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,800
easy to do um i mean it probably took a

148
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,880
few hours um originally and um the and

149
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
the results were not what i'd expected

150
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,360
at all now needless to say in the way

151
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
that science actually works the results

152
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,720
that i got a lot of unexpected things

153
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,879
which i thought were really interesting

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
but the really strongest results which

155
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,319
was already right there in the printouts

156
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,599
i made i didn't really understand for a

157
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,599
couple more years

158
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,000
so it was it was not you know the

159
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,280
compressed version of the story is

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,439
you run the experiment and you

161
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,279
immediately see what's going on but i

162
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,160
wasn't smart enough to to do that so to

163
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,478
speak

164
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,960
but the big the big thing is

165
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,560
even with very simple rules of that type

166
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,120
sort of the minimal

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,439
tiniest program sort of the the the one

168
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,600
line program or something it's possible

169
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,038
to get very complicated behavior my

170
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,360
favorite example is this thing called

171
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,879
rule 30 which is a particular cellular

172
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
automaton rule you just started off from

173
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,879
one black cell and it makes this really

174
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,759
complicated pattern

175
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,680
and so that for me was sort of a

176
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,439
critical discovery

177
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,918
that then kind of said playing back onto

178
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,000
you know how does nature make complexity

179
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,599
i sort of realized that might be how it

180
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,959
does it that might be kind of the secret

181
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
that it's using

182
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,399
is that in this kind of computational

183
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,000
universe of possible programs

184
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,519
it's actually pretty easy to get

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,519
programs where even though the program

186
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,359
is simple the behavior when you run the

187
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,918
program is not simple at all

188
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,120
and that was so for me that was the the

189
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,120
kind of the the story of kind of how

190
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
that that was sort of the the indication

191
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,120
that one had got an idea of what the

192
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,038
sort of secret that nature uses to make

193
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,519
complexity and that complexity how

194
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:44,159
complexity can be made in other places

195
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,159
now if you say what is complexity you

196
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,720
know it's it's

197
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,039
complexity is it's not easy to tell

198
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,680
what's going on that's the informal

199
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,839
version of what is complexity but there

200
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,478
is something going on but there's a rule

201
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:01,598
to know what right well no the rules can

202
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,758
generate just randomness

203
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,439
well that that's not obvious

204
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,199
in other words that's not how it is not

205
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,879
obvious at all and it wasn't what i

206
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,840
expected it's not what people's

207
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,759
intuition had been and has been for you

208
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,439
know for a long time that is one might

209
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,879
think you have a rule

210
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,319
you can tell

211
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,038
there's a rule behind it i mean it's

212
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,360
just like you know the early you know

213
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,759
robots and science fiction movies right

214
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,360
you can tell it's a robot because it

215
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,280
does simple things

216
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,400
right turns out that isn't actually the

217
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,758
right story

218
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,679
but it's not obvious that isn't the

219
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,439
right story because people assume simple

220
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,759
rules simple behavior

221
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,279
and that the sort of the key discovery

222
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,240
about the computational universe is that

223
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,959
isn't true and that discovery goes very

224
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,439
deep and relates to all kinds of things

225
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,000
that i've spent years and years studying

226
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,240
but um you know that that in the end the

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,079
sort of the the what is complexity is

228
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,560
well you can't easily tell what it's

229
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,639
going to do you could just run the rule

230
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,598
and see what happens but you can't just

231
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,280
say oh you know show me the rule great

232
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,360
and now i know what's going to happen

233
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,359
and you know the key phenomenon around

234
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,639
that is this thing i call computational

235
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,639
irreducibility this fact that in

236
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
something like rule 30 you might say

237
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,120
well what's it going to do after a

238
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,279
million steps

239
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,759
well you can run it for a million steps

240
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,519
and just do what it does to find out

241
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,520
but you can't compress that you can't

242
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:25,439
reduce that and say i'm going to be able

243
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,799
to jump ahead and say this is what it's

244
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,000
going to do after a million steps but i

245
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
don't have to go through anything like

246
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,680
that computational effort by the way has

247
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,399
anybody succeeded at that you had a

248
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,479
challenge a competition right for

249
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,240
predicting the middle column of rule 30

250
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,759
and indeed anybody

251
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
a number of people have sent things in

252
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,080
and and sort of people are picking away

253
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,200
at it but it's hard i mean it's it's uh

254
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,920
i've been i've been actually uh even

255
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,759
proving that the center column of rule

256
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,079
30 doesn't repeat

257
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,720
that's something i think might be doable

258
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,560
okay mathematically proving yes and so

259
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,320
that's analogous to

260
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,319
a similar kind of things like the digits

261
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,000
of pi which are also generated in this

262
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
very deterministic way

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,559
and so a question is how random are the

264
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,160
digits of pi for example does every

265
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,079
first of all do the digits of pi ever

266
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,559
repeat or we know they don't because it

267
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,040
was proved in the 1800s that pi is not a

268
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,559
rational number so that means only

269
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,559
rational numbers have digit sequences

270
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,119
that repeat so we know the digits of pi

271
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,759
don't repeat so now the question is does

272
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,600
you know 0 1 2 3 or whatever do all the

273
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,360
digits base 10 or base 2 or however you

274
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,639
work it out do they all occur with equal

275
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,080
frequency

276
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,919
nobody knows

277
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,240
that's far away from what can be

278
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:39,439
understood mathematically at this point

279
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,320
and that's that's kind of uh but i'm i'm

280
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,320
even looking for step one which is

281
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,160
prove that the the the center column

282
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
doesn't repeat and then prove other

283
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,559
things about it like equidistribution of

284
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,240
of uh equal numbers of zeros and ones

285
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,239
and those are things which i you know i

286
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,120
kind of set up this little little prize

287
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,120
thing because i thought those were not

288
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,200
not too out of range those are things

289
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,159
which are within

290
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,720
you know

291
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,000
a modest amount of time it's conceivable

292
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,160
that those could be done they're not

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,480
they're not far away from what current

294
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,799
mathematics might allow they'll require

295
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
a bunch of cleverness and hopefully some

296
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,399
interesting new ideas that you know will

297
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,879
be useful other places

298
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,839
but you started in 1980 with this idea

299
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,399
before i think you realized

300
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,680
you know this idea of programs

301
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,720
you thought that there might be some

302
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,278
kind of thermodynamic like randomness

303
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,800
and then complexity comes from a clever

304
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,360
filter

305
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,519
that uh you kind of like i don't know

306
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,278
spaghetti or something you you you

307
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,039
filter the randomness and outcomes

308
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:42,399
complexity which is an interesting

309
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,759
intuition i mean

310
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,720
how do we know that's not actually

311
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:49,039
what's happening so just because you

312
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,160
were then able to develop

313
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,480
look you don't need this like incredible

314
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,799
randomness you can just have very simple

315
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,039
predictable initial conditions and

316
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,879
predictable rules and then from that

317
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,919
emergency complexity

318
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:06,879
still there might be some systems where

319
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:09,278
it's uh filtering randomness and the

320
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,439
inputs well the point is

321
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,039
when you have quotes randomised in the

322
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
input that means there's all kinds of

323
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,599
information in the input yeah and in a

324
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,000
sense what you get out will be maybe

325
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,159
just something close to what you put in

326
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
like people are very in dynamical

327
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,919
systems theory sort of big area

328
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,159
mathematics that developed

329
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:30,879
from the early 1900s and and really got

330
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,799
big in the 1980s you know an example of

331
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,919
what people study there a lot and it's

332
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:38,319
popular version is chaos theory um an

333
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:42,000
example what people study a lot is the

334
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,399
shift map which is basically taking 2x

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,320
mod 1 to the fractional part of 2x which

336
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,879
is basically just taking digits in

337
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,278
binary and shifting them to the left so

338
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,439
at every step you get to see if you say

339
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,120
how big is this number that i got out

340
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,279
well the most important digit in that

341
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,519
number is whatever ended up at the at

342
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,919
the left-hand end but now if you start

343
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,919
off from an arbitrary random number

344
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,479
which is quotes randomly chosen so all

345
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,120
its digits are random then when you run

346
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,278
that sort of chaos theory shift map all

347
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,320
that you get out is just whatever you

348
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,320
put in you just get to see what you what

349
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,320
it's not obvious that you would excavate

350
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,680
all of those digits and if you're for

351
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,240
example making a theory i don't know

352
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,559
fluid mechanics for example if there was

353
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,159
that phenomenon in fluid mechanics then

354
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,078
the equations of fluid mechanics can't

355
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,319
be right because what that would be

356
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,199
saying is the equations of that that it

357
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,120
matters to the fluid what happens in the

358
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,040
fluid at the level of the you know

359
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,759
millionth digit of the initial

360
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,360
conditions which is far below the point

361
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,120
at which you're hitting kind of sizes of

362
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,278
molecules and things like that so it's

363
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,679
kind of almost explaining

364
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,278
if that phenomenon is an important thing

365
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,719
it's kind of telling you that the you

366
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,039
know fluid dynamics which describes

367
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,360
fluids as continuous media and so on

368
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,919
isn't isn't really right but so you know

369
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,680
so this idea that you know there's a

370
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,759
there's it's a tricky thing because as

371
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,319
soon as you put randomness in you have

372
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,720
to know you know what how much of what's

373
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,000
coming out is what you put in versus how

374
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,320
much is actually something that's being

375
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,679
generated and what's really nice about

376
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,079
these systems where you just have very

377
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,719
simple initial conditions and where you

378
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,719
get random stuff out or seemingly random

379
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,800
stuff out is you don't have that issue

380
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
you don't have to argue about was that

381
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,479
something complicated put in because

382
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,800
it's plainly obvious there wasn't now as

383
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,079
a practical matter in doing experiments

384
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:32,719
the big thing is if the thing you see

385
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,958
is complex and reproducible

386
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
then it didn't come from just filtering

387
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,198
some quotes randomness from the outside

388
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,759
world it has to be something that is

389
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,000
intrinsically made because it wouldn't

390
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,679
otherwise be i mean you know the the

391
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,440
it could be the case that you set things

392
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,000
up and it's always the same each time

393
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,680
and you say well it's kind of the same

394
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,198
but it's not then it's not random each

395
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,159
time because kind of the definition of

396
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,479
it being random is it was kind of picked

397
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,439
picked at random each time so to speak

398
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,320
so is it possible to for sure know that

399
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,040
our universe does not at the fundamental

400
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,800
level have randomness is it possible to

401
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,519
conclusively say

402
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:13,599
there's no randomness at the bottom

403
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,480
well it's an interesting question i mean

404
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
you know

405
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,639
science natural science is an inductive

406
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,879
business right you observe a bunch of

407
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,879
things and you say can we fit these

408
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,958
together what is our hypothesis for

409
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:28,399
what's going on the thing that i think i

410
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:30,078
can say fairly definitively is at this

411
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,600
point we understand enough about

412
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,719
fundamental physics

413
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,199
that there is if there was sort of an

414
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,800
extra dice being thrown

415
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:41,599
it's something that doesn't need to be

416
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,399
there we can get what we see without

417
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,199
that

418
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
now

419
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,198
you know could you add that in as an

420
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,440
extra little featuroid

421
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,879
um you know without breaking the

422
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,519
universe uh probably but in fact almost

423
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,039
certainly yes but is it necessary for

424
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,360
understanding the universe no and i

425
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,480
think actually from a a more fundamental

426
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
point of view

427
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,639
it's

428
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,639
it's

429
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,759
i think i might be able to argue so so

430
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,519
one of the things that i've been

431
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,439
interested in have been pretty surprised

432
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,519
that i've had anything sentient to say

433
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,120
about is the question of why does the

434
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,480
universe exist

435
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,639
i didn't think that was a question that

436
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,159
i would you know i thought that was a

437
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,839
far out there metaphysical kind of thing

438
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,120
uh even the philosophers have stayed

439
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,680
away from that question for the most

440
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,399
part it's so such a kind of

441
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,239
you know difficult to address question

442
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,000
but i actually think to my great

443
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,919
surprise that from our physics project

444
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,399
and so on that it is possible to

445
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,319
actually uh address that question and

446
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,159
explain why the universe exists and i

447
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,759
kind of have a suspicion i've not

448
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,919
thought it through i kind of have a

449
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,839
suspicion that that explanation will

450
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,240
eventually show you that

451
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,320
in no meaningful sense can there be

452
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,759
randomness underneath the universe that

453
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,560
is that if there is

454
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,879
it's something that is necessarily

455
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,679
irrelevant to our perception of the

456
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,159
universe that is that it could be there

457
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,159
but it doesn't matter because in a sense

458
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,039
we've already you know whatever it would

459
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,559
do whatever extra thing it would add is

460
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,799
not relevant to our perception of what's

461
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,599
going on so why

462
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:17,278
does the universe exist how does uh the

463
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,920
irrelevance of randomness connect to uh

464
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:22,078
the big why question of silver so okay

465
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,399
so i mean why does the universe exist

466
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,958
well let's see and uh is this the only

467
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,278
universe we got it's the only one

468
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,958
that about that i'm pretty sure so now

469
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,198
you may be which one

470
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:37,119
which of these topics is better to enter

471
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:38,799
first why does the universe exist and uh

472
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,720
why you think it's the only one that

473
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,399
exists well i think they're very closely

474
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,639
related okay okay

475
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,919
so i mean the first thing

476
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,680
let's see i mean this why does the

477
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,399
universe exist question

478
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,679
is built on top of all these things that

479
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,198
we've been figuring out about

480
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,479
fundamental physics

481
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:55,838
because if you want to know why the

482
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,519
universe exists you kind of have to know

483
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,320
what the universe is made of

484
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,600
and

485
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,360
i think the um well let me let me uh

486
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,120
describe a little bit about

487
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,120
the why does the universe exist question

488
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,879
so the main issue is let's say you have

489
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,198
a model for the universe

490
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,720
and you say i've got this this program

491
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,839
or something and you run it and you make

492
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,679
the universe

493
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,678
now you say well how do you actually why

494
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,519
is that program actually running and

495
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,959
people say you've got this program that

496
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,078
makes the universe what computer is it

497
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,240
running on

498
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,078
right what what does it mean what

499
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,000
actualizes something you know two plus

500
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,839
two equals four but that's different

501
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,440
from saying there's two a pile of two

502
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,519
rocks another pile of two rocks and so

503
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,400
many moves them together and makes four

504
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,798
so to speak and so what is it that kind

505
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,640
of turns it from being just this formal

506
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,000
thing to being something that is

507
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,480
actualized

508
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,038
okay so there we have to start thinking

509
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,400
about well well what do we actually know

510
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,440
about what's going on in the universe

511
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,200
well we are observers of this universe

512
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,558
but confusingly enough we're part of

513
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,880
this universe so in a sense we what what

514
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,000
what if we say what do we what do we

515
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,080
know about what's going on in the

516
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,480
universe well what we know is what sort

517
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,240
of our consciousness records about

518
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,079
what's going on in the universe

519
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
and so consciousness is part of the

520
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,558
fabric of the universe so we're in it

521
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,160
yes we're in it and and maybe i should

522
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,720
maybe i should start off by saying

523
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,519
something about the consciousness story

524
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,279
because that that's um yes

525
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,240
maybe we should begin

526
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,798
even before that at the very base layer

527
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,440
of the wolfram physics project

528
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,558
maybe you can give a broad overview once

529
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,279
again

530
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,759
really quick about this hypergraph model

531
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,079
yes and also what is it a year and a

532
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,319
half ago since you've brought this

533
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,279
project to the world what is the status

534
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,439
update

535
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,519
where what are all the beautiful ideas

536
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,038
you have come across

537
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,359
uh what are the interesting things you

538
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,279
can always mention it's i mean it's a

539
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,918
it's a freaking cambrian explosion i

540
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,279
mean it's it's crazy i mean there are

541
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,640
all these things which i've kind of

542
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,000
wondered about for years and suddenly

543
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,880
there's actually a way to think about

544
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,319
them and i really did not see

545
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,320
i mean the real strength of what's

546
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,480
happened i absolutely did not see coming

547
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,319
and the real strength of it is we've got

548
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,558
this model for physics but it turns out

549
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,558
it's a foundational kind of model that's

550
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,558
a different kind of computation-like

551
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,119
model that i'm kind of calling the sort

552
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:22,240
of multi-computational model

553
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,079
and that that kind of model is

554
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,079
applicable not only to physics but also

555
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,639
to lots of other kinds of things

556
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,839
and one reason that's extremely powerful

557
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,400
is because physics has been very

558
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,079
successful so we know a lot based on

559
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,960
what we figured out in physics and if we

560
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,558
know that the same model governs physics

561
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,038
and governs i don't know economics

562
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,639
linguistics immunology whatever

563
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,359
we know that the same kind of model

564
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,559
governs those things we can start using

565
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,719
things that we've successfully

566
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,798
discovered in physics and applying those

567
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,960
intuitions in all these other areas and

568
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,200
that's that's pretty exciting and and

569
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,440
very surprising to me um and in fact

570
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,319
it's kind of like in the original story

571
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,798
of sort of you go and you explain why is

572
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,079
there complexity in the natural world

573
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,200
then you realize well there's all this

574
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,279
complexity there's all this

575
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,120
computational irreducibility you know

576
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,798
there's a lot we can't know about what's

577
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,399
going to happen it's kind of it's kind

578
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,079
of very confusing thing for people who

579
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,360
say you know science has nailed

580
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,279
everything down we're going to you know

581
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,719
based on science we can know everything

582
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,798
well actually there's this computational

583
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
irreducibility thing right in the middle

584
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,158
of that

585
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,360
thrown up by science so to speak and

586
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,760
then the question is well given

587
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:29,199
computational irreducibility how can we

588
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,200
actually figure out anything about what

589
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,798
happens in the world why aren't we

590
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,880
why are we able to predict anything why

591
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,319
are we able to operate in the world and

592
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,919
the answer is that we sort of live in

593
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,798
these slices of computational

594
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,120
reusability that exists in this kind of

595
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,759
ocean of computational irreducibility

596
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,439
and it turns out that seems that it's a

597
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,879
very fundamental feature of the kind of

598
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,038
model that seems to operate in physics

599
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,200
and perhaps in a lot of these other

600
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,759
areas that there are these particular

601
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,519
slices of computational reducibility

602
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,000
that are relevant to us

603
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,319
and those are the things that both allow

604
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,359
us to operate in the world and not just

605
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,200
have everything be completely

606
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,599
unpredictable but there are also things

607
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,080
that potentially give us what amount to

608
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,480
sort of physics-like laws in all these

609
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:16,399
other areas so that's that's been sort

610
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,640
of an exciting thing but but i would say

611
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,559
that in general for our project it's

612
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,440
been going spectacularly well i mean i

613
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:25,599
you know i it's very honestly it wasn't

614
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,200
something i expected to happen in my

615
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,480
lifetime i mean it's you know it's

616
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,880
something where

617
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,480
where it's it's and in fact

618
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,640
one of the things about it some of the

619
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,960
things that we've discovered are things

620
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,320
where i was pretty sure that wasn't how

621
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,038
things worked

622
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,119
and turns out i'm wrong and you know

623
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,279
in a major area in metal mathematics i

624
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,279
i'd be realizing that i something i've

625
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,918
long believed we can talk about it

626
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:53,119
later that that that uh just just really

627
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,600
isn't right but but i think that um

628
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,519
the um the thing that uh so so what's

629
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,199
happened with the physics project i mean

630
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,720
you know it's a

631
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,880
it can explain a little bit about how

632
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,798
the how the model works but basically we

633
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,400
can maybe ask you uh the following

634
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,480
question so

635
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,240
it's easy through words describe how

636
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,759
cellular automotive works you've

637
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,519
explained this

638
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:17,759
and uh it's the fundamental mechanism by

639
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,000
which you in your book and your kind of

640
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:23,440
science explored the idea of complexity

641
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,640
and how to do science in this world of

642
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,759
isla reducible islands and irreducible

643
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,799
general irreducibility okay so how does

644
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,798
the model of hypergraphs differ from

645
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,480
cellular and how does the idea of

646
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,240
multi-computation

647
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,038
differ like maybe that's a way to

648
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,839
describe it right we're yeah right this

649
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,119
is a you know my life is like all of our

650
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,678
lives something of a story of

651
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,519
computational irreducibility yes and you

652
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,919
know it's been going for a few years now

653
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,679
so it's always a challenge to kind of

654
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,360
find these appropriate pockets of

655
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,159
reducibility but let me see what i can

656
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,959
do great so so i mean first of all let's

657
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,400
let's talk about physics first of all

658
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,000
and you know a key observation

659
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
that one of the starting point of our

660
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,400
physics project is

661
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,839
things about what is space what is the

662
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
universe made of

663
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,678
and you know ever since euclid people

664
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,359
just sort of say space is just this

665
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,640
thing where you can put things at any

666
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,240
position you want

667
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,320
and they're just points and they're just

668
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,919
geometrical things that you can just

669
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,960
arbitrarily put at different different

670
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,720
coordinate positions so the first thing

671
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,960
in our physics project is the idea that

672
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,038
space is made of something just like

673
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,120
water is made of molecules space is made

674
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,798
of kind of atoms of space

675
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,479
and the only thing we can say about

676
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,558
these atoms of space is they have some

677
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,038
identity there's a there's a there is

678
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,240
it's this atom as opposed to this atom

679
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:45,440
and you know you could give them if

680
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,558
you're a computer person you give them

681
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,038
uuids or something

682
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,278
yes and and um but that's all there is

683
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:54,558
to say about them so to speak um and

684
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:58,000
then

685
00:23:54,558 --> 00:24:00,240
all we know about these atoms of space

686
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,599
is how they relate to each other so we

687
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,599
say these three atoms of space

688
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,839
are associated with each other in some

689
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:10,079
relation so you can think about that as

690
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,240
you know what atom of space is friends

691
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,079
with what other atom of space you can

692
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,759
build this essentially friend network of

693
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,678
the atoms of space

694
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,200
and the sort of starting point of our

695
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,679
physics project is that's what our

696
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,278
universe is it's a giant friend network

697
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,240
of the atoms of space

698
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:29,440
and so how can that possibly represent

699
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,960
our universe well it's like in

700
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,120
something like water you know they're

701
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,798
molecules bouncing around but on a large

702
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,639
scale that

703
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,319
you know that produces fluid flow and we

704
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,320
have fluid vortices and we have all of

705
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,278
these phenomena that are sort of the

706
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,038
emergent phenomena from that underlying

707
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,720
uh kind of collection of molecules

708
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,759
bouncing around and by the way it's

709
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,440
important that that collection of

710
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,960
molecules bouncing around

711
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,720
have this phenomenon of computational

712
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,600
irreducibility that's actually what

713
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
leads to the second law of

714
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:58,158
thermodynamics among other things

715
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,480
and that leads to the sort of randomness

716
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,240
of the underlying behavior which is what

717
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,480
gives you something which on a large

718
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,919
scale seems like it's a smooth

719
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,319
continuous

720
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,278
type of thing and so so okay so first

721
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,278
thing is space is made of something it's

722
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,359
made of all these atoms of space

723
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,640
connected together in this network and

724
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,719
then everything that we experience

725
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,240
is sort of features of the of that

726
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
structure of space so you know when we

727
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,400
have an electron or something or a

728
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,079
photon it's some kind of tangle in the

729
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
structure of space much like kind of a

730
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,558
vortex and a fluid would be just this

731
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,400
thing that is you know it it can

732
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,158
actually the vortex can move around it

733
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,720
can involve different molecules in the

734
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,720
fluid but the vortex still stays there

735
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,880
and if you zoom out enough the vortex

736
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,640
looks like an atom itself like a basic

737
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,080
element yes so there's the levels of

738
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,440
abstraction

739
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,678
if you squint and kind of blur things

740
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,679
out it looks like at every level of

741
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,798
abstraction you can define what is a

742
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,960
basic

743
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:58,798
individual entities yes but but you know

744
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,319
in in this model

745
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:01,599
there's a bottom level yeah you know

746
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,399
there's an elementary length maybe

747
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,639
that's

748
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,240
100 10 to the minus 100 meters let's say

749
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,720
which is really small you know proton is

750
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,440
10 to the minus 15 meters the smallest

751
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,880
we've ever been able to sort of see

752
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,400
where the particle accelerator is around

753
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,240
10 to the minus 21 meters so you know if

754
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,080
we don't know precisely what the correct

755
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,599
scale is but it's perhaps over the order

756
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,240
of 10 to the minus 100 meters so it's

757
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,399
pretty small um and but but that's

758
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,159
that's the end that's that's what things

759
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,038
are made of what's your intuition where

760
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,360
the 10 to the minus 100 comes from

761
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,278
what's your intuition about this scale

762
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,839
well okay so there's a calculation which

763
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:41,359
i consider to be somewhat rickety okay

764
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:42,798
which has to do with comparing so so

765
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,558
there are various fundamental constants

766
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,960
there's the speed of light the speed of

767
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:49,119
light once you know the elementary time

768
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,558
the speed of light is tells you the

769
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,719
conversion from the elementary time to

770
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,319
the elementary length then there's the

771
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,038
question of how do you convert to the

772
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,359
elementary energy and how do you convert

773
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,798
to between other things and the various

774
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,359
constants we know we know the speed of

775
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,879
light we know the gravitational constant

776
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,798
we know planck's constant and quantum

777
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,278
mechanics those are the three important

778
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,639
ones and we actually know some other

779
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,960
things we know things like the size of

780
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,000
the universe the hubble constant things

781
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,480
like that

782
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,759
and essentially this calculation of the

783
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,599
elementary length comes from looking at

784
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,440
these sort of combination of those okay

785
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,519
so the most obvious thing people have

786
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,120
sort of assumed that quantum gravity

787
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:30,158
happens at this thing the planck scale

788
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,479
10 minus 34 meters which is the sort of

789
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,840
the the combination of planck's constant

790
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,839
and the gravitational constant the speed

791
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,359
of light that gives you that kind of

792
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,678
length

793
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,759
turns out in our model there is an

794
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,840
additional parameter which is

795
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,000
essentially the number of simultaneous

796
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,199
threads of execution of the universe

797
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,159
which is essentially the number of sort

798
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,399
of independent quantum uh processes that

799
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,080
are going on and that number let's see

800
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,199
if i remember that number that number is

801
00:27:54,079 --> 00:28:00,000
10 to 170 i think and and so it's a big

802
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,278
number but um that number

803
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,558
then connects you know sort of modifies

804
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:05,519
what you might think from all these

805
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,398
planck

806
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,158
uh

807
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:09,359
units to give you the things we're

808
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,200
giving and there's been sort of a

809
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,918
mystery actually in the in the more

810
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,880
technical physics thing that the planck

811
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,640
mass

812
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,399
the plank energy

813
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,720
plank energy is actually surprisingly

814
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,879
big the planck length is tiny 10 minus

815
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,839
34 meters that you know planck time 10

816
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,880
minus 43 meters i think seconds i think

817
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,278
um but the planck energy is like uh is

818
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,159
like the the energy of a of a lightning

819
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,880
strike okay which is pretty weird in our

820
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,880
models the actual elementary energy is

821
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,278
that divided by the number of sort of

822
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,039
simultaneous quantum threads and it ends

823
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,798
up being really small too and that's

824
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,440
sort of explains that mystery that's

825
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,879
been around for a while about about how

826
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,278
plank units work

827
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,880
but but that you know whether that

828
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,398
precise estimate is right we don't know

829
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,000
yet i mean that that that's one of the

830
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,319
things that's sort of been a thing we've

831
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,398
been pretty interested in is how do you

832
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,639
see through you know how does you how do

833
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,879
you make a gravitational microscope that

834
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,360
can kind of see through to the atoms of

835
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,960
space you know how do you get in in

836
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,558
fluid flow for example if you go to

837
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,798
hypersonic flow or something you know

838
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,720
you've got a mark 20 you know space

839
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,720
plane or something it really matters

840
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,038
that there are individual molecules

841
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,640
hitting the space plane not a continuous

842
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,240
fluid the question is what is the

843
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,720
analogous kind of

844
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,440
what is the analog of hypersonic flow

845
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,679
for

846
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,120
for our for things about the structure

847
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,759
of space time and it looks like uh a a

848
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:37,678
rapidly rotating black hole right at the

849
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:39,839
sort of critical rotation rate um is

850
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,159
it looks as if that's a case where

851
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,798
essentially the the structure of space

852
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,919
time is just about to fall apart

853
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:50,480
and you may be able to kind of see

854
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,799
the evidence of sort of discrete

855
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,558
uh elements you know you may be able to

856
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,319
kind of see there the sort of

857
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,720
gravitational microscope of actually

858
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,398
seeing these discrete elements of space

859
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,600
and there may be some effect in for

860
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,839
example gravitational waves produced by

861
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,599
rapidly rotating black hole that in

862
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,079
which one could actually see some

863
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:12,240
phenomenon where one can say yes they

864
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,639
don't come out the way one would expect

865
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,960
based on having a continuous structure

866
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,320
of space time that it is something where

867
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,558
you can kind of see through to the

868
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,200
discrete structure um we don't know that

869
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,798
yet so you can maybe elaborate a little

870
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,519
bit deeper hollow microscope that

871
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,879
concedes a 10 to the minus

872
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,519
100

873
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,000
how rotating black holes

874
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,119
and uh presumably the

875
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,038
the the detailed accurate detection of

876
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,599
gravitational waves from since black

877
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,798
holes can reveal the discreteness of

878
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,879
space

879
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,480
okay first thing is what is a black hole

880
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,240
uh actually we we need to go a little

881
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,360
bit further in the story of what space

882
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,200
time is because i explained a little bit

883
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,359
about what space is but it didn't talk

884
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,679
about what time is and that's sort of

885
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:58,000
important in in understanding space time

886
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,000
so to speak and your sense is both space

887
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,200
and time in the story are discreet

888
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,440
absolutely

889
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,759
absolutely but it's a complicated story

890
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,278
yes and um needless to say well it's

891
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,599
simple at the bottom

892
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,599
it's it's very simple at the bottom it's

893
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:14,639
it's very in the end

894
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:16,319
it's simple but deeply abstract and um

895
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,960
and something that is

896
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,398
simple in conception but kind of

897
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,640
wrapping one's head around what's going

898
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:25,518
on is pretty hard

899
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,120
um but so so first of all we have this

900
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,200
so you know i've described these kind of

901
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,558
atoms of space and their connections you

902
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,640
can think about these things as a

903
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,720
hypergraph you know a graph is just you

904
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,799
connect nodes to nodes but a hypergraph

905
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,880
you can have you know uh you can have

906
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,319
sort of not just friends

907
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,720
individual friends to friends but you

908
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:45,278
can have these triplets of of friends or

909
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,720
whatever else it's it's um and so we're

910
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,119
just saying and that's just the

911
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,120
relations between atoms of space are the

912
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,038
hyper edges of the hypograph and so

913
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,959
we've got some big collection of of

914
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,759
these atoms of space maybe 10 to the 400

915
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,480
or something in our in our universe um

916
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:03,679
and that's the structure of space that's

917
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,640
and every feature of what we experience

918
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,960
in the world is a feature of that that

919
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,880
hypergraph that spatial hypograph

920
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,960
so then the question is well how does

921
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,760
what does that spatial hypergraph do

922
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,399
well the idea is that there are rules

923
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,839
that that update that spatial hypograph

924
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:21,759
and you know in a cellular automaton

925
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,079
you've just got this line of cells and

926
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,919
you just say it every step at every time

927
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,879
step you've got fixed time steps fixed

928
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,640
array of cells at every step uh every

929
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,440
cell gets updated according to a certain

930
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,600
rule

931
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,679
and that's um that's kind of the that's

932
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:38,000
the way it works now in this hypograph

933
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,159
it's sort of vaguely the same kind of

934
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,720
thing we say every time you see a little

935
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:45,120
piece of hypergraph that looks like this

936
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,360
update it to one that looks like this so

937
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,798
it's just keep rewriting this hypergraph

938
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,038
every time you see something looks like

939
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:53,119
that anywhere in the universe it gets

940
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,960
rewritten now one thing that's tricky

941
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,278
about that which we'll come to is this

942
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,919
multi-computational idea which has to do

943
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,159
with you're not saying in in some kind

944
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,240
of lock-step way do this one then this

945
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,480
one then this one it's just whenever you

946
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,880
see one you can do you can go ahead and

947
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,200
do it and that leads one not to have a

948
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,840
single thread of time in the universe

949
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,440
because if you knew which one to do you

950
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,119
just say okay we do this one then we do

951
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,120
this one then we do this one but if you

952
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,719
say just do whichever one you feel like

953
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,239
you end up with these multiple threads

954
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,079
of time these kind of multiple histories

955
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,399
of the universe depending on which order

956
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,199
you happen to do the things you could do

957
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:28,959
in

958
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,720
so it's fundamentally asynchronous and

959
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,720
parallel yes

960
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,200
yes which is very uncomfortable for the

961
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,319
human brain that seeks for things to be

962
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,120
sequential

963
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,359
and synchronous right well i think that

964
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,558
this is this is part of the story of

965
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:44,879
consciousness

966
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,879
is i think the key aspect of

967
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,200
consciousness that is important for sort

968
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,120
of parsing the universe is this point

969
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,200
that we have a single thread of

970
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,199
experience right we have a memory of

971
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,399
what happened in the past we can say

972
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,000
something predict something about the

973
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,518
future but there's a single thread of

974
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,720
experience and it's not obvious it

975
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,480
should work that way i mean we've got

976
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,600
100 billion neurons in our brains and

977
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,599
they're all firing in all kinds of

978
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:10,000
different ways but yet our experiences

979
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,639
that there is the single thread of of of

980
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,320
time that that goes that that goes along

981
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,599
and i think that you know one of the

982
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,440
things i've kind of realized with a lot

983
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,480
more clarity in the last year

984
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,398
is the fact that our the fact that we

985
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,119
conclude that the universe has the laws

986
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,878
it has is a consequence of the fact that

987
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,399
we have consciousness the way we have

988
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,960
consciousness

989
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,679
and so the fact so i mean just to go on

990
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,599
with kind of the the basic setup it's uh

991
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,599
so we've got this spatial hypograph it's

992
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,039
got all these atoms of space they're

993
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,399
getting they're getting these little

994
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,679
clumps of atoms of space they're getting

995
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:42,799
turned into other clumps of atoms of

996
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,960
space and that's happening everywhere in

997
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,800
the universe all the time and so one

998
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,480
thing it's a little bit weird is there's

999
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,839
nothing permanent in the universe

1000
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,679
the universe is getting rewritten

1001
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,119
everywhere all the time and if it wasn't

1002
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,039
getting rewritten it would space

1003
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,559
wouldn't be knitted together that is

1004
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,400
space would just fall apart there

1005
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,078
wouldn't be any way in which we could

1006
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,160
say this part of space is next to this

1007
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,680
part of space you know one of the things

1008
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:05,519
that i was

1009
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,598
people were confused about back in

1010
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,119
antiquity you know the ancient greek

1011
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,559
philosophers and so on is how does

1012
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,160
motion work

1013
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,400
you know how can it be the case that you

1014
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,559
can take a thing that we can walk around

1015
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,200
and it's still us when we walked you

1016
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,599
know a foot forward so to speak and in a

1017
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,919
sense with our models that's again a

1018
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,000
question because it's a different set of

1019
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,400
atoms of space when we you know when i

1020
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,320
move my hand it's it's moving into a

1021
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,639
different set of atoms of space it's

1022
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,480
having to be recreated it's not the

1023
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,319
thing itself is not there it's it's

1024
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,400
being continuously recreated all the

1025
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,559
time now it's a little bit like waves in

1026
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,800
an ocean you know vortices in a fluid

1027
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:45,358
which again the actual molecules that

1028
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,039
exist in those are not what define the

1029
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:49,679
identity of the thing

1030
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:52,320
and but it's a little bit uh you know

1031
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,559
this idea that there can be pure motion

1032
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,480
that it can that it is even possible for

1033
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,480
an object to just move around in the

1034
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,320
universe and not change

1035
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,719
is it's not self-evident that such a

1036
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,640
thing should be possible and that is

1037
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,919
part of our perception of the universe

1038
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,920
is that we

1039
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,280
we parse those aspects of the universe

1040
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,920
where things like pure motion are

1041
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,800
possible now pure motion even in general

1042
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,400
relativity the theory of gravity um pure

1043
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,880
motion is a little bit of a complicated

1044
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,880
thing i mean if you imagine your average

1045
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,960
you know teacup or something approaching

1046
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,119
a black hole it is deformed and

1047
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,199
distorted by the structure of space time

1048
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,200
and to say you know is it really pure

1049
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:30,559
motion is it that same teacup that's the

1050
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,000
same shape well it's a bit of a

1051
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,078
complicated story

1052
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,719
and this is a more extreme version of

1053
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,880
that so so anyway the the thing that

1054
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:42,000
that's happening is we've got space

1055
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,000
we've got this notion of time so time is

1056
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,920
this kind of this rewriting of the

1057
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,920
hypograph and one of the things that's

1058
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,000
important about that time is this sort

1059
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,159
of computationally irreducible process

1060
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,358
there's something you know time is not

1061
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:55,358
something where

1062
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,358
in kind of the mathematical view of of

1063
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,838
time tends to be time is just to

1064
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:02,480
coordinate we can you know slide a

1065
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,799
slider turn a knob and we'll change the

1066
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,199
the time that we've got in this equation

1067
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,039
but in this picture of time that's not

1068
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:12,319
how it works at all time is this

1069
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:14,480
inexorable irreducible kind of set of

1070
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,440
computations that go on that go from

1071
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,519
where we are now to the future but so so

1072
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,599
the thing and one of the things that is

1073
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:24,400
again something one sort of has to break

1074
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,240
out of is your average trained physicist

1075
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,000
like me says you know space and time are

1076
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,559
the same kind of thing they're related

1077
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,159
by you know the prank array group and

1078
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,159
and lawrence transformations and

1079
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:37,199
relativity and all these kinds of things

1080
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,559
and you know space and time uh you know

1081
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,239
there are all these kind of sort of folk

1082
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:42,000
stories you can tell about why space and

1083
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,679
time is the same kind of thing

1084
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
in this model they're fundamentally not

1085
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,919
the same kind of thing space is this

1086
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
kind of sort of connections between

1087
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,639
these atoms of space time is this

1088
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,880
computational process so the thing that

1089
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,480
the first sort of surprising thing is

1090
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,200
well it turns out you get relativity

1091
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,358
anyway and the reason that happens the

1092
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,279
few bits and pieces here which one has

1093
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,598
to understand but but the the

1094
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,400
fundamental point is if you are an

1095
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,039
observer embedded in the system

1096
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,720
that are part of this whole story of

1097
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,519
things getting updated in this way and

1098
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:15,118
that

1099
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,358
there are there's sort of a limit to

1100
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,800
what you can tell about what's going on

1101
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:20,159
and really in the end the only thing you

1102
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,960
can tell is what are the causal

1103
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,239
relationships between events

1104
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,679
so an event

1105
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,319
in this sort of

1106
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:31,039
an elementary event is a little piece of

1107
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,880
hypograph got rewritten and that means a

1108
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,719
few hyper edges of the hyper graph were

1109
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,800
consumed by the event

1110
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,719
and you produce some other hyperedges

1111
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,039
and that's an elementary event

1112
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:44,078
and so then the question is uh what we

1113
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:46,079
can tell is kind of what the network of

1114
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,320
causal relationships between elementary

1115
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,480
events is that's the ultimate thing the

1116
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,800
causal graph of the universe

1117
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,079
and it it turns out that well there's

1118
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,680
this property of causal invariance that

1119
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,760
is true of a bunch of these models and i

1120
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:02,319
think is inevitably true for a variety

1121
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,640
of reasons um that

1122
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,280
makes it be the case that it doesn't

1123
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,639
matter kind of if if you are

1124
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,320
sort of saying well i've got this

1125
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,078
hypograph and i can rewrite this piece

1126
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,680
here and this piece here and i do them

1127
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,440
all in different orders when you

1128
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,000
construct the causal graph for each of

1129
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,000
those orders that you choose to do

1130
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,358
things in you'll end up with the same

1131
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,079
causal graph

1132
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,000
and so that's essentially why

1133
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,960
uh well that's in the end why relativity

1134
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,519
works

1135
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,400
it's why our perception of space and

1136
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,759
time is is as as having this kind of

1137
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,960
connection that relativity says they

1138
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,480
should have

1139
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,838
and that's that's kind of that's kind of

1140
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,679
how that works

1141
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,920
i think i'm missing a little piece uh if

1142
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,000
you can go there again you said

1143
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,159
the fact that the observer is embedded

1144
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,480
in this hypergraph

1145
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,679
what's missing uh what is the observer

1146
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,240
not able

1147
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,399
to state about this universe so

1148
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:57,039
basically if you look from the outside

1149
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,920
you can say oh i see

1150
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,759
this

1151
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,480
uh

1152
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,319
i see this particular place was updated

1153
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,920
and then this one was updated and and

1154
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,400
i'm seeing which order things were

1155
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,838
updated in but the observer embedded in

1156
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,599
the universe doesn't know which order

1157
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,599
things were updated in because until

1158
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,440
they've been updated they have no idea

1159
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,359
what else happened so the only thing

1160
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,440
they know is the set of causal

1161
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:21,759
relationships let me give an extreme

1162
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,760
example let's imagine that the universe

1163
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,800
is a turing machine turing machines have

1164
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,400
just this one update head which does

1165
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,720
something and otherwise the turing

1166
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,318
machine just does nothing right and and

1167
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,879
the turing machine works by having this

1168
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,480
head move around and do its updating uh

1169
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,559
you know just where the head happens to

1170
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,800
be the question is could the universe be

1171
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,480
a turing machine could the universe just

1172
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,240
have a single updating head that's just

1173
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,318
zipping around all over the place you

1174
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:47,838
say that's crazy because you know i'm

1175
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:50,880
i'm talking to you you seem to be

1176
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,639
updating i'm updating etc but the thing

1177
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,920
is there's no way to know that because

1178
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:56,719
if there was just this head moving

1179
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,400
around it's like okay it updates me

1180
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,318
but you're completely frozen at that

1181
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,160
point until the head has come over and

1182
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:03,358
updated you you have no idea what

1183
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,199
happened to me

1184
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,880
and so if you sort of unravel that

1185
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,318
argument you realize the only thing we

1186
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,640
actually can tell

1187
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,318
is what the network of causal

1188
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:15,118
relationships between the things that

1189
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:18,159
happened were we don't get to know from

1190
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,559
some sort of outside sort of god's eye

1191
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:22,799
view of the thing we don't get to know

1192
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,679
what sort of from the outside what

1193
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,920
happened we only get to know sort of

1194
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,759
what the set of relationships between

1195
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,240
the things that happened actually were

1196
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,480
yeah but if i somehow record like a

1197
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,279
trace of this

1198
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,960
i guess would be called

1199
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,400
multi-computation

1200
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,519
can't i uh then look back

1201
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,800
in the way where do you look for the

1202
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,039
trace

1203
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,039
some you place throughout the universe

1204
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,519
like throughout

1205
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,000
like a log that records

1206
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,599
in my own pocket of in this hyper graph

1207
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,559
can i

1208
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,559
like

1209
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,000
realizing that i'm getting an outdated

1210
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:59,599
picture

1211
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,039
can't i record

1212
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,640
see the problem is and this is where

1213
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,039
things start getting

1214
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:08,480
very entangled in terms of what one

1215
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:10,400
understands the problem is that any such

1216
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,760
recording device is itself part of the

1217
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,480
universe yeah

1218
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,400
so you don't get to say you never get to

1219
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,519
say let's go outside the universe and go

1220
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,920
do this

1221
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,838
and and that's why i mean lots of the

1222
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,000
features of this of this model and the

1223
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,838
way things work end up being a result of

1224
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,880
that so but what

1225
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,480
i guess from on a human level what is

1226
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,640
the cost you're paying what are you

1227
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,039
missing from not getting an updated

1228
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,159
picture all the time okay i got i i

1229
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,000
understand what you should say yeah yeah

1230
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,920
right but like what like how does

1231
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,760
consciousness emerge from that

1232
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,920
like how

1233
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,760
like what are the limitations of that

1234
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,599
observer i understand you're getting a

1235
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,880
delay well that's true there's a okay

1236
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,720
there's there's

1237
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,440
a bunch of limitations of the observer i

1238
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,799
think

1239
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,318
maybe just explain something about

1240
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,318
quantum mechanics because that maybe is

1241
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,880
a is an extreme version of some of these

1242
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:00,480
issues which helps to kind of motivate

1243
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,160
why one should sort of think things

1244
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,039
through a little bit more carefully

1245
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,399
so one feature of the of this

1246
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,318
okay so

1247
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,400
in standard physics like high school

1248
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,279
physics you learn you know the equations

1249
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,358
of motion for a ball and the the you

1250
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,599
know it says you throw the ball this

1251
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,838
angle this velocity things will move in

1252
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,079
this way and there's a definite answer

1253
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,199
right the story the the key story of

1254
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,800
quantum mechanics is there aren't

1255
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:27,199
definite answers to where does the ball

1256
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,240
go there's kind of this whole sort of

1257
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:32,239
bundle of possible paths and all we say

1258
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,479
we know from quantum mechanics is

1259
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,719
certain probabilities for where the ball

1260
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,719
will end up okay so that's kind of the

1261
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,679
the core idea of quantum mechanics so in

1262
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:44,399
our models you quantum mechanics is not

1263
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,759
some kind of plug-in add-on type thing

1264
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,760
you absolutely cannot get away from

1265
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,680
quantum mechanics because as you think

1266
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,000
about updating this hyper graph there

1267
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,279
isn't just one sequence of things one

1268
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,880
definite sequence of things that can

1269
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,119
happen there are all these different

1270
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,559
possible update sequences that can occur

1271
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,400
you could do this you know piece of the

1272
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:03,119
hypograph now and then this one later

1273
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,358
and etc etc etc all those different

1274
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,960
paths of history correspond to these

1275
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:08,639
quantum quantum

1276
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,800
paths and quantum mechanics these

1277
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:11,920
different possible quantum histories and

1278
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,119
one of the things that's kind of

1279
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,720
surprising about it is they they branch

1280
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,039
you know there can be a certain state of

1281
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:21,358
the universe and it could do this or it

1282
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,960
could do that but they can also merge

1283
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:25,519
there can be two states of the universe

1284
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,280
which their next state the next state

1285
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,519
they produce is the same for both of

1286
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,280
them and that process of branching and

1287
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:33,280
merging is kind of critical and the idea

1288
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
that they can be merging is critical and

1289
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,560
somewhat non-trivial for these

1290
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,720
hypographs because there's a whole graph

1291
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:40,400
isomorphism story and there's a whole

1292
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,039
very elaborate settlement that's where

1293
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,280
the causal invariance comes in yes

1294
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:48,480
among other things right okay yes that's

1295
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,280
but but so so then what happens is that

1296
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,039
what what one's seeing okay so we've got

1297
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,560
this thing it's branching it's merging

1298
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:57,039
et cetera et cetera et cetera okay so

1299
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,838
now the question is how do we perceive

1300
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,400
that

1301
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,838
what do you know how do we do we why

1302
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,358
don't we notice that the universe is

1303
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:05,039
branching and merging

1304
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,400
why you know why is it the case that we

1305
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,199
just think a definite set of things

1306
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,358
happen

1307
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,598
well the answer is we are embedded in

1308
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,519
that universe and our brains are

1309
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,680
branching and merging too

1310
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:18,159
and so what quantum mechanics becomes a

1311
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,399
story of is how does a branching brain

1312
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:23,759
perceive a branching universe

1313
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,440
and the key thing is as soon as you say

1314
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,680
i think definite things happen in the

1315
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,838
universe that means you are essentially

1316
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,759
conflating lots of different parts of

1317
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,838
history you're saying

1318
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,760
actually as far as i'm concerned because

1319
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,599
i'm convinced that definite things

1320
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,599
happen in the universe all these parts

1321
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,960
of history must be equivalent now it's

1322
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,880
not obvious that that would be a

1323
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,079
consistent thing to do it might be you

1324
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,280
say all these paths of history are

1325
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,720
equivalent but by golly moments later

1326
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,160
that would be a completely inconsistent

1327
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:52,559
point of view everything would have you

1328
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,399
know gone to hell in different ways the

1329
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,759
fact that that doesn't happen

1330
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,160
is well that's a consequence of this

1331
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,680
causal and variance thing but that's and

1332
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:01,598
the fact that that does happen a little

1333
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,639
bit is what causes little quantum

1334
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,640
effects

1335
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:07,358
and that term if that didn't happen at

1336
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:10,480
all there wouldn't be anything that sort

1337
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:12,000
of is like quantum mechanics it would be

1338
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,800
quantum mechanics is kind of like in

1339
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,639
this uh in this kind of this bundle of

1340
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,079
paths it's a little bit like what

1341
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:20,559
happens in statistical mechanics and

1342
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,000
fluid mechanics whatever that most of

1343
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,358
the time you just see this continuous

1344
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,358
fluid you just see the world just

1345
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,119
progressing in this kind of way that's

1346
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:28,480
like this continuous fluid but every so

1347
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,559
often if you look at the exact right

1348
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,240
experiment you can start seeing well

1349
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:33,519
actually it's made of these molecules

1350
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,199
where they might go that way or they

1351
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:38,639
might go this way and that's kind of

1352
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:41,039
quantum effects and and so that's so the

1353
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,559
this kind of idea of

1354
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,639
where we're sort of embedded in the

1355
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,719
universe this branching brain is

1356
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,400
perceiving this branching universe and

1357
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,879
that ends up being sort of a story of

1358
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,720
quantum mechanics that's that's part of

1359
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,960
the the whole picture of what's going on

1360
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:56,399
but i think i mean to come back to sort

1361
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,800
of where does conscious what is what is

1362
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,400
the story of consciousness so in the

1363
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,920
universe

1364
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,760
we've got you know whatever it is 10 to

1365
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,358
the 400 atoms of space they're all doing

1366
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,280
these complicated things

1367
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,679
it's all a big complicated irreducible

1368
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,680
computation the question is what do we

1369
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:14,960
perceive from all of that

1370
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:16,719
and the answer is that we are we are

1371
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,318
parsing the universe

1372
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:20,159
in a particular way

1373
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:23,279
let me again go back to the the gas

1374
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:25,118
molecules analogy you know in the gas in

1375
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,960
this room there are molecules bouncing

1376
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,079
around all kinds of complicated patterns

1377
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,920
but we don't care all we notice is

1378
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,920
there's you know the gas laws are

1379
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,880
satisfied maybe there's some fluid

1380
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,519
dynamics these are kind of features of

1381
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,519
that assembly molecules that we notice

1382
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:43,358
and then lots of details we don't notice

1383
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:45,119
when you say we do you mean the tools of

1384
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:47,679
physics or do you mean literally are the

1385
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,838
human brain in its perception system

1386
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:51,279
well okay so the human brain is where it

1387
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:52,558
starts but we've built a bunch of

1388
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,559
instruments to do a bit better than the

1389
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,160
human brain but they still have many of

1390
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,400
the same kinds of ideas you know their

1391
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,879
cameras and their pressure sensors and

1392
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,358
their these kinds of things they're not

1393
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,680
uh you know at this point we don't know

1394
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,318
how to make fundamentally qualitatively

1395
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,759
different sensory devices right and so

1396
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,800
it's always just an extension of the

1397
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,599
conscious

1398
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,480
experience or a sensory experience

1399
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,760
sensory experience but

1400
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,440
sensory experience that's somehow

1401
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,400
intricately tied to

1402
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,559
consciousness

1403
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,920
right well so so one question is when we

1404
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,519
are looking at all these molecules of

1405
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,760
the in the gas and there might be 10 to

1406
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:29,759
20 molecules in some little little box

1407
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,599
or something it's like

1408
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,280
what what do we notice about those

1409
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,599
molecules so one thing that we can say

1410
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,559
is we don't notice that much

1411
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:41,920
we are you know we are computationally

1412
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,680
bounded observers we can't go in and say

1413
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,000
okay i'm they're 10 to the 20th

1414
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:47,679
molecules and i know that i can sort of

1415
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,440
decrypt their motions and i can figure

1416
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:50,799
out this and that it's like i'm just

1417
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,599
going to say what's the average density

1418
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,519
of molecules and so one key feature of

1419
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,318
us is that we are computationally

1420
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:00,800
bounded and that when you are looking at

1421
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:03,119
a universe which is full of computation

1422
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,359
and doing huge amounts of computation

1423
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,960
but we are computationally bounded

1424
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:07,838
there's only certain things about that

1425
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,318
universe that we're going to be

1426
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,000
sensitive to we're not going to be you

1427
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,239
know figuring out what all the atoms of

1428
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,318
space are doing because we're just

1429
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:20,000
computationally bounded observers and we

1430
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:22,000
are only sampling these these small set

1431
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,679
of features so i i think the two

1432
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,559
defining features of consciousness that

1433
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:26,159
and i

1434
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,800
you know i would say that the the sort

1435
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,558
of the the preamble to this is

1436
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,760
for years you know because i've talked

1437
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,440
about sort of computation and

1438
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,400
fundamental features of physics and

1439
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,760
science

1440
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,960
people ask me so what about

1441
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,040
consciousness

1442
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,720
and i for years i've said i have nothing

1443
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,400
to say about consciousness

1444
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:43,759
and you know i've kind of told this

1445
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,318
story you know you talk about

1446
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,400
intelligence you talk about life

1447
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,079
these are both features where you say

1448
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,280
what's the abstract definition of life

1449
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,720
we don't really know the abstract

1450
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,800
definition we know the one for life on

1451
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,078
earth it's got rna it's got cell

1452
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,960
membranes it's got all this kind of

1453
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,119
stuff

1454
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,880
similarly for intelligence we know the

1455
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,800
human definition of intelligence but

1456
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,280
what is intelligence abstractly we don't

1457
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,359
really know and so what i've long

1458
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,280
believed is that sort of the abstract

1459
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:11,838
definition of intelligence is just

1460
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,119
computational sophistication that is

1461
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,119
that as soon as you can be

1462
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,519
computationally sophisticated that's

1463
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,838
kind of the abstract version the

1464
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:20,800
generalized version of intelligence so

1465
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:22,960
then the question is what about

1466
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,400
consciousness and what i sort of

1467
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,440
realized is that consciousness is

1468
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,800
actually a step down from intelligence

1469
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,119
that is that you might think oh you know

1470
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,039
consciousness is the is the is the top

1471
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,119
of the pile but actually i don't think

1472
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,880
it is i think that there's this notion

1473
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,358
of kind of computational sophistication

1474
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,079
which is the generalized intelligence

1475
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,920
but consciousness has two limitations i

1476
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,079
think one of them is computational

1477
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,240
boundedness that is that we're only

1478
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,880
perceiving a sort of computationally

1479
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,639
bounded view of the universe and the

1480
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,519
other is this idea of a single thread of

1481
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,159
time

1482
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:00,239
that is that we and in fact we know

1483
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:02,639
neurophysiologically our brains go to

1484
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,959
some trouble to give us this one thread

1485
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,159
of attention so to speak and it isn't

1486
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,039
the case that you know in all the

1487
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,639
neurons in our brains that that uh in at

1488
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,239
least in our conscious

1489
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,558
know the the you know the correspondence

1490
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,159
of language in our conscious experience

1491
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,040
we just have the single thread of

1492
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,799
attention single thread of of perception

1493
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:22,719
um and you know maybe there's something

1494
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,640
unconscious that's bubbling around

1495
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:26,078
that's the kind of almost the quantum

1496
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,239
version of what's happening in our brain

1497
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,800
so to speak we've got the the classical

1498
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:32,799
flow of what we are mostly thinking

1499
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,960
about so to speak but there's this kind

1500
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,720
of bubbling around of other paths that

1501
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,880
is all those other neurons that didn't

1502
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:41,199
make it to be part of our sort of

1503
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,680
conscious stream of experience so in

1504
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:46,399
that sense intelligence as computational

1505
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:49,598
sophistication is much broader

1506
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,440
than uh yes then the the computational

1507
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,400
constraints

1508
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,159
which

1509
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,400
consciousness operates under and also

1510
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,639
the sequential like the sequential thing

1511
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,000
yes like the notion of time

1512
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:02,159
that's that's kind of interesting but

1513
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,920
then the the follow-up question is like

1514
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,078
okay starting to get a sense of what is

1515
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,720
intelligence and how does that connect

1516
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,400
to a human brain because you're saying

1517
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:12,719
um

1518
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,559
intelligence is almost like a fabric

1519
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:16,558
like what we like plug into it or

1520
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,880
something like yeah i think you know our

1521
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,920
consciousness plugs into it yeah i mean

1522
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,519
the intelligence i think the core

1523
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,440
i mean you know intelligence at some

1524
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,440
level is just a word but we're asking

1525
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,838
you know what is the the notion of

1526
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,679
intelligence as we generalize it beyond

1527
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:33,759
the bounds of humans beyond the bounds

1528
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:37,039
of even the ais that we humans have

1529
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,960
built and so on you know what what is

1530
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,239
intelligence you know is the weather you

1531
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,838
know people say the weather has a mind

1532
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,919
of its own what does that mean you know

1533
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:46,000
can the weather be intelligent

1534
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,159
yeah what does agency have to do with

1535
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,318
intelligence here so is intelligence

1536
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:51,920
just like your conception of computation

1537
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:53,039
just intelligence

1538
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,440
is a

1539
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:58,079
is the capacity to perform computation

1540
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,838
and the sea of yeah i think so i mean i

1541
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,880
think that's right and i i think that

1542
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:04,318
you know this question of of is it for a

1543
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,119
purpose okay

1544
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:09,039
that quickly degenerates into a horrible

1545
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,480
philosophical mess because you know

1546
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,880
whenever you say

1547
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,960
did the weather do that for a purpose

1548
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,800
yeah right well yes it did it was trying

1549
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,720
to move a bunch of hot air from the

1550
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,318
equator to the poles or something that's

1551
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:24,558
its purpose but why because i seem to be

1552
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:27,519
equally as dumb today as i was yesterday

1553
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:30,079
so there's some persistence like uh

1554
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:32,400
consistency over time that the

1555
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,400
intelligence i plugged into

1556
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,318
so like what's it seems like there's a

1557
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,559
hard constraint

1558
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:40,800
well between the amount of computation i

1559
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,400
can perform in my consciousness

1560
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,400
like they seem to be really closely

1561
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,800
connected somehow well i think the point

1562
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,800
is that the thing that gives you kind of

1563
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,800
the ability to have

1564
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,880
kind of conscious

1565
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:55,200
intel intelligence

1566
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,119
you you can have kind of this okay so so

1567
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:59,439
one thing is we don't know

1568
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:02,400
intelligences other than the ones that

1569
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,318
are very much like us yes right and the

1570
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,000
ones that are very much like us i think

1571
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:06,800
have this feature of single thread of

1572
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,358
time

1573
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:12,400
bounded you know computationally bounded

1574
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:14,480
now that but you also need computational

1575
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,639
sophistication having a single thread of

1576
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,159
time and being computationally bounded

1577
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,719
you could just be a clock going

1578
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,799
tick-tock you know that would satisfy

1579
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:26,959
those conditions but the fact that we

1580
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,680
have this uh sort of uh irreducible

1581
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,599
you know computational ability that's

1582
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,598
that's an important feature that's

1583
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,200
that's the sort of the the bedrock on

1584
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,640
which we can construct the things we

1585
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:40,879
construct now the fact that we have this

1586
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,480
experience of the world that has the

1587
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,798
single thread of time and computational

1588
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,000
boundedness the thing that i sort of

1589
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:48,639
realized is

1590
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,280
it's that that causes us

1591
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:53,519
to deduce from this irreducible mess of

1592
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,720
what's going on in the physical world

1593
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:59,759
the laws of physics that we think exist

1594
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:02,399
so in other words if we say why do we

1595
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,400
believe that there is you know

1596
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,480
continuous space let's say why do we

1597
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,358
believe that gravity works the way it

1598
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,400
does

1599
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:12,719
well in principle we could be kind of

1600
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,680
parsing details of the universe

1601
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:18,959
that were uh you know that

1602
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:21,118
okay the analogy is uh again with

1603
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,240
the you know statistical mechanics and

1604
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,079
molecules in a box we could be sensitive

1605
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,759
to every little detail of the swirling

1606
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,440
around those molecules and we could say

1607
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,839
what really matters

1608
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,440
is the you know the wiggle effect yes

1609
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:35,440
that is um you know that is something

1610
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,440
that we humans just never notice because

1611
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,318
it's some weird thing that happens when

1612
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,920
there are 15 collisions of air molecules

1613
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,318
and this happens and that happens we

1614
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,119
just see the pure motion of a ball yeah

1615
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:49,599
moving about right why do we see that

1616
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:52,240
right and the point is that that what

1617
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:54,480
seems to be the case is that the things

1618
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:56,239
that if if we say given this sort of

1619
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,960
hypergraph that's updating and all the

1620
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:00,479
details about all the sort of uh sort of

1621
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,880
atoms of space and what they do and we

1622
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,880
say how do we slice that to what we can

1623
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,280
be sensitive to what seems to be the

1624
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,519
case is that as soon as we assume

1625
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,760
you know computational boundedness

1626
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:13,519
single thread of time that leads us to

1627
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,280
general relativity in other words we

1628
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:18,318
can't avoid that that that's the way

1629
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,640
that we we will parse the universe given

1630
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:21,838
those constraints we parse the universe

1631
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,078
according to

1632
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,798
those particular uh

1633
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,559
in such a way that we say the aggregate

1634
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:29,920
reducible copy

1635
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,960
sort of computate pocket of

1636
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,960
computational reducibility that we slice

1637
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,920
out of this kind of whole computational

1638
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,199
irreducible ocean of behavior is just

1639
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,960
this one that corresponds to general

1640
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,798
relativity yeah but we don't perceive

1641
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,280
general relativity

1642
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:47,358
well we do if we do fancy experiments so

1643
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,200
you're saying so perceive really does

1644
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:50,639
mean the force we drop something that's

1645
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:52,480
a that's a great example of general

1646
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,000
relativity in action the graph no but

1647
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,838
like what's the difference between that

1648
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,159
and newtonian mechanics i mean oh it

1649
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:00,558
doesn't i this is i when i say general

1650
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:02,960
relativity that's gravity uber the uber

1651
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,359
theory so to speak i mean newtonian

1652
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,880
gravity is just the approximation that

1653
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:09,119
we can make you know

1654
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,720
on the earth and things like that so so

1655
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,640
this is you know the phenomenon of

1656
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:16,480
gravity is one that is a consequence of

1657
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,480
you know we would perceive something

1658
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,440
very different from gravity so so the

1659
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,159
way to understand that is when we think

1660
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,720
about okay so

1661
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,558
we make up reference frames with which

1662
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:29,358
we parse what's happening in space and

1663
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,280
time

1664
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,639
so in other words one of the one of the

1665
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,559
things that we do

1666
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:36,318
is we say

1667
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,640
as time progresses

1668
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:40,719
uh everywhere in space

1669
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,879
is something happens at a particular

1670
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,399
time and then we go to the next time and

1671
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,838
we say this is what space is like at the

1672
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,119
next time there's what space is like at

1673
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:50,159
the next time

1674
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:51,358
that's it's the reason we are used to

1675
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:53,598
doing that

1676
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:56,798
is because you know when we look around

1677
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:59,200
we might see you know 10 100 meters away

1678
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:01,358
um the time it takes light to travel

1679
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:03,199
that distance is really short compared

1680
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:05,199
to the time it takes our brains to know

1681
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:07,439
what happened so as far as our brains

1682
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:09,838
are concerned we are parsing the

1683
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:11,920
universe in this there is a moment in

1684
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:14,078
time it's all of space there's a moment

1685
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,159
in time it's all of space you know if we

1686
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,200
were the size of planets or something we

1687
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,318
would have a different perception

1688
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:20,318
because the speed of light would be much

1689
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,719
more important to us we wouldn't have

1690
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,960
this perception that

1691
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,798
things happen progressively in time

1692
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,159
everywhere in space

1693
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:30,239
and so that's an important kind of

1694
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:32,480
constraint and the reason that we kind

1695
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,798
of parse the universe in the way that

1696
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,960
causes us to say gravity works the way

1697
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:39,519
it does is because we're doing things

1698
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,159
like deciding that we can say the

1699
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:43,440
universe exists space has a definite

1700
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:45,358
structure

1701
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,119
there is a moment in time space has this

1702
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:48,480
definite structure we move to the next

1703
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,200
moment in time space as another

1704
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,519
structure that kind of set up is what

1705
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:56,078
lets us kind of deduce

1706
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:58,400
kind of what to parse the universe in

1707
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:01,039
such a way that we say gravity works the

1708
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:04,240
way it does so uh that kind of reference

1709
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,199
frame is that the illusion of that is

1710
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:07,358
that

1711
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,798
you're saying that somehow useful for

1712
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:10,798
consciousness

1713
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:13,119
that's what consciousness does because

1714
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:15,440
in a sense what consciousness is doing

1715
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,318
is there are uh

1716
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:21,039
it's it's insisting that the universe is

1717
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:23,279
kind of sequentialized right that is um

1718
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,719
and it is not allowing the possibility

1719
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,319
that oh there are these multiple threads

1720
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:28,959
of time and they're all flowing

1721
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:31,759
differently it's like saying no you know

1722
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,599
everything is happening in this one

1723
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,359
thread of experience that we have and

1724
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,039
that illusion of that one thread of

1725
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:39,440
experience cannot happen at the

1726
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:41,759
planetary scale so are you saying

1727
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,920
typical human are you saying we are at a

1728
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,400
human level especially

1729
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,240
here for consciousness like well for our

1730
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,400
kind of consciousness it's it's uh you

1731
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:52,479
know if we existed at a scale close to

1732
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,920
the elementary length for example then

1733
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,000
our perception of the universe will be

1734
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,760
absurdly different okay so but this

1735
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,358
makes this consciousness seem like a

1736
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,559
weird side effect to this particular

1737
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:02,639
scale

1738
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:05,119
and so who cares i mean

1739
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:06,879
consciousness is not that special i i

1740
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,400
think look i think that a very

1741
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,160
interesting question is which i've

1742
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,240
certainly thought a little bit about

1743
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:15,440
is what can you imagine what is a sort

1744
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:17,279
of factoring of something you know what

1745
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,838
are some other possible ways you could

1746
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,720
exist so to speak right and you know if

1747
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:24,400
you were a photon if you were sort of

1748
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:26,838
you know some kind of thing that was

1749
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,039
some uh kind of you know

1750
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:32,078
intelligence represented in terms of

1751
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,679
photons you know for example the photons

1752
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:35,680
we receive in the cosmic microwave

1753
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:36,960
background those photons as far as

1754
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:39,519
they're concerned the universe just

1755
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,960
started they they they were emitted you

1756
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:42,079
know 100 000 years after the beginning

1757
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,480
of the universe they've been traveling

1758
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,720
at the speed of light time stayed still

1759
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,440
for them and then they just arrived and

1760
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:51,358
we just detected them so for them the

1761
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,440
universe just started and that's a

1762
01:00:51,358 --> 01:00:55,199
different perception of you know that

1763
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,798
has implications for a very different

1764
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,279
perception of time they don't have that

1765
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:00,719
single thread that seems to be

1766
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,359
really important for being able to tell

1767
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:05,118
a heck of a good story so we humans

1768
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:06,639
we can tell a story

1769
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,880
right we can tell a story what other

1770
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:10,960
kind of stories can you tell so photon

1771
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,880
is a really boring story

1772
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,400
yeah i mean so that's a i don't know if

1773
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,400
they're a boring story but i i think

1774
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,079
it's you know i've been wondering about

1775
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,280
this and i've been asking you know

1776
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,480
friends of mine who are science fiction

1777
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,079
writers and things have you written

1778
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,000
stuff about this and i've got one

1779
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,440
example good great great

1780
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,480
collection of books from my friend rudy

1781
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,440
rooker which were um uh which i have to

1782
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,280
say the um they're books about uh that

1783
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,119
are very informed by a bunch of science

1784
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,200
that i've done and the thing that i

1785
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,280
really loved about them is you know you

1786
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:41,519
know in the in the first chapter of the

1787
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,359
of the book the the earth is consumed by

1788
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:46,798
these things he called nance which are

1789
01:01:43,358 --> 01:01:48,400
nano nanobot type things and

1790
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:50,400
but so you know so the earth is gone in

1791
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,480
the first but then it comes back but but

1792
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,079
um but then spoiler alert yeah right

1793
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,719
that was uh that was only a microspot

1794
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:59,839
it's only chapter one okay it's it's um

1795
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:01,598
the but but uh the thing that um is is

1796
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:03,838
not a real spoiler alert because it's

1797
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,720
such a complicated concept but but in

1798
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:08,318
the end in the end the the earth is

1799
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:09,919
saved by this thing called the principle

1800
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:12,639
of computational equivalence which is a

1801
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,798
kind of a core scientific idea of mine

1802
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:16,960
and i was just like like thrilled i i

1803
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,480
don't read fiction books very often um

1804
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,559
and i was just thrilled i get to the end

1805
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,639
of this and it's like oh my gosh you

1806
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,640
know everything is saved by this sort of

1807
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:26,719
deep scientific principle can you can

1808
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:29,759
you maybe elaborate how the principle of

1809
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:31,279
computational equivalence

1810
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,880
can save

1811
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,559
a planet

1812
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,240
that would that would be a have a

1813
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,319
terrible spoiler for me that would be a

1814
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:39,598
spoiler okay yeah but but no but let me

1815
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:40,960
say what the principle of computational

1816
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,000
equivalence is

1817
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,599
um

1818
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,639
so the question is

1819
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,798
you are

1820
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,318
you have a system you have some rule

1821
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:50,239
you can think of its behavior as

1822
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:52,000
corresponding to a computation

1823
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:53,439
the question is how sophisticated is

1824
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,639
that computation

1825
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,960
the statement of the principle of

1826
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:59,679
computational equivalence is as soon as

1827
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:02,000
it's it's not obviously simple it will

1828
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:03,919
be as sophisticated as anything and so

1829
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,679
that has the implication that you know

1830
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,358
rule 30

1831
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:09,358
you know our brains

1832
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:10,558
other things in physics they're all

1833
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:12,719
ultimately equivalent in the

1834
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,839
computations they can do and that's what

1835
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,159
leads to this computational

1836
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:18,639
irreducibility idea because the reason

1837
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:21,118
we don't get to jump ahead you know and

1838
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:23,279
out think rule 30 is because we're just

1839
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:25,200
computationally equivalent to rule 30 so

1840
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,559
we're kind of just both just running

1841
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,199
computations

1842
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,119
that are the same sort of raw the same

1843
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:33,439
level of computation so to speak so

1844
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:36,480
that's kind of the the idea there and

1845
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:39,119
the question i mean it's it's like uh

1846
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,358
the you know in in the science fiction

1847
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:43,280
version would be okay somebody says we

1848
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:45,679
just need more servers get us more

1849
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,319
servers the way to get even more servers

1850
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:49,838
is turn the whole planet into a bunch of

1851
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:51,759
micro servers

1852
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:54,078
and that that's uh that's where it

1853
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,599
starts and so the question of you know

1854
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,880
computational equivalence principle of

1855
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,960
computational equivalence is well

1856
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,880
actually you don't need to build those

1857
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,240
custom servers actually you can uh you

1858
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,358
can just

1859
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:09,279
use natural computation to compute

1860
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:11,279
things so to speak you can use nature to

1861
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,960
compute you don't need to have done all

1862
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,640
that engineering i mean it's kind of the

1863
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,400
it's it's kind of feels a little

1864
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:18,078
disappointing that you say we're going

1865
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,280
to build all these servers we're going

1866
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,519
to do all these things we're going to

1867
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,839
make you know maybe we're going to have

1868
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:26,079
human consciousness uploaded into you

1869
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:27,519
know some elaborate digital environment

1870
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:29,519
and then you look at that thing and you

1871
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:31,038
say it's got electrons moving around

1872
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:32,159
just like in a rock

1873
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,760
and then you say well what's the

1874
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:35,759
difference and the principle of

1875
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,559
computational equivalence says there

1876
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,200
isn't at some level a fundamental you

1877
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:43,920
know you can't say mathematically

1878
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:45,519
there's a fundamental difference between

1879
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,680
the rock that is the future of human

1880
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:48,559
consciousness and the rock that's just a

1881
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:50,960
rock

1882
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:53,519
now what i've sort of realized with this

1883
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,400
kind of consciousness thing is there is

1884
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:59,119
a there is an aspect of this that seems

1885
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,798
to be more special that isn't and and

1886
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,200
for example something i i haven't really

1887
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:04,559
teased apart properly is when it comes

1888
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,919
to something like the weather and the

1889
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,160
weather having a mind of its own or

1890
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,318
whatever or your average you know pulsar

1891
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:12,960
magnetosphere acting like a sort of

1892
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:16,719
intelligent thing how does that relate

1893
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:19,199
to you know how how do how is that

1894
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:21,358
that entity related to the kind of

1895
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:23,118
consciousness that we have and sort of

1896
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:24,880
what would the world look like you know

1897
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,559
to the weather if we think about the

1898
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,559
weather as a mind

1899
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,720
what will it perceive what will it laws

1900
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,680
its laws of physics be i don't really

1901
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:33,759
know

1902
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:35,919
because it's very parallel it's very

1903
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,880
parallel among other things and it it

1904
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,400
it's not obvious i mean this is a a

1905
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,400
really kind of mind-bending thing

1906
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,200
because we've got to try and imagine

1907
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,798
where

1908
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:46,558
uh you know we've got to try and imagine

1909
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:48,960
a parsing of the universe different from

1910
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,160
the one we have and by the way when we

1911
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,400
think about extraterrestrial

1912
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:55,118
intelligence and so on i think that's

1913
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,440
kind of the key thing is you know we've

1914
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:59,280
always assumed i've always assumed okay

1915
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,960
the extraterrestrials at least they have

1916
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,280
the same physics we all live in the same

1917
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,960
universe they've got the same physics

1918
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:07,760
but actually that's not really right

1919
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:10,318
because the extraterrestrials could have

1920
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,640
a completely different way of parsing

1921
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:14,558
that the universe so it's as if you know

1922
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:16,159
there could be for all we know right

1923
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,680
here in this room you know in the in the

1924
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:20,239
details of the motion of these gas

1925
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:22,879
molecules there could be an amazing

1926
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:25,598
intelligence that we were like but we

1927
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,119
have no way of we're not parsing the

1928
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,880
universe in the same way if only we

1929
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,760
could parse the universe in the right

1930
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,599
way you know immediately this amazing

1931
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,119
thing that's going on and this you know

1932
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,720
huge culture that's developed and all

1933
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,318
that kind of thing would be obvious to

1934
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:39,759
us but it's not because we have a

1935
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:42,239
particular way of passing the universe

1936
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,839
would that thing also have us

1937
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:45,919
agency i don't know the right word to

1938
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:48,000
use but something like consciousness but

1939
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,358
a different kind of consciousness

1940
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,960
i think it's a question of just what you

1941
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:52,480
mean by the word because i think that

1942
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,240
the you know this notion of

1943
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,760
consciousness and the

1944
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:57,679
okay so some people think of

1945
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,720
consciousness as sort of a key aspect of

1946
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:03,279
it is that we feel that

1947
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:05,358
the the sort of a feeling of that we

1948
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:08,000
exist in some way that we have this

1949
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:11,519
intrinsic feeling about ourselves

1950
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,358
you know i i suspect that any of these

1951
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:14,639
things would also have an intrinsic

1952
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:16,318
feeling about themselves i've been sort

1953
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,798
of trying to think recently about

1954
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,239
constructing an experiment about what if

1955
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:22,559
you were just a piece of a cellular

1956
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:25,118
automaton let's say you know what would

1957
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,760
your feeling about yourself actually be

1958
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,680
and you know can we put ourselves in the

1959
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,079
in the shoes and the cells of the

1960
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:34,000
cellular automaton so to speak can we

1961
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,480
can we get ourselves close enough to

1962
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,880
that that we could have a sense of what

1963
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,119
the world would be like if you were

1964
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,119
operating in that way and it's a little

1965
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:45,039
difficult because you know you have to

1966
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,960
not only think about what are you

1967
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,440
perceiving but also what's actually

1968
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,679
going on in your brain and our brains do

1969
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,519
what they actually do and they don't

1970
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,358
it's you know i think there might be

1971
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:57,920
some experiments that are possible with

1972
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:59,119
with uh you know neural nets and so on

1973
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,280
where you can have something where you

1974
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:03,519
can at least see in detail what's

1975
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,359
happening inside the system and i i've

1976
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:06,880
been sort of one of the one of my

1977
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:08,798
projects to think about is is there a

1978
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,880
way of kind of uh

1979
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:13,440
kind of getting a sense kind of from

1980
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,079
inside the system about what its view of

1981
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,480
the world is and and how it how it you

1982
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:20,000
know uh can can we make a bridge see the

1983
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,079
main issue is this

1984
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,238
where you know it's a it's a sort of

1985
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,559
philosophically difficult thing because

1986
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:29,599
it's like we do what we do we understand

1987
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,039
ourselves um at least to some extent we

1988
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,079
humans understand ourselves that's

1989
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:35,759
correct and but yet okay so what are we

1990
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:37,359
trying to do for example when we are

1991
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,359
trying to make a model of physics what

1992
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,960
are we actually trying to do because you

1993
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,199
know you say well can we work out what

1994
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,719
the universe does well of course we can

1995
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,719
we just watch the universe the universe

1996
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:48,798
does what it does but what we're trying

1997
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,239
to do when we make a model of physics is

1998
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:52,960
we're trying to get to the point where

1999
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:54,238
we can tell a story to ourselves that we

2000
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,000
understand

2001
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:58,318
that is also a representation of what

2002
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,079
the universe does so it's this kind of

2003
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:01,839
you know can we make a bridge between

2004
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:04,399
what we humans can understand in our

2005
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:06,880
minds and what the universe does

2006
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:10,079
and in a sense you know a large part of

2007
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,079
my kind of life uh efforts have been

2008
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,158
devoted to making computational language

2009
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:15,920
which kind of is a bridge between what

2010
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:18,719
is possible in the computational

2011
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,560
universe and what we humans can

2012
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,239
conceptualize and think about in a sense

2013
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,600
what you know when i built wolfram

2014
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,838
language and our whole sort of

2015
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,640
computational language story it's all

2016
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:30,000
about how do you take sort of raw

2017
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,719
computation and this ocean of

2018
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,198
computational possibility and how do we

2019
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:37,920
sort of represent pieces of it in a way

2020
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:39,358
that we humans can understand and that

2021
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,119
map on to things that we care about

2022
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,679
doing and in a sense when you add

2023
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:45,358
physics you're adding this other piece

2024
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,239
where we can you know mediate it by

2025
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,640
computer can we get physics to the point

2026
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:52,238
where we humans can understand something

2027
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,679
about what's happening in it

2028
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:56,000
and when we talk about an alien

2029
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,880
intelligence it's kind of the same story

2030
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,719
it's like is there a way of mapping

2031
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,640
what's happening there onto something

2032
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:05,840
that we humans can understand

2033
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,640
and you know physics in some sense is

2034
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,360
like

2035
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:12,000
our exhibit one of the story of alien

2036
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:14,158
intelligence it's it's a it's a you know

2037
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,920
it's an alien intelligence in some sense

2038
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:16,960
and what we're doing in making a model

2039
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,960
of physics

2040
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,359
is mapping that onto something that we

2041
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,719
understand and i think you know a lot of

2042
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:25,039
these other things that have i've

2043
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,560
recently been kind of studying uh

2044
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:28,719
whether it's molecular biology other

2045
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,360
kinds of things um which we can talk

2046
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,960
about a bit um the um

2047
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:35,439
uh those are other cases where we're in

2048
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:37,920
a sense trying to again make that bridge

2049
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:40,079
between what we humans understand and

2050
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,239
sort of the the natural language of that

2051
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:45,119
sort of alien intelligence in some sense

2052
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,959
when you're talking about just uh to

2053
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:49,039
backtrack a little bit about cellular

2054
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:52,079
automata

2055
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:53,920
being able to uh what's it like to be a

2056
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:56,559
cellular automata

2057
01:10:53,920 --> 01:11:00,640
in a way that's equivalent to what is it

2058
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,640
like to be a conscious human being

2059
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:05,119
how do you approach that so

2060
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:06,880
is it looking at some subset of the

2061
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:08,479
cellular autonomy asking questions of

2062
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,600
that subset

2063
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:15,119
like how the world is perceived

2064
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,560
how yeah something like as that subset

2065
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:19,119
like for that local pocket of

2066
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,600
computation what are you able to say

2067
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:23,679
about the broader something like that

2068
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,280
and that somehow then

2069
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:27,279
can give you a sense of how to step

2070
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:28,800
outside of that cell right but but the

2071
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:31,519
tricky part is

2072
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,480
that that little subset

2073
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,880
it's what it's doing is it has a view of

2074
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:39,678
itself and the question is how do you

2075
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:42,400
get inside it it's like you know when we

2076
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,719
with humans right it's like we can't get

2077
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,879
inside each other's consciousness

2078
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:49,198
that doesn't really um you know that

2079
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,039
doesn't really even make sense it's like

2080
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:53,599
there is an experience that somebody is

2081
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:55,840
having but you can perceive things from

2082
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,079
the outside but sort of getting inside

2083
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,840
it it doesn't it doesn't quite make

2084
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:01,198
sense and i you know for me these sort

2085
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,360
of philosophical issues and this one i

2086
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:06,399
have not untangled so let's let's be um

2087
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:07,599
sure um the you know for me the thing

2088
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:09,439
that has been really interesting and

2089
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,039
thinking through some of these things is

2090
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:12,960
you know when it comes to questions

2091
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:15,439
about consciousness or whatever else

2092
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,000
it's like when i can run a program and

2093
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:20,079
actually see pictures and you know make

2094
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,679
things concrete i have a much better

2095
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:23,039
chance to understand what's going on

2096
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,800
than when i'm just trying to reason

2097
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:28,158
about things in a very abstract way yeah

2098
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:30,079
but there may be a way to uh

2099
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:32,158
map

2100
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,600
the program to your conscious experience

2101
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:35,759
so for example when you play a video

2102
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,560
game you do a first person shooter you

2103
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,560
walk around inside

2104
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,560
this entity yep it's a very different

2105
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,159
thing than watching this entity so if

2106
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,400
you can somehow

2107
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:48,879
connect more and more connect

2108
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:51,198
this full conscious experience

2109
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,640
to the subset of the cellular automata

2110
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:54,000
yeah it's something like that but the

2111
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,360
difference in the first person shooter

2112
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
thing is they're still

2113
01:12:55,359 --> 01:13:00,799
your brain and your memory is still

2114
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,198
remembering you know you you still have

2115
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,960
it's it's hard to i mean again what

2116
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:06,559
one's going to get

2117
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,480
one is not going to actually be able to

2118
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,760
be the cellular automaton one's going to

2119
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:11,439
be able to watch what the cellular

2120
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,719
automaton does but this is the

2121
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,759
frustrating thing that i'm trying to

2122
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:18,399
understand you know you know how to how

2123
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,079
to think about being it so to speak okay

2124
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:22,000
so like in virtual reality there's a

2125
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:23,600
concept of immersion like with anything

2126
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,840
with video game with books there's a

2127
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:29,600
concept of immersion it feels like over

2128
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,679
time if the virtual reality experience

2129
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,760
is is well done and maybe in the future

2130
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:36,719
would be extremely well done

2131
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:39,199
the immersion leads you to

2132
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,399
feel like you mentioned memories you

2133
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:42,399
forget

2134
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:43,519
that you even ever existed outside that

2135
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:45,359
experience

2136
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,560
yeah so immersive

2137
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,039
i mean you could argue sort of

2138
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,760
mathematically that you can never truly

2139
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:53,198
become immersed but maybe you can i mean

2140
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,440
well yeah i mean why can't you merge

2141
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:56,559
with the cellular automata yeah right i

2142
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:58,238
mean you're

2143
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,159
just part of the same fabric why can't

2144
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:02,000
you just like well that's a good

2145
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:03,519
question i mean so so let's imagine the

2146
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,800
following scenario let's imagine you

2147
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,800
return

2148
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,239
what's that well but then can you return

2149
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,000
back well yeah right i mean it's it's

2150
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:11,839
like let's imagine you've uploaded you

2151
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,399
know your brain is scanned you've got

2152
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,800
every synapse you know mapped out

2153
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:18,399
you upload everything about you the

2154
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,480
brain simulator you upload the brain

2155
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:22,719
simulator and the brain simulator is

2156
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:25,359
basically you know some glorified

2157
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,719
cellular automaton and then you say well

2158
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:28,799
now we've got an answer to what does it

2159
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:31,679
feel like to be a cellular automaton it

2160
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,760
feels just like it felt to be ordinary

2161
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,520
you because they're both computational

2162
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,679
systems and they're both you know

2163
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,520
operating in the same way so in a sense

2164
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:41,359
but i think there's there's somehow more

2165
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,400
to it because in that sense when you're

2166
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:46,079
just making a brain simulator it's just

2167
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:47,759
you know we're just saying there's

2168
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:49,760
another version of our consciousness the

2169
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,159
question that we're asking is if we

2170
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:54,159
tease away from our consciousness and

2171
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:55,920
get to something that is different how

2172
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:57,759
do we make a bridge to understanding

2173
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,520
what's going on there and you know

2174
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,600
there's a way of thinking about this

2175
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,800
okay so this is coming on to sort of

2176
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,280
questions about the existence of the

2177
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,600
universe and so on but one of the things

2178
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:09,119
is there's this notion that we have of

2179
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,800
rulial space

2180
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:12,960
so we have this idea of this physical

2181
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,119
space which is you know something you

2182
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,279
can move around in that's that's uh

2183
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:19,359
associated with actual the extent of the

2184
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:21,599
spatial hypergraph then there's what we

2185
01:15:19,359 --> 01:15:23,759
call branchial space the space of

2186
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,920
quantum branches so in this in this

2187
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,000
thing we call the multi-way graph of all

2188
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,158
of the sort of branching histories

2189
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,439
there's this idea of a kind of space

2190
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:33,359
where instead of moving around in

2191
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:35,599
physical space you're moving from

2192
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:36,960
history to history so to speak from one

2193
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,719
possible history to another possible

2194
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,239
history and that's kind of a different

2195
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,239
kind of space

2196
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:44,639
that is the space in which quantum

2197
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:47,678
mechanics plays out quantum mechanics

2198
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:49,199
like for example oh something like uh i

2199
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:50,800
think we're slowly understanding things

2200
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:53,039
like destructive interference in quantum

2201
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,600
mechanics but what's happening is

2202
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:57,198
branchial space is associated with phase

2203
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,800
in quantum mechanics and what's

2204
01:15:57,198 --> 01:15:59,759
happening is the two photons that are

2205
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,840
supposed to be interfering and

2206
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,119
destructively destructively interfering

2207
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,760
are winding up at different ends of

2208
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:08,000
branchial space and so us as these poor

2209
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,079
observers that are trying to that have

2210
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,679
branching brains that are trying to

2211
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,840
conflate together these different

2212
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,199
threads of history and say we've really

2213
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:16,800
got a consistent story that we're

2214
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:18,639
telling here we're really knitting

2215
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,880
together these threads of history by the

2216
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:23,039
time the two photons wound up at

2217
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,560
opposite ends of branchial space we just

2218
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:27,519
can't knit them together to tell a

2219
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,640
consistent story so for us that's sort

2220
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,000
of the analog of destructive

2221
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,000
interference

2222
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,238
got it and then there's rule space too

2223
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,960
which is the space of rules yes well

2224
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:39,198
that's that's a another level up so so

2225
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,198
there's there's the question um actually

2226
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:42,639
i i do want to mention one thing because

2227
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:44,079
it's something i've realized in recent

2228
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,239
times and it's i think it's really

2229
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:47,600
really kind of cool which is about time

2230
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:49,759
dilation and relativity and it kind of

2231
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,840
helps to understand it's something that

2232
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:53,119
kind of helps in understanding what's

2233
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,079
going on so

2234
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,760
in according to relativity if you you

2235
01:16:56,079 --> 01:16:58,880
know you have a clock it's ticking at a

2236
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,960
certain rate

2237
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,880
you send in a spacecraft that's going at

2238
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,679
some significant fraction the speed of

2239
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:07,359
light

2240
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:09,279
to you as a observer at rest that clock

2241
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:12,238
that's in the spacecraft will seem to be

2242
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:14,158
ticking much more slowly and so in other

2243
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:16,079
words you know it's kind of like the

2244
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:18,639
the the twin who goes off to alpha

2245
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,319
centauri and goes very fast will age

2246
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,719
much less than the twin who's on earth

2247
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:24,639
that um that is just hanging out where

2248
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:27,119
they're hanging out okay why does that

2249
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,800
happen okay so it has to do with what

2250
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:31,840
motion is

2251
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,520
so in in our models of physics

2252
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,679
what is motion well when you move from

2253
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,560
somewhere to somewhere it's you're

2254
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:40,560
having to sort of recreate yourself at a

2255
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,719
different place in space

2256
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:45,039
when you exist at a particular place and

2257
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,640
you just evolve with time you're again

2258
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:48,238
you're updating yourself you're you're

2259
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,280
following these rules to update what

2260
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:51,519
happens

2261
01:17:49,279 --> 01:17:53,679
well so the question is when you have a

2262
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,520
certain amount of computation in you so

2263
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:57,119
to speak when there's a certain amount

2264
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,199
you know you're computing the universe

2265
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:02,079
is computing at a certain rate you can

2266
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:04,319
either use that computation to work out

2267
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:06,640
sitting still where you are what's going

2268
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:08,799
to happen successively in time or you

2269
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:11,039
can use that computation to recreate

2270
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,679
yourself as you move around the universe

2271
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:14,960
and so time dilation ends up being it's

2272
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,880
really cool actually that this is

2273
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,560
explainable in a in a way that isn't

2274
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:21,359
just imagine the mathematics of

2275
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:24,239
relativity but but um that time dilation

2276
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:26,880
is a story of the fact that as you kind

2277
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:28,158
of are recreating yourself as you move

2278
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,079
you are using up some of your

2279
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:32,479
computation and so you don't have as

2280
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:34,319
much computation left over to actually

2281
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,799
work out what happens progressively with

2282
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:39,840
time so that means that time is running

2283
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,760
more slowly for you because it is

2284
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,480
you're you're using up your computation

2285
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,480
your your clock can't tick as quickly

2286
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,000
because every tick of the clock is using

2287
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:50,319
up some computation but you already use

2288
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,520
that computation up on moving at you

2289
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:53,920
know half the speed of light or

2290
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,520
something and so that's that's why time

2291
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:58,079
dilation happens

2292
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,440
and so you can you can start so it's

2293
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:01,119
kind of interesting that one can sort of

2294
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:02,879
get an intuition about something like

2295
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:05,198
that because it has seemed like just a

2296
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,760
mathematical fact about the mathematics

2297
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:09,599
of special relativity and so on well for

2298
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,480
me it's a little bit confusing what the

2299
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,960
u in that picture is because you're

2300
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:17,839
using up computation

2301
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:21,600
okay so so we're simply saying the

2302
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:24,079
entity is updating itself according to

2303
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,600
the way that the universe updates itself

2304
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:26,559
and the question is

2305
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,159
your

2306
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,600
you know those updates let's imagine the

2307
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:31,599
u is a clock

2308
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,520
okay and the clock is you know there's

2309
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,840
all these little updates the hypograph

2310
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:38,000
and a sequence of updates caused the

2311
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,560
pendulum to swing back the other way and

2312
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,000
then swing back swinging back and forth

2313
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:46,239
okay and all of the all of those updates

2314
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,679
are contributing to the motion of you

2315
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:50,718
know the pendulum going back and forth

2316
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:52,880
or the oscillator moving whatever it is

2317
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,800
okay but but then the alternative is

2318
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,159
that's sort of situation one where the

2319
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,560
thing is at rest

2320
01:19:56,158 --> 01:20:01,119
situation two where it's kind of moving

2321
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,440
the the what's happening is it is having

2322
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:06,238
to recreate itself at every at every

2323
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:08,960
moment the thing is going to have to do

2324
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,559
the computations to be able to

2325
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,639
sort of recreate itself at a different

2326
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,199
position in space and that's kind of the

2327
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:17,600
intuition behind so it's either going to

2328
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:19,599
spend its computation recreating itself

2329
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,320
at a different position in space or it's

2330
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:26,000
going to spend its computation doing the

2331
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:27,840
um uh sort of doing the updating of the

2332
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,920
you know of the the ticking of the clock

2333
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,159
so to speak so the more updating is

2334
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,239
doing the less the ticking of the clock

2335
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:36,079
update is doing that's right the more it

2336
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:38,079
has having to update because of motion

2337
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:41,119
yeah the less it can update the the

2338
01:20:38,079 --> 01:20:42,639
clock so that that's um i mean obviously

2339
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:44,319
there's a there's a sort of mathematical

2340
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,079
version of it that relates to how it

2341
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:48,399
actually works in relativity but that's

2342
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:50,238
kind of to me that was sort of exciting

2343
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:52,638
to me that it's possible to have a a

2344
01:20:50,238 --> 01:20:55,198
really mechanically explainable story

2345
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:56,719
there that that isn't um and similarly

2346
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:58,399
in quantum mechanics this notion of

2347
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:00,639
branching brains perceiving branching

2348
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:02,719
universes to me that's getting towards a

2349
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,159
sort of mechanically explainable version

2350
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,039
of what happens in quantum mechanics

2351
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:07,679
even though it's a little bit

2352
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:09,840
mind-bending uh to see you know these

2353
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:12,399
things about under what circumstances

2354
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,319
can you successfully knit together those

2355
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:16,319
different threads of history and when do

2356
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:18,559
things sort of escape and and those

2357
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:21,279
kinds of things but the you know the

2358
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:24,560
thing about this physical space and

2359
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:26,079
physical space the the main sort of big

2360
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,639
theory is general relativity the theory

2361
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:31,039
of gravity and that tells you how things

2362
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:32,880
move in physical space in bronchial

2363
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:35,920
space the big theory is the feynman path

2364
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,159
integral which it turns out tells you

2365
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,239
essentially how things move in quantum

2366
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:42,799
in the space of quantum phases so it's

2367
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:44,879
kind of like motion and branchial space

2368
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,639
and it's kind of a fun thing to start

2369
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,560
thinking about what

2370
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:50,880
oh you know all these things that we

2371
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,560
know in physical space like uh event

2372
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,000
horizons and black holes and so on what

2373
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,840
are the analogous things in branchial

2374
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,039
space for example the speed of light

2375
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,639
what's the analog of the speed of light

2376
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:00,238
in branch hill space

2377
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:03,760
it's the maximum speed of quantum

2378
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,839
entanglement so the speed of light is a

2379
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,400
flash bulb goes off here what's the

2380
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:11,440
maximum rate at which the effect of that

2381
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:12,638
flash bulb is detectable moving away in

2382
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:14,479
space

2383
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:16,800
so similarly in bronchial space

2384
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:18,638
something happens and the question is

2385
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,440
how far in this branchial space in the

2386
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:23,840
space of quantum states how far away can

2387
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:25,599
that get within a certain period of time

2388
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:28,319
and so there's this notion of a maximum

2389
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,600
entanglement speed and that might be

2390
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,000
observable that's the thing we've been

2391
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,840
sort of poking at is might there be a

2392
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,639
way to observe it even in some atomic

2393
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,840
physics kind of situation um

2394
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:40,560
because one of the things that's weird

2395
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,159
in quantum mechanics is we're you know

2396
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,159
when we study quantum mechanics we

2397
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:45,519
mostly study it in terms of small

2398
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:47,439
numbers of particles you know this

2399
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,679
electron does this this thing on an ion

2400
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:51,359
trap does that and so on but when we

2401
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:52,719
deal with large numbers of particles

2402
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:54,079
kind of all bets are off it's kind of

2403
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,800
too complicated to deal with quantum

2404
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:59,359
mechanics and so what ends up happening

2405
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,199
is so this question about maximum

2406
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:03,599
entanglement speed and things like that

2407
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:05,119
may actually play in one of these in the

2408
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,600
sort of story of many body quantum

2409
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:08,479
mechanics and even have some suspicions

2410
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,960
about

2411
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:12,959
things that might happen even in

2412
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,639
one of the things i i realized i'd never

2413
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,399
understood and it's kind of embarrassing

2414
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,880
but i think i now understand a little

2415
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:20,559
better is when you have chemistry

2416
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,159
and you have quantum mechanics

2417
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,520
it's like well there's two carbon atoms

2418
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:25,839
there's this molecule and we do a

2419
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:28,000
reaction and we draw a diagram we say

2420
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,520
this carbon atom ends up in this place

2421
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,198
and it's like but wait a minute in

2422
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,560
quantum mechanics nothing ends up in a

2423
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:34,719
definite place there's always just some

2424
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,719
wave function for this to happen how can

2425
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:38,239
it be the case that we can draw these

2426
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:40,079
reasonable it just ended up in this

2427
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:42,079
place and you have to kind of say well

2428
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:43,760
the environment of the molecule

2429
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:45,760
effectively made a bunch of measurements

2430
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,159
on the molecule to keep it kind of

2431
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,800
classical and that's a story that has to

2432
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:53,039
do with this whole thing about about you

2433
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:56,000
know measurements have to do with this

2434
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:57,279
idea of you know can we conclude that

2435
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,600
something definite happened because in

2436
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:00,960
quantum mechanics the the intrinsic

2437
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,639
quantum mechanics the mathematics of

2438
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,920
quantum mechanics is all about they're

2439
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,920
just these amplitudes for different

2440
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:08,480
things to happen then there's this thing

2441
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,840
of and then we make a measurement and we

2442
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:11,759
conclude that something definite

2443
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,719
happened and that has to do with this

2444
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:16,000
thing i think about sort of moving about

2445
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,480
knitting together these different

2446
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
threads of history and saying this is

2447
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:21,519
now something where we can definitively

2448
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,520
say something definite happen in the

2449
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:25,120
traditional theory of quantum mechanics

2450
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,080
it's just like

2451
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:28,479
you know after you've done all the

2452
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:30,000
sample sheet computation then this big

2453
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:32,000
hammer comes down and you do a

2454
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,520
measurement and it's all over and that's

2455
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,279
been very confusing for example in

2456
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,840
quantum computing it's been a very

2457
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:39,679
confusing thing because when you say you

2458
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,560
know in quantum computing the basic idea

2459
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,039
is you're going to use all these

2460
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,560
separate threads of of computation so to

2461
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:46,319
speak to do all the different parts of

2462
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,320
you know try these different factors for

2463
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:50,158
an integer or something like this and it

2464
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:51,840
looks like you can do a lot because

2465
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:54,238
you've got all these different threads

2466
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,760
going on but then you have to say well

2467
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:57,359
at the end of it you've got all these

2468
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,960
threads and every thread came up with

2469
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:01,198
the definite answer but we've got to

2470
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,439
conflate those together to figure out a

2471
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:05,599
definite thing that we humans can take

2472
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:08,879
away from it a definite so the computer

2473
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:11,760
actually produced this output so having

2474
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:14,000
this branchial space and this hypergraph

2475
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:16,719
model of physics do you think it's

2476
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,920
possible to then make predictions that

2477
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:21,359
are definite about uh many body quantum

2478
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,880
mechanical systems

2479
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:25,759
is that the whole i think it's likely

2480
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,840
yes but i don't you know this is every

2481
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,199
one of these things when you when you go

2482
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,360
from the underlying theory which is

2483
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:33,039
complicated enough and it's i mean the

2484
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,880
theory at some level is beautifully

2485
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:36,560
simple but as soon as you start actually

2486
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,319
trying to it's this whole question about

2487
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,639
how do you bridge it to things that we

2488
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:43,119
humans can talk about it gets really

2489
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:45,199
complicated and and this thing about

2490
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:48,238
actually getting it to a definite

2491
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:49,519
definite prediction um about you know

2492
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:51,678
definite thing you can say about

2493
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,800
chemistry or something like this um you

2494
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:54,319
know that's just a lot of work so i'll

2495
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,039
give you an example there's a thing

2496
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:59,198
called the quantum zeno effect so

2497
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:01,039
the idea is you know quantum stuff

2498
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:03,039
happens but then if you make a

2499
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:06,158
measurement you're kind of freezing time

2500
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:07,840
in quantum mechanics you and and so it

2501
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:09,279
looks like there's a possibility that

2502
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,279
with sort of the the relationship

2503
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:12,719
between the quantum zeno effect and the

2504
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:16,079
way that many body quantum mechanics

2505
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:17,840
works and so on maybe just conceivably

2506
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:20,079
it may be possible to actually figure

2507
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:21,920
out a way to measure the the uh the

2508
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:24,158
maximum entanglement speed and the

2509
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,480
reason we can potentially do that is

2510
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:28,158
because the systems we deal with in

2511
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:30,638
terms of atoms and things they're pretty

2512
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:32,799
big you know a mole of atoms is you know

2513
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:34,719
it's a lot of atoms and you know but it

2514
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,639
isn't a very you know it's something

2515
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:38,639
where to get you know when we're dealing

2516
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:41,359
with how can you see 10 to the minus 100

2517
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:43,520
so to speak well by the time you've got

2518
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:45,279
you know 10 to the 30th atoms

2519
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:47,280
you're not you know you're within a

2520
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:49,759
little bit closer striking distance of

2521
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:50,559
that it's not like oh we've just got you

2522
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,800
know

2523
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,560
two atoms and we're trying to see down

2524
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,880
to 10 to the minus 100 meters or

2525
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:59,440
whatever so i don't know how it will

2526
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:02,079
work but this is a this is a a potential

2527
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:03,279
direction if you can tell by the way if

2528
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:05,039
we could measure the maximum

2529
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:07,679
entanglement speed we would know the

2530
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:10,158
elementary length these are all related

2531
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:12,319
so if if we get that one number we just

2532
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:14,238
need one number if we can get that one

2533
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:17,039
number we can you know the theory has no

2534
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:18,718
parameters anymore um and uh you know

2535
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:20,560
there are there are other places well

2536
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:23,679
there's another another hope for doing

2537
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:25,199
that is in cosmology uh in this model

2538
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:26,880
one of the features is the universe is

2539
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:28,879
not fixed dimensional i mean we think we

2540
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,400
live in three-dimensional space but this

2541
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,880
hyper graph doesn't have any particular

2542
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:35,679
dimension it can emerge as something

2543
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,199
which on an approximation it's as if you

2544
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,520
know you say what's the volume of a

2545
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:41,919
sphere in the hypergraph where a sphere

2546
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,920
is defined as how many nodes do you get

2547
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,119
to when you go a distance r away from a

2548
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,920
given point

2549
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:50,960
and you can say well if i get to about r

2550
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,639
cube nodes when i go a distance r away

2551
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,480
in the hypergraph then i'm living

2552
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:57,039
roughly in three dimensional space but

2553
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:58,959
you might also get to r to the point you

2554
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:01,920
know 2.92

2555
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,760
you know for for some value for r in you

2556
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:06,399
know as as our increases that might be

2557
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,079
the the sort of fit to what happens and

2558
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:10,079
so one of the things we suspect is that

2559
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:12,238
the very early universe was essentially

2560
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:13,198
infinite dimensional and that as the

2561
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:16,638
universe

2562
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:18,638
expanded it became lower dimensional and

2563
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:20,560
so one of the things that is another

2564
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:22,239
little sort of point where we we think

2565
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,679
there might be a way to to actually

2566
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:25,759
measure some things is dimension

2567
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:27,760
fluctuations in the early universe that

2568
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,320
is is there a is there leftover

2569
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:32,320
dimension fluctuation of at the time of

2570
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:33,359
the cosmic microwave background 100 000

2571
01:28:32,319 --> 01:28:35,359
years or something after the beginning

2572
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:37,119
of the universe is it still the case

2573
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:39,519
that there are there were pieces of the

2574
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:42,238
universe that didn't have dimension 3

2575
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:44,239
that had dimension 3.01 or something and

2576
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:45,439
can we tell that is that possible to

2577
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:46,799
observe

2578
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:49,279
uh

2579
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:52,239
the fluctuations in dimensions i don't

2580
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:53,599
even know what that entails okay so the

2581
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:55,198
the question

2582
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:58,560
which should be an elementary exercise

2583
01:28:55,198 --> 01:29:00,319
in electrodynamics except it isn't is um

2584
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,159
understanding what happens to a photon

2585
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:03,599
when it propagates through 3.01

2586
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:05,920
dimensional space

2587
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,480
so for example the inverse square law is

2588
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:11,199
a consequence of the you know the the

2589
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:12,638
surface area of a sphere is proportional

2590
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:14,799
to r squared

2591
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:17,600
but if you're not in three dimensional

2592
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:19,520
space the surface area of sphere is not

2593
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:22,639
proportional to r squared it's r to the

2594
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,880
whatever 2.01 or something

2595
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:28,159
and so that means that

2596
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:30,079
i think when you kind try and do optics

2597
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:32,158
you know a common principle in optics is

2598
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:34,800
huygens principle which basically says

2599
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:35,439
that every piece of a wavefront of a of

2600
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,800
a

2601
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:40,719
of light is a source of new spherical

2602
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,159
waves and those spherical waves if

2603
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:45,198
they're different dimensional spherical

2604
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:47,359
waves will have other characteristics

2605
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:49,519
and so there will be bizarre optical

2606
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:52,158
phenomena which we haven't figured out

2607
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:54,239
yet um so you're you're you're what

2608
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:56,079
looking for some weird photon

2609
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:58,638
trajectories

2610
01:29:56,079 --> 01:30:00,559
that designate that it's 3.01

2611
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,560
dimensional space yeah

2612
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,840
yeah that would be an example of i mean

2613
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,039
you know there are there are only a

2614
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,960
certain number of things we can measure

2615
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:08,479
about photons you know we can measure

2616
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:11,039
their polarization we can measure their

2617
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:13,519
frequency we can measure their direction

2618
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:15,439
um those kinds of things and you know

2619
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,920
how that all works out

2620
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:20,719
and you know in the current models of

2621
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,480
physics uh you know it's been hard to

2622
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,560
explain how the universe manages to be

2623
01:30:22,479 --> 01:30:27,759
as uniform as it is and that's led to

2624
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,880
this inflation idea that um to the to

2625
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,039
the great annoyance of my then

2626
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,520
collaborator i we had we figured out in

2627
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:35,198
like 1979 we had this realization that

2628
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,880
that you could get something like this

2629
01:30:35,198 --> 01:30:38,238
but it seemed implausible that that's

2630
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,600
the way the universe worked so we put in

2631
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:43,359
a footnote and that was uh so that's a

2632
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,760
but but any case i i've never really

2633
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:47,839
completely believed it but this that's

2634
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,840
an idea for how to sort of puff out the

2635
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:51,679
universe faster than the speed of light

2636
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:54,079
early moments of the universe that

2637
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:56,639
that's the sort of inflation idea and

2638
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:58,880
that you can somehow explain how the

2639
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:02,079
universe manages to be as uniform as it

2640
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:04,159
is in in our model this turns out to be

2641
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:05,519
much more natural because the universe

2642
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:07,039
just starts very connected the

2643
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,199
hypergraph is not

2644
01:31:07,039 --> 01:31:11,198
such that the ball that you grow

2645
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:14,238
starting from single point has volume r

2646
01:31:11,198 --> 01:31:17,519
cubed it might have volume r to the 500

2647
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:19,439
or r to the infinity um and so that

2648
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:20,960
means that you you sort of naturally get

2649
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:22,960
this much higher degree of connectivity

2650
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,439
and uniformity in the universe and then

2651
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:27,760
the question is uh this is sort of the

2652
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:29,439
mathematical physics challenge is in the

2653
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,520
standard theory of the universe there's

2654
01:31:29,439 --> 01:31:33,119
the friedman robertson walker universe

2655
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,639
which is the kind of standard model

2656
01:31:33,119 --> 01:31:36,960
where the universe is isotropic and

2657
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,719
homogeneous and you can then work out

2658
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,000
the equations of general relativity and

2659
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:41,119
you can figure out how the universe

2660
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,399
expands

2661
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:44,559
we would like to do the same kind of

2662
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:46,079
thing including dimension change

2663
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,800
this is just difficult mathematical

2664
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:50,319
physics i mean the reason it's difficult

2665
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,079
is there's sort of fundamental reason

2666
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:54,639
it's difficult when when people invented

2667
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:56,559
calculus 300 years ago calculus was a

2668
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:59,119
story of understanding

2669
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:01,280
change and change as a function of a

2670
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:03,198
variable so people study univariate

2671
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:04,880
calculus they study multivariate

2672
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:07,279
calculus it's one variable it's two

2673
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:10,800
variables three variables but whoever

2674
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:13,599
studied you know 2.5 variable calculus

2675
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:16,320
turns out nobody turns out that but what

2676
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,800
we need to have to understand these

2677
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:21,279
fractional dimensional spaces uh which

2678
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:23,279
don't work like well they're

2679
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:26,238
they're spaces where where the effective

2680
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:29,039
dimension is not an integer so you can't

2681
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:31,919
apply the tools of calculus in naturally

2682
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:33,519
and easily to fractional dimensions no

2683
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,440
so somebody has to figure out how to do

2684
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,600
that yeah we're trying to figure this

2685
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:39,839
out i mean it's it's very interesting

2686
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,120
it's very connected to very frontier

2687
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,239
issues in mathematics it's very

2688
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:46,319
beautiful but so is it possible is it

2689
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:49,039
possible we're dealing with a scale

2690
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:50,399
that's so so much smaller than our human

2691
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:52,238
scale

2692
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:55,279
is it possible to make predictions

2693
01:32:52,238 --> 01:32:57,678
versus explanations do you have a hope

2694
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:59,759
that with this hypograph model you'll be

2695
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:00,560
able to make predictions yeah

2696
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,119
that

2697
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,360
that could be validated with a physics

2698
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:07,599
experiment predictions that couldn't

2699
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:09,359
have been done or weren't done otherwise

2700
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,199
oh yeah yeah i mean you know i think

2701
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:12,960
which in which domain do you think okay

2702
01:33:11,198 --> 01:33:14,399
so they're going to be cosmology ones to

2703
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,158
do with dimension fluctuations in the

2704
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:17,759
universe that's a very bizarre effect

2705
01:33:16,158 --> 01:33:19,359
nobody you know dimension fluctuation is

2706
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,639
just something nobody ever looked for

2707
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:23,759
that if anybody sees dimension

2708
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:26,560
fluctuation that's a huge flag that

2709
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:28,800
something like our model is going on if

2710
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,560
and and how one detects that you know

2711
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:32,239
that's a problem of kind of you know

2712
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,760
that's a problem of traditional physics

2713
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:34,638
in a sense of what's the best way to

2714
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:36,639
actually

2715
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:39,279
figure that out and and for example that

2716
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:40,639
that's one there are there are all kinds

2717
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:43,519
of things one can imagine i mean there

2718
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:46,719
are things that um uh in black hole

2719
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:48,560
mergers it's possible that there will be

2720
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:50,960
effects of maximum entanglement speed

2721
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:53,280
and large black hole mergers um that's

2722
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:55,439
another another possible thing and all

2723
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:57,039
of that is detected through like what do

2724
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:59,678
you have a hope for ligo type of

2725
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:02,719
situation like gravitational waves yeah

2726
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:03,440
or alternatively i mean i think it's you

2727
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:06,560
know

2728
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:08,719
look figuring out experiments is like

2729
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,639
figuring out technology inventions right

2730
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,639
that is you know you've got a set of raw

2731
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:14,560
materials you've got an underlying model

2732
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:16,319
and now you've got to be very clever to

2733
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:18,800
figure out you know what is that thing i

2734
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:21,920
can measure that just somehow you know

2735
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,600
leverages in to the right place and

2736
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,840
we've spent less effort on that than i

2737
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,520
would have liked because i one of the

2738
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,840
one of the reasons is that that i think

2739
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:31,840
that the the this you know the

2740
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:34,159
physicists who've been working on on our

2741
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:35,600
models we've with now lots of physicists

2742
01:34:34,158 --> 01:34:36,479
actually it's very very nice it's kind

2743
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:39,039
of uh

2744
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:41,359
it's one of these cases where i'm almost

2745
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:42,560
i'm really kind of pleasantly surprised

2746
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:45,279
that the sort of absorption of the

2747
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:48,000
things we've done has been uh quite

2748
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:50,158
rapid and quite uh sort of you know very

2749
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,399
positive so it's a cambrian explosion of

2750
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:54,479
physicists too not just ideas

2751
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:56,638
yes i mean you know a lot of what's

2752
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:58,799
happened that's really interesting and

2753
01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:01,600
again not what i expected is there are a

2754
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:03,279
lot of areas of of sort of very uh

2755
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,239
elaborate sophisticated mathematical

2756
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:06,079
physics

2757
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:08,319
whether that's causal set theory whether

2758
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:10,079
it's higher category theory whether it's

2759
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:12,399
categorical quantum mechanics all sorts

2760
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:16,079
of elaborate names for these things spin

2761
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:17,759
networks perhaps uh you know causal

2762
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:20,238
dynamical triangulations all kinds of

2763
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,000
names of these fields and these fields

2764
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:23,678
have a bunch of good mathematical

2765
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,158
physicists in them who've been working

2766
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:28,719
for decades in these particular areas

2767
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:30,638
and the question is but but they've been

2768
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,920
building these mathematical structures

2769
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:33,440
and the mathematical structures are

2770
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:35,440
interesting but they're not they don't

2771
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:37,359
typically sit on anything they're just

2772
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:39,359
mathematical structures and i think

2773
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:41,839
what's happened is our models provide

2774
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:43,920
kind of a machine code that lives

2775
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:47,199
underneath those models so a typical

2776
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:49,118
example this is uh uh due to jonathan

2777
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:51,839
gorad who's one of the key people who's

2778
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:54,559
been working on our project um this is

2779
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:55,840
uh in okay so i'll give you an example

2780
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,560
just to give a sense of how these things

2781
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:01,119
connect this is in causal set theory so

2782
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,679
the idea of causal set theory is

2783
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:05,599
there are in space-time we imagine that

2784
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:08,480
there's space and time it's a three plus

2785
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:11,440
one-dimensional you know set up we

2786
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:13,919
imagine that there are just events that

2787
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:15,359
happen at different times and places in

2788
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,359
space and time

2789
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:19,519
and the idea of causal set theory is the

2790
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:21,359
only thing you say about the universe is

2791
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:23,040
there are a bunch of events that happen

2792
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:25,439
sort of randomly at different places in

2793
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:27,198
space and time and then the whole sort

2794
01:36:25,439 --> 01:36:29,599
of theory of physics has to be to do

2795
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:32,158
with this this graph of causal

2796
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:34,000
relationships between these randomly

2797
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:36,079
thrown down events

2798
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,079
so they've always been confused by the

2799
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:39,920
fact that to get even lorentz and

2800
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:41,760
variance even relativistic and variants

2801
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:43,840
you need a very special way to throw

2802
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,520
down those events and they've had no

2803
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:46,319
natural way to understand how that would

2804
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,880
happen

2805
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,559
so what jonathan figured out is that in

2806
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:53,118
fact from our models

2807
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:56,080
they instead of just

2808
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:58,000
generating events at random our models

2809
01:36:56,079 --> 01:37:01,198
necessarily generate events in some

2810
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,880
pattern in space-time effectively that

2811
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:04,158
then leads to ransom variants and

2812
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,159
relativistic invariants and all those

2813
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:07,839
kinds of things so it's a place where

2814
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:09,519
all the mathematics that's been done on

2815
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,279
well we just have a random collection of

2816
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:13,600
events now what you know what

2817
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:15,759
consequences does that have in terms of

2818
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:18,000
causal set theory and so on that can all

2819
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,320
be kind of wheeled in now that we have

2820
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,639
some different underlying foundational

2821
01:37:20,319 --> 01:37:24,319
idea for what what the particular

2822
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:26,480
distribution of events is as opposed to

2823
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:28,399
just we throw down random events

2824
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:30,238
and so that's a that's a typical sort of

2825
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:32,719
example of what we're seeing in all

2826
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:34,559
these different areas of kind of how you

2827
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:35,279
can take you know really interesting

2828
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,280
things that have been done in

2829
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:39,118
mathematical physics and connect them

2830
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:41,759
and it's really kind of beautiful

2831
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:44,079
because the the you know the sort of the

2832
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,159
abstract models we have just seem to

2833
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:48,639
plug into all these different very

2834
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:51,039
interesting very elegant abstract ideas

2835
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:52,639
but we're now giving sort of a reason

2836
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:55,118
for that to be the way

2837
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:56,480
for for a reason for one to care i mean

2838
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:58,479
it's like saying

2839
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:00,879
uh you can you know you can think about

2840
01:37:58,479 --> 01:38:02,399
computation abstractly you know you can

2841
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:04,000
think about i don't know combinators or

2842
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:06,158
something as abstract computational

2843
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,319
things and you can sort of do all kinds

2844
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:10,399
of study of them but it's like why do we

2845
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:11,679
care well okay turing machines are a

2846
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:13,279
good start because you can kind of see

2847
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:14,639
they're sort of mechanically doing

2848
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:16,639
things but when we actually start

2849
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:18,560
thinking about computers computing

2850
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:20,800
things we have a really good reason to

2851
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,639
care and this is sort of what we're what

2852
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,320
we're providing i think is a reason to

2853
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:25,760
care about a lot of these areas of

2854
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:28,079
mathematical physics so that's been

2855
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:30,719
that's been very nice so i'm not sure

2856
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:33,118
we've ever got to the

2857
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:35,359
the question of why does the university

2858
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:37,599
let's let's let's talk about that yes so

2859
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:40,399
we're it's not the simplest question in

2860
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:42,480
the world so um so it's it takes a few

2861
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:44,879
steps to get to it and it's nevertheless

2862
01:38:42,479 --> 01:38:46,638
even surprisingly you can even begin to

2863
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:49,600
answer this question indeed as you were

2864
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:51,039
saying i'm very surprised

2865
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,880
so

2866
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:55,039
the next thing to perhaps understand is

2867
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:57,440
this idea of rulial space

2868
01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:59,600
so we've got kind of physical space

2869
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:01,759
we've got branchial space the space of

2870
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:04,480
possible quantum histories and now we've

2871
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,320
got another level of kind of abstraction

2872
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:08,158
which is real space and here's the

2873
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:11,359
here's where that comes from

2874
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:13,439
so you say okay you say we've got this

2875
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:15,920
model for the universe we've got

2876
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:18,079
a particular rule and we run this rule

2877
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:20,880
and we get the universe okay so that's

2878
01:39:18,079 --> 01:39:22,079
that's interesting why that rule why not

2879
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,400
another rule

2880
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:26,559
and so that confused me for a long time

2881
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:27,759
then i realized well actually

2882
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,600
what if

2883
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:32,239
the thing could be using all possible

2884
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:35,119
rules what if at every step in addition

2885
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:37,678
to saying apply a particular rule at all

2886
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:39,679
places in this hyper graph one could say

2887
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:41,279
just take all possible rules and apply

2888
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,039
all possible rules at all possible

2889
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:45,039
places in this hypergraph

2890
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:47,760
okay and then you make this rulial

2891
01:39:45,039 --> 01:39:49,760
multi-way graph which both is all

2892
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:52,000
possible histories for a particular rule

2893
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:53,840
and all possible rules so the next thing

2894
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,840
you'd say is how can you get anything

2895
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,800
reasonable how can anything you know

2896
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:01,119
real come out of the set of all possible

2897
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:03,199
rules applied in all possible ways okay

2898
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:05,039
there's a subtle thing so which i

2899
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:07,839
haven't fully untangled

2900
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:10,238
the there is this object which is the

2901
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:12,159
result of running all possible rules in

2902
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:13,439
all possible ways and you might say if

2903
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:15,679
you're running all possible rules why

2904
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:18,079
can't everything possible happen

2905
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:20,158
well the answer is because

2906
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:23,198
when you there's sort of this

2907
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:25,279
entanglement that occurs so let's say

2908
01:40:23,198 --> 01:40:27,039
that you have a lot of different

2909
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:28,960
possible initial conditions a lot of

2910
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:30,719
different possible states then you're

2911
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:33,279
applying these different rules

2912
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:35,520
well some of those rules can end up with

2913
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:36,639
the same state so it isn't the case that

2914
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:38,560
you can just get from anywhere to

2915
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:41,118
anywhere there's this whole entangled

2916
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,320
structure of what can lead to what and

2917
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:43,439
there's a definite structure that's

2918
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:44,719
produced

2919
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:48,079
i think i'm going to call that definite

2920
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:50,239
structure the ruliad the limit of um

2921
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:52,079
the limits of kind of uh all possible

2922
01:40:50,238 --> 01:40:53,279
rules being applied in all possible ways

2923
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:54,479
and you're saying that structure is

2924
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:56,559
finite

2925
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:58,399
so that somehow connects to maybe a

2926
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:00,960
similar kind of thing as like causal

2927
01:40:58,399 --> 01:41:02,879
invariance well there happens

2928
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,800
necessarily has causal invariance that's

2929
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,880
a feature of that's just a mathematical

2930
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:09,199
consequence of essentially using all

2931
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:11,679
possible rules plus universal

2932
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:14,158
computation gives you the fact that from

2933
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:15,760
any diverging paths you can always the

2934
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:17,920
the paths will always convert does that

2935
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:20,480
say that the rule does that necessarily

2936
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:21,760
infer that the ruliad is

2937
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:23,919
finite

2938
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:26,480
in the end it's not necessarily finite i

2939
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:28,079
mean it's it's a it's a the the just

2940
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:29,678
like the history of the universe may not

2941
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:31,920
be finite the history of the universe

2942
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:34,000
time may keep going forever you can keep

2943
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,520
running the computations of the ruliad

2944
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
and you'll keep spewing out more and

2945
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:39,679
more and more structure it's like time

2946
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,118
doesn't have to end

2947
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:43,359
it's it's um

2948
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:44,880
that but the the issue is there are

2949
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:46,479
there are three limits that happen in

2950
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,560
this ruliad object

2951
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:51,198
one is how long you run the computation

2952
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:53,360
for another is how many different rules

2953
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:55,359
you're applying and another is how many

2954
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:57,359
different states you start from

2955
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:59,279
and the mixture of those three limits i

2956
01:41:57,359 --> 01:42:02,079
mean this is just mathematically a

2957
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:04,399
horrendous object okay and what's what's

2958
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:05,679
interesting about this object is the one

2959
01:42:04,399 --> 01:42:07,519
thing that does seem to be the case

2960
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:09,600
about this object is it connects with

2961
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,679
ideas in higher category theory and in

2962
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:14,560
particular it connects to some of the

2963
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:16,880
20th century's most abstract mathematics

2964
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:18,080
done by this chap growth indeek

2965
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,319
growth and leak had a thing called the

2966
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:22,960
infinity group void which is closely

2967
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:25,439
related to this roulette object

2968
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:28,719
although the details of the relationship

2969
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:31,039
uh you know i don't fully understand yet

2970
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,399
um but i think that the what's what's

2971
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:34,960
interesting is this thing that is sort

2972
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:36,879
of this very limiting object so so okay

2973
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,520
so a way to think about this that that

2974
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,039
again will will take us into another

2975
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:43,360
direction which is the equivalence

2976
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:45,439
between physics and mathematics

2977
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:48,479
the way that uh

2978
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:50,638
well let's see uh maybe this is um just

2979
01:42:48,479 --> 01:42:52,238
to give a sense of this kind of um

2980
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:54,079
groupoid and things like that you can

2981
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:56,238
think about in mathematics you can think

2982
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:59,760
you have certain axioms they're kind of

2983
01:42:56,238 --> 01:43:00,718
like atoms and you well actually let's

2984
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,000
say

2985
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,760
let's talk about mathematics for a

2986
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,238
second so what is mathematics what do

2987
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:07,600
what is what is it made of so to speak

2988
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:09,599
mathematics there's a bunch of

2989
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,920
statements like uh

2990
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:14,239
for addition x plus y is equal to y plus

2991
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:15,920
x that's a statement of mathematics

2992
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:17,678
another statement will be you know x

2993
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:20,158
squared minus one is equal to x plus one

2994
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:21,920
x minus one there are infinite number of

2995
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:23,439
these possible statements of mathematics

2996
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:25,840
well it's not i mean it's not just i

2997
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:28,479
guess a statement but with x plus y it's

2998
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:30,960
uh it's a rule the you can it's a i mean

2999
01:43:28,479 --> 01:43:34,158
you think of it as a rule it's it's a it

3000
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:36,719
is a it is a rule it's also just a thing

3001
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:38,799
that is true in mathematics right um the

3002
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:40,480
statement of truth okay right and and

3003
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:43,039
what you can imagine is you you you

3004
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:46,079
imagine just laying out this giant kind

3005
01:43:43,039 --> 01:43:48,000
of ocean of all all statements well

3006
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:48,880
actually you first start okay this is

3007
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,238
where

3008
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,600
this was segwaying into a different

3009
01:43:50,238 --> 01:43:53,039
thing let me let me not go in this

3010
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,880
direction for a second let's not go to

3011
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:57,118
meta mathematics just yet yeah we'll

3012
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,760
we'll maybe get to meta mathematics but

3013
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:01,359
it's it's um uh so let me not let me

3014
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,679
explain the groupoid and things later

3015
01:44:01,359 --> 01:44:06,639
yes yeah but but so let's come back to

3016
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:08,960
the universe um always a good place to

3017
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:10,800
be in so yeah so what does the universe

3018
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:13,920
have to do with the rouley ad the rulio

3019
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:16,719
space and how that's possible

3020
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:19,359
lee connected to why the thing exists at

3021
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:21,679
all and why there's just one of them yes

3022
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:24,238
okay so here's the point so the thing

3023
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:26,239
that had confused me for a long time was

3024
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:27,839
let's say we get the rule for the

3025
01:44:26,238 --> 01:44:30,000
universe we hold it in our hand we say

3026
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:32,319
this is our universe then the immediate

3027
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,560
question is well why isn't another one

3028
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:36,799
and you know that's kind of the you know

3029
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:40,000
the the sort of the lesson of copernicus

3030
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:43,840
is we're not very special so how come we

3031
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:46,079
got universe number 312 and not universe

3032
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:47,760
quadrillion quadrillion quadrillion and

3033
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:49,519
i think the resolution of that is the

3034
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:52,320
realization that

3035
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,760
there that the universe is running all

3036
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:57,439
possible rules

3037
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:58,960
so then you say well how on earth do we

3038
01:44:57,439 --> 01:45:01,039
perceive the universe to be running

3039
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:02,639
according to a particular rule how do we

3040
01:45:01,039 --> 01:45:03,920
perceive definite things happening in

3041
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:07,039
the universe well

3042
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,880
it's the same story it's the observer

3043
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:11,198
there is a reference frame that we are

3044
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:13,520
picking in this rule space

3045
01:45:11,198 --> 01:45:15,359
and that that is what determines our

3046
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:18,000
perception of the universe with our

3047
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:20,238
particular sensory information and so on

3048
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,479
we are parsing the universe in this

3049
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:24,799
particular way so here's the way to

3050
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:26,238
think about it in in in physical space

3051
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,400
we live in a particular place in the

3052
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:30,799
universe and you know we could live in

3053
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:32,319
alpha centauri but we don't we live here

3054
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,400
um and

3055
01:45:32,319 --> 01:45:36,559
similarly in rural space

3056
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:38,479
we could live in many different places

3057
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:40,320
in rural space but we happen to live

3058
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:43,039
here and what does it mean to live here

3059
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:44,639
it means we have certain sensory input

3060
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:45,760
we have certain ways to parse the

3061
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:47,840
universe

3062
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:50,079
those are our interpretation of the

3063
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:51,440
universe what would it mean to travel in

3064
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:53,039
rule space

3065
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:55,439
what it basically means is that we are

3066
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,198
successively interpreting the universe

3067
01:45:55,439 --> 01:45:59,759
in different ways so in other words to

3068
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:01,678
be at a different point in rule space is

3069
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,280
to have a different in a sense a

3070
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:06,000
different interpretation of what's going

3071
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:07,599
on in the universe and we can imagine

3072
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,840
even things like an analog of the speed

3073
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:12,400
of light as the maximum speed of

3074
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:14,079
translation in real space and so on

3075
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:15,759
so wait what's the

3076
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:17,600
interpretation

3077
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:19,840
so real space

3078
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:22,560
and we is i'm confused by the we and the

3079
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:25,039
interpretation and the universe i

3080
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:28,320
thought moving about in real space

3081
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:29,439
changes the way the universe

3082
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:30,479
is

3083
01:46:29,439 --> 01:46:32,479
is

3084
01:46:30,479 --> 01:46:34,479
the the way we would perceive it the way

3085
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:37,839
that so this ultimately has to do with

3086
01:46:34,479 --> 01:46:39,759
the perception so it doesn't real real

3087
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:41,679
space is not

3088
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,400
somehow changing

3089
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:43,279
like

3090
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:44,879
uh

3091
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:46,639
branching into another universe

3092
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,239
something like that no i mean

3093
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:50,319
the point is that the whole point of

3094
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:51,359
this is the rouliad is

3095
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:54,399
sort of

3096
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:55,920
the encapsulated version of everything

3097
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:58,638
that is the universe running according

3098
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:01,279
to all possible yeah we think of uh our

3099
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:02,960
universe the observable universe

3100
01:47:01,279 --> 01:47:04,559
as its

3101
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:07,118
thing so we're a little bit loose with

3102
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,480
the word universe then because wouldn't

3103
01:47:07,118 --> 01:47:10,719
the ruley ad

3104
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:13,678
potentially encapsulate

3105
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:15,439
a very large number like combinatorially

3106
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:17,359
large maybe infinite

3107
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:20,238
set of what we

3108
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:21,759
human physicists think of as universes

3109
01:47:20,238 --> 01:47:23,839
that's an interesting interesting

3110
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:26,159
parsing of the word universe right

3111
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:27,520
because what we're saying is just as

3112
01:47:26,158 --> 01:47:28,879
we're at a particular place in physical

3113
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,560
space we're at a particular place in

3114
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:32,719
rural space

3115
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:34,560
at that particular place in rural space

3116
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:36,239
our experience of the universe is this

3117
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:37,600
yeah just as if we lived at the center

3118
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:38,718
of the galaxy our universe our

3119
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,480
experience of the universe will be

3120
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:43,198
different from the when it is given

3121
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:45,519
where we actually live and so in us what

3122
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:47,919
we're saying is our

3123
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,840
when you might say i mean in a sense

3124
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:52,480
this this ruliad is sort of a super

3125
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:54,319
universe so to speak um but it's all

3126
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:57,039
entangled together it's not like you can

3127
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:58,960
separate out you can say let me

3128
01:47:57,039 --> 01:48:00,560
it's it's like when we take a reference

3129
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:02,239
okay it's like our experience of the

3130
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,360
universe is based on where we are in the

3131
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:04,959
universe

3132
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:06,319
we could imagine moving to somewhere

3133
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:08,000
else in the universe but it's still the

3134
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:10,399
same universe so there's not like

3135
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,238
universes

3136
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:13,599
existing in parallel

3137
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:15,039
no

3138
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,119
because because

3139
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:19,198
and the whole point is that if we were

3140
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:20,639
able to change our interpretation of

3141
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:23,839
what's going on

3142
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:25,760
we could perceive a different reference

3143
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:26,480
frame in this roulette yeah but that's

3144
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,119
not

3145
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:31,359
that's not uh that's just yeah that's

3146
01:48:29,118 --> 01:48:34,079
the same rule yeah that's the same

3147
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:36,399
universe you're just moving about this

3148
01:48:34,079 --> 01:48:38,719
is just coordinates right so so the way

3149
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:40,238
that's the reason that's interesting is

3150
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:42,079
imagine the extraterrestrial

3151
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:43,439
intelligence so the alien intelligence

3152
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:46,000
we should say

3153
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:48,399
the alien intelligence might live on

3154
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,560
alpha centauri but it might also live at

3155
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:52,238
a different place in rural space it can

3156
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,080
live right here on earth it just has a

3157
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,559
different reference frame that

3158
01:48:54,079 --> 01:48:59,198
includes a very different perception of

3159
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:02,000
the universe right and then because that

3160
01:48:59,198 --> 01:49:03,759
really all space is very large

3161
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,840
i mean

3162
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:08,960
do we get to communicate with them right

3163
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:10,880
that's yeah but it's also well one uh

3164
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:13,279
thing is how

3165
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:15,279
different the perception

3166
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:17,559
of the universe could be i think it

3167
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:20,079
could be bizarrely

3168
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:23,039
unimaginably completely different and i

3169
01:49:20,079 --> 01:49:25,198
mean one thing to realize is even in

3170
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:27,118
kind of things i don't understand well

3171
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:29,279
you know i'm i i know about the kind of

3172
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:31,118
western tradition of understanding you

3173
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:32,960
know science and all that kind of thing

3174
01:49:31,118 --> 01:49:36,559
and you know you talk to people who say

3175
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:38,719
well i you know i'm really into some you

3176
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:40,560
know eastern tradition of this that and

3177
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:42,399
the other and it's really obvious to me

3178
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:44,159
what how things work

3179
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:46,879
i don't understand it at all

3180
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:48,319
but you know it is not obvious i think

3181
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,560
with this kind of realization that

3182
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:51,840
there's these very different ways to

3183
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,000
interpret what's going on in the

3184
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,599
universe that kind of gives me at least

3185
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,599
it doesn't help me to understand that

3186
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:59,440
different interpretation but it gives me

3187
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:00,719
at least more respect for the

3188
01:49:59,439 --> 01:50:02,960
possibility that there will be other

3189
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:05,118
interpretations yeah it humbles you to

3190
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:08,079
the possibility that like what is it

3191
01:50:05,118 --> 01:50:10,000
reincarnation or all all these like uh

3192
01:50:08,079 --> 01:50:11,760
eternal recurrence with nietzsche like

3193
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,639
just these ideas

3194
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:14,079
yeah

3195
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:15,599
well you know the thing that i realized

3196
01:50:14,079 --> 01:50:16,960
about a bunch of those things is that

3197
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:18,400
you know i've been sort of doing my

3198
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,319
little survey of the history of

3199
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:22,079
philosophy just trying to understand you

3200
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:23,759
know what what can i actually say now

3201
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:25,519
about some of these things and you

3202
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:27,679
realize that some of these concepts like

3203
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:29,599
the immortal soul concept

3204
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:32,319
which you know i remember when i was a

3205
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:34,639
kid and you know it was kind of a lots

3206
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:36,158
of religion bashing type stuff of people

3207
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:38,639
saying you know what we know about

3208
01:50:36,158 --> 01:50:39,839
physics tell us how much does a soul

3209
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:42,560
weigh

3210
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:44,719
and people are like well how can it be a

3211
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:46,880
thing if it doesn't weigh anything

3212
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:48,719
well now we understand you know there is

3213
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:50,480
this notion of what's in brains that

3214
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:52,719
isn't the matter of brains and it's

3215
01:50:50,479 --> 01:50:55,039
something computational and there is a

3216
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:56,800
sense and in fact it is correct that it

3217
01:50:55,039 --> 01:50:58,800
is in some sense immortal because this

3218
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,960
pattern of computation is something

3219
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:03,840
abstract that is not specific to the

3220
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:06,000
particular material of a brain now we

3221
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:08,800
don't know how to extract it you know in

3222
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,639
our traditional scientific approach but

3223
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,039
it's still something where it isn't a

3224
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:14,960
crazy thing to say there is something it

3225
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:17,519
doesn't weigh anything that's a kind of

3226
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:19,599
a silly question how much does it weigh

3227
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:21,280
um well actually maybe it isn't such a

3228
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:23,199
silly question in our model of physics

3229
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:25,759
because the actual computational

3230
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:27,039
activity has has a consequence for

3231
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,639
gravity and things but that's a very

3232
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:30,639
very subtle because if we start talking

3233
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:32,960
about mass and energy and so on there

3234
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:35,118
could be a uh what would you call a

3235
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:37,359
solatron

3236
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:39,839
yes yes yes a particle

3237
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:41,839
that somehow contains soulness yeah

3238
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:44,159
right well that's what by the way that's

3239
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:45,920
what leibniz said and you know one thing

3240
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:47,598
i've i've never understood this you know

3241
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,679
leibniz had the center of monads and

3242
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:51,440
monadolology and he had this idea that

3243
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:53,840
that what exists in the universe is this

3244
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:55,839
big collection of monads and that they

3245
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:57,599
that the only thing that one knows about

3246
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:59,279
the monads is sort of how they relate to

3247
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:02,239
each other which sounds awfully like

3248
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:04,639
hypographs right but leibniz had really

3249
01:52:02,238 --> 01:52:07,198
lost me at the following thing he said

3250
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:09,118
each of these monads has a soul and each

3251
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:10,638
of them has a consciousness

3252
01:52:09,118 --> 01:52:12,319
and it's like okay i'm out of here i

3253
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,520
don't understand this at all i don't

3254
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:17,039
know what's going on but i realized

3255
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:19,679
recently that in his day the concept

3256
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:22,000
that a thing could do something could

3257
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:23,840
spontaneously do something that was his

3258
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,920
only way of describing that

3259
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:29,199
and so what i would now say is well as

3260
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:31,760
this abstract rule that runs to leibniz

3261
01:52:29,198 --> 01:52:33,519
that would have been you know in 1690 or

3262
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:35,119
whatever that would have been kind of

3263
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:37,679
well it has a soul it has a

3264
01:52:35,118 --> 01:52:38,960
consciousness um and so you know in a

3265
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:40,800
sense it's it's like one of these

3266
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:42,800
there's no new idea under the sun so to

3267
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,480
speak that's you know that's a sort of a

3268
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:47,520
version of of the same kinds of ideas

3269
01:52:44,479 --> 01:52:48,959
but couched in terms that are sort of

3270
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,199
bizarrely different from the ones that

3271
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:53,679
we would use today would you be able to

3272
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:56,319
maybe play devil's advocate on the your

3273
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:58,079
conception of consciousness that uh like

3274
01:52:56,319 --> 01:53:00,000
the the two characteristics of it that

3275
01:52:58,079 --> 01:53:02,559
is constrained and there's a

3276
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,840
single thread of time is it possible the

3277
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:09,039
liveness was onto something that

3278
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:11,199
the the basic atom the screw atom of

3279
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:13,920
space has a consciousness

3280
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:15,039
is is that uh so these are just words

3281
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,440
right but yeah

3282
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:20,079
what is there is there some sense where

3283
01:53:17,439 --> 01:53:22,319
consciousness is much more fundamental

3284
01:53:20,079 --> 01:53:24,319
than you're making it seem i don't know

3285
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:26,000
i mean that you know i think can you

3286
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:27,359
construct a world in which it is much

3287
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,158
more fundamental

3288
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:30,880
i think that okay so the question would

3289
01:53:30,158 --> 01:53:33,519
be

3290
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:36,319
is there a way to think about kind of uh

3291
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:38,639
if we sort of parse the universe down at

3292
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:40,960
the level of atoms of space or something

3293
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:42,239
could we say well so that's really a

3294
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,760
question of a different point of view a

3295
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:45,678
different place in real space we're

3296
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:48,480
asking you're asking the question could

3297
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:51,520
there be a civilization that exists

3298
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:53,678
could there be sort of uh conscious

3299
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:55,599
entities that exist at the level of

3300
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:57,440
atoms of space and what would that be

3301
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:58,800
like and i think that comes back to this

3302
01:53:57,439 --> 01:54:00,399
question of can we you know what's it

3303
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:03,679
like to be a cellular automaton type

3304
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:06,399
thing um i mean it's it's you know i'm

3305
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:09,039
i'm not yet there i don't know i mean i

3306
01:54:06,399 --> 01:54:10,399
think that the this is a and i don't

3307
01:54:09,039 --> 01:54:13,039
even know

3308
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:15,118
yet quite how to think about this in the

3309
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:17,039
sense that i was considering you know

3310
01:54:15,118 --> 01:54:18,319
i'm i never write fiction but i i

3311
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:20,399
haven't written it since i was like 10

3312
01:54:18,319 --> 01:54:22,238
years old my my fiction i made one

3313
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:23,359
attempt which i sent to some science

3314
01:54:22,238 --> 01:54:25,118
fiction writer friends of mine and they

3315
01:54:23,359 --> 01:54:27,198
told me it was terrible so

3316
01:54:25,118 --> 01:54:28,960
but um this is a long time ago no it was

3317
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:30,559
recently recently they said it was

3318
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:33,198
terrible that'd be interesting to see

3319
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:34,960
you write a short story based on what

3320
01:54:33,198 --> 01:54:37,759
sounds like it's already inspiring short

3321
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:39,760
stories by or stories yeah right science

3322
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:42,239
fiction writers but but i think the the

3323
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:43,920
interesting thing for me is

3324
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:46,158
you know in the what does it what is it

3325
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:47,679
like to be a whatever yeah how do you

3326
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:48,879
describe that i mean it's like that's

3327
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:51,039
not a thing that you describe in

3328
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:53,118
mathematics that what is it like to be

3329
01:54:51,039 --> 01:54:55,118
such and such well see to me

3330
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:56,319
when you say what is it like to be

3331
01:54:55,118 --> 01:54:58,719
something

3332
01:54:56,319 --> 01:55:01,118
presumes that you're talking about

3333
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:01,840
a singular entity

3334
01:55:01,118 --> 01:55:02,719
so

3335
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:06,239
yeah

3336
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:09,118
like there there's a some kind of

3337
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:10,879
feeling of the the entity

3338
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:12,880
the the stuff that's inside of it and

3339
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:14,000
the stuff that's outside of it

3340
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:15,920
and then

3341
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,960
that's when consciousness starts making

3342
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:19,118
sense

3343
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:20,079
but but then um

3344
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:23,839
it seems like that could be

3345
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:26,238
generalizable if you take some subset

3346
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:28,159
of uh a cellular automata you could

3347
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:29,678
start talking about what does that

3348
01:55:28,158 --> 01:55:32,079
subset

3349
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:34,000
maybe a few but then you can i think you

3350
01:55:32,079 --> 01:55:35,920
could just take arbitrary

3351
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:39,359
numbers of subsets like

3352
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:42,079
to me uh uh like you and i

3353
01:55:39,359 --> 01:55:44,000
uh individually are consciousnesses but

3354
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:45,760
you could also say the two of us

3355
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,238
together is a singular consciousness

3356
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:49,679
maybe maybe i'm not so sure about that i

3357
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:51,678
think that the single thread of time

3358
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:53,760
thing may be pretty important and that

3359
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:55,920
as soon as you start saying there are

3360
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:58,000
two different threads of time there are

3361
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:59,520
two different experiences and then we

3362
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,599
have to say how do they relate how are

3363
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:03,360
they sort of entangled with each other i

3364
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:06,000
mean that may be a different story of a

3365
01:56:03,359 --> 01:56:07,839
thing that isn't much like you know the

3366
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,840
the what do the ants you know what's it

3367
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:11,520
like to be an ant you know where there's

3368
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:14,319
a sort of more collective view of the

3369
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:18,000
world so to speak i don't know i think

3370
01:56:14,319 --> 01:56:19,039
that um i mean this is uh uh

3371
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,960
you know

3372
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:23,760
i don't really have a good i mean you

3373
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:25,679
know my best thought is you know can we

3374
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:27,920
turn it into a human story it's like the

3375
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:29,679
question of you know when we try and

3376
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,880
understand physics can we turn that into

3377
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:33,039
something which is sort of a human

3378
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:35,760
understandable narrative and now what's

3379
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:37,359
it like to be a such and such you know

3380
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:39,840
maybe the only medium in which we can

3381
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:41,920
describe that is something like fiction

3382
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:44,319
where it's kind of like you're telling

3383
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:46,960
you know the life story in that in that

3384
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:48,719
uh in that setting but i i'm this is

3385
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:50,319
this is beyond what i've what i've yet

3386
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:53,039
understood how to do yeah but it does

3387
01:56:50,319 --> 01:56:56,238
seem so like with human consciousness

3388
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:58,238
you know we're made up of cells and like

3389
01:56:56,238 --> 01:56:59,759
there's a bunch of systems that are

3390
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:02,959
networked

3391
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:04,560
that work together that at this at the

3392
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:06,239
human level

3393
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:07,599
feel like a singular consciousness when

3394
01:57:06,238 --> 01:57:09,919
you take yes

3395
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:11,440
and so maybe like an ant colony is just

3396
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:13,920
too low level

3397
01:57:11,439 --> 01:57:15,839
sorry an ant is too low level right

3398
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,158
maybe you have to look at the ant colony

3399
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:19,039
yeah i agree like there's some level at

3400
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:20,638
which

3401
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:22,960
it's a conscious being and then if you

3402
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:24,719
go to the planetary scale then maybe

3403
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:27,279
that's going too far so there's a nice

3404
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:28,800
sweet spot yeah right consciousness no i

3405
01:57:27,279 --> 01:57:31,198
mean i agree i think i think the

3406
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,000
difficulty is that

3407
01:57:31,198 --> 01:57:34,479
you know

3408
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,479
okay so in sort of people who talk about

3409
01:57:34,479 --> 01:57:37,598
consciousness yes one of the one of the

3410
01:57:36,479 --> 01:57:39,118
terrible things i've realized because

3411
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:41,039
i've now interacted with with some of

3412
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:43,439
this community so to speak some

3413
01:57:41,039 --> 01:57:45,599
interesting people who do that kind of

3414
01:57:43,439 --> 01:57:46,960
thinking but you know one of the things

3415
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:48,880
i was saying to one of the leading

3416
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:50,319
people in that area i was saying you

3417
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:53,359
know uh

3418
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:54,719
that um you know it must be kind of

3419
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:56,559
frustrating because it's kind of like a

3420
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:58,319
poetry story that is many people are

3421
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:00,159
writing poems but few people are reading

3422
01:57:58,319 --> 01:58:01,759
them yes so there are always these

3423
01:58:00,158 --> 01:58:04,158
different you know everybody has their

3424
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:08,159
own theory of consciousness and they are

3425
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:10,559
very non-inter sort of interdiscussible

3426
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:12,638
and and by the way i mean you know my

3427
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:14,560
own approach to sort of the the question

3428
01:58:12,639 --> 01:58:16,560
of consciousness as far as i'm concerned

3429
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:18,960
i'm an applied consciousness operative

3430
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:20,880
so to speak because i don't really in a

3431
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:23,359
sense the thing i'm trying to get out of

3432
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:25,599
it is how does it help me to understand

3433
01:58:23,359 --> 01:58:28,479
what's a possible theory of physics and

3434
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:30,880
how does it help me to say how do i go

3435
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:32,718
from this this incoherent collection of

3436
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:34,960
things happening in the universe

3437
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:37,198
to our definite perception and definite

3438
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:39,118
laws and so on and sort of an applied

3439
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:40,960
version of consciousness and and i think

3440
01:58:39,118 --> 01:58:42,479
the reason it sort of segues to a

3441
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:44,399
different kind of topic but the reason

3442
01:58:42,479 --> 01:58:45,839
that um uh one of the things i'm

3443
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:48,158
particularly interested in is kind of

3444
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:50,480
what's the analog of consciousness and

3445
01:58:48,158 --> 01:58:52,559
systems very different from brains

3446
01:58:50,479 --> 01:58:54,799
and so why does that matter

3447
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:56,480
well you know this whole description of

3448
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:58,079
this kind of uh

3449
01:58:56,479 --> 01:58:59,519
well i should you know what we haven't

3450
01:58:58,079 --> 01:59:00,960
talked about why the universe exists so

3451
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:03,440
let's let's get to why the universe

3452
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:05,840
exists and then we then we can can talk

3453
01:59:03,439 --> 01:59:08,960
about perhaps a little bit about what

3454
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:10,400
these models of physics kind of show you

3455
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:12,399
about other kinds of things like

3456
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:13,598
molecular computing and so on yes but

3457
01:59:12,399 --> 01:59:15,920
that's okay that's good why does the

3458
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:17,440
universe exist okay so we finally sort

3459
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:20,319
of more or less set the stage we've got

3460
01:59:17,439 --> 01:59:22,079
this idea of this ruliad of this object

3461
01:59:20,319 --> 01:59:24,960
that is made from following all possible

3462
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:26,800
rules the fact that it's sort of not

3463
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:29,439
just this incoherent mess it's got all

3464
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:34,079
this entangled structure in it and so on

3465
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:36,479
okay so what is this ruliad well it is

3466
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:39,198
the working out of all possible formal

3467
01:59:36,479 --> 01:59:41,598
systems so the the sort of the question

3468
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:43,839
of why does the universe exist its core

3469
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:45,599
question which kind of started with is

3470
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:48,639
you've got two plus two equals four

3471
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:51,279
you've got some other abstract results

3472
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:53,359
but that's not actualized it's just an

3473
01:59:51,279 --> 01:59:55,039
abstract thing and when we say we've got

3474
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:56,880
a model for the universe okay it's this

3475
01:59:55,039 --> 01:59:59,279
rule you run it and it'll make the

3476
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:01,359
universe but it's like but but

3477
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:03,439
you know where's it actually running

3478
02:00:01,359 --> 02:00:06,960
what what what is what is it actually

3479
02:00:03,439 --> 02:00:08,719
doing right what is is it actual or is

3480
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:10,399
it merely a formal description of

3481
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:12,480
something okay

3482
02:00:10,399 --> 02:00:15,039
so the thing to realize with this with

3483
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:17,519
this the the thing about the rouliad is

3484
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:20,238
it's an inevitable it is

3485
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:22,719
the entangled running of all possible

3486
02:00:20,238 --> 02:00:25,118
rules so you don't get to say it's not

3487
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:27,359
like you're saying which roulette are

3488
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:30,719
you picking because it's all possible

3489
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:32,960
formal rules it's not like it's just um

3490
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:34,639
you know well actually it's only

3491
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:37,118
footnote the only footnote it's an

3492
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:38,880
important footnote is it's all possible

3493
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:42,079
computational rules

3494
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:44,639
not hyper-computational rules that is

3495
02:00:42,079 --> 02:00:46,479
it's running all the rules

3496
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:48,480
that would be

3497
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:50,638
accessible to a turing machine

3498
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:52,638
but it is not running all the rules that

3499
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:54,800
will be accessible to a thing that can

3500
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:56,400
solve problems in finite time that would

3501
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:58,960
take a turing machine infinite time to

3502
02:00:56,399 --> 02:01:00,879
solve so you can even alan turing knew

3503
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,719
this that you could make oracles for

3504
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:03,920
touring machines where you say a touring

3505
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:05,520
machine can't solve the whole thing

3506
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:07,279
problem for touring machines it can't

3507
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:09,440
know what will happen in any touring

3508
02:01:07,279 --> 02:01:11,920
machine after an infinite time in any

3509
02:01:09,439 --> 02:01:14,158
finite time but you could invent a box

3510
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:16,319
just make a black box you say i'm going

3511
02:01:14,158 --> 02:01:18,000
to sell you an oracle that will just

3512
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:19,279
tell you you know press this button

3513
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,039
it'll tell you what the touring machine

3514
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:23,519
will do after an infinite time you can

3515
02:01:21,039 --> 02:01:24,880
imagine such a box you can't necessarily

3516
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:27,119
build one in the physical universe but

3517
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:29,920
you can imagine such a box and so we

3518
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:33,198
could say well in addition to so in this

3519
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:36,158
ruliad we're imagining that there is a

3520
02:01:33,198 --> 02:01:38,079
computational that at the end it's it's

3521
02:01:36,158 --> 02:01:40,799
running rules that are computational it

3522
02:01:38,079 --> 02:01:44,238
doesn't have a bunch of uh oracle black

3523
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:46,159
boxes in it you say well why not well

3524
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:49,439
turns out if there are oracle black

3525
02:01:46,158 --> 02:01:51,198
boxes the ruliad that is you can make a

3526
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:53,759
sort of super rouliad that contains

3527
02:01:51,198 --> 02:01:55,839
those oracle black boxes but it has a

3528
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:58,000
cosmological event horizon relative to

3529
02:01:55,840 --> 02:02:00,079
the first one they can't communicate

3530
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,319
in other words you can you can end up

3531
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:04,559
with what you end up happening what ends

3532
02:02:02,319 --> 02:02:06,960
up happening is it's it's like in the

3533
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:08,320
physical universe we in this causal

3534
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:10,079
graph that represents the causal

3535
02:02:08,319 --> 02:02:12,319
relationships of different things you

3536
02:02:10,079 --> 02:02:14,719
can have an event horizon where there's

3537
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:17,279
where the causal graph is disconnected

3538
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:19,198
where the effect here an event happening

3539
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:20,880
here does not affect an event happening

3540
02:02:19,198 --> 02:02:22,638
here because there's a disconnection in

3541
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:25,679
the causal graph and that's what happens

3542
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:27,679
at an event horizon and so the what will

3543
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:30,800
happen between this kind of the ordinary

3544
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:34,800
ruliad and the hyper ruliad is there is

3545
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:37,760
an event horizon and you you know we in

3546
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:40,800
our rouliad will just never know

3547
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:43,039
that there is that they're just separate

3548
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:44,880
things they're not they're not connected

3549
02:02:43,039 --> 02:02:47,359
maybe i'm not understanding but just

3550
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:50,319
because we can't observe it

3551
02:02:47,359 --> 02:02:51,598
uh why does that mean it doesn't exist

3552
02:02:50,319 --> 02:02:53,039
um

3553
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,599
it might exist but it does it's not

3554
02:02:53,039 --> 02:02:57,198
clear what it it's so what so to speak

3555
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:58,800
whether it exists i mean you know what

3556
02:02:57,198 --> 02:03:00,638
we're trying to understand is why does

3557
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:02,560
our universe exist

3558
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:05,118
we're not trying to ask the question

3559
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:07,360
what uh you know it's

3560
02:03:05,118 --> 02:03:10,158
let me say another thing let me make a

3561
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:11,679
meta comment okay which is that that i

3562
02:03:10,158 --> 02:03:14,000
have not thought through this hyper

3563
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:17,359
really ad business properly so i'm i'm i

3564
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,840
can't the the the the the the hyper

3565
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:22,079
ruliad is referring to

3566
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:24,880
a ruliad in which hyper computation is

3567
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:27,039
possible that's correct okay so like

3568
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:29,199
what the that footnote

3569
02:03:27,039 --> 02:03:30,560
the footnote to the footnote

3570
02:03:29,198 --> 02:03:32,079
is we're not

3571
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:34,400
sure why

3572
02:03:32,079 --> 02:03:36,800
this is important yeah that's right so

3573
02:03:34,399 --> 02:03:40,238
let's let's ignore that okay it's

3574
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:43,039
already abstract enough okay so so okay

3575
02:03:40,238 --> 02:03:45,439
so the the one question is

3576
02:03:43,039 --> 02:03:47,679
we have to say if we're saying why does

3577
02:03:45,439 --> 02:03:49,279
the universe exist one question is why

3578
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:50,960
is it this universe and not another

3579
02:03:49,279 --> 02:03:52,880
universe yeah okay

3580
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:55,198
so the the important point about this

3581
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:57,679
ruliad idea is that

3582
02:03:55,198 --> 02:04:00,158
it's in the rouliad are all possible

3583
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:02,719
formal systems so there's no choice

3584
02:04:00,158 --> 02:04:04,238
being made there's no there's no like oh

3585
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:06,319
we picked this particular universe and

3586
02:04:04,238 --> 02:04:09,359
not that one that's the first thing the

3587
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:12,399
second thing is the that we have to ask

3588
02:04:09,359 --> 02:04:15,039
the question so so you say why does 2

3589
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:17,359
plus 2 equals 4 exist

3590
02:04:15,039 --> 02:04:19,760
that's not really a that is a thing that

3591
02:04:17,359 --> 02:04:21,439
necessarily is that way

3592
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:24,320
just on the basis of the meaning of the

3593
02:04:21,439 --> 02:04:26,960
terms 2 and plus and equals and so on

3594
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:30,000
right so the thing is that this this

3595
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:32,480
ruliad object is in a sense a necessary

3596
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:35,279
object it is just the thing that is the

3597
02:04:32,479 --> 02:04:37,198
consequence of working out the

3598
02:04:35,279 --> 02:04:39,599
consequence of the formal definition of

3599
02:04:37,198 --> 02:04:42,399
things you don't it is not a thing where

3600
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:44,480
you're saying and this is picked as the

3601
02:04:42,399 --> 02:04:46,399
particular thing this is just something

3602
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:47,118
which necessarily

3603
02:04:46,399 --> 02:04:49,279
is

3604
02:04:47,118 --> 02:04:51,118
that thing because of the definition of

3605
02:04:49,279 --> 02:04:54,479
what it means to have computations is

3606
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:56,799
there really a it's a formal system

3607
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:56,799
yes

3608
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:59,599
but does it exist

3609
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:00,800
ah

3610
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:03,599
well

3611
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:07,679
uh where are we in this whole thing

3612
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:10,560
we are part of this ruliad and so our so

3613
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:13,199
there is no sense to say does two plus

3614
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:16,639
two equals four exist

3615
02:05:13,198 --> 02:05:19,039
well that's that's in some sense it

3616
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:20,800
necessarily exists it's a necessary

3617
02:05:19,039 --> 02:05:22,000
object it's not a thing that where you

3618
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:23,920
can ask

3619
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,679
uh you know it's it's usually in in

3620
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:28,158
philosophy there's a sort of distinction

3621
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:30,480
made between uh you know necessary

3622
02:05:28,158 --> 02:05:32,078
truths contingent truths analytic

3623
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:33,118
propositions synthetic propositions

3624
02:05:32,078 --> 02:05:34,960
there are a variety of different

3625
02:05:33,118 --> 02:05:38,000
versions of this they're things which

3626
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:40,158
are necessarily true just based on the

3627
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,880
definition of terms and there are things

3628
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:44,000
which happen to be true in our universe

3629
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:46,719
but

3630
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,319
we're we don't exist in rural space we

3631
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:50,480
that's one of the coordinates that

3632
02:05:48,319 --> 02:05:51,279
define our existence

3633
02:05:50,479 --> 02:05:54,959
right

3634
02:05:51,279 --> 02:05:57,279
well okay so so yes yes but this ruliad

3635
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:59,920
is the set of all possible rule

3636
02:05:57,279 --> 02:06:02,800
coordinates so what we're saying is it

3637
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:03,840
contains that so what we're saying is we

3638
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:06,079
exist

3639
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:08,159
as okay so our perception of what's

3640
02:06:06,078 --> 02:06:10,479
going on is we're at a particular place

3641
02:06:08,158 --> 02:06:11,920
in this ruling ad and we are concluding

3642
02:06:10,479 --> 02:06:13,598
certain things about how the universe

3643
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:16,960
works based on that

3644
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:17,760
but the question is do we understand you

3645
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:20,560
know

3646
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:23,440
is there something where we say

3647
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:26,159
so so why does it work that way

3648
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:28,479
well the answer is i think it has to

3649
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:29,279
work that way because

3650
02:06:28,479 --> 02:06:31,919
this

3651
02:06:29,279 --> 02:06:34,238
there isn't this ruliad is a necessary

3652
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:36,399
object in the sense that it is a purely

3653
02:06:34,238 --> 02:06:39,759
formal object just like two plus two

3654
02:06:36,399 --> 02:06:41,839
equals four it's not an object that was

3655
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:44,480
made of something it's an object that is

3656
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:46,078
just an expression of the necessary

3657
02:06:44,479 --> 02:06:47,198
collection of formal relations that

3658
02:06:46,078 --> 02:06:48,880
exist

3659
02:06:47,198 --> 02:06:50,078
and so then the issue is

3660
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:52,400
can we

3661
02:06:50,078 --> 02:06:54,719
in our experience of that

3662
02:06:52,399 --> 02:06:56,960
is it you know can we have tables and

3663
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:59,599
chairs so to speak in

3664
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:01,439
that just by virtue of our experience of

3665
02:06:59,599 --> 02:07:03,279
that necessary thing

3666
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:05,439
and you know what people have generally

3667
02:07:03,279 --> 02:07:06,880
thought and honestly that i don't know

3668
02:07:05,439 --> 02:07:08,479
of a lot of

3669
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:11,520
discussion of this why does the universe

3670
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:13,118
exist question it's been a very

3671
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:14,239
you know i've been surprised actually at

3672
02:07:13,118 --> 02:07:15,439
how little

3673
02:07:14,238 --> 02:07:18,319
i mean i think it's one of these things

3674
02:07:15,439 --> 02:07:21,279
that's really uh kind of far out there

3675
02:07:18,319 --> 02:07:23,759
but the thing that that is you know the

3676
02:07:21,279 --> 02:07:26,639
surprise here is that

3677
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:28,480
all possible formal rules when you run

3678
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:30,159
them together and that's the critical

3679
02:07:28,479 --> 02:07:32,879
thing when you run them together they

3680
02:07:30,158 --> 02:07:35,198
produce this kind of entangled structure

3681
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,000
that has a definite structure it's not

3682
02:07:35,198 --> 02:07:38,158
just

3683
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,639
a you know a random arbitrary thing it's

3684
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:43,198
a thing with definite structure and that

3685
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:44,960
structure is the thing when we are

3686
02:07:43,198 --> 02:07:47,519
embedded in that structure when when

3687
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:50,158
anything you know the an entity embedded

3688
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:51,440
in that structure perceives something

3689
02:07:50,158 --> 02:07:53,439
which is

3690
02:07:51,439 --> 02:07:54,399
then we can interpret as physics and

3691
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:55,919
things like this

3692
02:07:54,399 --> 02:07:58,799
so in other words we don't have to ask

3693
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:01,679
the question the the the why does it

3694
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:03,679
exist it necessarily exists i'm missing

3695
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:07,199
this part why does it necessarily exist

3696
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:10,399
okay okay so like you need to have it if

3697
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:12,699
you want to formalize the relation

3698
02:08:10,399 --> 02:08:14,158
between entities but why

3699
02:08:12,699 --> 02:08:16,238
[Music]

3700
02:08:14,158 --> 02:08:19,198
why do you need to have relations okay

3701
02:08:16,238 --> 02:08:22,238
okay so so let's say

3702
02:08:19,198 --> 02:08:23,198
you say um

3703
02:08:22,238 --> 02:08:25,678
well

3704
02:08:23,198 --> 02:08:28,000
it's like why does math have to exist

3705
02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:29,359
okay that's the same question yeah okay

3706
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,238
fair question

3707
02:08:29,359 --> 02:08:32,238
um

3708
02:08:30,238 --> 02:08:33,598
let's see i think the thing to think

3709
02:08:32,238 --> 02:08:35,439
about is

3710
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:36,880
the existence of mathematics is

3711
02:08:35,439 --> 02:08:40,078
something where

3712
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:42,319
given a definition of terms

3713
02:08:40,078 --> 02:08:44,399
what follows from that definition

3714
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:46,078
inevitably follows

3715
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:48,399
so now you can say

3716
02:08:46,078 --> 02:08:51,840
why define any terms

3717
02:08:48,399 --> 02:08:54,078
but in a sense the

3718
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:55,279
well that's okay so the the definition

3719
02:08:54,078 --> 02:08:57,359
of terms

3720
02:08:55,279 --> 02:09:00,158
i mean i think the way to think about

3721
02:08:57,359 --> 02:09:04,039
this let me see so like

3722
02:09:00,158 --> 02:09:04,039
concrete terms

3723
02:09:04,238 --> 02:09:08,799
i mean they're just things like you know

3724
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:08,800
uh

3725
02:09:09,039 --> 02:09:12,639
logical or

3726
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:14,638
right that's a thing

3727
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:16,880
that's a powerful thing well it's a it's

3728
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:18,719
a yes okay but it's it's a

3729
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:21,118
the point is that it is not a thing

3730
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:22,719
about you know people imagine

3731
02:09:21,118 --> 02:09:25,198
there is i don't know

3732
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:28,399
the uh uh you know an elephant or

3733
02:09:25,198 --> 02:09:31,359
something or the you know elephants are

3734
02:09:28,399 --> 02:09:34,158
presumably not necessary objects they

3735
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:35,679
are they happen to exist as a result of

3736
02:09:34,158 --> 02:09:37,039
kind of biological evolution and

3737
02:09:35,679 --> 02:09:40,000
whatever else

3738
02:09:37,039 --> 02:09:42,639
but the the thing is that

3739
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:45,599
in some sense that there is it is a

3740
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:46,800
different kind of thing to say does plus

3741
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:48,960
exist

3742
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:51,199
the the it's not it's not not like an

3743
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:53,359
elephant so a plus is seems more

3744
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:55,519
fundamental more basic than an elephant

3745
02:09:53,359 --> 02:09:57,039
yes but

3746
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:59,280
you can imagine

3747
02:09:57,039 --> 02:10:01,760
a world without

3748
02:09:59,279 --> 02:10:04,800
plus or anything like it like why do

3749
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:06,639
formal things that are discreet

3750
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:09,840
that can be used

3751
02:10:06,639 --> 02:10:12,800
to reason have to exist or uh well okay

3752
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:15,599
so why okay so that then the question is

3753
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:18,560
but the whole point is computation we

3754
02:10:15,599 --> 02:10:20,719
can certainly imagine computation that

3755
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:22,960
is we can certainly say there is a

3756
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:25,279
formal system that we can construct

3757
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:26,719
abstractly in our minds that is

3758
02:10:25,279 --> 02:10:27,759
computation

3759
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:30,639
and that

3760
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:33,520
that's the um uh and you know we can we

3761
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:35,520
can imagine it right now the question is

3762
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:37,599
um is it is

3763
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:40,320
that formal system

3764
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:43,279
once we exist as observers embedded in

3765
02:10:40,319 --> 02:10:44,880
that formal system that's enough to have

3766
02:10:43,279 --> 02:10:47,359
something which is like our universe

3767
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:49,679
yeah and so then the then what you're

3768
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:50,559
kind of asking is perhaps

3769
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:51,599
is

3770
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:53,679
why

3771
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:55,679
i mean the point is we definitely can

3772
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:57,679
imagine it there's nothing that says

3773
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:58,560
that we're not saying

3774
02:10:57,679 --> 02:11:01,599
that

3775
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:02,480
there's it's sort of inevitable that

3776
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:04,400
that

3777
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:06,479
is a thing that we can imagine we don't

3778
02:11:04,399 --> 02:11:08,399
have to ask does it exist

3779
02:11:06,479 --> 02:11:09,519
we're just it is definitely something we

3780
02:11:08,399 --> 02:11:12,879
can imagine

3781
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:15,840
now that's then we have this thing that

3782
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:17,679
is a formally constructable thing that

3783
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:18,880
we can imagine and now we have to ask

3784
02:11:17,679 --> 02:11:21,118
the question

3785
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:22,880
what you know given that formally

3786
02:11:21,118 --> 02:11:26,078
constructable thing

3787
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:29,039
what is uh what consequences does that

3788
02:11:26,078 --> 02:11:30,479
if we were to perceive that formally if

3789
02:11:29,039 --> 02:11:32,399
we were embedded in that formally

3790
02:11:30,479 --> 02:11:34,238
constructable thing what would be

3791
02:11:32,399 --> 02:11:38,399
perceived about the world and we would

3792
02:11:34,238 --> 02:11:40,479
say we perceive that the world exists

3793
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:42,479
because we are we are seeing all of this

3794
02:11:40,479 --> 02:11:44,879
mechanism of all these things happening

3795
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:47,279
and but that's something that is just a

3796
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:48,480
feature of it's it's it's something

3797
02:11:47,279 --> 02:11:51,039
where we are

3798
02:11:48,479 --> 02:11:52,638
see another way of asking this that i'm

3799
02:11:51,039 --> 02:11:54,960
trying to get at

3800
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:56,319
i understand why it feels like

3801
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:58,319
this uh

3802
02:11:56,319 --> 02:12:01,039
rooliad is

3803
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:03,840
necessary

3804
02:12:01,039 --> 02:12:07,519
but maybe it's just me being human but

3805
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:10,239
it feels like then you should be able to

3806
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:11,520
not us but somehow step outside of the

3807
02:12:10,238 --> 02:12:14,078
roulette

3808
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:15,679
like what's outside the roulette

3809
02:12:14,078 --> 02:12:16,799
well the ruling out is all formal

3810
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:19,039
systems

3811
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:20,960
so there's nothing because but that's

3812
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:22,158
what a human would say i know that's

3813
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:24,560
what a human would say because we're

3814
02:12:22,158 --> 02:12:26,559
used to the idea that there are there's

3815
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:29,599
but the whole point is that by the time

3816
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:32,840
it's all possible formal systems

3817
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:36,078
it's it's like it is all things you can

3818
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:37,039
imagine but not all computations you can

3819
02:12:36,078 --> 02:12:39,039
imagine

3820
02:12:37,039 --> 02:12:40,719
but like we don't

3821
02:12:39,039 --> 02:12:43,039
well so what we don't see that could be

3822
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:46,719
other code okay so so that's a that's a

3823
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:50,319
fair question is it possible to encode

3824
02:12:46,719 --> 02:12:52,158
uh all i mean once we is is there

3825
02:12:50,319 --> 02:12:54,639
something that isn't what we can

3826
02:12:52,158 --> 02:12:56,799
represent formally right that is that is

3827
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:58,880
there's something that um and that's i

3828
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:02,000
think related to the hyper rouliad

3829
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:02,000
footnote so to speak

3830
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,960
you know one of the things sort of

3831
02:13:05,039 --> 02:13:08,800
interesting about this is

3832
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:10,960
you know there has been some discussion

3833
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:13,520
of this in theology and things like that

3834
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:17,760
um but uh which i don't necessarily

3835
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:21,679
understand all of um but the the key

3836
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:23,840
sort of new input is this idea that all

3837
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:26,480
possible formal systems it's like you

3838
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:29,279
know if you make a world people say well

3839
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:31,118
you make a world with a particular in a

3840
02:13:29,279 --> 02:13:33,039
particular way with particular rules but

3841
02:13:31,118 --> 02:13:35,759
no you don't do that you can make a

3842
02:13:33,039 --> 02:13:39,599
world that deals with all possible rules

3843
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:41,760
and then merely by virtue of living in a

3844
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:44,000
particular place in that world so to

3845
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:45,520
speak we have the perception we have of

3846
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,639
what the world is like

3847
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:50,320
now i have to say the the um uh it's

3848
02:13:48,639 --> 02:13:52,078
sort of interesting because i i've you

3849
02:13:50,319 --> 02:13:54,880
know i wrote this piece about this and i

3850
02:13:52,078 --> 02:13:57,279
i you know this philosophy stuff is not

3851
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:59,520
super easy and i i've

3852
02:13:57,279 --> 02:14:01,198
um i as i'm as i'm talking to you about

3853
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:02,320
it and i actually haven't you know

3854
02:14:01,198 --> 02:14:03,359
people have been interested in lots of

3855
02:14:02,319 --> 02:14:05,439
different things we've been doing but

3856
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:07,679
this why does the universe exist has

3857
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:09,598
been i would say one of the one of the

3858
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:12,319
ones that you would think people will be

3859
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:14,319
most interested in but actually i think

3860
02:14:12,319 --> 02:14:17,039
they're just like oh that's just

3861
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:19,519
something complicated that that um so so

3862
02:14:17,039 --> 02:14:20,880
i haven't i haven't explained it as as

3863
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:22,560
much as i've explained a bunch of other

3864
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:24,078
things and i have to say i think i i

3865
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:27,360
think i may be missing a couple of

3866
02:14:24,078 --> 02:14:30,319
pieces of that argument that um uh would

3867
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:32,319
be so so it's kind of a like well your

3868
02:14:30,319 --> 02:14:34,158
your uh conscious being is

3869
02:14:32,319 --> 02:14:36,799
computationally bounded so you're

3870
02:14:34,158 --> 02:14:39,279
missing having written quite a few

3871
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:41,840
articles yourself you you're now missing

3872
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:43,439
some of the pieces yes

3873
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:45,119
being human right

3874
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:47,279
one of the consequences of this why the

3875
02:14:45,118 --> 02:14:49,118
unit why the universe exists thing and

3876
02:14:47,279 --> 02:14:52,238
this kind of concept of

3877
02:14:49,118 --> 02:14:54,078
ruling ads and and uh you know places in

3878
02:14:52,238 --> 02:14:56,078
there representing our perception of the

3879
02:14:54,078 --> 02:14:57,679
universe and so on one of the weird

3880
02:14:56,078 --> 02:15:00,238
consequences is

3881
02:14:57,679 --> 02:15:02,239
if the universe exists mathematics must

3882
02:15:00,238 --> 02:15:03,919
also exist

3883
02:15:02,238 --> 02:15:05,839
and that's a weird thing because

3884
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:07,840
mathematics people have been very

3885
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:10,319
confused including me have been very

3886
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:13,119
confused about

3887
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:15,439
the the question of of kind of what

3888
02:15:13,118 --> 02:15:16,960
uh what is the foundation of mathematics

3889
02:15:15,439 --> 02:15:18,879
what is what kind of a thing is

3890
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:20,800
mathematics is mathematics

3891
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:23,199
something where we just write down

3892
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:25,199
axioms like euclid did for geometry and

3893
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:26,479
we just build the structure and we could

3894
02:15:25,198 --> 02:15:28,559
have written down different axioms and

3895
02:15:26,479 --> 02:15:30,559
we'd have a different structure or is it

3896
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:32,480
something that has a more fundamental

3897
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:34,960
sort of truth to it and i have to say

3898
02:15:32,479 --> 02:15:36,559
it's one of these cases where i've i've

3899
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,078
long believed that mathematics has a

3900
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:40,159
great deal of arbitrariness to it that

3901
02:15:38,078 --> 02:15:42,639
there are particular axioms that kind of

3902
02:15:40,158 --> 02:15:44,158
got written down by the babylonians and

3903
02:15:42,639 --> 02:15:46,078
uh you know that's what we've ended up

3904
02:15:44,158 --> 02:15:48,000
with the mathematics that we have and i

3905
02:15:46,078 --> 02:15:49,439
have to say actually my my wife has been

3906
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,198
telling me for 25 years she's a

3907
02:15:49,439 --> 02:15:52,719
mathematician she's been telling me

3908
02:15:51,198 --> 02:15:55,759
you're wrong about the foundations of

3909
02:15:52,719 --> 02:15:58,078
mathematics and and you know i'm like no

3910
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:59,119
no no i know what i'm talking about and

3911
02:15:58,078 --> 02:16:01,519
finally

3912
02:15:59,118 --> 02:16:04,399
she's she's much more right than i've

3913
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:06,320
been so it's um it's wonderful so i mean

3914
02:16:04,399 --> 02:16:09,039
uh her sense

3915
02:16:06,319 --> 02:16:11,118
in your sense are we just uh so this is

3916
02:16:09,039 --> 02:16:12,238
to the question of uh meta mathematics

3917
02:16:11,118 --> 02:16:14,960
so we're just

3918
02:16:12,238 --> 02:16:17,118
kind of on the trajectory through

3919
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:19,679
rule space except in mathematics through

3920
02:16:17,118 --> 02:16:21,439
a trajectory a certain kind of

3921
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:23,679
thing that's partly the idea so so i

3922
02:16:21,439 --> 02:16:25,279
think that the notion is this so 100

3923
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:26,960
years ago a little bit more than 100

3924
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:28,960
years ago but people have been doing

3925
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:31,198
mathematics for ages but then in the in

3926
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:34,398
the late 1800s people decided to try and

3927
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:36,398
formalize mathematics and say you know

3928
02:16:34,398 --> 02:16:37,519
it is mathematics is you know we're

3929
02:16:36,398 --> 02:16:38,959
going to break it down we're going to

3930
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:41,040
make it like logic we're going to make

3931
02:16:38,959 --> 02:16:42,718
it out of out of sort of fundamental

3932
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:44,880
primitives and that was people like

3933
02:16:42,718 --> 02:16:48,079
fraga and piano and hilbert and so on

3934
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:50,398
and they kind of got this idea of let's

3935
02:16:48,079 --> 02:16:52,079
do kind of euclid but even better let's

3936
02:16:50,398 --> 02:16:54,239
just make everything just in terms of

3937
02:16:52,079 --> 02:16:56,239
this sort of symbolic axioms and then

3938
02:16:54,239 --> 02:16:58,558
build up mathematics from that

3939
02:16:56,239 --> 02:17:00,959
and that you know they thought at the

3940
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:02,959
time as soon as they get

3941
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:04,558
these symbolic axioms that they made the

3942
02:17:02,959 --> 02:17:07,199
same mistake the kind of computational

3943
02:17:04,558 --> 02:17:09,358
irreducibility mistake they thought as

3944
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:10,559
soon as we've written down the axioms

3945
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:11,599
then it'll just we'll just have a

3946
02:17:10,558 --> 02:17:13,920
machine

3947
02:17:11,599 --> 02:17:15,920
kind of a super mathematica so to speak

3948
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:17,679
that can just grind out all true

3949
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:19,920
theorems of mathematics

3950
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:21,280
that got exploited by godel's theorem

3951
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:23,439
which is basically the story of

3952
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:25,120
computational irreducibility it's that

3953
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:26,960
even though you know those underlying

3954
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:29,679
rules you can't deduce all the

3955
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:31,678
consequences in any finite way

3956
02:17:29,679 --> 02:17:34,079
and so so that was but now the question

3957
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:36,318
is okay so they broke mathematics down

3958
02:17:34,079 --> 02:17:37,679
into these axioms and they say now you

3959
02:17:36,318 --> 02:17:40,239
build up from that

3960
02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:42,799
so what i'm increasingly uh coming to

3961
02:17:40,239 --> 02:17:44,959
realize is that's similar to saying

3962
02:17:42,799 --> 02:17:46,239
let's take a gas and break it down into

3963
02:17:44,959 --> 02:17:48,079
molecules

3964
02:17:46,239 --> 02:17:50,558
there's gas laws that are the

3965
02:17:48,079 --> 02:17:52,318
large-scale structure and so on that we

3966
02:17:50,558 --> 02:17:53,599
humans are familiar with and then

3967
02:17:52,318 --> 02:17:56,159
there's the underlying molecular

3968
02:17:53,599 --> 02:17:58,719
dynamics and i think that the axiomatic

3969
02:17:56,159 --> 02:18:00,478
level of mathematics which we can access

3970
02:17:58,718 --> 02:18:02,718
with automated theorem proving and proof

3971
02:18:00,478 --> 02:18:04,159
assistance and these kinds of things

3972
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:06,558
that's the molecular dynamics of

3973
02:18:04,159 --> 02:18:08,799
mathematics and occasionally we see

3974
02:18:06,558 --> 02:18:10,879
through to that molecular dynamics we

3975
02:18:08,799 --> 02:18:12,478
see undecidability we see other things

3976
02:18:10,879 --> 02:18:15,438
like this one things i've always found

3977
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:17,519
very mysterious is that godel's theorem

3978
02:18:15,439 --> 02:18:19,280
shows that there are

3979
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:20,960
sort of things which cannot be finitely

3980
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:22,880
proved in mathematics there are proofs

3981
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:24,398
of arbitrary length infinite length

3982
02:18:22,879 --> 02:18:25,920
proofs that you might need

3983
02:18:24,398 --> 02:18:27,439
but in practical mathematics

3984
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:30,000
mathematicians don't typically run into

3985
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:32,398
this they just happily go along doing

3986
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,920
their mathematics and i think what's

3987
02:18:32,398 --> 02:18:36,000
actually happening is that what they're

3988
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:38,799
doing is they're looking at

3989
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,679
this they are essentially observers

3990
02:18:38,799 --> 02:18:41,599
in

3991
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:43,760
meta mathematical space

3992
02:18:41,599 --> 02:18:46,000
and they are picking a reference frame

3993
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:47,679
in metal mathematical space and they are

3994
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,079
computationally bounded observers in

3995
02:18:47,679 --> 02:18:52,558
metamathematical space which is causing

3996
02:18:50,079 --> 02:18:54,478
them to deduce that the laws of

3997
02:18:52,558 --> 02:18:56,638
metamathematics and the laws of

3998
02:18:54,478 --> 02:18:59,119
mathematics like the laws of fluid

3999
02:18:56,638 --> 02:19:01,759
mechanics are much more understandable

4000
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:04,160
than this underlying molecular dynamics

4001
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:06,398
and so what gets really bizarre is

4002
02:19:04,159 --> 02:19:09,679
thinking about kind of the analogy

4003
02:19:06,398 --> 02:19:13,519
between matter mathematics this idea of

4004
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:16,239
of you exist in this kind of uh um

4005
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:18,000
in the sort of space of possible um in

4006
02:19:16,239 --> 02:19:20,398
this kind of mathematical space where

4007
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,799
the where the individual kind of uh

4008
02:19:20,398 --> 02:19:24,318
points in the mathematical space are

4009
02:19:22,799 --> 02:19:27,119
statements in mathematics and they're

4010
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:28,478
connected by proofs where one statement

4011
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:29,920
you know you take a couple of different

4012
02:19:28,478 --> 02:19:31,679
statements you can use those to prove

4013
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:34,079
some other statement and you've got this

4014
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:36,159
whole network of proofs that's the kind

4015
02:19:34,079 --> 02:19:39,200
of causal network of mathematics so what

4016
02:19:36,159 --> 02:19:41,760
can prove what and so on and you can say

4017
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:44,079
at any moment in the history of a

4018
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:46,880
mathematician of a single mathematical

4019
02:19:44,079 --> 02:19:48,398
consciousness you are in a single kind

4020
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:51,199
of slice

4021
02:19:48,398 --> 02:19:52,559
of this kind of meta-mathematical space

4022
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:54,800
you you know a certain set of

4023
02:19:52,559 --> 02:19:56,719
mathematical statements you can then

4024
02:19:54,799 --> 02:19:58,719
deduce with proofs you can deduce other

4025
02:19:56,719 --> 02:20:01,119
ones and so on you're kind of gradually

4026
02:19:58,719 --> 02:20:03,920
moving through meta-mathematical space

4027
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:06,240
and so it's kind of the view is that the

4028
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:07,600
reason that mathematicians perceive

4029
02:20:06,239 --> 02:20:09,439
mathematics to have the sort of

4030
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:11,680
integrity and lack of kind of

4031
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:14,159
undecidability and so on that they do is

4032
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:16,000
because they like we as as observers of

4033
02:20:14,159 --> 02:20:17,600
the physical universe we have these

4034
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,200
limitations associated with

4035
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:21,280
computational boundedness single thread

4036
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:23,520
of time consciousness limitations

4037
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:25,280
basically that the same thing is true of

4038
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:26,880
mathematicians perceiving sort of

4039
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:29,439
meta-mathematical space and so what's

4040
02:20:26,879 --> 02:20:30,639
happening is that when you look at if

4041
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:32,720
you look at one of these formalized

4042
02:20:30,639 --> 02:20:35,680
mathematics systems something like you

4043
02:20:32,719 --> 02:20:37,438
know pythagoras theorem it'll be it'll

4044
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:40,318
take oh i don't know

4045
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:42,398
uh what is it maybe 10 000 individual

4046
02:20:40,318 --> 02:20:45,039
little steps to prove pythagoras's

4047
02:20:42,398 --> 02:20:46,879
theorem and one of the bizarre things

4048
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:47,920
that's a sort of an empirical fact that

4049
02:20:46,879 --> 02:20:49,679
i'm trying to understand a little bit

4050
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:51,040
better if you look at different proof

4051
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:52,880
assists if you look at different

4052
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:54,240
formalized mathematics systems they

4053
02:20:52,879 --> 02:20:55,759
actually have different axioms

4054
02:20:54,239 --> 02:20:58,639
underneath but they can all prove

4055
02:20:55,760 --> 02:21:00,079
pythagoras theorem and so in other words

4056
02:20:58,639 --> 02:21:02,398
it's a little bit like what happens with

4057
02:21:00,079 --> 02:21:04,239
gases we can have air molecules we can

4058
02:21:02,398 --> 02:21:06,239
have water molecules but they still have

4059
02:21:04,239 --> 02:21:08,478
fluid dynamics both of them have fluid

4060
02:21:06,239 --> 02:21:10,159
dynamics and so similarly at the level

4061
02:21:08,478 --> 02:21:12,478
that mathematics that mathematicians

4062
02:21:10,159 --> 02:21:14,559
care about mathematics it's way above

4063
02:21:12,478 --> 02:21:16,159
the macular dynamics so to speak

4064
02:21:14,559 --> 02:21:17,359
and there are all kinds of weird things

4065
02:21:16,159 --> 02:21:19,280
like for example one thing i was

4066
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:20,960
realizing recently is that the quantum

4067
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:23,760
theory of mathematics that's a very

4068
02:21:20,959 --> 02:21:24,799
bizarre idea but um basically when you

4069
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:26,800
prove

4070
02:21:24,799 --> 02:21:28,398
what is you know a proof

4071
02:21:26,799 --> 02:21:29,679
is you've got one statement in

4072
02:21:28,398 --> 02:21:31,119
mathematics you go through other

4073
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:32,239
statements you eventually get to a

4074
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:34,640
statement you're trying to prove for

4075
02:21:32,239 --> 02:21:36,478
example that's a path path in

4076
02:21:34,639 --> 02:21:38,398
meta-mathematical space

4077
02:21:36,478 --> 02:21:39,760
and that's a single path a single proof

4078
02:21:38,398 --> 02:21:41,358
is a single path

4079
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:43,359
but you can imagine there are other

4080
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:45,280
proofs of the same result

4081
02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:47,439
there are a bundle of proofs there's

4082
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:49,120
this whole set of possible proofs you

4083
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:50,479
could think of as branching similar to

4084
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:52,079
the quantum mechanics model that you

4085
02:21:50,478 --> 02:21:53,438
were talking about exactly and so and

4086
02:21:52,079 --> 02:21:55,439
then there's some invariants that you

4087
02:21:53,439 --> 02:21:57,200
can formalize in the same way that you

4088
02:21:55,439 --> 02:21:59,200
can for the quantum mechanical right so

4089
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:00,399
the question is in in proof space you

4090
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:02,640
know as you start thinking about

4091
02:22:00,398 --> 02:22:04,000
multiple proofs are there analogs of for

4092
02:22:02,639 --> 02:22:05,439
example destructive

4093
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:07,680
interference of multiple proofs so

4094
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:10,559
here's a bizarre idea it's just a couple

4095
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:12,800
of days old so not not yet fully formed

4096
02:22:10,559 --> 02:22:14,799
but um as you try and do that when you

4097
02:22:12,799 --> 02:22:16,239
have two different proofs it's like two

4098
02:22:14,799 --> 02:22:17,599
photons going in different directions

4099
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:20,318
you have two proofs which at an

4100
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:21,439
intermediate stage are incompatible and

4101
02:22:20,318 --> 02:22:23,359
that's kind of like destructive

4102
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:25,840
interference is it possible

4103
02:22:23,359 --> 02:22:28,079
for this to instruct the engineering of

4104
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:29,760
automated proof systems

4105
02:22:28,079 --> 02:22:32,000
absolutely i mean as a practical matter

4106
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:33,760
i mean the you know this whole question

4107
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:35,840
in fact jonathan gorad has a nice

4108
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:38,000
heuristic for automated theorem provers

4109
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:40,960
that's based on our physics project that

4110
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:44,398
is looking for essentially using

4111
02:22:40,959 --> 02:22:46,639
kind of uh using energy and in our

4112
02:22:44,398 --> 02:22:49,358
models energy is kind of level of

4113
02:22:46,639 --> 02:22:51,279
activity in this hypograph

4114
02:22:49,359 --> 02:22:53,359
and so there's sort of a heuristic for

4115
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:56,640
automated theorem proving about how do

4116
02:22:53,359 --> 02:22:59,840
you pick which path to go down that uh

4117
02:22:56,639 --> 02:23:01,119
is based on essentially physics um and i

4118
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:03,439
mean the thing that that gets

4119
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:04,880
interesting about this is is the way

4120
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:06,639
that one can sort of have the interplay

4121
02:23:04,879 --> 02:23:07,759
between like for example a black hole

4122
02:23:06,639 --> 02:23:09,039
what is a black hole in metal

4123
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:11,280
mathematics

4124
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:14,080
so the answer is what is black hole in

4125
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:15,920
physics a black hole in physics is where

4126
02:23:14,079 --> 02:23:16,879
in the simplest form of black hole time

4127
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:19,200
ends

4128
02:23:16,879 --> 02:23:20,559
that is all you know everything is is

4129
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:23,040
crunched down to the space-time

4130
02:23:20,559 --> 02:23:26,000
singularity and everything just ends up

4131
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:27,359
at that singularity so in our models and

4132
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,879
that's a little hard to understand in

4133
02:23:27,359 --> 02:23:30,559
general relativity with continuous

4134
02:23:28,879 --> 02:23:32,318
mathematics and what does singularity

4135
02:23:30,559 --> 02:23:34,398
look like in our models it's something

4136
02:23:32,318 --> 02:23:36,559
very pragmatic it's just you're applying

4137
02:23:34,398 --> 02:23:37,920
these rules time is moving forward and

4138
02:23:36,559 --> 02:23:40,959
then there comes a moment where the

4139
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:43,040
rules no rules apply so time stops it's

4140
02:23:40,959 --> 02:23:44,639
kind of like the universe dies there's

4141
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:47,520
you know the nothing happens in the

4142
02:23:44,639 --> 02:23:49,599
universe anymore well in mathematics

4143
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:51,439
that's a decidable theory that's a

4144
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:53,280
theory so theories which have

4145
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:55,439
undecidability which are things like

4146
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:57,760
arithmetic set theory all the serious

4147
02:23:55,439 --> 02:23:59,280
models theories in mathematics they all

4148
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:01,359
have the feature that there are proofs

4149
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:03,280
of arbitrarily long length

4150
02:24:01,359 --> 02:24:05,760
in something like boolean algebra which

4151
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:07,359
is a decidable theory there are you know

4152
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:09,520
any question in boolean algebra you can

4153
02:24:07,359 --> 02:24:11,680
just go crunch crunch crunch and in a

4154
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:13,760
known number of steps you can answer it

4155
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:15,920
you know satisfiability you know might

4156
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:17,920
be hard but it's still a bounded number

4157
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:20,559
of steps to answer any satisfiability

4158
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:24,000
problem and so that's the the notion of

4159
02:24:20,559 --> 02:24:26,159
a black hole in physics where time stops

4160
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:28,478
that's the that's analogous to in

4161
02:24:26,159 --> 02:24:31,600
mathematics where there aren't infinite

4162
02:24:28,478 --> 02:24:33,358
length proofs where when in physics

4163
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:34,960
you know you can wander around the

4164
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:36,318
universe forever if you don't run into a

4165
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:39,039
black hole if you run into a black hole

4166
02:24:36,318 --> 02:24:40,559
and time stops you're done and it's the

4167
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:42,240
same thing in mathematics between

4168
02:24:40,559 --> 02:24:43,920
decidable decidable theories and

4169
02:24:42,239 --> 02:24:46,639
undecidable theories that's a that's an

4170
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:48,719
example and i think we're sort of the

4171
02:24:46,639 --> 02:24:50,639
the attempt to understand so so another

4172
02:24:48,719 --> 02:24:53,358
question is kind of what is the what is

4173
02:24:50,639 --> 02:24:55,680
the general relativity of uh of

4174
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:57,359
metamathematics what is the bulk theory

4175
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:59,120
of metamathematics

4176
02:24:57,359 --> 02:25:00,399
so in the literature of mathematics

4177
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:02,560
there are about three million theorems

4178
02:25:00,398 --> 02:25:04,879
that people have have published and

4179
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:07,039
those represent it's kind of on this

4180
02:25:04,879 --> 02:25:09,438
it's like like on the earth

4181
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:11,120
we would be you know uh you know we've

4182
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:13,280
put cities in particular places on the

4183
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:14,640
earth but yet there is ultimately you

4184
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:16,560
know we know the earth is roughly

4185
02:25:14,639 --> 02:25:18,879
spherical and there's an underlying

4186
02:25:16,559 --> 02:25:21,119
space and we could just talk about you

4187
02:25:18,879 --> 02:25:22,478
know the world of space in terms of

4188
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:24,479
where our cities happen to be but

4189
02:25:22,478 --> 02:25:25,920
there's actually an underlying space and

4190
02:25:24,478 --> 02:25:28,159
so the question is what's that for meta

4191
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:30,079
mathematics and as we kind of explore

4192
02:25:28,159 --> 02:25:32,239
what is for example for mathematics

4193
02:25:30,079 --> 02:25:34,639
which is always likes taking sort of

4194
02:25:32,239 --> 02:25:36,559
abstract limits so an obvious abstract

4195
02:25:34,639 --> 02:25:38,879
limit for mathematics to take is the

4196
02:25:36,559 --> 02:25:41,039
limit of the future of mathematics

4197
02:25:38,879 --> 02:25:43,199
that is what will be you know the

4198
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:44,240
ultimate structure of mathematics yeah

4199
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:46,319
and one of the things that's an

4200
02:25:44,239 --> 02:25:48,478
empirical observation about mathematics

4201
02:25:46,318 --> 02:25:50,478
that's quite interesting is that a lot

4202
02:25:48,478 --> 02:25:52,559
of theories in one area of mathematics

4203
02:25:50,478 --> 02:25:54,719
algebraic geometry or something might

4204
02:25:52,559 --> 02:25:57,680
have they play into another area of

4205
02:25:54,719 --> 02:25:59,519
mathematics that that same the same kind

4206
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:01,200
of a fundamental construct seemed to

4207
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:03,200
occur in very different areas of

4208
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:04,720
mathematics and that's structurally

4209
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:06,720
captured a bit with category theory and

4210
02:26:04,719 --> 02:26:08,239
things like that but i think that

4211
02:26:06,719 --> 02:26:10,000
there's probably an understanding of

4212
02:26:08,239 --> 02:26:12,000
this meta-mathematical space that will

4213
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:14,239
explain why different areas of

4214
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,398
mathematics ultimately sort of map into

4215
02:26:14,239 --> 02:26:18,239
the same thing and i mean you know my

4216
02:26:16,398 --> 02:26:20,799
little challenge to myself is what's

4217
02:26:18,239 --> 02:26:23,760
time dilation in um uh in mata

4218
02:26:20,799 --> 02:26:25,519
mathematics in other words as you as you

4219
02:26:23,760 --> 02:26:27,520
basically as you move around in this

4220
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:30,479
mathematical space of possible

4221
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:32,239
statements um you know what's how does

4222
02:26:30,478 --> 02:26:34,959
that moving around it's basically what's

4223
02:26:32,239 --> 02:26:36,318
happening is that as you move around in

4224
02:26:34,959 --> 02:26:37,679
the space of mathematical statements

4225
02:26:36,318 --> 02:26:40,239
it's like you're changing from algebra

4226
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:42,559
to geometry to whatever else and you're

4227
02:26:40,239 --> 02:26:44,799
trying to prove the same theorem but as

4228
02:26:42,559 --> 02:26:46,879
you try if you keep on moving to these

4229
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:48,079
different places it's slower to prove

4230
02:26:46,879 --> 02:26:49,839
that theorem because you keep on having

4231
02:26:48,079 --> 02:26:50,959
to translate what you're doing back to

4232
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:52,799
where you started from and that's kind

4233
02:26:50,959 --> 02:26:54,959
of the beginnings of the analog of time

4234
02:26:52,799 --> 02:26:56,559
dilation and metamathematics plus

4235
02:26:54,959 --> 02:26:58,000
there's probably fractional dimensions

4236
02:26:56,559 --> 02:27:00,799
in this space as well

4237
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,478
oh this space is a very messy space this

4238
02:27:00,799 --> 02:27:04,559
space is much messier than physical

4239
02:27:02,478 --> 02:27:05,599
space i mean even in even in the models

4240
02:27:04,559 --> 02:27:08,239
of physics

4241
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:10,880
physical space is is very tame compared

4242
02:27:08,239 --> 02:27:12,879
to branchial space and real space um i

4243
02:27:10,879 --> 02:27:14,159
mean the mathematical structure you know

4244
02:27:12,879 --> 02:27:15,438
bronchial space probably more like

4245
02:27:14,159 --> 02:27:17,280
hilbert space but it's a rather

4246
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:19,600
complicated hilbert space

4247
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:22,319
and rulial space

4248
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:24,318
is more like this weird infinity

4249
02:27:22,318 --> 02:27:25,519
groupoid story of growth and deacon and

4250
02:27:24,318 --> 02:27:28,159
you know i can explain that a little bit

4251
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:29,680
because in you know in in meta

4252
02:27:28,159 --> 02:27:33,439
mathematical space

4253
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:35,600
a a path in mathematical space is a is a

4254
02:27:33,439 --> 02:27:37,359
a path between two statements is a way

4255
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:39,280
to get by proofs

4256
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:40,960
is to way to find a proof that goes from

4257
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:42,800
one statement to another

4258
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:44,559
and so one of the things you can do you

4259
02:27:42,799 --> 02:27:46,639
can think about is you've got between

4260
02:27:44,559 --> 02:27:48,799
statements you've got proofs and they

4261
02:27:46,639 --> 02:27:50,799
are paths between statements okay so now

4262
02:27:48,799 --> 02:27:53,119
you can go to the next level and you can

4263
02:27:50,799 --> 02:27:54,318
ask what about a mapping from one proof

4264
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:56,479
to another

4265
02:27:54,318 --> 02:27:58,639
and so that's in in category theory

4266
02:27:56,478 --> 02:28:00,559
that's kind of a higher category the

4267
02:27:58,639 --> 02:28:02,559
notion of higher categories where you're

4268
02:28:00,559 --> 02:28:04,398
where you're mapping not just between

4269
02:28:02,559 --> 02:28:06,000
not just between objects but you're

4270
02:28:04,398 --> 02:28:08,639
mapping between the mappings between

4271
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:10,318
objects and so on and so you can keep

4272
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:12,159
doing that you can keep saying higher

4273
02:28:10,318 --> 02:28:14,478
order proofs i want mappings between

4274
02:28:12,159 --> 02:28:16,398
proofs between proofs and so on and that

4275
02:28:14,478 --> 02:28:19,039
limiting structure oh by the way one

4276
02:28:16,398 --> 02:28:20,318
thing that's very interesting is imagine

4277
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:21,200
in proof space you've got these two

4278
02:28:20,318 --> 02:28:23,279
proofs

4279
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:25,120
and the question is what is the topology

4280
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:26,880
of proof space in other words if you

4281
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:29,040
take these two parts can you

4282
02:28:26,879 --> 02:28:30,879
continuously deform them into each other

4283
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:32,640
or is there some big hole in the middle

4284
02:28:30,879 --> 02:28:34,239
that prevents you from continuously

4285
02:28:32,639 --> 02:28:35,840
deforming them one into the other it's

4286
02:28:34,239 --> 02:28:37,280
kind of like you know when you when you

4287
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:39,200
think about some i don't know some

4288
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:41,439
puzzle for example you're moving pieces

4289
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:43,280
around on some puzzle and you can think

4290
02:28:41,439 --> 02:28:45,280
about the space of possible states of

4291
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:47,040
the puzzle and you can make this graph

4292
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:48,960
that shows from one state to the puzzle

4293
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:51,280
to another state of the puzzle and so on

4294
02:28:48,959 --> 02:28:52,559
and sometimes you can easily get from

4295
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:54,560
one state to any other state but

4296
02:28:52,559 --> 02:28:56,559
sometimes there'll be a hole in that

4297
02:28:54,559 --> 02:28:58,799
space and they'll be you know you always

4298
02:28:56,559 --> 02:29:00,398
have to go around the circuitous route

4299
02:28:58,799 --> 02:29:03,279
to get from here to there there won't be

4300
02:29:00,398 --> 02:29:05,199
any direct way that's kind of a question

4301
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:07,120
of of whether there's sort of an

4302
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:09,120
obstruction in the space and so the

4303
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:12,079
question is in proof space

4304
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:13,840
what is the what are you know what does

4305
02:29:12,079 --> 02:29:15,520
it mean if there's an obstruction in

4306
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:18,079
proof space yeah i don't even know what

4307
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:19,120
an uh obstruction means improve space

4308
02:29:18,079 --> 02:29:20,478
because

4309
02:29:19,120 --> 02:29:22,960
for it to be an obstruction it should be

4310
02:29:20,478 --> 02:29:23,920
reachable some other way from some other

4311
02:29:22,959 --> 02:29:26,318
place

4312
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:27,840
right so this is like an unreachable

4313
02:29:26,318 --> 02:29:29,279
part of the graph

4314
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:31,359
no it's not just an unreachable part

4315
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:32,960
it's a part where there are paths that

4316
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:34,800
go one way there are parts that go the

4317
02:29:32,959 --> 02:29:36,398
other way and this question of homotopy

4318
02:29:34,799 --> 02:29:38,799
and mathematics is this question can you

4319
02:29:36,398 --> 02:29:40,959
continuously deform you know from one

4320
02:29:38,799 --> 02:29:43,438
path to another path or do you have to

4321
02:29:40,959 --> 02:29:44,719
go in a jump so to speak so okay so like

4322
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:46,318
if you're going around a sphere for

4323
02:29:44,719 --> 02:29:47,358
example if you're going around

4324
02:29:46,318 --> 02:29:48,799
i don't know

4325
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:52,000
a cylinder or something you can wind

4326
02:29:48,799 --> 02:29:54,079
around one way and you can there's no

4327
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,680
paths where you can where you can easily

4328
02:29:54,079 --> 02:29:56,879
deform one path into another because

4329
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:58,720
it's just sort of sitting on the same

4330
02:29:56,879 --> 02:30:00,000
side of the cylinder but when you've got

4331
02:29:58,719 --> 02:30:02,000
something that winds all the way around

4332
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:04,239
a cylinder you can't continuously deform

4333
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:06,239
that down to a point because it's it's

4334
02:30:04,239 --> 02:30:07,680
stuck wrapped around my intuition about

4335
02:30:06,239 --> 02:30:09,359
proof space is you should be able to

4336
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:10,720
deform it i mean that because then

4337
02:30:09,359 --> 02:30:11,600
otherwise it doesn't even make sense

4338
02:30:10,719 --> 02:30:14,398
because

4339
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:16,399
if the topology matters of the way you

4340
02:30:14,398 --> 02:30:17,840
move about the space that i don't even

4341
02:30:16,398 --> 02:30:20,318
know what that means well what it would

4342
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:22,478
mean is that you would have one way of

4343
02:30:20,318 --> 02:30:24,398
doing a proof of something over here in

4344
02:30:22,478 --> 02:30:26,559
algebra yeah and another way of doing a

4345
02:30:24,398 --> 02:30:28,639
proof of something over here in geometry

4346
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:31,119
and there would not be an intermediate

4347
02:30:28,639 --> 02:30:32,879
way to map between those proofs how

4348
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:35,200
would that be possible if they start at

4349
02:30:32,879 --> 02:30:36,959
the same place and end the same place

4350
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:38,960
well it's the same thing as

4351
02:30:36,959 --> 02:30:41,119
you know we've got points on a you know

4352
02:30:38,959 --> 02:30:42,799
if we've got paths on a cylinder now i

4353
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:44,960
understand how it works in physical

4354
02:30:42,799 --> 02:30:47,599
space but it just doesn't it feels like

4355
02:30:44,959 --> 02:30:49,679
proof space shouldn't have that i okay i

4356
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:51,439
mean i'm not sure i don't know we will

4357
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:52,720
know very soon because we get to do some

4358
02:30:51,439 --> 02:30:55,280
experiments this is the great thing

4359
02:30:52,719 --> 02:30:57,279
about this stuff is that in fact you

4360
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:59,040
know i i'm in the next few days i hope

4361
02:30:57,280 --> 02:31:00,960
to do a bunch of experiments on this so

4362
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:03,840
you're playing with like proofs in in

4363
02:31:00,959 --> 02:31:06,559
this kind of space yes yes i mean so so

4364
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:09,120
you know this is toy you know theories

4365
02:31:06,559 --> 02:31:10,639
and you know we've got good so this kind

4366
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:13,280
of segues to perhaps another thing which

4367
02:31:10,639 --> 02:31:15,680
is this whole idea of multi-computation

4368
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:19,120
so this this um

4369
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:21,280
is another kind of bigger idea that so

4370
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:22,800
okay this has to do with how do you make

4371
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:25,040
models of things

4372
02:31:22,799 --> 02:31:25,759
and it's going to it's some

4373
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:27,200
so

4374
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:29,680
i've sort of claimed that they've been

4375
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:31,680
sort of four epochs in the history of

4376
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:32,880
making models of things

4377
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:34,960
and um

4378
02:31:32,879 --> 02:31:36,639
and this multi-computation thing is is

4379
02:31:34,959 --> 02:31:37,919
the fourth there's a new epoch what are

4380
02:31:36,639 --> 02:31:40,559
the first three

4381
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:43,200
the first one is is back in antiquity

4382
02:31:40,559 --> 02:31:45,199
ancient greek times people were like

4383
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:47,680
what's the universe made of oh it's made

4384
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:50,720
of you know everything is water thales

4385
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:53,439
you know or everything is made of atoms

4386
02:31:50,719 --> 02:31:55,199
it's sort of what are things made of or

4387
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:57,439
you know there are these crystal spheres

4388
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:59,760
that represent where the planets are and

4389
02:31:57,439 --> 02:32:01,840
so on it's like a structural idea of how

4390
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:04,079
the universe is constructed there's no

4391
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:06,478
real notion of dynamics it's just what

4392
02:32:04,079 --> 02:32:09,120
is the universe how is the universe made

4393
02:32:06,478 --> 02:32:10,959
then we get to the 1600s and we get to

4394
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:14,240
the sort of revolution of mathematics

4395
02:32:10,959 --> 02:32:16,478
being introduced into physics and then

4396
02:32:14,239 --> 02:32:18,719
we have this kind of idea of you write

4397
02:32:16,478 --> 02:32:20,719
down some equation

4398
02:32:18,719 --> 02:32:22,398
the what happens in the universe is the

4399
02:32:20,719 --> 02:32:24,559
solving of that equation

4400
02:32:22,398 --> 02:32:26,398
time enters but it's usually just a

4401
02:32:24,559 --> 02:32:28,959
parameter we just can you know sort of

4402
02:32:26,398 --> 02:32:30,239
slide it back and forth and say here's

4403
02:32:28,959 --> 02:32:31,759
here's where it is

4404
02:32:30,239 --> 02:32:34,959
okay then we come to this kind of

4405
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:36,639
computational idea that i kind of

4406
02:32:34,959 --> 02:32:39,358
started really pushing in the in the 90

4407
02:32:36,639 --> 02:32:40,398
early 1980s as a result you know the

4408
02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:43,200
things we were talking about before

4409
02:32:40,398 --> 02:32:45,199
about complexity that was my motivation

4410
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:47,680
but the bigger story was the story of

4411
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:49,359
kind of computational models of things

4412
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:51,359
and the big difference there from the

4413
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:53,680
mathematical models is in mathematical

4414
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:55,439
models there's an equation you solve it

4415
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:56,880
you've got kind of slide time to the

4416
02:32:55,439 --> 02:32:58,720
place where you want it

4417
02:32:56,879 --> 02:33:01,358
in computational models

4418
02:32:58,719 --> 02:33:04,000
you give the rule and then you just say

4419
02:33:01,359 --> 02:33:06,000
go run the rule and time is not

4420
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:07,920
something you get to slide time is

4421
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:11,439
something where it just you run the rule

4422
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:13,359
time goes in steps and that's how you

4423
02:33:11,439 --> 02:33:15,840
work out what how the system behaves you

4424
02:33:13,359 --> 02:33:17,520
don't time is not just a parameter time

4425
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:19,680
is something that is about the running

4426
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:21,359
of these of these rules and so there's

4427
02:33:19,680 --> 02:33:23,439
this computational irreducibility you

4428
02:33:21,359 --> 02:33:25,600
can't jump ahead in time but there's

4429
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:27,840
still important thing is there's still

4430
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:29,760
one thread of time it's still the case

4431
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:31,280
you know the seller automaton state then

4432
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:34,079
it has the next state and the next state

4433
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:35,920
and so on the thing that is kind of was

4434
02:33:34,079 --> 02:33:38,000
sort of tipped off by quantum mechanics

4435
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:39,920
in a sense although it it actually feeds

4436
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,959
back even into relativity and things

4437
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:42,960
like that

4438
02:33:40,959 --> 02:33:45,759
that there's these multiple threads of

4439
02:33:42,959 --> 02:33:48,239
time and so in this multi-computation

4440
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:50,159
paradigm the kind of idea is instead of

4441
02:33:48,239 --> 02:33:51,600
there being this single threat of time

4442
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:53,760
there are these kind of distributed

4443
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:55,600
asynchronous threads of time that are

4444
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:56,880
happening and the thing that's sort of

4445
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:58,800
different there

4446
02:33:56,879 --> 02:34:01,279
is if you want to know what happened if

4447
02:33:58,799 --> 02:34:03,279
you say what happened in the system in

4448
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:06,479
the case of the computational paradigm

4449
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:07,920
you just say well after a thousand steps

4450
02:34:06,478 --> 02:34:09,840
we got this result

4451
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:12,000
right but in the multi-computational

4452
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:13,200
paradigm after a thousand steps not even

4453
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,079
clear what a thousand steps means

4454
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:16,960
because you've got all these different

4455
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:19,039
threads of time but there is no state

4456
02:34:16,959 --> 02:34:20,799
there's all these different possible you

4457
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:22,479
know there's all these different paths

4458
02:34:20,799 --> 02:34:23,679
and so the only way you can know what

4459
02:34:22,478 --> 02:34:25,840
happened is to have some kind of

4460
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:26,800
observer who is saying here's how to

4461
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:28,880
parse

4462
02:34:26,799 --> 02:34:30,398
the results of what was going on right

4463
02:34:28,879 --> 02:34:32,478
but that observer is embedded and they

4464
02:34:30,398 --> 02:34:34,239
don't have a complete picture so in the

4465
02:34:32,478 --> 02:34:36,639
case of physics that's right yes and

4466
02:34:34,239 --> 02:34:39,359
then in the but that's but so the idea

4467
02:34:36,639 --> 02:34:41,039
is that in this multi-computation setup

4468
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:43,280
that it's this idea of these multiple

4469
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:46,720
threads of time and models that are

4470
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:47,840
based on that and this is similar to

4471
02:34:46,719 --> 02:34:49,920
what people think about in

4472
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:51,600
non-deterministic computation so you

4473
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:53,200
have a turing machine usually it has a

4474
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:55,200
definite state it follows another state

4475
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:56,560
follows another state but typically what

4476
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:58,399
people have done when they thought about

4477
02:34:56,559 --> 02:34:59,840
these kinds of things is they've said

4478
02:34:58,398 --> 02:35:01,680
well there are all these possible paths

4479
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:03,600
a non-deterministic turing machine can

4480
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:05,040
follow all these possible paths but we

4481
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:06,960
just want one of them we just want the

4482
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:08,720
one that's the winner that factors the

4483
02:35:06,959 --> 02:35:09,919
number or whatever else

4484
02:35:08,719 --> 02:35:11,920
and similarly you know it's the same

4485
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:14,159
story in logic programming and so on but

4486
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:16,239
we say we've got this goal find us a

4487
02:35:14,159 --> 02:35:18,639
path to that goal i just want one path

4488
02:35:16,239 --> 02:35:20,478
then i'm happy or theorem proving same

4489
02:35:18,639 --> 02:35:21,439
story i just want one proof and then i'm

4490
02:35:20,478 --> 02:35:23,358
happy

4491
02:35:21,439 --> 02:35:24,398
what's happening in multi-computation in

4492
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:26,960
physics

4493
02:35:24,398 --> 02:35:28,959
is we actually care about many parts

4494
02:35:26,959 --> 02:35:30,879
and well there is a case for example

4495
02:35:28,959 --> 02:35:32,318
probabilistic programming is a version

4496
02:35:30,879 --> 02:35:34,000
of multi-computation in which you're

4497
02:35:32,318 --> 02:35:36,478
looking at all the paths you're just

4498
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:38,559
asking for probabilities of things um

4499
02:35:36,478 --> 02:35:40,799
but in a sense in physics we're taking

4500
02:35:38,559 --> 02:35:42,079
different kinds of samplings for example

4501
02:35:40,799 --> 02:35:44,239
in quantum mechanics we're taking a

4502
02:35:42,079 --> 02:35:45,760
different kind of sampling of all these

4503
02:35:44,239 --> 02:35:48,639
multiple paths

4504
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:50,639
and but the thing that is notable is

4505
02:35:48,639 --> 02:35:52,478
that when you are when you're an

4506
02:35:50,639 --> 02:35:53,680
observer embedded in this thing etc etc

4507
02:35:52,478 --> 02:35:55,358
etc

4508
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:57,840
with various other sort of footnotes and

4509
02:35:55,359 --> 02:36:00,159
so on it is inevitable

4510
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:01,760
that the thing that you parse out of

4511
02:36:00,159 --> 02:36:04,318
this system looks like general

4512
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:06,239
relativity and quantum mechanics um in

4513
02:36:04,318 --> 02:36:07,840
other words that just by the very

4514
02:36:06,239 --> 02:36:08,879
structure of this multi-computational

4515
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:11,280
setup

4516
02:36:08,879 --> 02:36:13,279
it inevitably is the case

4517
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:15,600
that you have certain

4518
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:18,159
emergent laws now

4519
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:19,760
why is this perhaps not surprising

4520
02:36:18,159 --> 02:36:21,280
in thermodynamics and statistical

4521
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:22,800
mechanics there are sort of inevitable

4522
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:25,040
emergent laws

4523
02:36:22,799 --> 02:36:26,959
of sort of gas dynamics that are

4524
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:29,200
independent of the of the details of the

4525
02:36:26,959 --> 02:36:31,599
molecular dynamics sort of the same kind

4526
02:36:29,200 --> 02:36:33,439
of thing but i think what happens is

4527
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:36,960
what's sort of a funny thing that i've

4528
02:36:33,439 --> 02:36:38,720
just been understanding very recently is

4529
02:36:36,959 --> 02:36:40,719
when when i kind of introduced this

4530
02:36:38,719 --> 02:36:43,679
whole sort of computational paradigm

4531
02:36:40,719 --> 02:36:45,119
complexity-ish thing back in the 80s it

4532
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:46,479
was kind of like a big downer because

4533
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:48,960
it's like there's a lot of stuff you

4534
02:36:46,478 --> 02:36:50,398
can't say about what systems will do

4535
02:36:48,959 --> 02:36:51,599
and then what i realized is and then you

4536
02:36:50,398 --> 02:36:53,760
might say now we've got

4537
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:55,280
multi-computation it's even worse you

4538
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:56,639
know it isn't just one thread of time

4539
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:57,760
that we can't explain it's all these

4540
02:36:56,639 --> 02:36:58,799
threads of time we can't explain

4541
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:01,120
anything

4542
02:36:58,799 --> 02:37:02,398
but the following thing happens

4543
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:04,640
because

4544
02:37:02,398 --> 02:37:06,639
there is all this irreducibility and any

4545
02:37:04,639 --> 02:37:09,039
detailed thing you might want to answer

4546
02:37:06,639 --> 02:37:11,199
it's very hard to answer but when you

4547
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:12,720
have an observer who has certain

4548
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:15,359
characteristics like computational

4549
02:37:12,719 --> 02:37:17,438
boundedness sequentiality of time and so

4550
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:19,520
on that observer

4551
02:37:17,439 --> 02:37:21,120
only samples certain aspects of this

4552
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:23,280
incredible complexity going on in this

4553
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:26,319
multi-computational system and that

4554
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:28,319
observer is sensitive only to

4555
02:37:26,318 --> 02:37:30,478
some underlying core structure of this

4556
02:37:28,318 --> 02:37:32,398
multi-computational system there is all

4557
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:34,719
this irreducible computation going on

4558
02:37:32,398 --> 02:37:37,680
all these details but to that kind of

4559
02:37:34,719 --> 02:37:39,920
observer what's important is only the

4560
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:42,639
the core structure of multi-computation

4561
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:45,359
which means that observer observes

4562
02:37:42,639 --> 02:37:47,358
comparatively simple laws and i think it

4563
02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:49,680
is inevitable that that observer

4564
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:51,439
observes laws which are mathematically

4565
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:53,359
structured like general relativity and

4566
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:55,439
quantum mechanics which by the way are

4567
02:37:53,359 --> 02:37:57,359
the same law in our in our model of

4568
02:37:55,439 --> 02:38:00,239
physics so that's an explanation why

4569
02:37:57,359 --> 02:38:02,880
there are simple laws that explain a lot

4570
02:38:00,239 --> 02:38:04,959
for this observer potentially yes but

4571
02:38:02,879 --> 02:38:06,959
the the place where this gets really

4572
02:38:04,959 --> 02:38:09,039
interesting is

4573
02:38:06,959 --> 02:38:10,719
there are all these fields of science

4574
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:12,399
where people have kind of gotten stuck

4575
02:38:10,719 --> 02:38:14,799
where they say we'd really love to have

4576
02:38:12,398 --> 02:38:16,478
a physics-like theory of economics we'd

4577
02:38:14,799 --> 02:38:17,920
really love to have a physics like lore

4578
02:38:16,478 --> 02:38:20,000
in linguistics

4579
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:22,239
we gotta talk about molecular biology

4580
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:24,398
here okay so what where where does

4581
02:38:22,239 --> 02:38:26,079
multi-computation come in for biology

4582
02:38:24,398 --> 02:38:27,680
economics is super interesting too but

4583
02:38:26,079 --> 02:38:29,439
biology okay let's talk about that so

4584
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:30,239
let's talk about chemistry for a second

4585
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:32,639
okay

4586
02:38:30,239 --> 02:38:33,920
so i mean i have to say you know this is

4587
02:38:32,639 --> 02:38:35,039
it's such a weird business for me

4588
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:36,960
because you know

4589
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:38,960
they're these kind of paradigmatic ideas

4590
02:38:36,959 --> 02:38:40,318
and then the actual applications and

4591
02:38:38,959 --> 02:38:41,599
it's like i've always said i i know

4592
02:38:40,318 --> 02:38:43,119
nothing about chemistry i learned all

4593
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:44,960
the chemistry i know you know the night

4594
02:38:43,120 --> 02:38:46,479
before some exam when i was 14 years old

4595
02:38:44,959 --> 02:38:48,239
but yeah but i've actually learned a

4596
02:38:46,478 --> 02:38:49,599
bunch more chemistry and in in more from

4597
02:38:48,239 --> 02:38:51,280
language these days we have really

4598
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:53,359
pretty nice symbolic representation of

4599
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:55,040
chemistry and in understanding the

4600
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:56,479
design of that i've actually i think

4601
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:57,840
learned a certain amount of chemistry

4602
02:38:56,478 --> 02:38:59,599
though if you quizzed me on sort of

4603
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:02,639
basic high school chemistry i would

4604
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:04,720
probably totally fail but um uh but but

4605
02:39:02,639 --> 02:39:07,279
okay so what is chemistry i mean

4606
02:39:04,719 --> 02:39:09,760
chemistry is sort of a story of you know

4607
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:11,040
chemical reactions are like you've got

4608
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:13,280
this particular chemical it's

4609
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:15,120
represented as some graph of you know

4610
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:17,359
these are these are this configuration

4611
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:19,680
of molecules with these bonds and so on

4612
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:21,680
and a chemical reaction happens you've

4613
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:23,040
got these sort of two graphs they

4614
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:24,880
interact in some way you get another

4615
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:27,120
graph or multiple other graphs out so

4616
02:39:24,879 --> 02:39:29,039
that's kind of the the the the sort of

4617
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:31,439
the the abstract view of what's

4618
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:33,840
happening in chemistry and so when you

4619
02:39:31,439 --> 02:39:35,920
do a chemical synthesis for example you

4620
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:38,159
are given certain sort of these are

4621
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:40,398
possible reactions that can happen and

4622
02:39:38,159 --> 02:39:42,398
you're asked can you piece together this

4623
02:39:40,398 --> 02:39:44,478
a sequence of such reactions a sequence

4624
02:39:42,398 --> 02:39:45,680
of such sort of axiomatic reactions

4625
02:39:44,478 --> 02:39:47,519
usually called name reactions in

4626
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:50,079
chemistry can you piece together a

4627
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:52,399
sequence of these reactions so that you

4628
02:39:50,079 --> 02:39:54,079
get out at the end this great molecule

4629
02:39:52,398 --> 02:39:55,519
you were trying to synthesize and so

4630
02:39:54,079 --> 02:39:58,000
that's a story very much like theorem

4631
02:39:55,520 --> 02:39:59,680
proving and people have done

4632
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:01,600
actually they started in the 1960s

4633
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:02,880
looking at at kind of the theorem

4634
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:05,120
proving approach to that although it

4635
02:40:02,879 --> 02:40:07,599
didn't really it didn't it didn't uh was

4636
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:09,040
sort of done too early i think um but

4637
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:10,880
anyway so that's kind of the view is

4638
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:12,960
that that chemistry chemical reactions

4639
02:40:10,879 --> 02:40:15,759
are the story of of all these different

4640
02:40:12,959 --> 02:40:17,679
sort of paths of possible things that go

4641
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:21,040
on okay let's let's go to an even lower

4642
02:40:17,680 --> 02:40:23,600
level let's say instead of asking about

4643
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:25,040
uh which species of molecules we're

4644
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:27,040
talking about let's look at individual

4645
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:29,040
molecules and let's say we're looking at

4646
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:31,040
individual molecules and they are having

4647
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:32,800
chemical reactions and we're building up

4648
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:35,439
this big graph of all these reactions

4649
02:40:32,799 --> 02:40:37,199
that are happening okay so so then we've

4650
02:40:35,439 --> 02:40:40,398
got this big graph and by the way that

4651
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:43,359
big graph is incredibly similar to these

4652
02:40:40,398 --> 02:40:44,799
hypergraph rewriting things um in fact

4653
02:40:43,359 --> 02:40:46,318
in the underlying theory of

4654
02:40:44,799 --> 02:40:48,478
multi-computation there are these things

4655
02:40:46,318 --> 02:40:51,199
we call token event graphs which are

4656
02:40:48,478 --> 02:40:53,199
basically you've broken your state into

4657
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:55,200
tokens like in the case of a hypergraph

4658
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:57,359
you've broken it into hyperedges and

4659
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:59,439
each event is just consuming some number

4660
02:40:57,359 --> 02:41:01,359
of tokens and producing some number of

4661
02:40:59,439 --> 02:41:04,479
tokens yeah but then you have to there's

4662
02:41:01,359 --> 02:41:06,000
a lot of work to be done on update rules

4663
02:41:04,478 --> 02:41:08,478
in terms of what they actually are for

4664
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:11,120
chemistry yeah what they are for our

4665
02:41:08,478 --> 02:41:12,559
observed chemistry yes indeed yes indeed

4666
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:14,479
we've been working on that actually

4667
02:41:12,559 --> 02:41:16,159
because we have this beautiful system in

4668
02:41:14,478 --> 02:41:17,679
wolfram language for representing

4669
02:41:16,159 --> 02:41:19,520
chemistry symbolically so we actually

4670
02:41:17,680 --> 02:41:20,800
have you know this is a this is an

4671
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:22,640
ongoing thing to actually figure out

4672
02:41:20,799 --> 02:41:24,959
what they are for some practical cases

4673
02:41:22,639 --> 02:41:27,039
does that require human injection or can

4674
02:41:24,959 --> 02:41:29,519
it be automatically discovered

4675
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:30,640
these update rules well if we implement

4676
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:31,920
chemistry better we could probably

4677
02:41:30,639 --> 02:41:34,959
discover them automatically but i think

4678
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:36,639
in in reality right now it's like there

4679
02:41:34,959 --> 02:41:38,398
are these particular reactions and

4680
02:41:36,639 --> 02:41:39,358
really to understand what's going on

4681
02:41:38,398 --> 02:41:42,239
we're probably going to pick a

4682
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:43,520
particular subtype of chemistry and just

4683
02:41:42,239 --> 02:41:44,559
because because let me explain where

4684
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:46,640
this is going

4685
02:41:44,559 --> 02:41:48,559
the place that here's here's where this

4686
02:41:46,639 --> 02:41:50,159
is going so

4687
02:41:48,559 --> 02:41:52,079
we got this whole network of all these

4688
02:41:50,159 --> 02:41:53,039
molecules having all these reactions and

4689
02:41:52,079 --> 02:41:54,398
so on

4690
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:57,279
and this is some whole

4691
02:41:54,398 --> 02:41:58,719
multi-computational story because each

4692
02:41:57,279 --> 02:42:01,120
each uh

4693
02:41:58,719 --> 02:42:02,559
sort of chemical reaction event is its

4694
02:42:01,120 --> 02:42:04,160
own separate event where we're saying

4695
02:42:02,559 --> 02:42:06,559
they all happen asynchronously we're not

4696
02:42:04,159 --> 02:42:08,079
describing in what order they happen you

4697
02:42:06,559 --> 02:42:09,760
know maybe that order is governed by

4698
02:42:08,079 --> 02:42:11,359
some quantum mechanics thing doesn't

4699
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:13,920
really matter we're just saying they

4700
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:16,159
happen in some order and then we ask

4701
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:18,318
what is the what what's the you know how

4702
02:42:16,159 --> 02:42:20,159
do we think about the system well

4703
02:42:18,318 --> 02:42:21,920
this thing is some kind of big

4704
02:42:20,159 --> 02:42:24,000
multi-computational system the question

4705
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:26,318
is what is the chemical observer

4706
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:27,920
and one possible chemical observer is

4707
02:42:26,318 --> 02:42:29,840
all you care about is did you make that

4708
02:42:27,920 --> 02:42:31,680
particular drug molecule you're just

4709
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:33,520
asking you know the for the one path

4710
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:35,200
another thing you might care about is i

4711
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:36,479
want to know the concentration of each

4712
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:38,960
species

4713
02:42:36,478 --> 02:42:40,000
right i want to know you know at every

4714
02:42:38,959 --> 02:42:41,438
stage i'm going to solve the

4715
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,959
differential equations that represent

4716
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:45,200
the concentrations and i want to know

4717
02:42:42,959 --> 02:42:47,438
what those all are but there's more

4718
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:49,279
because when and it's kind of like

4719
02:42:47,439 --> 02:42:51,120
you're going below in statistical

4720
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:54,000
mechanics there's kind of all these

4721
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:54,960
molecules bouncing around and you might

4722
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,318
say

4723
02:42:54,959 --> 02:42:58,318
we're just going to ignore we're just

4724
02:42:56,318 --> 02:43:00,079
going to look at the aggregate

4725
02:42:58,318 --> 02:43:01,600
densities of certain kinds of molecules

4726
02:43:00,079 --> 02:43:03,760
but you can look at a lower level you

4727
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:06,479
can look at this whole graph of possible

4728
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:07,439
interactions and so the kind of the idea

4729
02:43:06,478 --> 02:43:09,519
would be

4730
02:43:07,439 --> 02:43:10,639
what you know is the only chemical

4731
02:43:09,520 --> 02:43:12,079
observer

4732
02:43:10,639 --> 02:43:14,079
one who just cares about overall

4733
02:43:12,079 --> 02:43:16,159
concentrations or can there be a

4734
02:43:14,079 --> 02:43:19,439
chemical observer who cares about this

4735
02:43:16,159 --> 02:43:21,279
network of what happened and so that

4736
02:43:19,439 --> 02:43:23,359
the question then is so let me give an

4737
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:25,120
analogy so this is where i think this is

4738
02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:26,640
potentially very relevant to molecular

4739
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:27,760
molecular biology and molecular

4740
02:43:26,639 --> 02:43:29,680
computing

4741
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:32,880
uh when we think about a computation

4742
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:34,720
usually we say it's input it's output we

4743
02:43:32,879 --> 02:43:36,079
you know or chemistry we say there's

4744
02:43:34,719 --> 02:43:37,920
this input we're going to make this

4745
02:43:36,079 --> 02:43:38,799
molecule as the output

4746
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:41,359
but

4747
02:43:38,799 --> 02:43:43,278
what if what we actually encode what if

4748
02:43:41,359 --> 02:43:45,520
our computation whatever the thing we

4749
02:43:43,279 --> 02:43:46,479
care about is some part of this dynamic

4750
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:48,159
network

4751
02:43:46,478 --> 02:43:49,358
what if it isn't just the input and the

4752
02:43:48,159 --> 02:43:51,119
output that we care about what if

4753
02:43:49,359 --> 02:43:53,040
there's some dynamics of the network

4754
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:55,200
that we care about now imagine you're a

4755
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:58,160
chemical observer what is a chemical

4756
02:43:55,200 --> 02:44:00,159
observer well in molecular biology there

4757
02:43:58,159 --> 02:44:02,639
are all kinds of weird sorts of

4758
02:44:00,159 --> 02:44:04,159
observers there are membranes that exist

4759
02:44:02,639 --> 02:44:06,159
that have you know different kinds of

4760
02:44:04,159 --> 02:44:09,039
molecules that can bind to them things

4761
02:44:06,159 --> 02:44:10,879
like this it's not obvious that the from

4762
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:12,720
a human scale we just measure the

4763
02:44:10,879 --> 02:44:15,358
concentration of something is the

4764
02:44:12,719 --> 02:44:16,719
relevant story we can imagine that for

4765
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:18,479
example when we look at this whole

4766
02:44:16,719 --> 02:44:20,159
network of possible reactions

4767
02:44:18,478 --> 02:44:21,840
we can imagine you know at a physical

4768
02:44:20,159 --> 02:44:23,600
level we can imagine well what was the

4769
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:25,680
actual momentum direction of that of

4770
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:27,040
that molecule what was it which we don't

4771
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:28,880
pay any attention to when we were just

4772
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:30,240
talking about chemical concentrations

4773
02:44:28,879 --> 02:44:32,478
what was the orientation of that

4774
02:44:30,239 --> 02:44:34,639
molecule these kinds of things

4775
02:44:32,478 --> 02:44:37,119
and so here's here's the place where i'm

4776
02:44:34,639 --> 02:44:39,358
i have a little suspicion okay so one of

4777
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:40,560
the questions in biology is what matters

4778
02:44:39,359 --> 02:44:41,840
in biology

4779
02:44:40,559 --> 02:44:43,840
and that is you know we have all these

4780
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:46,398
chemical reactions we have all these all

4781
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:48,398
these molecular processes going on in

4782
02:44:46,398 --> 02:44:49,599
you know in biological systems what

4783
02:44:48,398 --> 02:44:52,239
matters

4784
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:54,880
and you know one of the things is to be

4785
02:44:52,239 --> 02:44:56,478
able to tell what matters well so a big

4786
02:44:54,879 --> 02:44:58,799
story of the what mata's question was

4787
02:44:56,478 --> 02:45:01,679
what happened in genetics in 1953 when

4788
02:44:58,799 --> 02:45:03,119
dna was figured out how dna worked

4789
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:04,479
because before that time you know

4790
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:06,479
genetics have been all these different

4791
02:45:04,478 --> 02:45:09,039
effects and complicated things and then

4792
02:45:06,478 --> 02:45:11,278
it was realized ah there's something new

4793
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:13,439
a molecule can store information which

4794
02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:14,960
wasn't obvious before that time a single

4795
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:16,720
molecule can store information so

4796
02:45:14,959 --> 02:45:18,559
there's a place where there can be

4797
02:45:16,719 --> 02:45:20,879
something important that's happening in

4798
02:45:18,559 --> 02:45:22,398
molecular biology and it's just in the

4799
02:45:20,879 --> 02:45:23,358
sequence that's storing information in a

4800
02:45:22,398 --> 02:45:26,318
molecule

4801
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:29,200
so the possibility now is imagine this

4802
02:45:26,318 --> 02:45:31,199
dynamic network this uh you know causal

4803
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:33,279
graphs and multi-way causal graphs and

4804
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:35,120
so on that represent all of these

4805
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:37,279
different reactions between molecules

4806
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:39,040
what if there is some aspect of that

4807
02:45:37,279 --> 02:45:41,040
that is storing information that's

4808
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:43,279
relevant for molecular biology

4809
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:45,520
in the dynamic aspect of that yes that's

4810
02:45:43,279 --> 02:45:48,239
right so that it's similar to how the

4811
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:49,760
structure of a dna molecule

4812
02:45:48,239 --> 02:45:51,840
stores information it could be the

4813
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:53,600
dynamics of the system somehow stores

4814
02:45:51,840 --> 02:45:56,318
information and this

4815
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:58,800
kind of process might allow you to give

4816
02:45:56,318 --> 02:46:00,959
predictions of what that would be well

4817
02:45:58,799 --> 02:46:02,079
yes but also imagine that you're trying

4818
02:46:00,959 --> 02:46:04,000
to do

4819
02:46:02,079 --> 02:46:06,799
for example imagine you're trying to do

4820
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:07,840
molecular computation okay you might

4821
02:46:06,799 --> 02:46:09,679
think the way we're going to do

4822
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:10,639
molecular computation is we're just

4823
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:11,760
going to run the thing we're going to

4824
02:46:10,639 --> 02:46:13,439
see what came out we're going to see

4825
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:15,200
what molecule came out

4826
02:46:13,439 --> 02:46:17,359
this is saying that's not the only thing

4827
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:18,960
you can do there is a different kind of

4828
02:46:17,359 --> 02:46:21,920
chemical observer that you can imagine

4829
02:46:18,959 --> 02:46:24,318
constructing which is somehow sensitive

4830
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:25,680
to this dynamic network exactly how that

4831
02:46:24,318 --> 02:46:28,079
works how we make that measurement i

4832
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:30,720
don't know but i have a few ideas but

4833
02:46:28,079 --> 02:46:32,639
but um that that's what's important so

4834
02:46:30,719 --> 02:46:34,000
to speak and that that means and by the

4835
02:46:32,639 --> 02:46:36,318
way you can do the same thing even for

4836
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:39,040
touring machines you can say if you have

4837
02:46:36,318 --> 02:46:40,559
a multi-way turing machine you can say

4838
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:42,399
how do you compute with a multi-way

4839
02:46:40,559 --> 02:46:43,680
turing machine you cut you can't say

4840
02:46:42,398 --> 02:46:45,680
well we've got this input and this

4841
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:47,279
output because the thing has all these

4842
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:49,200
threads of time and it's got lots of

4843
02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:50,960
outputs and so then you say well what

4844
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:52,880
does it even mean to be a universal

4845
02:46:50,959 --> 02:46:54,719
multi-way touring machine i don't fully

4846
02:46:52,879 --> 02:46:57,199
know the answer to that but it has an

4847
02:46:54,719 --> 02:46:58,079
interesting idea freak touring out for

4848
02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:00,640
sure

4849
02:46:58,079 --> 02:47:02,879
because then uh the dynamics of the the

4850
02:47:00,639 --> 02:47:06,079
trajectory of the computation matters

4851
02:47:02,879 --> 02:47:08,239
yes yes i mean but but the thing is that

4852
02:47:06,079 --> 02:47:10,000
that so this is again a story of what's

4853
02:47:08,239 --> 02:47:11,920
the observer so to speak in chemistry

4854
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:13,840
what's what's the observer there now to

4855
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:16,960
give an example of of where that might

4856
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:20,398
matter a very uh sort of uh present day

4857
02:47:16,959 --> 02:47:22,478
example is in immunology um

4858
02:47:20,398 --> 02:47:23,840
where you know we have whatever it is

4859
02:47:22,478 --> 02:47:26,398
you know 10 billion different kinds of

4860
02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:28,639
antibodies that are you know all these

4861
02:47:26,398 --> 02:47:29,920
different shapes and so on we have i'm a

4862
02:47:28,639 --> 02:47:33,119
trillion different kinds of t cell

4863
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:34,960
receptors that we can that we produce

4864
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:37,680
and you know the the traditional theory

4865
02:47:34,959 --> 02:47:39,919
of immunology is this clonal selection

4866
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:41,520
theory where we're constantly producing

4867
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:43,439
randomly producing all these different

4868
02:47:41,520 --> 02:47:45,760
antibodies and as soon as one of those

4869
02:47:43,439 --> 02:47:47,200
binds to an antigen then that one gets

4870
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:48,800
amplified and we produce more of that

4871
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:52,079
antibody and so on

4872
02:47:48,799 --> 02:47:53,840
um back in the 1960s um

4873
02:47:52,079 --> 02:47:56,000
immunologist called nilsiona who was the

4874
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:58,559
guy who invented monoclonal antibodies

4875
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:00,159
various other things um kind of had this

4876
02:47:58,559 --> 02:48:01,439
network theory of the immune system

4877
02:48:00,159 --> 02:48:02,398
where it would be like well we produce

4878
02:48:01,439 --> 02:48:04,479
antibodies

4879
02:48:02,398 --> 02:48:06,079
but then we produce antibodies to the

4880
02:48:04,478 --> 02:48:08,239
antibodies anti-antibodies and we

4881
02:48:06,079 --> 02:48:10,079
produce anti-anti-antibodies and we get

4882
02:48:08,239 --> 02:48:11,680
this whole dynamic network of

4883
02:48:10,079 --> 02:48:13,120
interactions between different immune

4884
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:15,840
system cells

4885
02:48:13,120 --> 02:48:18,960
and that was that that was kind of a

4886
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:20,239
qualitative theory at that time and it's

4887
02:48:18,959 --> 02:48:21,599
i've been a little disappointed because

4888
02:48:20,239 --> 02:48:23,760
i've been studying immunology a bit

4889
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:25,439
recently and i i knew something about

4890
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:27,040
this like 35 years ago or something and

4891
02:48:25,439 --> 02:48:28,239
i knew you know i'd read a bunch of the

4892
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:30,720
books and i talked to a bunch of the

4893
02:48:28,239 --> 02:48:33,520
people and so on and it was like

4894
02:48:30,719 --> 02:48:35,438
an emerging theoretical immunology world

4895
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:37,200
and then i look at the books now and

4896
02:48:35,439 --> 02:48:38,720
they're very thick because they've got

4897
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:40,640
you know there's just a ton known about

4898
02:48:38,719 --> 02:48:42,159
immunology and you know all these

4899
02:48:40,639 --> 02:48:44,639
different pathways all these different

4900
02:48:42,159 --> 02:48:46,639
details and so on but the theoretical

4901
02:48:44,639 --> 02:48:47,358
sections seem to have shrunk

4902
02:48:46,639 --> 02:48:50,719
um

4903
02:48:47,359 --> 02:48:53,120
and so it's um so the question is

4904
02:48:50,719 --> 02:48:54,239
what you know for example immune memory

4905
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:56,240
where is the where does the immune

4906
02:48:54,239 --> 02:48:58,239
memory reside is it actually some cell

4907
02:48:56,239 --> 02:48:59,760
sitting in our bone marrow that is you

4908
02:48:58,239 --> 02:49:01,600
know living for the whole of our lives

4909
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:04,079
that's going to spring into action as

4910
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:05,600
soon as we're shown the same antigen or

4911
02:49:04,079 --> 02:49:07,439
is it something different from that is

4912
02:49:05,600 --> 02:49:08,960
it something more dynamic is it

4913
02:49:07,439 --> 02:49:10,398
something more like some network of

4914
02:49:08,959 --> 02:49:12,719
interactions between these different

4915
02:49:10,398 --> 02:49:14,478
kinds of immune system cells and so on

4916
02:49:12,719 --> 02:49:16,079
and it's known that there are plenty of

4917
02:49:14,478 --> 02:49:18,879
interactions between t cells and you

4918
02:49:16,079 --> 02:49:20,719
know there's plenty of dynamics but what

4919
02:49:18,879 --> 02:49:23,119
the consequence of that dynamics is is

4920
02:49:20,719 --> 02:49:26,000
not clear and to have a qualitative

4921
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:27,760
theory for that doesn't it doesn't seem

4922
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:29,200
to exist in fact i was just just been

4923
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:30,719
trying to study this so i'm quite

4924
02:49:29,200 --> 02:49:32,399
incomplete in my study of these things

4925
02:49:30,719 --> 02:49:34,079
but i was a little bit taken aback

4926
02:49:32,398 --> 02:49:35,439
because i i've been looking at these

4927
02:49:34,079 --> 02:49:36,639
things and it's like and then they get

4928
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:38,479
to the end where they have the most

4929
02:49:36,639 --> 02:49:39,920
advanced theory that they've got and it

4930
02:49:38,478 --> 02:49:41,438
turns out it's a cellular automaton

4931
02:49:39,920 --> 02:49:43,439
theory um

4932
02:49:41,439 --> 02:49:46,079
it's like uh okay well at least i

4933
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:48,159
understand that theory yeah um but but

4934
02:49:46,079 --> 02:49:50,959
uh you know i think that the possibility

4935
02:49:48,159 --> 02:49:52,719
is that in um

4936
02:49:50,959 --> 02:49:54,639
uh this is a place where if you want to

4937
02:49:52,719 --> 02:49:56,799
know you know explain roughly how the

4938
02:49:54,639 --> 02:49:59,680
immune system works it ends up being

4939
02:49:56,799 --> 02:50:02,000
this dynamic network and then the the

4940
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:04,159
you know the immune consciousness so to

4941
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:06,239
speak the observer ends up being

4942
02:50:04,159 --> 02:50:07,840
something that you know in the end it's

4943
02:50:06,239 --> 02:50:10,398
kind of like does the human get sick or

4944
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:12,799
whatever but it's a it's something which

4945
02:50:10,398 --> 02:50:14,639
is a complicated story that relates to

4946
02:50:12,799 --> 02:50:16,478
this whole sort of dynamic network and

4947
02:50:14,639 --> 02:50:18,559
so on and i think that's another place

4948
02:50:16,478 --> 02:50:20,239
where this kind of notion of

4949
02:50:18,559 --> 02:50:21,600
where i think multi-computation has the

4950
02:50:20,239 --> 02:50:23,600
possibility

4951
02:50:21,600 --> 02:50:25,120
see one of the things okay you can end

4952
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:27,120
up with something where yes there is a

4953
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:28,800
general relativity in there there but it

4954
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:30,720
turns up but it may turn out that the

4955
02:50:28,799 --> 02:50:32,318
observer who

4956
02:50:30,719 --> 02:50:34,478
sees general relativity in the immune

4957
02:50:32,318 --> 02:50:36,079
system is an observer that's irrelevant

4958
02:50:34,478 --> 02:50:37,920
to what we care about about the immune

4959
02:50:36,079 --> 02:50:40,318
system i mean it could be yes there is

4960
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:42,799
some effect where you know there's some

4961
02:50:40,318 --> 02:50:44,639
you know time dilation of t cells

4962
02:50:42,799 --> 02:50:46,639
interacting with whatever but it's like

4963
02:50:44,639 --> 02:50:48,398
that's an effect that's just irrelevant

4964
02:50:46,639 --> 02:50:49,840
and the thing we actually care about is

4965
02:50:48,398 --> 02:50:51,760
things about you know

4966
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:53,760
what happens when you have a vaccine

4967
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:55,359
that goes into some place in shape space

4968
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:57,120
and you know how does that affect other

4969
02:50:55,359 --> 02:50:59,040
places in shape space and how does that

4970
02:50:57,120 --> 02:51:00,640
spread you know what's the what's the

4971
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:02,240
analog of the speed of light in shape

4972
02:51:00,639 --> 02:51:03,920
space for example that's and that's an

4973
02:51:02,239 --> 02:51:05,920
important issue if you have one of these

4974
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:08,159
dynamic theories it's like you you know

4975
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:09,760
you you poke into shape space by having

4976
02:51:08,159 --> 02:51:11,359
you know let's say a vaccine or

4977
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:13,920
something that has a particular

4978
02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:16,239
configuration in shape space how how

4979
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:18,960
quickly as this dynamic network spreads

4980
02:51:16,239 --> 02:51:20,318
out how quickly do you get sort of other

4981
02:51:18,959 --> 02:51:21,599
antibodies

4982
02:51:20,318 --> 02:51:22,879
in different places in shape space

4983
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:23,920
things like that when you say shape

4984
02:51:22,879 --> 02:51:26,398
space you mean the shape of the

4985
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:27,520
molecules or those and then so this is

4986
02:51:26,398 --> 02:51:28,879
like uh

4987
02:51:27,520 --> 02:51:30,880
it could be deeply connected to the

4988
02:51:28,879 --> 02:51:33,119
protein and multi-protein folding all of

4989
02:51:30,879 --> 02:51:34,719
that kind of stuff to be able to say

4990
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:37,040
something interesting about the the

4991
02:51:34,719 --> 02:51:40,079
dance of proteins that right exactly

4992
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:41,040
that actually has an impact on

4993
02:51:40,079 --> 02:51:43,520
um

4994
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:44,800
helping develop drugs for example or has

4995
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:47,760
an impact on

4996
02:51:44,799 --> 02:51:50,478
virology immunology helping too i think

4997
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:52,318
the big thing is you know when we think

4998
02:51:50,478 --> 02:51:55,119
about molecular biology

4999
02:51:52,318 --> 02:51:57,039
the um uh you know what what is the

5000
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:58,640
qualitative way to think about it you

5001
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:01,439
know in other words is it chemical

5002
02:51:58,639 --> 02:52:03,840
reaction networks right is it you know

5003
02:52:01,439 --> 02:52:05,920
genetics you know dna

5004
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:07,760
big you know big news it's kind of

5005
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:09,680
there's a digital aspect to the whole

5006
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:11,760
thing you know what is the qualitative

5007
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:14,079
way to think about how things work in

5008
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:15,600
biology um you know when we think about

5009
02:52:14,079 --> 02:52:17,359
i don't know some phenomenon like aging

5010
02:52:15,600 --> 02:52:18,720
or something which is a big complicated

5011
02:52:17,359 --> 02:52:20,880
phenomenon which just seems to have all

5012
02:52:18,719 --> 02:52:22,879
these different tentacles is it really

5013
02:52:20,879 --> 02:52:25,679
the case that that can be thought about

5014
02:52:22,879 --> 02:52:27,519
in some you know without dna when people

5015
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:28,398
were describing you know genetic

5016
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:30,239
phenomena

5017
02:52:28,398 --> 02:52:31,680
there were you know dominant recessive

5018
02:52:30,239 --> 02:52:33,920
this that and the other got very very

5019
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:36,000
complicated and then people realized oh

5020
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:37,920
it's just you know and and what is a

5021
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:39,760
gene and so on and so on and so on then

5022
02:52:37,920 --> 02:52:41,439
people realize it's just base pairs and

5023
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:42,719
there's this digital representation and

5024
02:52:41,439 --> 02:52:45,040
so the question is what is the

5025
02:52:42,719 --> 02:52:46,398
overarching representation that we can

5026
02:52:45,040 --> 02:52:48,080
now start to think about using a

5027
02:52:46,398 --> 02:52:50,000
microbiology i don't know how this will

5028
02:52:48,079 --> 02:52:52,159
work out and this is again one of these

5029
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:54,559
things where and and the place where

5030
02:52:52,159 --> 02:52:56,959
that gets important is you know maybe

5031
02:52:54,559 --> 02:53:00,398
molecular biology is doing molecular

5032
02:52:56,959 --> 02:53:02,559
computing by using some dynamic process

5033
02:53:00,398 --> 02:53:04,559
that is something where it is very

5034
02:53:02,559 --> 02:53:06,000
happily saying oh i just got a result

5035
02:53:04,559 --> 02:53:07,439
it's in the dynamic structure of this

5036
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,520
network now i'm going to go and do some

5037
02:53:07,439 --> 02:53:11,439
other thing based on that result for

5038
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:13,120
example but we're like oh i don't know

5039
02:53:11,439 --> 02:53:15,040
what's going on you know it's just we

5040
02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:16,640
just measured them levels of these

5041
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:18,479
chemicals and we couldn't conclude

5042
02:53:16,639 --> 02:53:20,879
anything but it just we're looking at

5043
02:53:18,478 --> 02:53:22,879
the wrong thing and and so that's the

5044
02:53:20,879 --> 02:53:24,959
that's kind of the the the potential

5045
02:53:22,879 --> 02:53:27,679
there and it's it's um i mean these

5046
02:53:24,959 --> 02:53:30,478
things are i don't know it's it's for me

5047
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:32,159
it's it's like i've not really that was

5048
02:53:30,478 --> 02:53:34,079
not a view i mean i've thought about

5049
02:53:32,159 --> 02:53:36,079
molecular computing for ages and ages

5050
02:53:34,079 --> 02:53:38,318
and ages and i've always imagined that

5051
02:53:36,079 --> 02:53:40,559
the big story is kind of the the

5052
02:53:38,318 --> 02:53:42,318
original promise of nanotechnology of

5053
02:53:40,559 --> 02:53:44,478
like can we make a molecular scale

5054
02:53:42,318 --> 02:53:46,639
constructor that will just build build a

5055
02:53:44,478 --> 02:53:48,959
molecule in any shape but i don't think

5056
02:53:46,639 --> 02:53:50,879
i i'm now increasingly concluding that's

5057
02:53:48,959 --> 02:53:52,799
not the big point the big point is

5058
02:53:50,879 --> 02:53:54,799
something more dynamic that will be an

5059
02:53:52,799 --> 02:53:57,599
interesting end point for any of these

5060
02:53:54,799 --> 02:53:59,039
things but that's perhaps not the thing

5061
02:53:57,600 --> 02:54:00,720
you know because the one example we have

5062
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:03,359
molecular computing that's really

5063
02:54:00,719 --> 02:54:05,358
working is us biological organisms

5064
02:54:03,359 --> 02:54:08,079
and you know maybe the thing that's

5065
02:54:05,359 --> 02:54:09,920
important there is not uh this you know

5066
02:54:08,079 --> 02:54:11,840
what chemicals do you make so to speak

5067
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:13,279
but more this kind of dynamic process

5068
02:54:11,840 --> 02:54:15,120
it's a dynamic process and then you can

5069
02:54:13,279 --> 02:54:16,800
have a good model like the hypergraph to

5070
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:17,920
to then explore

5071
02:54:16,799 --> 02:54:18,959
ex

5072
02:54:17,920 --> 02:54:20,799
what like

5073
02:54:18,959 --> 02:54:22,719
simulate again make predictions and if

5074
02:54:20,799 --> 02:54:25,199
they i think just have a way to reason

5075
02:54:22,719 --> 02:54:27,438
about biology i mean it's it's hard you

5076
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:29,359
know but first of all biology doesn't

5077
02:54:27,439 --> 02:54:31,600
have theories like physics you know

5078
02:54:29,359 --> 02:54:34,159
physics is a much more successful sort

5079
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:36,159
of global theory kind of kind of area

5080
02:54:34,159 --> 02:54:37,680
you know biology what are the global

5081
02:54:36,159 --> 02:54:39,520
theories of biology pretty much

5082
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:41,680
darwinian evolution that's the only

5083
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:43,600
global theory of biology you know other

5084
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:45,520
any other theory is just a well the

5085
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:47,920
kidneys work this way this thing works

5086
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:49,200
this way and so on there isn't i suppose

5087
02:54:47,920 --> 02:54:51,600
another global theory is digital

5088
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:53,840
information in dna that's another sort

5089
02:54:51,600 --> 02:54:57,439
of global fact about biology but the the

5090
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:59,760
difficult thing to do is to match

5091
02:54:57,439 --> 02:55:01,680
something you uh have a model of in the

5092
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:03,359
hyper graph to the actual like how do

5093
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:04,559
you discover the theory

5094
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:05,920
how do you how do you discover the

5095
02:55:04,559 --> 02:55:08,159
theory okay you have something that

5096
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:10,960
looks nice and makes sense but like you

5097
02:55:08,159 --> 02:55:13,200
have to match it to validation oh sure

5098
02:55:10,959 --> 02:55:15,278
right and that's tricky because you're

5099
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:17,680
walking around in the dark

5100
02:55:15,279 --> 02:55:19,359
not entirely i mean so so you know for

5101
02:55:17,680 --> 02:55:21,439
example in what we've been trying to

5102
02:55:19,359 --> 02:55:24,399
think about is take actual chemical

5103
02:55:21,439 --> 02:55:27,040
reactions okay so you know one of my one

5104
02:55:24,398 --> 02:55:29,278
of my goals is can i compute the primes

5105
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:31,840
with molecules okay that's if i can do

5106
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:32,720
that then i kind of maybe i can compute

5107
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:34,559
things

5108
02:55:32,719 --> 02:55:36,799
and you know there's this nice automated

5109
02:55:34,559 --> 02:55:38,239
lab these guys this emerald cloud lab

5110
02:55:36,799 --> 02:55:40,719
people are built with wolfram language

5111
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:42,000
and so on that's an actual physical lab

5112
02:55:40,719 --> 02:55:44,079
and you send it a piece of wolf and

5113
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:46,000
language code and it goes and you know

5114
02:55:44,079 --> 02:55:48,239
actually does physical experiments and

5115
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:50,478
so one of my one of my goals because i'm

5116
02:55:48,239 --> 02:55:52,959
not a test tube kind of guy i'm more of

5117
02:55:50,478 --> 02:55:54,639
a software kind of person is can i make

5118
02:55:52,959 --> 02:55:56,959
something where you know in this

5119
02:55:54,639 --> 02:55:58,879
automated lab we can actually get it so

5120
02:55:56,959 --> 02:56:02,478
that there's some gel that we made and

5121
02:55:58,879 --> 02:56:02,478
you know the positions of the stripes

5122
02:56:02,799 --> 02:56:06,559
i mean that would be that would be an

5123
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:08,079
example of of where and that would be

5124
02:56:06,559 --> 02:56:10,559
with a particular

5125
02:56:08,079 --> 02:56:12,478
uh you know framework for actually doing

5126
02:56:10,559 --> 02:56:14,239
the molecular computing you know with

5127
02:56:12,478 --> 02:56:16,398
particular kinds of molecules and and

5128
02:56:14,239 --> 02:56:18,000
there's a lot of kind of ambient

5129
02:56:16,398 --> 02:56:19,920
technological mess so to speak

5130
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:22,000
associated with oh is it carbon is it

5131
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:24,000
this is that you know is it important

5132
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:25,279
that there's a bromine atom here et

5133
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:27,279
cetera et cetera et cetera this is all

5134
02:56:25,279 --> 02:56:29,760
chemistry that i don't know much about

5135
02:56:27,279 --> 02:56:31,600
um and you know that's that's a sort of

5136
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:33,439
you know unfortunately that's down at

5137
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:35,359
the level you know i i would like to be

5138
02:56:33,439 --> 02:56:37,520
at the software level not at the level

5139
02:56:35,359 --> 02:56:39,279
of the transistors so to speak but in

5140
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:40,560
chemistry you know there's a certain

5141
02:56:39,279 --> 02:56:43,120
amount we have to do i think at the

5142
02:56:40,559 --> 02:56:44,879
level of transistors before we get up to

5143
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:46,880
being able to do it although you know

5144
02:56:44,879 --> 02:56:48,559
automated labs certainly help in in

5145
02:56:46,879 --> 02:56:50,000
setting that up

5146
02:56:48,559 --> 02:56:53,039
i talked to

5147
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:54,719
a guy named charles hoskinson

5148
02:56:53,040 --> 02:56:55,680
he mentioned that he's collaborating

5149
02:56:54,719 --> 02:56:57,519
with you

5150
02:56:55,680 --> 02:57:00,159
he's an interesting guy he sends me

5151
02:56:57,520 --> 02:57:02,079
papers on uh speaking of automated

5152
02:57:00,159 --> 02:57:04,719
theorem proving a lot he's exceptionally

5153
02:57:02,079 --> 02:57:06,478
well read on that area as well so what's

5154
02:57:04,719 --> 02:57:08,559
the nature of your collaboration with

5155
02:57:06,478 --> 02:57:10,398
him he's the creator of cardano what's

5156
02:57:08,559 --> 02:57:11,359
the nature of the color collaboration

5157
02:57:10,398 --> 02:57:12,959
between

5158
02:57:11,359 --> 02:57:15,200
cardano and the whole space of

5159
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:17,278
blockchain and wolfram or from alpha or

5160
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:20,159
from blockchain all that kind of stuff

5161
02:57:17,279 --> 02:57:23,200
well okay we're segueing to a

5162
02:57:20,159 --> 02:57:25,200
slightly different world but but um so

5163
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:27,040
although not completely unconnected

5164
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:29,600
right the whole thing is somehow

5165
02:57:27,040 --> 02:57:31,279
connected i know i mean the the you know

5166
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:33,040
the strange thing in my life is i've

5167
02:57:31,279 --> 02:57:35,359
sort of alternated between doing basic

5168
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:37,760
science and doing technology about five

5169
02:57:35,359 --> 02:57:40,079
times in my life so far and the thing

5170
02:57:37,760 --> 02:57:41,600
that's just crazy about it is you know

5171
02:57:40,079 --> 02:57:43,520
every time i do one of these

5172
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:45,439
alternations i think there's not going

5173
02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:46,960
to be a way back to the other thing and

5174
02:57:45,439 --> 02:57:48,479
like i thought for this physics project

5175
02:57:46,959 --> 02:57:50,398
i thought you know we're doing

5176
02:57:48,478 --> 02:57:52,639
fundamental theory of physics maybe

5177
02:57:50,398 --> 02:57:55,039
it'll have an application in 200 years

5178
02:57:52,639 --> 02:57:57,439
um but now i've realized

5179
02:57:55,040 --> 02:58:00,000
um actually this multi-computation idea

5180
02:57:57,439 --> 02:58:02,479
is is applicable here and now it's and

5181
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:03,760
in fact it's also giving us this way

5182
02:58:02,478 --> 02:58:07,920
i'll just mention one other thing and

5183
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:10,398
then to talk about blockchain um the um

5184
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:12,239
the question of um uh actually that

5185
02:58:10,398 --> 02:58:14,719
relates to several different things but

5186
02:58:12,239 --> 02:58:16,079
but um one of the things about about

5187
02:58:14,719 --> 02:58:19,039
okay so

5188
02:58:16,079 --> 02:58:20,719
our wolfram language which is our

5189
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:22,720
attempt to kind of represent everything

5190
02:58:20,719 --> 02:58:24,318
in the world computationally and it's

5191
02:58:22,719 --> 02:58:25,278
the thing i kind of started building 40

5192
02:58:24,318 --> 02:58:27,119
years ago

5193
02:58:25,279 --> 02:58:30,239
in the form of actual wolfram language

5194
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:33,840
uh 35 years ago um it's kind of this

5195
02:58:30,239 --> 02:58:36,799
idea of can we can we express things

5196
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:38,559
about the world in computational terms

5197
02:58:36,799 --> 02:58:40,559
and you know we've come a long way in

5198
02:58:38,559 --> 02:58:42,159
being able to do that well from alpha is

5199
02:58:40,559 --> 02:58:43,519
kind of the consumer version of that

5200
02:58:42,159 --> 02:58:46,318
where you're just using natural language

5201
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:48,720
as input the um and it turns it into our

5202
02:58:46,318 --> 02:58:50,398
symbolic language and that's you know

5203
02:58:48,719 --> 02:58:52,159
the symbolic language wolf and language

5204
02:58:50,398 --> 02:58:54,478
is what people use and have been using

5205
02:58:52,159 --> 02:58:56,239
for the last 33 years actually

5206
02:58:54,478 --> 02:58:58,318
mathematica which is its first

5207
02:58:56,239 --> 02:59:02,639
instantiation will be one third of a

5208
02:58:58,318 --> 02:59:04,478
century old in uh in october um and um

5209
02:59:02,639 --> 02:59:06,239
that

5210
02:59:04,478 --> 02:59:07,760
it's it's kind of interesting what do

5211
02:59:06,239 --> 02:59:09,760
you mean one third of a centuries i mean

5212
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:10,800
33 or 30 what are we

5213
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:14,318
in the third

5214
02:59:10,799 --> 02:59:15,759
33 in the third um so

5215
02:59:14,318 --> 02:59:17,439
but i've never heard of anyone

5216
02:59:15,760 --> 02:59:19,200
celebrating that anniversary but i like

5217
02:59:17,439 --> 02:59:21,120
it i know a third of a century though

5218
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:22,960
it's it's like cannot get many many

5219
02:59:21,120 --> 02:59:24,800
slices of a century that are interesting

5220
02:59:22,959 --> 02:59:26,318
yeah but but you know i think that the

5221
02:59:24,799 --> 02:59:28,639
the thing that's really striking about

5222
02:59:26,318 --> 02:59:30,000
that is that means you know including

5223
02:59:28,639 --> 02:59:31,920
the whole sort of technology stack i

5224
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:33,359
built around that's about 40 years old

5225
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:34,559
and that means it's a significant

5226
02:59:33,359 --> 02:59:35,920
fraction of the total age of the

5227
02:59:34,559 --> 02:59:38,079
computer industry

5228
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:39,439
um and it's i mean i think it's cool

5229
02:59:38,079 --> 02:59:42,239
that we can still run you know

5230
02:59:39,439 --> 02:59:43,920
mathematica version 1 programs today and

5231
02:59:42,239 --> 02:59:45,680
so on and and we've sort of maintained

5232
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:48,398
compatibility and we've been just

5233
02:59:45,680 --> 02:59:49,840
building this big tower all those years

5234
02:59:48,398 --> 02:59:51,358
of just more and more and more

5235
02:59:49,840 --> 02:59:52,719
computational capabilities it's sort of

5236
02:59:51,359 --> 02:59:55,439
interesting we just made this this

5237
02:59:52,719 --> 02:59:58,159
picture um of kind of the different kind

5238
02:59:55,439 --> 03:00:00,639
of threads of of of computational

5239
02:59:58,159 --> 03:00:01,359
content of you know mathematical content

5240
03:00:00,639 --> 03:00:03,920
and

5241
03:00:01,359 --> 03:00:05,920
and you know uh all sorts of things with

5242
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:07,840
you know data and graphs and whatever

5243
03:00:05,920 --> 03:00:10,000
else and what you see in this picture is

5244
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:11,920
about the first 10 years it's kind of

5245
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:13,920
like it's just a few threads

5246
03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:15,520
and then then about

5247
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:17,120
maybe 15 20 years ago it kind of

5248
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:19,279
explodes in this whole collection

5249
03:00:17,120 --> 03:00:21,040
different threads of all these different

5250
03:00:19,279 --> 03:00:22,319
capabilities that are now part of

5251
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:24,560
language and representing different

5252
03:00:22,318 --> 03:00:27,680
things in the world but the thing that

5253
03:00:24,559 --> 03:00:29,920
was super lucky in some sense is it's

5254
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:32,079
all based on one idea it's all based on

5255
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:33,520
the idea of symbolic expressions and

5256
03:00:32,079 --> 03:00:35,439
transformation rules for symbolic

5257
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:38,560
expressions which was kind of what i

5258
03:00:35,439 --> 03:00:41,200
originally put into this smp system back

5259
03:00:38,559 --> 03:00:42,959
in 1979 that was a predecessor of the

5260
03:00:41,200 --> 03:00:44,399
whole world from language stack

5261
03:00:42,959 --> 03:00:46,639
so that idea

5262
03:00:44,398 --> 03:00:48,478
was an idea that i got from sort of

5263
03:00:46,639 --> 03:00:50,799
trying to understand mathematical logic

5264
03:00:48,478 --> 03:00:53,358
and so on it was my attempt to kind of

5265
03:00:50,799 --> 03:00:55,759
make a general human comprehensible

5266
03:00:53,359 --> 03:00:57,760
model of computation of just everything

5267
03:00:55,760 --> 03:01:00,000
is a symbolic expression and all you do

5268
03:00:57,760 --> 03:01:04,000
is transform symbolic expressions

5269
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:05,840
and you know in in retrospect i was very

5270
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:08,079
lucky that i understood as little as i

5271
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:09,600
understood then because had i understood

5272
03:01:08,079 --> 03:01:11,840
more i would have been completely

5273
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:14,559
freaked out about all the different ways

5274
03:01:11,840 --> 03:01:16,880
that that kind of model can can fail

5275
03:01:14,559 --> 03:01:18,398
because what do you do when you have a a

5276
03:01:16,879 --> 03:01:20,639
a symbolic expression you make

5277
03:01:18,398 --> 03:01:22,478
transformations for symbolic expressions

5278
03:01:20,639 --> 03:01:23,920
well for example one question is there

5279
03:01:22,478 --> 03:01:25,920
may be many transformations that could

5280
03:01:23,920 --> 03:01:28,000
be made in a very multi-computational

5281
03:01:25,920 --> 03:01:29,520
kind of way but what we're doing is

5282
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:32,239
picking we're using the first

5283
03:01:29,520 --> 03:01:34,399
transformation that applies and we keep

5284
03:01:32,239 --> 03:01:36,398
doing that until we reach a fixed point

5285
03:01:34,398 --> 03:01:37,358
and that's the result and that's kind of

5286
03:01:36,398 --> 03:01:40,000
a very

5287
03:01:37,359 --> 03:01:42,239
it's kind of a way of of sort of sliding

5288
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:43,920
around the edge of multi-computation and

5289
03:01:42,239 --> 03:01:45,840
back when i was working on smp and

5290
03:01:43,920 --> 03:01:48,799
things i actually thought about these

5291
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:50,559
questions about about how you know how

5292
03:01:48,799 --> 03:01:52,799
what determines the this kind of

5293
03:01:50,559 --> 03:01:54,478
evaluation path so for example you know

5294
03:01:52,799 --> 03:01:56,719
you work out fibonacci you know

5295
03:01:54,478 --> 03:01:58,959
fibonacci is a recursive thing f of n is

5296
03:01:56,719 --> 03:02:01,039
f of n minus one plus f of n minus two

5297
03:01:58,959 --> 03:02:02,879
and you get this whole tree of recursion

5298
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:04,560
right and there's the question of how do

5299
03:02:02,879 --> 03:02:06,639
you evaluate that tree of recursion do

5300
03:02:04,559 --> 03:02:08,239
you do it sort of depth first where you

5301
03:02:06,639 --> 03:02:10,159
go all the way down one side do you do

5302
03:02:08,239 --> 03:02:12,398
it breadth first where you're kind of

5303
03:02:10,159 --> 03:02:13,920
collecting the terms together where you

5304
03:02:12,398 --> 03:02:16,000
know that you know f of a plus f of

5305
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:18,398
seven f of seven plus f of six you can

5306
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:20,478
collect the f of sevens and so on these

5307
03:02:18,398 --> 03:02:21,599
are um you know i didn't realize that at

5308
03:02:20,478 --> 03:02:23,840
the time it's kind of funny i was

5309
03:02:21,600 --> 03:02:26,159
working on on gauge field theories back

5310
03:02:23,840 --> 03:02:28,159
in 1979 and i was also working on the

5311
03:02:26,159 --> 03:02:30,879
evaluation model

5312
03:02:28,159 --> 03:02:33,359
in smp and they're the same problem but

5313
03:02:30,879 --> 03:02:35,599
it took me 40 more years to realize that

5314
03:02:33,359 --> 03:02:37,520
and this question about how you do this

5315
03:02:35,600 --> 03:02:39,439
sort of evaluation front that's a

5316
03:02:37,520 --> 03:02:42,000
question of reference frames it's a

5317
03:02:39,439 --> 03:02:44,318
question of of kind of the um the story

5318
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:46,559
of i mean that that's that is basically

5319
03:02:44,318 --> 03:02:48,239
this question of in what order is the

5320
03:02:46,559 --> 03:02:50,559
universe evaluated

5321
03:02:48,239 --> 03:02:52,318
and that and so what you realize is

5322
03:02:50,559 --> 03:02:53,840
there's this whole sort of world of

5323
03:02:52,318 --> 03:02:56,318
different kinds of computation that you

5324
03:02:53,840 --> 03:02:58,159
can do sort of multi-computationally and

5325
03:02:56,318 --> 03:02:59,199
that's a that's an interesting thing it

5326
03:02:58,159 --> 03:03:01,200
has a lot of implications for

5327
03:02:59,200 --> 03:03:02,720
distributed computing and so on

5328
03:03:01,200 --> 03:03:04,640
it also has a potential implication for

5329
03:03:02,719 --> 03:03:06,959
blockchain which we haven't fully worked

5330
03:03:04,639 --> 03:03:08,559
out which is some and this is not what

5331
03:03:06,959 --> 03:03:12,318
we're doing with cardano but but this is

5332
03:03:08,559 --> 03:03:14,719
a different thing um the um this is

5333
03:03:12,318 --> 03:03:15,439
something where uh one of the questions

5334
03:03:14,719 --> 03:03:17,199
is

5335
03:03:15,439 --> 03:03:19,040
um when you have

5336
03:03:17,200 --> 03:03:21,760
in a sense blockchain is a deeply

5337
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:24,080
sequentialized story of time because in

5338
03:03:21,760 --> 03:03:26,478
blockchain there's just one copy of the

5339
03:03:24,079 --> 03:03:28,398
of the ledger and you're saying this is

5340
03:03:26,478 --> 03:03:29,679
what happened you know time has

5341
03:03:28,398 --> 03:03:31,439
progressed in this way and the other

5342
03:03:29,680 --> 03:03:33,520
little things around the edge as as you

5343
03:03:31,439 --> 03:03:35,520
try and reach consensus and so on and

5344
03:03:33,520 --> 03:03:37,439
and uh you know actually we just

5345
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:39,120
recently we've had this little

5346
03:03:37,439 --> 03:03:40,639
conference we organized about the the

5347
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:42,479
theory of distributed consensus because

5348
03:03:40,639 --> 03:03:44,398
i realized that a bunch of interesting

5349
03:03:42,478 --> 03:03:46,000
things that some of our science can tell

5350
03:03:44,398 --> 03:03:47,840
one about that but that's a different

5351
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:49,359
let's let's not go down that that part

5352
03:03:47,840 --> 03:03:51,120
yeah but distributed consensus is that

5353
03:03:49,359 --> 03:03:53,120
still has a sequential there's like

5354
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:55,120
there's still sequentiality so just

5355
03:03:53,120 --> 03:03:57,520
don't tell me you're thinking through

5356
03:03:55,120 --> 03:04:01,120
like how to apply multi-computation to

5357
03:03:57,520 --> 03:04:03,760
uh blockchain yes and so so that becomes

5358
03:04:01,120 --> 03:04:05,840
a story of you know instead of

5359
03:04:03,760 --> 03:04:08,318
transactions all having to settle in one

5360
03:04:05,840 --> 03:04:10,239
ledger it's like a story of all these

5361
03:04:08,318 --> 03:04:12,478
different ledgers and they all have to

5362
03:04:10,239 --> 03:04:14,398
have some ultimate consistency which is

5363
03:04:12,478 --> 03:04:16,719
what causal and variance would give one

5364
03:04:14,398 --> 03:04:18,159
but it can take a while and the it can

5365
03:04:16,719 --> 03:04:20,000
take a while as kind of like quantum

5366
03:04:18,159 --> 03:04:22,079
mechanics so it's kind of what's

5367
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:24,639
happening is that these different paths

5368
03:04:22,079 --> 03:04:26,719
of history that correspond to you know

5369
03:04:24,639 --> 03:04:28,159
in one part of history you got paid this

5370
03:04:26,719 --> 03:04:30,719
amount in another path of history you

5371
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:32,478
got paid this amount in the end the

5372
03:04:30,719 --> 03:04:36,159
universe will always become consistent

5373
03:04:32,478 --> 03:04:37,358
now now the way it will it works is okay

5374
03:04:36,159 --> 03:04:39,760
it's a little bit more complicated than

5375
03:04:37,359 --> 03:04:41,120
that what happens is the way space is

5376
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:43,680
knitted together in our theory of

5377
03:04:41,120 --> 03:04:46,720
physics is through all these events

5378
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:49,520
and the the the idea is that the way

5379
03:04:46,719 --> 03:04:51,920
that economic space is knitted together

5380
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:53,520
is between is there these autonomous

5381
03:04:51,920 --> 03:04:55,439
events that essentially knit together

5382
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:56,800
economic space so there are all these

5383
03:04:55,439 --> 03:04:58,639
threads of transactions that are

5384
03:04:56,799 --> 03:05:00,000
happening and the question is can they

5385
03:04:58,639 --> 03:05:02,159
be made consistent are there is there

5386
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:05,439
something forcing them to be sort of a

5387
03:05:02,159 --> 03:05:07,920
consistent fabric of economic reality

5388
03:05:05,439 --> 03:05:09,840
and sort of what this has led me to is

5389
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:11,359
trying to realize how does economics

5390
03:05:09,840 --> 03:05:14,318
fundamentally work

5391
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:15,840
and you know what is economics and uh

5392
03:05:14,318 --> 03:05:18,559
you know what what are the atoms of

5393
03:05:15,840 --> 03:05:20,880
economics right so to speak and so what

5394
03:05:18,559 --> 03:05:22,000
i've kind of realized is that that sort

5395
03:05:20,879 --> 03:05:23,519
of the

5396
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:25,439
perhaps i don't even know if this is

5397
03:05:23,520 --> 03:05:27,760
right yet there's sort of events in

5398
03:05:25,439 --> 03:05:29,840
economics of transactions there are

5399
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:31,600
states of agents that are kind of the

5400
03:05:29,840 --> 03:05:34,719
atoms of economics

5401
03:05:31,600 --> 03:05:36,479
and then transactions are kind of agents

5402
03:05:34,719 --> 03:05:38,639
transact and some

5403
03:05:36,478 --> 03:05:40,719
transact in some way and that's an event

5404
03:05:38,639 --> 03:05:42,719
and then the question is how do you knit

5405
03:05:40,719 --> 03:05:44,799
together sort of economic space from

5406
03:05:42,719 --> 03:05:46,639
that what is there an economic space

5407
03:05:44,799 --> 03:05:48,239
well all these transactions there's a

5408
03:05:46,639 --> 03:05:50,079
whole complicated collection of possible

5409
03:05:48,239 --> 03:05:52,318
transactions but one thing that's true

5410
03:05:50,079 --> 03:05:54,719
about economics is we tend to have the

5411
03:05:52,318 --> 03:05:56,159
notion of a definite value for things

5412
03:05:54,719 --> 03:05:58,959
we could imagine

5413
03:05:56,159 --> 03:06:00,559
that you know you buy

5414
03:05:58,959 --> 03:06:02,478
a cookie

5415
03:06:00,559 --> 03:06:05,278
from somebody and

5416
03:06:02,478 --> 03:06:08,159
they want to get a movie ticket

5417
03:06:05,279 --> 03:06:09,760
and there is some way that ai bots could

5418
03:06:08,159 --> 03:06:12,478
make some path

5419
03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:13,920
from the cookie to the movie ticket by

5420
03:06:12,478 --> 03:06:15,278
all these different trans intermediate

5421
03:06:13,920 --> 03:06:16,639
transactions

5422
03:06:15,279 --> 03:06:18,960
but in fact

5423
03:06:16,639 --> 03:06:21,519
we have an approximation to that which

5424
03:06:18,959 --> 03:06:24,159
is we say they each have a dollar value

5425
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:27,040
and we have this kind of numeric concept

5426
03:06:24,159 --> 03:06:28,719
of there's just a way of kind of of of

5427
03:06:27,040 --> 03:06:31,840
taking this whole complicated space of

5428
03:06:28,719 --> 03:06:34,159
transactions and parsing it in something

5429
03:06:31,840 --> 03:06:36,239
which is a kind of a simplified thing

5430
03:06:34,159 --> 03:06:37,600
that is kind of like our parsing of

5431
03:06:36,239 --> 03:06:40,879
physical space

5432
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:42,640
and so my my guess is that the uh yet

5433
03:06:40,879 --> 03:06:44,799
again i mean it's crazy that all these

5434
03:06:42,639 --> 03:06:47,920
things are so connected this is another

5435
03:06:44,799 --> 03:06:49,278
multi-computation story another story of

5436
03:06:47,920 --> 03:06:51,840
where what's happening is that the

5437
03:06:49,279 --> 03:06:54,560
economic consciousness the economic

5438
03:06:51,840 --> 03:06:55,760
observer is not going to deal with all

5439
03:06:54,559 --> 03:06:57,600
of those a different microscopic

5440
03:06:55,760 --> 03:06:59,359
transactions they're just going to parse

5441
03:06:57,600 --> 03:07:01,680
the whole thing by saying there's this

5442
03:06:59,359 --> 03:07:03,920
value it's a number and that's that's

5443
03:07:01,680 --> 03:07:05,920
their understanding of their summary of

5444
03:07:03,920 --> 03:07:07,359
this economic network and there will be

5445
03:07:05,920 --> 03:07:09,120
all kinds of things like there are all

5446
03:07:07,359 --> 03:07:11,040
kinds of arbitrage opportunities which

5447
03:07:09,120 --> 03:07:13,680
are kind of like the quantum effects in

5448
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:15,520
this whole thing and um that's uh you

5449
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:16,960
know and places where there's where

5450
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:20,960
there's sort of different paths that can

5451
03:07:16,959 --> 03:07:23,039
be followed and and so on and there's so

5452
03:07:20,959 --> 03:07:25,358
the question is can one make a sort of

5453
03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:28,080
global theory of economics and then my

5454
03:07:25,359 --> 03:07:29,520
test case is again what is time dilation

5455
03:07:28,079 --> 03:07:31,600
and economics

5456
03:07:29,520 --> 03:07:33,439
and and i know for you know if you

5457
03:07:31,600 --> 03:07:35,120
imagine a very agricultural economics

5458
03:07:33,439 --> 03:07:37,120
where people are growing lettuces and

5459
03:07:35,120 --> 03:07:38,399
fields and things like this and you ask

5460
03:07:37,120 --> 03:07:40,000
questions about well if you're

5461
03:07:38,398 --> 03:07:42,159
transporting lettuces to different

5462
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:44,318
places you know what is the value of the

5463
03:07:42,159 --> 03:07:46,079
lettuces after you have to transport

5464
03:07:44,318 --> 03:07:47,920
them versus if you're just sitting in

5465
03:07:46,079 --> 03:07:49,359
one place and selling them you can kind

5466
03:07:47,920 --> 03:07:50,879
of get a little bit of an analogy there

5467
03:07:49,359 --> 03:07:52,399
but i think there's a there's a better

5468
03:07:50,879 --> 03:07:54,079
and more complete analogy

5469
03:07:52,398 --> 03:07:56,079
and that's the question of is there a

5470
03:07:54,079 --> 03:07:58,318
theory like general relativity that is a

5471
03:07:56,079 --> 03:08:00,239
global theory of economics and is it

5472
03:07:58,318 --> 03:08:01,600
about something we care about it could

5473
03:08:00,239 --> 03:08:04,000
be that there is a global theory but

5474
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:06,239
it's about a feature of economic reality

5475
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:08,799
that isn't important to us now another

5476
03:08:06,239 --> 03:08:11,119
part of the story is can one use those

5477
03:08:08,799 --> 03:08:13,599
ideas to make essentially a distributed

5478
03:08:11,120 --> 03:08:15,920
blockchain a distributed generalization

5479
03:08:13,600 --> 03:08:17,920
of blockchain kind of the quantum analog

5480
03:08:15,920 --> 03:08:19,840
of money so to speak where where you

5481
03:08:17,920 --> 03:08:21,359
have for example you can have

5482
03:08:19,840 --> 03:08:24,000
uncertainty relations where you're

5483
03:08:21,359 --> 03:08:26,079
saying you know well if i if i insist on

5484
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:28,000
knowing my bank account right now

5485
03:08:26,079 --> 03:08:30,239
there'll be some uncertainty if i'm

5486
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:32,799
prepared to wait a while then it'll be

5487
03:08:30,239 --> 03:08:34,639
much more certain um and so there's you

5488
03:08:32,799 --> 03:08:37,278
know is there a way of using and so

5489
03:08:34,639 --> 03:08:39,680
we've made a bunch of prototypes of this

5490
03:08:37,279 --> 03:08:41,920
um which i'm not yet happy with because

5491
03:08:39,680 --> 03:08:43,279
what i realized is to really understand

5492
03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:45,439
these prototypes actually have to have a

5493
03:08:43,279 --> 03:08:47,760
foundational theory of economics and so

5494
03:08:45,439 --> 03:08:49,120
that's kind of a uh you know it may be

5495
03:08:47,760 --> 03:08:51,279
that we could deploy one of these

5496
03:08:49,120 --> 03:08:52,240
prototypes as a practical system but i

5497
03:08:51,279 --> 03:08:53,840
think it's really going to be much

5498
03:08:52,239 --> 03:08:55,439
better if we actually have an

5499
03:08:53,840 --> 03:08:57,439
understanding of how this plugs into

5500
03:08:55,439 --> 03:08:59,359
kind of the economics that means like a

5501
03:08:57,439 --> 03:09:00,398
fundamental theory of transactions

5502
03:08:59,359 --> 03:09:02,479
between

5503
03:09:00,398 --> 03:09:04,879
entities well that's that's what you

5504
03:09:02,478 --> 03:09:07,599
mean by economics yes i think so but i

5505
03:09:04,879 --> 03:09:09,199
mean you know how how there emerge sort

5506
03:09:07,600 --> 03:09:10,720
of laws of economics i don't even know

5507
03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:12,880
and i've been asking friends of mine who

5508
03:09:10,719 --> 03:09:15,599
are who are economists and things what

5509
03:09:12,879 --> 03:09:18,079
is economics you know is it an axiomatic

5510
03:09:15,600 --> 03:09:20,720
theory is it a theory that is a kind of

5511
03:09:18,079 --> 03:09:22,559
a qualitative description theory is it

5512
03:09:20,719 --> 03:09:24,159
you know what kind of a theory is it is

5513
03:09:22,559 --> 03:09:26,478
it a theory you know what kind of

5514
03:09:24,159 --> 03:09:28,000
thinking it's like like in in biology

5515
03:09:26,478 --> 03:09:29,438
and evolutionary biology for example

5516
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,799
there's a certain there's a certain

5517
03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:33,040
pattern of thinking that goes on in

5518
03:09:30,799 --> 03:09:34,959
evolutionary biology where if you're a

5519
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:37,120
you know a good evolutionary biologist

5520
03:09:34,959 --> 03:09:39,519
somebody says that creature has a weird

5521
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:41,200
horn and they'll say well that's because

5522
03:09:39,520 --> 03:09:43,439
this and this and this and the selection

5523
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:44,560
of this kind and that kind and that's

5524
03:09:43,439 --> 03:09:46,559
the story

5525
03:09:44,559 --> 03:09:48,478
and it's not a mathematical story it's a

5526
03:09:46,559 --> 03:09:50,478
story of a different type of thinking

5527
03:09:48,478 --> 03:09:52,159
about these things by the way

5528
03:09:50,478 --> 03:09:53,679
evolutionary biology is yet another

5529
03:09:52,159 --> 03:09:56,318
place where it looks like this

5530
03:09:53,680 --> 03:09:58,960
multi-computational idea can be applied

5531
03:09:56,318 --> 03:10:01,359
and that's where where maybe speciation

5532
03:09:58,959 --> 03:10:03,438
is related to things like event horizons

5533
03:10:01,359 --> 03:10:05,279
and there's a whole whole other kind of

5534
03:10:03,439 --> 03:10:07,200
world of that but because it seems like

5535
03:10:05,279 --> 03:10:10,640
this kind of model can be applicable in

5536
03:10:07,200 --> 03:10:13,920
so many aspects like at the different

5537
03:10:10,639 --> 03:10:15,920
levels of understanding of

5538
03:10:13,920 --> 03:10:18,159
our reality so it could be the biology

5539
03:10:15,920 --> 03:10:20,398
of the chemistry at the physics level

5540
03:10:18,159 --> 03:10:21,439
right the economics and you could

5541
03:10:20,398 --> 03:10:22,879
potentially

5542
03:10:21,439 --> 03:10:24,238
the thing is

5543
03:10:22,879 --> 03:10:26,079
it's like

5544
03:10:24,238 --> 03:10:28,318
okay sure at all these levels it might

5545
03:10:26,079 --> 03:10:30,000
rhyme it might make sense as a model the

5546
03:10:28,318 --> 03:10:31,600
question is can you make useful

5547
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:33,200
predictions that's one of these levels

5548
03:10:31,600 --> 03:10:35,760
that's that's right and that's that's

5549
03:10:33,200 --> 03:10:37,520
really a question of you know it's a

5550
03:10:35,760 --> 03:10:39,040
weird situation because it's a situation

5551
03:10:37,520 --> 03:10:41,840
where the model

5552
03:10:39,040 --> 03:10:43,279
probably has definite consequences the

5553
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:46,000
question is are there consequences we

5554
03:10:43,279 --> 03:10:47,359
care about yeah and and that's some uh

5555
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:48,079
you know and so

5556
03:10:47,359 --> 03:10:50,479
so

5557
03:10:48,079 --> 03:10:52,318
in the case of in the economic case

5558
03:10:50,478 --> 03:10:53,199
the um

5559
03:10:52,318 --> 03:10:56,159
uh

5560
03:10:53,200 --> 03:10:58,000
we're um so you know the one one thing

5561
03:10:56,159 --> 03:10:59,920
is this this idea of using kind of

5562
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:02,079
physics-like notions

5563
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:04,159
to construct a kind of distributed

5564
03:11:02,079 --> 03:11:06,238
analog blockchain okay the much more

5565
03:11:04,159 --> 03:11:08,318
pragmatic thing is that it's a different

5566
03:11:06,238 --> 03:11:09,920
direction and it has to do with this

5567
03:11:08,318 --> 03:11:12,238
computational language that we built to

5568
03:11:09,920 --> 03:11:14,159
describe the world that knows about you

5569
03:11:12,238 --> 03:11:16,079
know different kinds of cookies and

5570
03:11:14,159 --> 03:11:18,000
knows about different cities and knows

5571
03:11:16,079 --> 03:11:20,318
about how to compute all these kinds of

5572
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:23,120
things one of the things that is of

5573
03:11:20,318 --> 03:11:25,119
interest is if you want to run the world

5574
03:11:23,120 --> 03:11:27,600
you need you know with with with

5575
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:29,520
contracts and laws and rules and so on

5576
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:32,000
there are rules at a human level and

5577
03:11:29,520 --> 03:11:33,920
there are kind of um things like

5578
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:36,000
and so this this gets one into the idea

5579
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:38,079
of computational contracts you know

5580
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:40,478
right now when we write a contract it's

5581
03:11:38,079 --> 03:11:42,398
a piece of legalese it's you know it's

5582
03:11:40,478 --> 03:11:43,760
just written in english and it's not

5583
03:11:42,398 --> 03:11:45,920
something that's automatically

5584
03:11:43,760 --> 03:11:46,800
analyzable executable whatever else it's

5585
03:11:45,920 --> 03:11:49,040
just

5586
03:11:46,799 --> 03:11:52,318
english you know back in

5587
03:11:49,040 --> 03:11:55,200
gottfried leibniz back in you know 1680

5588
03:11:52,318 --> 03:11:57,840
or whatever was like um i'm gonna you

5589
03:11:55,200 --> 03:11:59,920
know figure out how to use logic to

5590
03:11:57,840 --> 03:12:01,760
decide legal cases and so on and he had

5591
03:11:59,920 --> 03:12:03,760
kind of this idea of let's make a

5592
03:12:01,760 --> 03:12:04,960
computational language for the huma the

5593
03:12:03,760 --> 03:12:07,600
human law

5594
03:12:04,959 --> 03:12:09,919
um forget about modeling nature forgot

5595
03:12:07,600 --> 03:12:11,439
about natural laws what about human law

5596
03:12:09,920 --> 03:12:13,600
can we make kind of a computational

5597
03:12:11,439 --> 03:12:15,600
representation of that well i think

5598
03:12:13,600 --> 03:12:17,680
finally we're close to being able to do

5599
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:19,840
that and one of the projects that i hope

5600
03:12:17,680 --> 03:12:21,600
to get to as soon as the there's a

5601
03:12:19,840 --> 03:12:23,680
little bit of slowing down of some of

5602
03:12:21,600 --> 03:12:25,359
this cambrian explosion that's happening

5603
03:12:23,680 --> 03:12:27,279
as a project i've been meaning to really

5604
03:12:25,359 --> 03:12:29,120
do for a long time which is what i'm

5605
03:12:27,279 --> 03:12:31,600
calling a symbolic discourse language

5606
03:12:29,120 --> 03:12:33,600
it's is just finishing the job of being

5607
03:12:31,600 --> 03:12:35,520
able to represent everything like the

5608
03:12:33,600 --> 03:12:37,920
conversation we're having in

5609
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:39,359
computational terms and one of the use

5610
03:12:37,920 --> 03:12:41,680
cases for that is computational

5611
03:12:39,359 --> 03:12:43,840
contracts another use case is something

5612
03:12:41,680 --> 03:12:46,079
like the the constitution that says what

5613
03:12:43,840 --> 03:12:48,318
the ai's what we want the ais to do so

5614
03:12:46,079 --> 03:12:49,920
but this is useful so you're saying uh

5615
03:12:48,318 --> 03:12:51,760
so these are like you're saying

5616
03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:53,760
computational contracts but smart

5617
03:12:51,760 --> 03:12:55,200
contracts this is what's in the domain

5618
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:57,439
of cryptocurrencies known as smart

5619
03:12:55,200 --> 03:12:59,520
contracts and so the the language you've

5620
03:12:57,439 --> 03:13:01,760
developed this symbolic

5621
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:05,520
or seek to further develop symbolic

5622
03:13:01,760 --> 03:13:07,680
discourse language enables you to uh

5623
03:13:05,520 --> 03:13:10,720
write a contract and right so write a

5624
03:13:07,680 --> 03:13:13,040
contract that richly represents

5625
03:13:10,719 --> 03:13:15,119
some aspect of the world yeah but so so

5626
03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:17,200
i mean smart contracts tend to be right

5627
03:13:15,120 --> 03:13:19,040
now mostly about things happening on the

5628
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:21,680
blockchain yes and sometimes they have

5629
03:13:19,040 --> 03:13:23,760
oracles in fact our wolfram alpha api is

5630
03:13:21,680 --> 03:13:25,600
is the main thing people use to get

5631
03:13:23,760 --> 03:13:27,680
information about the real world so to

5632
03:13:25,600 --> 03:13:30,000
speak yeah within smart contracts so

5633
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:32,318
well from alpha as it stands is a really

5634
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:33,920
good oracle yes whoever wants to use it

5635
03:13:32,318 --> 03:13:35,760
that's perhaps where the relationship

5636
03:13:33,920 --> 03:13:36,639
with cardano is yeah that's how we

5637
03:13:35,760 --> 03:13:38,079
started getting involved with

5638
03:13:36,639 --> 03:13:40,639
blockchains is we realized people were

5639
03:13:38,079 --> 03:13:42,639
using you know wolfman alpha as the

5640
03:13:40,639 --> 03:13:44,238
oracle for smart contract so to speak

5641
03:13:42,639 --> 03:13:46,799
and so that got us interested in

5642
03:13:44,238 --> 03:13:49,359
blockchains in general and what was

5643
03:13:46,799 --> 03:13:50,879
ended up happening is orphan language is

5644
03:13:49,359 --> 03:13:52,000
with its symbolic representation of

5645
03:13:50,879 --> 03:13:53,358
things is really very good at

5646
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:56,079
representing

5647
03:13:53,359 --> 03:13:57,439
things like blockchains and so i think

5648
03:13:56,079 --> 03:13:58,959
we now have them we don't really know

5649
03:13:57,439 --> 03:14:00,639
all the comparisons but we now have a

5650
03:13:58,959 --> 03:14:03,759
really nice environment within wolverine

5651
03:14:00,639 --> 03:14:05,519
language for dealing with the sort of uh

5652
03:14:03,760 --> 03:14:06,880
you know for representing what happens

5653
03:14:05,520 --> 03:14:08,960
in blockchains for analyzing what

5654
03:14:06,879 --> 03:14:11,519
happens with blockchains we have a whole

5655
03:14:08,959 --> 03:14:13,919
effort in blockchain analytics

5656
03:14:11,520 --> 03:14:15,760
um and uh you know we've sort of

5657
03:14:13,920 --> 03:14:18,079
published some samples of how that works

5658
03:14:15,760 --> 03:14:19,600
but but it's you know because our

5659
03:14:18,079 --> 03:14:21,520
technology stack welcome language and

5660
03:14:19,600 --> 03:14:24,318
mathematica are very widely used in the

5661
03:14:21,520 --> 03:14:27,520
quant finance world there's a there's a

5662
03:14:24,318 --> 03:14:29,359
sort of immediate uh sort of um uh

5663
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:31,200
co-evolution there of of sort of the

5664
03:14:29,359 --> 03:14:34,079
quant finance kind of thing and

5665
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:35,359
blockchain analytics and that's um so so

5666
03:14:34,079 --> 03:14:37,520
it's kind of the representation of

5667
03:14:35,359 --> 03:14:40,000
blockchain in computational language

5668
03:14:37,520 --> 03:14:42,238
then ultimately it's kind of like how do

5669
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:44,318
you run the world with code that is how

5670
03:14:42,238 --> 03:14:46,478
do you write sort of all these things

5671
03:14:44,318 --> 03:14:47,840
which are right now regulations and laws

5672
03:14:46,478 --> 03:14:50,079
and contracts and things in

5673
03:14:47,840 --> 03:14:52,559
computational language and kind of the

5674
03:14:50,079 --> 03:14:54,079
the ultimate vision is that sort of

5675
03:14:52,559 --> 03:14:56,000
something happens in the world and then

5676
03:14:54,079 --> 03:14:57,680
there's this giant domino effect of all

5677
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:59,520
these computational contracts that

5678
03:14:57,680 --> 03:15:01,359
trigger based on the thing that happened

5679
03:14:59,520 --> 03:15:04,079
and there's a there's a whole story to

5680
03:15:01,359 --> 03:15:06,159
that and of course you know i i like to

5681
03:15:04,079 --> 03:15:07,760
always pay attention to the latest

5682
03:15:06,159 --> 03:15:09,760
things that are going on and i i really

5683
03:15:07,760 --> 03:15:12,079
i kind of like blockchain because it's a

5684
03:15:09,760 --> 03:15:13,920
it's a it's another rethinking of kind

5685
03:15:12,079 --> 03:15:15,600
of computation it's kind of like you

5686
03:15:13,920 --> 03:15:18,960
know cloud computing was a little bit of

5687
03:15:15,600 --> 03:15:21,840
that of sort of persistent um kind of uh

5688
03:15:18,959 --> 03:15:23,599
computational resources and so on and uh

5689
03:15:21,840 --> 03:15:25,600
you know this multi-computation is a big

5690
03:15:23,600 --> 03:15:27,680
rethinking of kind of what it means to

5691
03:15:25,600 --> 03:15:29,840
compute blockchain is another bit of

5692
03:15:27,680 --> 03:15:31,520
rethinking of what it means to compute

5693
03:15:29,840 --> 03:15:33,680
the idea that you lodge kind of these

5694
03:15:31,520 --> 03:15:35,840
autonomous lumps of computation out

5695
03:15:33,680 --> 03:15:38,238
there in the blockchain world and and

5696
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:40,318
one of the things that um just sort of

5697
03:15:38,238 --> 03:15:42,079
uh for fun so to speak is we've been

5698
03:15:40,318 --> 03:15:44,478
doing a bit of stuff with nfts and we

5699
03:15:42,079 --> 03:15:46,799
just did some nfts on gardano and we'll

5700
03:15:44,478 --> 03:15:48,478
be doing some more and uh you know we

5701
03:15:46,799 --> 03:15:50,318
did some cellular automaton nfts on

5702
03:15:48,478 --> 03:15:52,559
cadance people

5703
03:15:50,318 --> 03:15:54,159
like quite a bit um and you know one of

5704
03:15:52,559 --> 03:15:57,359
the things i've realized about about

5705
03:15:54,159 --> 03:15:59,359
nfts is that there's kind of this notion

5706
03:15:57,359 --> 03:16:00,720
and we're really working on this you

5707
03:15:59,359 --> 03:16:02,720
know i like

5708
03:16:00,719 --> 03:16:04,719
recording stuff you know one of the

5709
03:16:02,719 --> 03:16:06,719
things that's come out of of kind of my

5710
03:16:04,719 --> 03:16:09,599
science i suppose is this this history

5711
03:16:06,719 --> 03:16:10,799
matters type type story of you know it's

5712
03:16:09,600 --> 03:16:13,040
not just the current state it's the

5713
03:16:10,799 --> 03:16:15,039
history that matters and i've kind of i

5714
03:16:13,040 --> 03:16:17,200
don't think this is actually realizing

5715
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:18,720
maybe it's not coincidental that i'm

5716
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:20,479
sort of the human who's recorded more

5717
03:16:18,719 --> 03:16:22,559
about themselves than anybody else and

5718
03:16:20,478 --> 03:16:24,879
then i end up with these science results

5719
03:16:22,559 --> 03:16:26,559
that say history matters which was not

5720
03:16:24,879 --> 03:16:28,398
those those things i didn't think those

5721
03:16:26,559 --> 03:16:30,719
were connected but they're at least

5722
03:16:28,398 --> 03:16:32,159
correlated yes yeah right so

5723
03:16:30,719 --> 03:16:34,000
you know this question about sort of

5724
03:16:32,159 --> 03:16:35,680
recording what has happened

5725
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:37,359
and and having sort of a permanent

5726
03:16:35,680 --> 03:16:39,200
record of things one of the things

5727
03:16:37,359 --> 03:16:40,640
that's kind of interesting there is you

5728
03:16:39,200 --> 03:16:42,319
know you put up a website and it's got a

5729
03:16:40,639 --> 03:16:43,760
bunch of stuff on it but you know you

5730
03:16:42,318 --> 03:16:45,439
have to keep paying the hosting fees or

5731
03:16:43,760 --> 03:16:47,120
the things going to go away

5732
03:16:45,439 --> 03:16:49,439
but one of the things about blockchain

5733
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:51,040
is kind of interesting is if you put

5734
03:16:49,439 --> 03:16:52,559
something on a blockchain and you pay

5735
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:55,040
you know your commission to get that

5736
03:16:52,559 --> 03:16:57,840
thing you know put on you know mind put

5737
03:16:55,040 --> 03:17:00,399
on the block blockchain then then in a

5738
03:16:57,840 --> 03:17:02,559
sense everybody who comes after you

5739
03:17:00,398 --> 03:17:04,318
is you know they are motivated to keep

5740
03:17:02,559 --> 03:17:06,238
your thing alive because that's what

5741
03:17:04,318 --> 03:17:08,559
keeps the consistency of the blockchain

5742
03:17:06,238 --> 03:17:09,840
so in a sense with sort of the nft world

5743
03:17:08,559 --> 03:17:12,318
it's kind of like if you want to have

5744
03:17:09,840 --> 03:17:14,318
something permanent well at least for

5745
03:17:12,318 --> 03:17:15,840
the life of the blockchain but but even

5746
03:17:14,318 --> 03:17:17,680
if the blockchain goes out of

5747
03:17:15,840 --> 03:17:19,600
circulation so to speak there's going to

5748
03:17:17,680 --> 03:17:21,359
be enough value in that whole collection

5749
03:17:19,600 --> 03:17:23,279
of transactions that people are going to

5750
03:17:21,359 --> 03:17:24,880
archive the thing but that means that

5751
03:17:23,279 --> 03:17:26,800
you know pay once

5752
03:17:24,879 --> 03:17:28,639
and you're kind of you're lodged in the

5753
03:17:26,799 --> 03:17:30,639
blockchain forever and so we've been

5754
03:17:28,639 --> 03:17:33,358
kind of playing around with um a sort of

5755
03:17:30,639 --> 03:17:35,358
a hobby thing of of mine of of thinking

5756
03:17:33,359 --> 03:17:38,238
about sort of the nfts

5757
03:17:35,359 --> 03:17:40,800
and how you um and sort of the consumer

5758
03:17:38,238 --> 03:17:42,719
idea of kind of the it's the it's the

5759
03:17:40,799 --> 03:17:45,039
anti you know it's the opposite of the

5760
03:17:42,719 --> 03:17:46,799
snapchat view of the world so there's a

5761
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:49,439
permanence to it this heavily

5762
03:17:46,799 --> 03:17:51,358
incentivized and uh

5763
03:17:49,439 --> 03:17:53,359
thereby you can have a

5764
03:17:51,359 --> 03:17:56,079
permanence of history right and that's

5765
03:17:53,359 --> 03:17:57,279
that's that's kind of the um now you

5766
03:17:56,079 --> 03:17:58,959
know so that's so that's one of the

5767
03:17:57,279 --> 03:18:01,120
things we've been doing with cardano and

5768
03:17:58,959 --> 03:18:02,559
it's kind of fun i think that that um i

5769
03:18:01,120 --> 03:18:04,239
mean this whole question about you know

5770
03:18:02,559 --> 03:18:06,478
you mentioned automated theorem proving

5771
03:18:04,238 --> 03:18:07,840
and blockchains and so on and as i've

5772
03:18:06,478 --> 03:18:09,840
thought about this kind of physics

5773
03:18:07,840 --> 03:18:12,960
inspired distributed blockchain

5774
03:18:09,840 --> 03:18:14,880
obviously they're the sort of the proof

5775
03:18:12,959 --> 03:18:16,879
that it works that they're no double

5776
03:18:14,879 --> 03:18:20,000
spends there's no whatever else

5777
03:18:16,879 --> 03:18:22,238
that proof becomes a very formal kind of

5778
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:24,159
almost a matter of physics so to speak

5779
03:18:22,238 --> 03:18:25,760
um and uh you know it's been it's been

5780
03:18:24,159 --> 03:18:28,398
an interesting thing for the for the

5781
03:18:25,760 --> 03:18:30,079
practical blockchains to do kind of

5782
03:18:28,398 --> 03:18:31,519
actual automated film proving and i

5783
03:18:30,079 --> 03:18:33,600
don't think anybody's really managed it

5784
03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:35,920
in an interesting case yet it's a thing

5785
03:18:33,600 --> 03:18:37,920
that people you know aspire to but i

5786
03:18:35,920 --> 03:18:39,760
think it's a challenging thing because

5787
03:18:37,920 --> 03:18:42,079
basically the point is one of the one of

5788
03:18:39,760 --> 03:18:44,000
the things about proving correctness of

5789
03:18:42,079 --> 03:18:45,279
something is well you know people say

5790
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:47,279
i've got this program and i'm going to

5791
03:18:45,279 --> 03:18:49,040
prove it's correct it's like what does

5792
03:18:47,279 --> 03:18:51,040
that mean you have to say what correct

5793
03:18:49,040 --> 03:18:52,560
means i mean it's it's kind of like then

5794
03:18:51,040 --> 03:18:54,239
you have to have another language and

5795
03:18:52,559 --> 03:18:56,318
people were very confused back in past

5796
03:18:54,238 --> 03:18:58,398
decades of you know oh we're going to

5797
03:18:56,318 --> 03:19:00,478
prove the correctness by representing

5798
03:18:58,398 --> 03:19:02,559
the program in another language which we

5799
03:19:00,478 --> 03:19:04,318
also don't know whether it's correct and

5800
03:19:02,559 --> 03:19:07,039
you know often by correctness we just

5801
03:19:04,318 --> 03:19:08,799
mean it can't crash or it can't scribble

5802
03:19:07,040 --> 03:19:10,640
on memory but but the thing is that

5803
03:19:08,799 --> 03:19:12,639
there's this complicated trade-off

5804
03:19:10,639 --> 03:19:14,639
because as soon as there's as soon as

5805
03:19:12,639 --> 03:19:16,840
you're really using computation you have

5806
03:19:14,639 --> 03:19:18,879
computational irreducibility you have

5807
03:19:16,840 --> 03:19:21,279
undecidability if you want to use

5808
03:19:18,879 --> 03:19:23,920
computation seriously you have to kind

5809
03:19:21,279 --> 03:19:26,399
of let go of the idea that you're going

5810
03:19:23,920 --> 03:19:28,079
to be able to box it in and say we're

5811
03:19:26,398 --> 03:19:29,760
going to have just this happen and not

5812
03:19:28,079 --> 03:19:32,238
anything else i mean this is a this is

5813
03:19:29,760 --> 03:19:34,238
an old fact i mean girdle's theorem

5814
03:19:32,238 --> 03:19:36,719
tries to say you know piano arithmetic

5815
03:19:34,238 --> 03:19:39,039
the axioms of arithmetic can you box in

5816
03:19:36,719 --> 03:19:40,398
the integers and say these axioms give

5817
03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:42,160
just the integers and nothing but the

5818
03:19:40,398 --> 03:19:44,000
integers go to theorem showed that

5819
03:19:42,159 --> 03:19:46,159
wasn't the case there's a you know you

5820
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:48,238
can have all these wild weird things

5821
03:19:46,159 --> 03:19:50,079
that are obey the piano axioms but

5822
03:19:48,238 --> 03:19:52,398
aren't integers and there's this kind of

5823
03:19:50,079 --> 03:19:54,079
infinite hierarchy of additional axioms

5824
03:19:52,398 --> 03:19:56,238
you would have to add and it's kind of

5825
03:19:54,079 --> 03:19:58,159
the same thing you you don't get to you

5826
03:19:56,238 --> 03:20:00,318
know if you want to say i want to know

5827
03:19:58,159 --> 03:20:01,760
what happens you're boxing yourself in

5828
03:20:00,318 --> 03:20:03,680
and there's a limit to what can happen

5829
03:20:01,760 --> 03:20:05,439
so to speak so it's a it's a complicated

5830
03:20:03,680 --> 03:20:07,200
trade-off and it's a it's a it's a big

5831
03:20:05,439 --> 03:20:09,200
trade-off for ai so to speak it's kind

5832
03:20:07,200 --> 03:20:11,279
of like do you want to let computation

5833
03:20:09,200 --> 03:20:13,520
actually do what it can do or do you

5834
03:20:11,279 --> 03:20:15,040
want to say no it's very very boxed in

5835
03:20:13,520 --> 03:20:17,439
to the point where we can understand

5836
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:19,120
every step and that's a that's kind of a

5837
03:20:17,439 --> 03:20:21,200
thing that that um that becomes

5838
03:20:19,120 --> 03:20:23,439
difficult to do but that that's some i

5839
03:20:21,200 --> 03:20:24,720
mean in in general

5840
03:20:23,439 --> 03:20:26,559
i would say one of the things that's

5841
03:20:24,719 --> 03:20:28,639
kind of complicated in my

5842
03:20:26,559 --> 03:20:30,799
uh sort of life in the whole sort of

5843
03:20:28,639 --> 03:20:33,119
story of computational language and all

5844
03:20:30,799 --> 03:20:35,679
this technology and science and so on i

5845
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:37,760
mean i i kind of in in the flow of one's

5846
03:20:35,680 --> 03:20:39,840
life it's sort of interesting to see how

5847
03:20:37,760 --> 03:20:41,920
these things play out because i you know

5848
03:20:39,840 --> 03:20:43,680
i've kind of concluded that i'm in the

5849
03:20:41,920 --> 03:20:45,040
business of making kind of artifacts

5850
03:20:43,680 --> 03:20:46,960
from the future

5851
03:20:45,040 --> 03:20:48,720
which means you know there are things

5852
03:20:46,959 --> 03:20:49,679
that i've done i don't know this physics

5853
03:20:48,719 --> 03:20:52,238
project i don't know whether anybody

5854
03:20:49,680 --> 03:20:53,760
would have gotten to it for 50 years you

5855
03:20:52,238 --> 03:20:56,398
know the fact that mathematica is a

5856
03:20:53,760 --> 03:20:58,478
third of a century old and i know that a

5857
03:20:56,398 --> 03:21:00,799
bunch of the core ideas are not well

5858
03:20:58,478 --> 03:21:02,000
absorbed i mean that is people finally

5859
03:21:00,799 --> 03:21:04,559
got this idea that i thought was a

5860
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:05,359
triviality of notebooks that was 25

5861
03:21:04,559 --> 03:21:07,439
years

5862
03:21:05,359 --> 03:21:09,840
and um you know some of these core ideas

5863
03:21:07,439 --> 03:21:12,479
about symbolic computation and so on are

5864
03:21:09,840 --> 03:21:15,200
not not absorbed i mean people people

5865
03:21:12,478 --> 03:21:16,719
use them every day in wolfram language

5866
03:21:15,200 --> 03:21:18,479
and you know do all kinds of cool things

5867
03:21:16,719 --> 03:21:21,119
with them but if you say what is the

5868
03:21:18,478 --> 03:21:22,959
fundamental intellectual point here it's

5869
03:21:21,120 --> 03:21:24,720
it's not well absorbed and it's it's

5870
03:21:22,959 --> 03:21:26,318
something where you kind of realize that

5871
03:21:24,719 --> 03:21:28,398
you're you're sort of building things

5872
03:21:26,318 --> 03:21:30,079
and i i kind of made this this thing

5873
03:21:28,398 --> 03:21:31,199
about you know we're building artifacts

5874
03:21:30,079 --> 03:21:33,920
from the future so to speak and i

5875
03:21:31,200 --> 03:21:35,359
mentioned that it's our uh we have a a

5876
03:21:33,920 --> 03:21:36,719
conference ever it's coming up actually

5877
03:21:35,359 --> 03:21:39,279
in a couple of weeks our annual

5878
03:21:36,719 --> 03:21:41,199
technology conference uh where we talk

5879
03:21:39,279 --> 03:21:43,359
about all the all the things we're doing

5880
03:21:41,200 --> 03:21:45,439
um and uh you know so i was talking

5881
03:21:43,359 --> 03:21:46,720
about it last year about you know we're

5882
03:21:45,439 --> 03:21:47,920
making artifacts from the future and i

5883
03:21:46,719 --> 03:21:50,159
was kind of like

5884
03:21:47,920 --> 03:21:52,079
i had some some version of that that was

5885
03:21:50,159 --> 03:21:53,920
kind of a dark and frustrated thing of

5886
03:21:52,079 --> 03:21:55,359
like you know i'm building things which

5887
03:21:53,920 --> 03:21:57,920
nobody's going to care about until long

5888
03:21:55,359 --> 03:22:00,800
after i'm dead so to speak but um but

5889
03:21:57,920 --> 03:22:02,639
but then i i realized you know people

5890
03:22:00,799 --> 03:22:05,278
were sort of telling me afterwards you

5891
03:22:02,639 --> 03:22:06,639
know that's exactly how you know we're

5892
03:22:05,279 --> 03:22:08,399
using wolfman language in some

5893
03:22:06,639 --> 03:22:10,000
particular setting in you know some

5894
03:22:08,398 --> 03:22:11,760
computational acts field or some

5895
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:14,079
organization or whatever and it's like

5896
03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:16,000
people are saying oh you know what did

5897
03:22:14,079 --> 03:22:17,600
you manage to do you know well we know

5898
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:18,719
that in principle it will be possible to

5899
03:22:17,600 --> 03:22:20,880
do that but we didn't know that was

5900
03:22:18,719 --> 03:22:22,318
possible now and it's kind of like

5901
03:22:20,879 --> 03:22:23,679
that's the that's sort of the business

5902
03:22:22,318 --> 03:22:26,000
we're in and in a sense with some of

5903
03:22:23,680 --> 03:22:27,520
these ideas in science um you know i

5904
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:29,279
feel a little bit the same way that

5905
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:31,520
there are some of these things where you

5906
03:22:29,279 --> 03:22:35,359
know some some things like for example

5907
03:22:31,520 --> 03:22:36,800
this whole idea well so so to to relate

5908
03:22:35,359 --> 03:22:38,800
to another sort of piece of history in

5909
03:22:36,799 --> 03:22:40,238
the future one of you know i mentioned

5910
03:22:38,799 --> 03:22:42,238
we mentioned at the beginning kind of

5911
03:22:40,238 --> 03:22:44,238
complexity as this thing that i was

5912
03:22:42,238 --> 03:22:46,959
interested in back 40 years ago and so

5913
03:22:44,238 --> 03:22:48,879
on where does complexity come from well

5914
03:22:46,959 --> 03:22:51,199
i think we kind of nailed that the

5915
03:22:48,879 --> 03:22:53,438
answer is in the computational universe

5916
03:22:51,200 --> 03:22:55,120
even simple programs make it and that's

5917
03:22:53,439 --> 03:22:57,359
kind of the secret that nature has that

5918
03:22:55,120 --> 03:22:59,840
allows you to make it so so that's kind

5919
03:22:57,359 --> 03:23:02,079
of the um uh that that's that part but

5920
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:04,079
the bigger picture there was this idea

5921
03:23:02,079 --> 03:23:05,600
of this kind of computational paradigm

5922
03:23:04,079 --> 03:23:07,200
the idea that you could go beyond

5923
03:23:05,600 --> 03:23:10,000
mathematical equations which have been

5924
03:23:07,200 --> 03:23:11,279
sort of the primary modeling medium for

5925
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:14,159
300 years

5926
03:23:11,279 --> 03:23:16,319
and so it was like look it is inexorably

5927
03:23:14,159 --> 03:23:18,318
the case that people will use programs

5928
03:23:16,318 --> 03:23:20,398
rather than just equations and you know

5929
03:23:18,318 --> 03:23:22,159
i was saying that in the 1980s and

5930
03:23:20,398 --> 03:23:24,000
people were you know i published my big

5931
03:23:22,159 --> 03:23:27,680
book new kind of science that'll be 20

5932
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:29,359
years ago uh next year so in 2002 and

5933
03:23:27,680 --> 03:23:31,200
people are saying oh no this can't

5934
03:23:29,359 --> 03:23:32,559
possibly be true you know we know for

5935
03:23:31,200 --> 03:23:33,760
300 years we've been doing all this

5936
03:23:32,559 --> 03:23:35,039
stuff right

5937
03:23:33,760 --> 03:23:36,559
to be fair

5938
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:39,359
i now realize on a little bit more

5939
03:23:36,559 --> 03:23:40,959
analysis of what people actually said

5940
03:23:39,359 --> 03:23:41,920
in pretty much every field other than

5941
03:23:40,959 --> 03:23:44,000
physics

5942
03:23:41,920 --> 03:23:46,639
people said oh these are new models

5943
03:23:44,000 --> 03:23:48,159
that's pretty interesting in physics

5944
03:23:46,639 --> 03:23:50,159
people were like we've got our physics

5945
03:23:48,159 --> 03:23:51,680
models we're very happy with them yeah

5946
03:23:50,159 --> 03:23:53,520
in physics there's more resistance

5947
03:23:51,680 --> 03:23:55,520
because of the attachment and the power

5948
03:23:53,520 --> 03:23:57,600
of the equations right the idea that

5949
03:23:55,520 --> 03:23:58,560
programs might be the right way to

5950
03:23:57,600 --> 03:24:00,880
approach

5951
03:23:58,559 --> 03:24:02,959
right uh this field was uh there's some

5952
03:24:00,879 --> 03:24:05,519
resistance and like you're saying

5953
03:24:02,959 --> 03:24:07,358
it takes time for somebody who likes the

5954
03:24:05,520 --> 03:24:08,640
idea of time dilation and all these

5955
03:24:07,359 --> 03:24:10,640
applications i thought you would

5956
03:24:08,639 --> 03:24:12,639
understand this yeah right but but you

5957
03:24:10,639 --> 03:24:15,199
know and computational introduceability

5958
03:24:12,639 --> 03:24:17,439
yes exactly but but i mean it is really

5959
03:24:15,200 --> 03:24:20,000
interesting that just 20 years

5960
03:24:17,439 --> 03:24:22,318
a span of 20 years it's gone from you

5961
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:23,120
know pitchforks and horror

5962
03:24:22,318 --> 03:24:25,600
to

5963
03:24:23,120 --> 03:24:26,399
yeah we get it and um you know it's

5964
03:24:25,600 --> 03:24:29,200
helped

5965
03:24:26,398 --> 03:24:30,959
that we've you know in our current

5966
03:24:29,200 --> 03:24:32,479
effort in fundamental physics we've

5967
03:24:30,959 --> 03:24:33,278
gotten a lot further and we've managed

5968
03:24:32,478 --> 03:24:35,358
to

5969
03:24:33,279 --> 03:24:37,279
put a lot of puzzle pieces together that

5970
03:24:35,359 --> 03:24:38,880
that makes sense but the thing that i've

5971
03:24:37,279 --> 03:24:41,120
been thinking about recently is this

5972
03:24:38,879 --> 03:24:44,000
field of complexity so i i've kind of

5973
03:24:41,120 --> 03:24:46,880
was a sort of a a field builder back in

5974
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:50,000
the 1980s i was kind of like okay you

5975
03:24:46,879 --> 03:24:51,119
know can we uh you know i i'd understood

5976
03:24:50,000 --> 03:24:52,799
this point that there was this sort of

5977
03:24:51,120 --> 03:24:54,399
fundamental phenomenon of complexity and

5978
03:24:52,799 --> 03:24:56,238
showed up in lots of places

5979
03:24:54,398 --> 03:24:59,119
and i was like this is an interesting

5980
03:24:56,238 --> 03:25:00,719
sort of field of science and i was uh

5981
03:24:59,120 --> 03:25:02,800
recently

5982
03:25:00,719 --> 03:25:05,119
was reminded i was at this the very

5983
03:25:02,799 --> 03:25:07,358
first sort of get-together of what

5984
03:25:05,120 --> 03:25:08,640
became the santa fe institute and i was

5985
03:25:07,359 --> 03:25:10,880
like in fact there's even an audio

5986
03:25:08,639 --> 03:25:11,920
recording of me sort of saying people

5987
03:25:10,879 --> 03:25:13,759
have been talking about oh what should

5988
03:25:11,920 --> 03:25:15,920
this play you know outfit do and i was

5989
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:17,120
saying well there is this thing that

5990
03:25:15,920 --> 03:25:19,840
i've been thinking about it's this kind

5991
03:25:17,120 --> 03:25:20,880
of idea of complexity nice and um it's

5992
03:25:19,840 --> 03:25:22,719
kind of like

5993
03:25:20,879 --> 03:25:24,318
and that's that's what that ended up you

5994
03:25:22,719 --> 03:25:25,840
implanted the seat of complexity to

5995
03:25:24,318 --> 03:25:27,760
santa fe that's beautiful it's a

5996
03:25:25,840 --> 03:25:30,559
beautiful vision but but i mean so that

5997
03:25:27,760 --> 03:25:32,159
but what's happened then is this idea of

5998
03:25:30,559 --> 03:25:34,639
complexity and you know ken you know and

5999
03:25:32,159 --> 03:25:36,079
i started the first research center at

6000
03:25:34,639 --> 03:25:38,398
university of illinois for doing that in

6001
03:25:36,079 --> 03:25:40,559
the first journal complex systems and so

6002
03:25:38,398 --> 03:25:43,119
on and uh and it's kind of an

6003
03:25:40,559 --> 03:25:45,039
interesting thing in in my life at least

6004
03:25:43,120 --> 03:25:47,359
that it's kind of like you plant this

6005
03:25:45,040 --> 03:25:49,600
seed you have this idea it's a kind of a

6006
03:25:47,359 --> 03:25:50,800
science idea you have this idea of sort

6007
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:53,200
of focusing on the phenomenon of

6008
03:25:50,799 --> 03:25:55,679
complexity the deeper idea was this

6009
03:25:53,200 --> 03:25:57,279
computational paradigm but the the

6010
03:25:55,680 --> 03:25:59,600
nominal idea is this kind of idea of

6011
03:25:57,279 --> 03:26:02,159
complexity okay then you roll time

6012
03:25:59,600 --> 03:26:04,479
forward 30 years or whatever 35 years

6013
03:26:02,159 --> 03:26:06,238
whatever it is um and you say what

6014
03:26:04,478 --> 03:26:08,000
happened okay well now there are a

6015
03:26:06,238 --> 03:26:10,238
thousand complexity institutes around

6016
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:12,959
the world um i think more or less we've

6017
03:26:10,238 --> 03:26:14,959
been trying to count them um and uh you

6018
03:26:12,959 --> 03:26:17,679
know there are 40 complexity journals i

6019
03:26:14,959 --> 03:26:19,278
think um and so

6020
03:26:17,680 --> 03:26:21,760
it's kind of like what actually happened

6021
03:26:19,279 --> 03:26:24,000
in this field right and and i look at a

6022
03:26:21,760 --> 03:26:26,238
lot of what happened and i'm like

6023
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:28,559
uh you know i have to admit to some eye

6024
03:26:26,238 --> 03:26:30,799
rolling so to speak because it's kind of

6025
03:26:28,559 --> 03:26:32,159
like like what is what what's what

6026
03:26:30,799 --> 03:26:34,000
what's actually going on well what

6027
03:26:32,159 --> 03:26:36,559
people definitely got

6028
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:38,478
was this idea of computational models

6029
03:26:36,559 --> 03:26:39,840
and then they got but they thought one

6030
03:26:38,478 --> 03:26:42,398
of the one of the kind of cognitive

6031
03:26:39,840 --> 03:26:43,920
mistakes i think is they say we've got a

6032
03:26:42,398 --> 03:26:45,599
computational model

6033
03:26:43,920 --> 03:26:47,040
and it

6034
03:26:45,600 --> 03:26:48,399
and we're looking at a system that's

6035
03:26:47,040 --> 03:26:50,239
complex

6036
03:26:48,398 --> 03:26:52,478
and our computational model gives

6037
03:26:50,238 --> 03:26:53,439
complexity by goalie that must mean it's

6038
03:26:52,478 --> 03:26:56,000
right

6039
03:26:53,439 --> 03:26:57,760
and unfortunately because complexity is

6040
03:26:56,000 --> 03:26:59,520
a generic phenomenon and computational

6041
03:26:57,760 --> 03:27:00,880
irreducibility is a

6042
03:26:59,520 --> 03:27:01,920
generic phenomenon that actually tells

6043
03:27:00,879 --> 03:27:03,679
you nothing

6044
03:27:01,920 --> 03:27:05,840
and so then the question is well what

6045
03:27:03,680 --> 03:27:07,040
can you do you know there's a a lot of

6046
03:27:05,840 --> 03:27:08,559
things that have been sort of done under

6047
03:27:07,040 --> 03:27:10,560
this banner of complexity and i think

6048
03:27:08,559 --> 03:27:12,799
it's been very successful in providing

6049
03:27:10,559 --> 03:27:14,478
sort of an interdisciplinary way of

6050
03:27:12,799 --> 03:27:16,318
connecting different fields together

6051
03:27:14,478 --> 03:27:18,559
which is powerful in itself right i mean

6052
03:27:16,318 --> 03:27:20,159
that's a biology in economics and yeah

6053
03:27:18,559 --> 03:27:22,079
it is right and it's a good organizing

6054
03:27:20,159 --> 03:27:23,200
principle but but in the end a lot of

6055
03:27:22,079 --> 03:27:24,799
that is around this kind of

6056
03:27:23,200 --> 03:27:27,200
computational paradigm computational

6057
03:27:24,799 --> 03:27:28,959
modeling that's the raw material that

6058
03:27:27,200 --> 03:27:30,960
powers that kind of uh that kind of

6059
03:27:28,959 --> 03:27:32,879
correspondence i think and the question

6060
03:27:30,959 --> 03:27:34,799
is sort of what is the you know i was

6061
03:27:32,879 --> 03:27:37,119
just thinking recently you know we've

6062
03:27:34,799 --> 03:27:38,000
been i mean the the other we've been

6063
03:27:37,120 --> 03:27:39,680
we've been

6064
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:41,439
for years people told me you should

6065
03:27:39,680 --> 03:27:43,680
start some will from institute that does

6066
03:27:41,439 --> 03:27:46,079
basic science you know all i have is a

6067
03:27:43,680 --> 03:27:47,439
company that that builds software and we

6068
03:27:46,079 --> 03:27:49,279
you know we have a little piece that

6069
03:27:47,439 --> 03:27:50,880
does basic science as kind of a hobby

6070
03:27:49,279 --> 03:27:53,120
people are saying you should start this

6071
03:27:50,879 --> 03:27:54,398
wolfram institute thing and and i've

6072
03:27:53,120 --> 03:27:55,920
been you know because i've known about

6073
03:27:54,398 --> 03:27:57,920
lots of institutes and i've seen kind of

6074
03:27:55,920 --> 03:27:59,120
that flow of money and and kind of you

6075
03:27:57,920 --> 03:28:00,799
know what happens in different

6076
03:27:59,120 --> 03:28:03,279
situations and so on so i've been kind

6077
03:28:00,799 --> 03:28:04,959
of reluctant but uh but i've i've i have

6078
03:28:03,279 --> 03:28:07,120
realized that you know what we've done

6079
03:28:04,959 --> 03:28:09,119
with our company over the last 35 years

6080
03:28:07,120 --> 03:28:10,479
you know we built a very good machine

6081
03:28:09,120 --> 03:28:12,239
for doing r d

6082
03:28:10,478 --> 03:28:14,719
and you know innovating and creating

6083
03:28:12,238 --> 03:28:16,719
things and i just applied that machine

6084
03:28:14,719 --> 03:28:18,238
to the physics project that's how we did

6085
03:28:16,719 --> 03:28:21,519
the physics project in a fairly short

6086
03:28:18,238 --> 03:28:23,199
amount of time with a you know efficient

6087
03:28:21,520 --> 03:28:26,159
machine with you know various people

6088
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:28,560
involved and so on um and so you know it

6089
03:28:26,159 --> 03:28:30,318
it works for basic science and it's like

6090
03:28:28,559 --> 03:28:32,959
we can do more of this

6091
03:28:30,318 --> 03:28:35,119
and so biology and chemistry so it's

6092
03:28:32,959 --> 03:28:36,398
it's become an institute yes well it

6093
03:28:35,120 --> 03:28:38,079
needs to become an institution an

6094
03:28:36,398 --> 03:28:40,079
official institute right right but the

6095
03:28:38,079 --> 03:28:42,719
the thing that so i was thinking about

6096
03:28:40,079 --> 03:28:44,478
okay so what do we do with complexity

6097
03:28:42,719 --> 03:28:46,238
you know what what there are all these

6098
03:28:44,478 --> 03:28:48,079
people who've you know what what should

6099
03:28:46,238 --> 03:28:50,079
happen to that field yeah and what i

6100
03:28:48,079 --> 03:28:52,799
realized is there's kind of this area of

6101
03:28:50,079 --> 03:28:54,478
foundations of complexity that's about

6102
03:28:52,799 --> 03:28:56,478
these questions about simple programs

6103
03:28:54,478 --> 03:28:58,000
what they do that's far away from a

6104
03:28:56,478 --> 03:28:59,679
bunch of the detailed applications the

6105
03:28:58,000 --> 03:29:02,639
people well it's not far away it's it's

6106
03:28:59,680 --> 03:29:04,639
the it's the under you know the bedrock

6107
03:29:02,639 --> 03:29:06,879
underneath those applications so i

6108
03:29:04,639 --> 03:29:09,840
realized recently this is my a recent

6109
03:29:06,879 --> 03:29:13,199
kind of little uh innovation of a sort

6110
03:29:09,840 --> 03:29:15,680
um a post that i'll do very soon

6111
03:29:13,200 --> 03:29:18,239
um about um

6112
03:29:15,680 --> 03:29:20,479
uh kind of you know the foundations of

6113
03:29:18,238 --> 03:29:22,959
complexity what really are they i think

6114
03:29:20,478 --> 03:29:25,438
they're really two ideas two conceptual

6115
03:29:22,959 --> 03:29:27,278
ideas that i hadn't really enunciated i

6116
03:29:25,439 --> 03:29:30,159
think before one is what i call

6117
03:29:27,279 --> 03:29:32,238
meta-modeling the other is ruleology

6118
03:29:30,159 --> 03:29:34,159
so what is meta modeling so metamodeling

6119
03:29:32,238 --> 03:29:36,079
is you've got this complicated model and

6120
03:29:34,159 --> 03:29:37,680
it's a model of you know hedgehogs

6121
03:29:36,079 --> 03:29:38,559
interacting with this interacting with

6122
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:39,920
that

6123
03:29:38,559 --> 03:29:42,079
and the question is what's really

6124
03:29:39,920 --> 03:29:44,559
underneath that what is it you know is

6125
03:29:42,079 --> 03:29:46,318
it a turing machine is it a cellular

6126
03:29:44,559 --> 03:29:49,039
automaton you know what is the

6127
03:29:46,318 --> 03:29:51,199
underlying stuff underneath that model

6128
03:29:49,040 --> 03:29:54,160
and so there's this kind of meta science

6129
03:29:51,200 --> 03:29:56,479
question of given these models what is

6130
03:29:54,159 --> 03:29:58,318
the core model and i realized i mean to

6131
03:29:56,478 --> 03:29:59,760
me that's sort of an obvious question

6132
03:29:58,318 --> 03:30:01,600
but then i realized i've been doing

6133
03:29:59,760 --> 03:30:03,840
language design for 40 years and

6134
03:30:01,600 --> 03:30:05,600
language design is exactly that question

6135
03:30:03,840 --> 03:30:07,840
you know underneath all of this detailed

6136
03:30:05,600 --> 03:30:09,760
stuff people do what are the underlying

6137
03:30:07,840 --> 03:30:11,920
primitives and that's a question people

6138
03:30:09,760 --> 03:30:13,359
haven't tended to ask about models they

6139
03:30:11,920 --> 03:30:14,799
say well we've got this nice model for

6140
03:30:13,359 --> 03:30:17,200
this and that and the other what's

6141
03:30:14,799 --> 03:30:18,639
really underneath it and what you know

6142
03:30:17,200 --> 03:30:20,880
because once you have the thing that's

6143
03:30:18,639 --> 03:30:23,278
underneath it well for example this

6144
03:30:20,879 --> 03:30:25,519
multi-computation idea is an ultimate

6145
03:30:23,279 --> 03:30:27,920
meta modeling idea because it's saying

6146
03:30:25,520 --> 03:30:30,238
underneath all these fields is one kind

6147
03:30:27,920 --> 03:30:31,680
of paradigmatic structure and you know

6148
03:30:30,238 --> 03:30:34,799
you can you can imagine the same kind of

6149
03:30:31,680 --> 03:30:37,760
thing much more sort of uh

6150
03:30:34,799 --> 03:30:39,358
much sort of shallower levels in in um

6151
03:30:37,760 --> 03:30:41,040
in different kinds of modeling so this

6152
03:30:39,359 --> 03:30:44,079
the first activity is this kind of meta

6153
03:30:41,040 --> 03:30:46,319
modeling the the kind of the the models

6154
03:30:44,079 --> 03:30:48,398
about models so to speak you know what

6155
03:30:46,318 --> 03:30:50,879
is the what's what's you know drilling

6156
03:30:48,398 --> 03:30:52,719
down into models that's one thing the

6157
03:30:50,879 --> 03:30:54,799
other thing is this this thing that i

6158
03:30:52,719 --> 03:30:56,398
think we're going to call ruleology

6159
03:30:54,799 --> 03:30:57,679
which is kind of the

6160
03:30:56,398 --> 03:30:59,039
okay you've got these simple rules

6161
03:30:57,680 --> 03:31:00,639
you've got cellular automata you've got

6162
03:30:59,040 --> 03:31:02,319
turing machines you've got substitution

6163
03:31:00,639 --> 03:31:03,680
systems you've got registered machines

6164
03:31:02,318 --> 03:31:06,559
got all these different things what do

6165
03:31:03,680 --> 03:31:08,800
they actually do in the wild and this is

6166
03:31:06,559 --> 03:31:10,478
an area that i've spent a lot of time

6167
03:31:08,799 --> 03:31:12,159
you know working on it's a lot of stuff

6168
03:31:10,478 --> 03:31:14,478
in my new kind of science book is about

6169
03:31:12,159 --> 03:31:16,478
this um you know this new book i wrote

6170
03:31:14,478 --> 03:31:17,519
about combinators is is full of stuff

6171
03:31:16,478 --> 03:31:19,840
like this

6172
03:31:17,520 --> 03:31:21,279
and and this journal complex systems has

6173
03:31:19,840 --> 03:31:23,840
lots of papers about these kinds of

6174
03:31:21,279 --> 03:31:25,200
things but but there isn't really a home

6175
03:31:23,840 --> 03:31:26,318
for people who do

6176
03:31:25,200 --> 03:31:29,600
or whatever

6177
03:31:26,318 --> 03:31:30,398
as you call the basic science of rules

6178
03:31:29,600 --> 03:31:32,880
yes

6179
03:31:30,398 --> 03:31:35,278
yes right so it's it's like you've got

6180
03:31:32,879 --> 03:31:36,639
some what is it is it mathematics no it

6181
03:31:35,279 --> 03:31:38,079
isn't really like mathematics in fact

6182
03:31:36,639 --> 03:31:40,159
from my now understanding of meta

6183
03:31:38,079 --> 03:31:42,318
mathematics i understand that it's the

6184
03:31:40,159 --> 03:31:44,000
molecular dynamics level it's not the

6185
03:31:42,318 --> 03:31:45,680
level that mathematicians have

6186
03:31:44,000 --> 03:31:47,600
traditionally cared about it's not

6187
03:31:45,680 --> 03:31:48,960
computer science because computer

6188
03:31:47,600 --> 03:31:51,040
science is about writing programs that

6189
03:31:48,959 --> 03:31:53,119
do things you know that were for a

6190
03:31:51,040 --> 03:31:55,040
purpose not programs in the wild so to

6191
03:31:53,120 --> 03:31:56,560
speak it's not physics it doesn't have

6192
03:31:55,040 --> 03:31:58,160
anything to do with you know maybe

6193
03:31:56,559 --> 03:32:00,719
underneath some physics but it's not

6194
03:31:58,159 --> 03:32:02,959
physics as such so it just hasn't had a

6195
03:32:00,719 --> 03:32:05,199
home and if you look at you know but

6196
03:32:02,959 --> 03:32:07,679
what's great about it is

6197
03:32:05,200 --> 03:32:09,120
it's a surviving field so to speak it's

6198
03:32:07,680 --> 03:32:11,920
something where you know one of the

6199
03:32:09,120 --> 03:32:13,920
things i i find sort of inspiring about

6200
03:32:11,920 --> 03:32:15,760
mathematics for example is you look at

6201
03:32:13,920 --> 03:32:18,318
mathematics that was done you know in

6202
03:32:15,760 --> 03:32:20,719
ancient greece ancient you know babylon

6203
03:32:18,318 --> 03:32:22,398
egypt and so on it's still here today

6204
03:32:20,719 --> 03:32:24,879
you know you find an icosahedron that

6205
03:32:22,398 --> 03:32:27,119
somebody made in ancient egypt you look

6206
03:32:24,879 --> 03:32:29,199
at it oh that's a very modern thing it's

6207
03:32:27,120 --> 03:32:31,760
an icosahedron you know it's it's a

6208
03:32:29,200 --> 03:32:33,760
timeless kind of kind of activity and

6209
03:32:31,760 --> 03:32:36,159
this idea of studying simple rules and

6210
03:32:33,760 --> 03:32:37,680
what they do it's a timeless activity

6211
03:32:36,159 --> 03:32:40,000
and i can see that over the last 40

6212
03:32:37,680 --> 03:32:41,920
years or so as you know

6213
03:32:40,000 --> 03:32:44,318
even with cellular automata it's kind of

6214
03:32:41,920 --> 03:32:45,439
like you know you can sort of catalogue

6215
03:32:44,318 --> 03:32:47,519
what what are the different cellular

6216
03:32:45,439 --> 03:32:49,520
autonomics are used for and you know

6217
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:51,359
like the the simplest rules like like

6218
03:32:49,520 --> 03:32:54,560
one you might even know this one rule

6219
03:32:51,359 --> 03:32:56,720
184 it's um rule 184 is a minimal model

6220
03:32:54,559 --> 03:32:58,318
for road traffic flow and you know it's

6221
03:32:56,719 --> 03:33:00,079
also a minimal model for various other

6222
03:32:58,318 --> 03:33:03,119
things but it's kind of fun that you can

6223
03:33:00,079 --> 03:33:05,279
literally say you know rule 90 is a

6224
03:33:03,120 --> 03:33:07,840
minimal model for this and this and this

6225
03:33:05,279 --> 03:33:09,600
rule 4 is a minimal model for this and

6226
03:33:07,840 --> 03:33:11,760
it's kind of remarkable that you can

6227
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:14,318
just by in this raw level of this kind

6228
03:33:11,760 --> 03:33:16,478
of study of rules they then branch

6229
03:33:14,318 --> 03:33:17,920
they're the raw material that you can

6230
03:33:16,478 --> 03:33:20,879
use to make models of different things

6231
03:33:17,920 --> 03:33:22,719
so it's a it's a very pure basic science

6232
03:33:20,879 --> 03:33:24,398
but it's one that you know people have

6233
03:33:22,719 --> 03:33:26,559
explored it but they've been kind of a

6234
03:33:24,398 --> 03:33:27,840
little bit in the wilderness and i think

6235
03:33:26,559 --> 03:33:31,119
you know one of the things that i would

6236
03:33:27,840 --> 03:33:32,799
like to do finally is is uh you know i

6237
03:33:31,120 --> 03:33:35,840
always thought that sort of this notion

6238
03:33:32,799 --> 03:33:38,000
of pure and chaos pure and nks being the

6239
03:33:35,840 --> 03:33:40,079
acronym for my book new kind of science

6240
03:33:38,000 --> 03:33:41,439
um was um

6241
03:33:40,079 --> 03:33:43,120
was something that people should be

6242
03:33:41,439 --> 03:33:44,720
doing and you know we tried to figure

6243
03:33:43,120 --> 03:33:46,560
out what's the right institutional

6244
03:33:44,719 --> 03:33:48,559
structure to do this stuff you know we

6245
03:33:46,559 --> 03:33:50,159
we dealt with a bunch of universities oh

6246
03:33:48,559 --> 03:33:51,519
you know can we do this here well what

6247
03:33:50,159 --> 03:33:53,520
department would it be in it well it

6248
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:55,520
isn't in a department it's it's its own

6249
03:33:53,520 --> 03:33:56,960
new kind of thing that's why that's why

6250
03:33:55,520 --> 03:33:59,840
the book was called the new kind of

6251
03:33:56,959 --> 03:34:01,599
science um it's kind of the the because

6252
03:33:59,840 --> 03:34:03,920
that's an increasingly good description

6253
03:34:01,600 --> 03:34:05,279
of what it is so to speak we're actually

6254
03:34:03,920 --> 03:34:08,000
we were thinking about kind of the

6255
03:34:05,279 --> 03:34:09,920
ruleological society because we're

6256
03:34:08,000 --> 03:34:11,359
realizing that it's kind of

6257
03:34:09,920 --> 03:34:13,200
it's it's some you know there's a

6258
03:34:11,359 --> 03:34:14,318
there's it's very it's very interesting

6259
03:34:13,200 --> 03:34:15,920
i mean i've never really done something

6260
03:34:14,318 --> 03:34:18,159
like this before because there's this

6261
03:34:15,920 --> 03:34:20,639
whole group of researchers who are

6262
03:34:18,159 --> 03:34:22,318
who've been doing things that are really

6263
03:34:20,639 --> 03:34:25,039
in some cases very elegant very

6264
03:34:22,318 --> 03:34:26,639
surviving very solid you know here's

6265
03:34:25,040 --> 03:34:29,279
this thing that happens in this very

6266
03:34:26,639 --> 03:34:31,599
abstract system but it's like

6267
03:34:29,279 --> 03:34:34,079
it's like what is that part of you know

6268
03:34:31,600 --> 03:34:35,760
it's it doesn't have a a home and i

6269
03:34:34,079 --> 03:34:37,840
think that's something i you know i kind

6270
03:34:35,760 --> 03:34:39,359
of fault myself for not having been more

6271
03:34:37,840 --> 03:34:43,359
you know when complexity was developing

6272
03:34:39,359 --> 03:34:46,238
in the 80s i didn't understand the the

6273
03:34:43,359 --> 03:34:47,600
the danger of applications that is it's

6274
03:34:46,238 --> 03:34:48,799
really cool that you can apply this to

6275
03:34:47,600 --> 03:34:50,720
economics and you can apply it to

6276
03:34:48,799 --> 03:34:52,879
evolutionary biology and this and that

6277
03:34:50,719 --> 03:34:54,478
and the other but what happens with

6278
03:34:52,879 --> 03:34:56,879
applications is everything gets sucked

6279
03:34:54,478 --> 03:34:58,879
into the applications and the pure stuff

6280
03:34:56,879 --> 03:35:00,879
it's like the pure mathematics there

6281
03:34:58,879 --> 03:35:02,238
isn't any pure mathematics so to speak

6282
03:35:00,879 --> 03:35:05,119
it's all just applications of

6283
03:35:02,238 --> 03:35:07,760
mathematics and i i failed to kind of

6284
03:35:05,120 --> 03:35:10,640
make sure that this kind of pure area

6285
03:35:07,760 --> 03:35:12,719
was was kind of um maintained and and

6286
03:35:10,639 --> 03:35:14,719
and developed and i think now you know

6287
03:35:12,719 --> 03:35:16,159
one of the things i i want to try to do

6288
03:35:14,719 --> 03:35:18,559
and and you know it's a funny thing

6289
03:35:16,159 --> 03:35:20,559
because i'm used to look i've been a a

6290
03:35:18,559 --> 03:35:22,478
tech ceo for more than half my life now

6291
03:35:20,559 --> 03:35:25,278
so you know this is what i know how to

6292
03:35:22,478 --> 03:35:27,679
do and um you know i can i can make

6293
03:35:25,279 --> 03:35:29,200
stuff happen and get projects to happen

6294
03:35:27,680 --> 03:35:31,840
even as it turns out basic science

6295
03:35:29,200 --> 03:35:34,479
projects in that kind of setting and and

6296
03:35:31,840 --> 03:35:35,600
how that translates into kind of

6297
03:35:34,478 --> 03:35:36,959
you know there are a lot of people

6298
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:38,318
working on for example our physics

6299
03:35:36,959 --> 03:35:39,759
project sort of distributed through the

6300
03:35:38,318 --> 03:35:41,680
academic world and that's working just

6301
03:35:39,760 --> 03:35:44,559
great but the question is you know can

6302
03:35:41,680 --> 03:35:46,079
we have a sort of accelerator mechanism

6303
03:35:44,559 --> 03:35:49,519
that makes use of kind of what we've

6304
03:35:46,079 --> 03:35:51,039
learned in in sort of r d innovation and

6305
03:35:49,520 --> 03:35:52,399
you know but on the other hand it's a

6306
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:55,279
funny thing because

6307
03:35:52,398 --> 03:35:57,199
you know in a company in the end the

6308
03:35:55,279 --> 03:35:58,800
thing is you know it's a company it

6309
03:35:57,200 --> 03:36:01,200
makes products that sell things sells

6310
03:35:58,799 --> 03:36:02,639
things to people um in you know when

6311
03:36:01,200 --> 03:36:04,720
you're doing basic research one of the

6312
03:36:02,639 --> 03:36:07,760
challenges is there isn't that same kind

6313
03:36:04,719 --> 03:36:09,920
of of sort of mechanism and so it's it's

6314
03:36:07,760 --> 03:36:12,960
it's you know how do you drive the thing

6315
03:36:09,920 --> 03:36:14,639
in a in a kind of a led kind of way so

6316
03:36:12,959 --> 03:36:16,719
that it really can can make forward

6317
03:36:14,639 --> 03:36:18,879
progress rather than you know what can

6318
03:36:16,719 --> 03:36:20,398
often happen in you know in in academic

6319
03:36:18,879 --> 03:36:22,079
settings where it's like well there are

6320
03:36:20,398 --> 03:36:24,238
all these flowers blooming but it's not

6321
03:36:22,079 --> 03:36:26,238
clear that they're you know that it's

6322
03:36:24,238 --> 03:36:28,398
that yeah they have a central mission

6323
03:36:26,238 --> 03:36:30,079
and a drive just like you do with the

6324
03:36:28,398 --> 03:36:32,719
company that's delivering a big

6325
03:36:30,079 --> 03:36:34,238
overarching product and that's that's uh

6326
03:36:32,719 --> 03:36:36,639
but the the challenges you know when you

6327
03:36:34,238 --> 03:36:39,199
have a the the the economics of the

6328
03:36:36,639 --> 03:36:40,799
world are such that you know when you're

6329
03:36:39,200 --> 03:36:42,640
delivering a product and people say well

6330
03:36:40,799 --> 03:36:44,159
that's useful we'll buy it

6331
03:36:42,639 --> 03:36:46,559
and then that kind of feeds back and

6332
03:36:44,159 --> 03:36:48,398
okay then you can then you can pay the

6333
03:36:46,559 --> 03:36:51,199
people who build it to eat you know so

6334
03:36:48,398 --> 03:36:53,840
they can eat and so on and with basic

6335
03:36:51,200 --> 03:36:56,079
science the the payoff

6336
03:36:53,840 --> 03:36:57,439
is very much less visible and and you

6337
03:36:56,079 --> 03:36:59,760
know with this physics project as i say

6338
03:36:57,439 --> 03:37:00,720
the big surprise has been that i mean

6339
03:36:59,760 --> 03:37:02,318
you know

6340
03:37:00,719 --> 03:37:05,438
for example well the big surprise with

6341
03:37:02,318 --> 03:37:07,278
the physics project is that it's looks

6342
03:37:05,439 --> 03:37:09,359
like it has near-term applications and i

6343
03:37:07,279 --> 03:37:10,319
was like i'm guessing this is 200 years

6344
03:37:09,359 --> 03:37:12,479
away

6345
03:37:10,318 --> 03:37:14,398
it's um i was kind of using the analogy

6346
03:37:12,478 --> 03:37:16,799
of of you know newton

6347
03:37:14,398 --> 03:37:18,959
uh starting a satellite launch company

6348
03:37:16,799 --> 03:37:21,358
which would have been kind of wrong time

6349
03:37:18,959 --> 03:37:23,199
um and uh you know but but it turns out

6350
03:37:21,359 --> 03:37:25,200
that's not the case but but we can't

6351
03:37:23,200 --> 03:37:27,439
guarantee that and if you say we're

6352
03:37:25,200 --> 03:37:29,120
signing up to do basic research basic

6353
03:37:27,439 --> 03:37:32,159
radiology let's say

6354
03:37:29,120 --> 03:37:33,600
and you know and we can't we don't know

6355
03:37:32,159 --> 03:37:35,119
the horizon you know it's it's an

6356
03:37:33,600 --> 03:37:37,600
unknown horizon it's kind of like an

6357
03:37:35,120 --> 03:37:39,439
undecidable kind of proposition of when

6358
03:37:37,600 --> 03:37:40,800
is this proof going to end so to speak

6359
03:37:39,439 --> 03:37:41,520
when is it going to be something that

6360
03:37:40,799 --> 03:37:43,840
that

6361
03:37:41,520 --> 03:37:47,040
that gets applied

6362
03:37:43,840 --> 03:37:49,439
i i hope this is this becomes a vibrant

6363
03:37:47,040 --> 03:37:52,560
new field of radiology i love it like i

6364
03:37:49,439 --> 03:37:54,800
told you many many times it's one of

6365
03:37:52,559 --> 03:37:57,278
the most amazing ideas that has been

6366
03:37:54,799 --> 03:37:59,358
brought to this world so i hope you

6367
03:37:57,279 --> 03:38:01,680
get a bunch of people to explore this

6368
03:37:59,359 --> 03:38:01,680
world

6369
03:38:01,760 --> 03:38:06,079
thank you once again for spending your

6370
03:38:03,680 --> 03:38:08,398
really valuable time with me today fun

6371
03:38:06,079 --> 03:38:09,520
stuff thank you

6372
03:38:08,398 --> 03:38:11,358
thanks for listening to this

6373
03:38:09,520 --> 03:38:13,120
conversation with stephen wolfram to

6374
03:38:11,359 --> 03:38:15,279
support this podcast please check out

6375
03:38:13,120 --> 03:38:17,439
our sponsors in the description

6376
03:38:15,279 --> 03:38:19,439
and now let me leave you with some words

6377
03:38:17,439 --> 03:38:22,800
from richard feynman

6378
03:38:19,439 --> 03:38:24,318
nature uses only the longest threads to

6379
03:38:22,799 --> 03:38:27,039
weave her patterns

6380
03:38:24,318 --> 03:38:29,278
so each small piece of our fabric

6381
03:38:27,040 --> 03:38:31,120
reveals the organization of the entire

6382
03:38:29,279 --> 03:38:32,640
tapestry

6383
03:38:31,120 --> 03:38:36,439
thank you for listening and hope to see

6384
03:38:32,639 --> 03:38:36,439
you next time

6385
03:38:42,318 --> 03:38:44,398
